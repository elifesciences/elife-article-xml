<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cardiac lymphatics play an important role in myocardial edema and inflammation. This study integrated single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points post-myocardial infarction (MI), and identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of lymphatic endothelial cells(LECs) and localized them in space. Interestingly, LECs subgroups was found to be localized in different zones of infarcted heart related to different functions. Additionally, LEC capillary III(LEC ca III) may be involved in the direct regulation of myocardial injuries in infarcted zone from the perspective of metabolic stress, while LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory responses of the border zone in the early stage of MI. LEC ca I, as well as LEC collection mainly participate in the regulation of myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI. Cell trajectory and Cell-Chat analyses further identified that LECs may regulate myocardial edema through Aqp1, and might affect the infiltration of macrophages through the galectin9-CD44 pathway. Collectively, our study revealed the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution of LECs in different regions of the infarcted heart, in detail; these LECs formed different functional subgroups, that might exhibit different bioeffects in myocardial tissue post-MI.</p>

<p>The lymphatic vasculature, which accompanies the blood vasculature in most organs, is indispensable for maintaining of tissue fluid homeostasis, immune surveillance and lipid uptake and transport(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alitalo, Tammela, &amp; Petrova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang, Elvington, &amp; Randolph, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Petrova &amp; Koh, 2020</xref>). In contrast to circulatory blood vessels, lymphatic vessels are structurally blind-ended segments, that are designed to absorb interstitial fluid and immune cells. These lymphatic capillaries converge onto deeper lymphatic structures called collecting vessels, which are equipped with valves and a muscular wall that promote unidirectional transport and drain extravascular fluid, macromolecules and immune cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alitalo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Oliver, Kipnis, Randolph, &amp; Harvey, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The cardiac lymphatic vasculature was first described in the 17<sup>th</sup> century(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tammela &amp; Alitalo, 2010</xref>). To date, studies have demonstrated the role of the lymphatic system only in embryonic heart development and cardiac health in adults(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brakenhielm &amp; Alitalo, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heron, Ratajska, &amp; Brakenhielm, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Klotz et al., 2015</xref>). Cardiac lymphatics can take up inter-tissue fluid and transport immune cells through highly branched, blunt, open-ended lymphatic capillaries, to the lymph nodes near the thoracic ducts and, finally, into the superior vena cava(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huang, Lavine, &amp; Randolph, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most important cardiovascular diseases. Myocardial edema and inflammation are the two dominant pathological processes in the early stages of MI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Anzai, Ko, &amp; Fukuda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bulluck, Dharmakumar, Arai, Berry, &amp; Hausenloy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen, Zhao, &amp; Yan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Nahrendorf, Pittet, &amp; Swirski, 2010</xref>). Many preclinical studies have revealed severe remodeling of lymphatic system during MI in animal models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shimizu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Vuorio et al., 2018</xref>). The stimulation of cardiac lymphangiogenesis by adrenomedullin or vascular endothelial growth factor C can ameliorate myocardial edema following MI(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Trincot et al., 2019</xref>). However, owing to the extremely low number of lymphatic vessels in the myocardial tissue, there is still a lack of comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying myocardial injury and prognostic progression after MI.</p>
<p>With the rapid development of single-cell transcriptome sequencing and spatial single-cell transcriptome sequencing technologies, researchers can explore cell subpopulations, heterogeneity, function, metabolism, and cell-cell interactions at the single-cell level(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Grün &amp; van Oudenaarden, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Vandereyken, Sifrim, Thienpont, &amp; Voet, 2023</xref>). In order to further elucidate the effects and regulatory mechanisms of the lymphatic vessels in the repair process of myocardial injury following MI. This study, integrated single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points after MI from publicly available data (E-MTAB-7895, GSE214611) in the ArrayExpress and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases. By reanalyzing these data, this study revealed dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity and spatial localization differences in regenerated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in heart tissue after MI. Different subpopulations of LECs appear at different times and locations during the process of myocardial post-MI, and perform different biological functions. Furthermore, we validated two key regulatory molecules that play important regulatory roles in myocardial edema and lymphatic immune regulation after MI.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>Dynamic Changes of Cardiac Lymphatics in Cardiac Tissue post-MI</title>
<p>To explore the physiological and pathological functions of cardiac lymphatic vessels after myocardial infarction (MI), we established an MI mouse model by ligating the anterior descending branch of the coronary artery (n=32) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Heart function was evaluated by micro-ultrasound, and mouse hearts were harvested at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after MI (n=5-7/ per time-point) (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was performed using antibodies against Prospero homeobox 1 (PROX1, nuclear protein), the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan recetor-1 (LYVE1, membrane protein) and podoplanin(PDPN, membrane protein), all of which specifically labeled the LECs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure1A</xref>, <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure1-Figure Suppl-1C-E</xref>). Since the membrane protein LYVE1 and PDPN can present lymphatic vessel morphology more clearly than PROX1. LYVE1 and PDPN were used for lymphatic vessel co-staining at 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after MI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). There were significant differences in the morphology and distribution of the newly formed lymphatic vessels in different regions of the heart tissue post-MI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Three days post-MI, lymphatic vessels in the infarcted zone (IZ) and border zone (BZ) were significantly lost. However, on the 7th day, a large number of newly formed and dilated continuous lymphatic vessels appeared in the BZ. In the IZ, only a small number of lymphatic capillaries with discontinuous walls were observed. On the 14th and 28th days following the infarction, the number of lymphatic capillaries in the IZ significantly increased. Continuous large lymphatic collecting vessels were observed in the epicardium of the IZ, and the number of large lymphatic collecting vessels in the BZ did not decrease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures. 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). In addition, there were no significant changes in the distribution and morphology of cardiac lymphatic vessels in the unaffected normal myocardial area (remote zone, RZ) at any time (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure1-figure Supplement 1E</xref>). These results suggest that lymphatic regeneration may be involved in the regulation of myocardial damage following MI.</p>

<label>2.2</label><title>Identification of Four Transcriptionally Distinct Subtypes of Regenerated Lymphatic Endothelial Cells in Myocardial Tissue post-MI via Single-Cell Sequence</title>
<p>To further clarify why the regenerated cardiac LECs mapped to a particular distribution during cardiac repair post-MI, a set of published single-cell sequencing data (E-MTAB-7895) was selected from the ArrayExpress database of mouse MI models at different time points (days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28). Using specific marker proteins as cell-clustering markers, the cluster dimensionality reduction analysis of the 10,519 single cells (excluding myocardial cells) in this experimental dataset was recalculated. First, we classified these cells into five categories based on specific genes: endothelial cells (Cdh5, Pecam1, and Vwf), fibroblasts (Dcn, Col1a1, and Gsn), immune cells (Ptprc, and C1qa), myocardial fibroblasts (Cthrc1, and postn), smooth muscle cells and pericytes (Myh11, Tagln, Acta2, Rgs5, Abcc9, and Kcnj8) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). Subsequently, the endothelial cells (Cdh5, Pecam1, and Vwf) were further clustered into five sub-clusters, including angiogenic endothelial cells (Col4a2, Apln, Sparcl1, and Aplnr), arterial endothelial cells (Fbln5, Hey1, Sema3g, and Efnb2), capillary endothelial cells (Kdr, Rgcc, Aqp1, and Endou), venous endothelial cells (Mgp, Cfh, Bgn, Vwf, and Plvap), and LECs (Lyve1, Cldn5, and Prox1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). To further characterize LECs, we examined the expression of Foxp2, Ackr4, Cavolin-1(Cav1), Nt5e, Pdpn and Lyve1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Takeda et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this report, the collecting LEC marker Cav1 was expressed in the clusters LEC collecting (LEC co), LEC capillary I (LEC ca I), and LEC capillary III (LEC ca III) clusters, whereas Foxp2 and Ackr4 were expressed almost exclusively in LEC co clusters. Capillary markers Pdpn and Lyve1 were expressed in four subsets, but showed the highest expression in LEC ca III, and the lowest in LEC co (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures. 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Together, these results indicate significant transcriptional heterogeneity in the regenerated cardiac LECs post-MI.</p>

<label>2.3</label><title>Relationship Between the Spatial Localization and Function of LEC Subpopulations post-MI</title>
<p>To elucidate the biological functions of LECs subgroups in myocardial tissue post-MI, we first observed dynamic changes in the number and proportion of LECs subsets after MI. Consistent with the results of IF staining, the number of LECs was significantly reduced in the early phases of MI (D1 and D3). From D7, the number of cells gradually increased and returned to normal levels within 14 days. The regeneration potential of the four LECs subsets were significantly different. Normal myocardial tissues are mainly composed of LEC ca I, LEC ca II, and LEC co, with a small amount of LEC ca III. In the early stages of myocardial infarction (D1 and D3), although the number of LECs sharply decreased, the proportion of LEC ca III significantly increased. By D7, there was a significant decrease in LEC ca III with a gradual increase in LEC ca II and LEC co. From D14, the proportion of LEC ca I region significantly increased. Twenty-eight days post-MI, the number and proportion of the three capillary LECs had returned to normal, except for a small proportion of LEC co in the group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To validate whether these LEC subpopulations are involved in the repair of myocardial injury following MI, we retrieved published single-cell nuclear transcriptomic and spatial transcriptomic data (GSE214611) of mouse MI models from the GEO database. In early MI (D3), LEC ca I, ca III and LEC co were mainly distributed in the IZ and BZ, with LEC ca III being significantly higher in the IZ. In contrast, LEC ca II was mainly distributed in the BZ and RZ, and was significantly reduced in the IZ. As the morphology of the infarcted area gradually became clear, on D7, LEC ca I continued to increase in the IZ region, LEC ca III was still mainly distributed in the IZ, LEC co migrated from the BZ to the IZ, and LEC ca II showed no significant spatial localization or expression differences, but were still highly expressed in the BZ and RZ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure3-figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>KEGG functional enrichment analysis was conducted on the genes of the four LEC subtypes. LEC ca III, the LEC subgroup with the highest proportion expressed in the IZ during the early stage of MI, was found to primarily participate in energy metabolism such as oxidative phosphorylation, thermogenesis, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, antigen presentation, cell morphology and migration related functions. Although ca I and ca III have similar spatial localization after MI, their expression levels were lower than that of LEC ca III on D3, but significantly increased in the IZ on D7. LEC ca I was found primarily participate in the activation of infection, apoptosis, mitophagy, and water absorption related regulation of vasopressin. LEC co showed partial similarity in biological functions with ca I, and were mainly involved in fluid regulation and flow, such as renin, saliva secretion, and inflammation. LECs are inconsistently is involved in the regulation of RNA transport, degradation, and ferroptosis. LEC ca II, which significantly reduced in IZ, while sustaining high expression in the BZ and RZ, is mainly related to NFκB is associated with the regulation of chemokine signaling pathways and cytokine interactions between ligands (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, based on the pathological changes in myocardial tissue, as well as the regeneration ratio, spatial localization, and functional differences of LEC subgroups after MI, we deduced that LEC ca III may be involved in the direct regulation of myocardial injury in the IZ from the perspective of metabolic stress, whereas LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory response in the BZ in the very early stages of MI. LEC ca I and LEC co primarily participate in the regulation of myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI.</p>

<label>2.4</label><title>Single-Cell Trajectories of LECs Subsets post-MI</title>
<p>How do LEC subgroups regenerate and evolve after MI? To answer this question, we used cell trajectory analysis to characterize LECs development and determine lineage differentiation. From the pseudo-time plot and phenotype-based trajectory plot, we learn that, in the early stage post-MI, the main LEC subgroup is still LEC ca II and III, which is consistent with the spatial transcriptome localization results. LEC ca II was significantly upregulated in the BZ and RZ of the infarcted area, and Ca III was significantly upregulated in the IZ. During the mid-to-late stages, we found that LEC ca II gradually differentiated into two orientations. One group was mainly composed of ca I, which may regulate immune and metabolic outcomes, while the other group jointly involved ca I, ca III, and co, which may be mainly involved in cell death, inflammation and edema regression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures. 4A-C</xref>). These results further suggest that ca II and III mainly participate in the early stages of myocardial infarction, whereas ca I and co are involved in the regulation of injury repair in the middle and late stages after MI.</p>

<p>What are the main regulatory molecules in these LEC subgroups during pseudo-time post-MI? Subsequently, we screened and performed KEGG functional enrichment analysis on temporally expressed genes during MI and obtained four gene sets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures. 4D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>). Interestingly, these genes corresponded well with the ratios of different LEC subgroups during MI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Gene set 1, similar to LEC ca III, which is highly expressed at the very early stages of MI and then gradually decreases, is mainly related to oxidative phosphorylation, diabetic cardiomyopathy, cholesterol metabolism, thermogenesis, and the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR), cyclic guanosine 3’, 5’- monophosphate (cGMP) - Protein Kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway. The expression of gene sets 2 and 3 was lower during MI, significantly increased in the early and middle stages, and gradually decreased thereafter. These genes are primarily involved in the regulation of programmed cell death, apoptosis, amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Gene set 4 showed lower expression in the early stage of myocardial infarction, but gradually increased in the middle and showed the highest expression in the late stages post-MI. These genes are mainly involved in cardiac regeneration, renin secretion, bicarbonate reabsorption, salivary and bile secretion, as well as parathyroid and growth hormone synthesis and secretion. These results imply that LECs are mainly involved in the stress regulation of cell metabolism, inflammation, and death in the very early stages of MI, while regeneration and repair functions are mainly involved in the late stages.</p>

<label>2.5</label><title>Assessment of Cell-Cell Communication between LECs and immune cells</title>
<p>To explore how LECs and immune cells interact to regulate metabolic inflammation in the early stages of MI, we conducted further clustering analysis on immune cells from the RAW Data (E-MTAB-7895). As shown in <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure5-figure Supplement 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, seven immune cell types were identified: neutrophils (S100a8 and S100a9), monocytes I (Chil3 and Plac8) and II (Saa3 and Arg1), macrophages (C1qa and Cd68), dendritic cells (H2ab1 and Cd74), B cells (Cd79a and Igkc), and natural killer T cells (Nkg7 and Ms4a4b). The R Package “CellChat” was used to investigate the communication and interaction between these cells and LEC subpopulations. As expected, the communication strength of all significant signaling pathway analyses showed that the highest level of communication probability occured between LEC ca I, NKT and B cells in normal heart tissue, as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. During the early phase of MI, that is, between D1 and D3, the highest interaction numbers and strength found were between LEC ca I and ca III, as well as monocytes and macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, correlation analysis was conducted on the strength of the receptor-ligand of LEC and immune cells, except for the classical APP-CD74 pathway (MHCII, expressed by activated APC cells); the interaction was found to be more active in the Galectin9-CD44 and CD45, as well as Collagen-CD44, and ICAM1-ITGβ2 pathways, between the LEC ca I and III, as well as monocytes type I or macrophages (P&lt;0.05) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures. 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>; <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure5-figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).

<p>In this study, we reveal that fluid retention, one of the basic functions of lymphatic vessels, occurs in LEC ca I and LEC co in the middle-late phase of MI(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, we explored all molecules that may have important regulatory effects on edema regression. Through localization and temporal expression analysis of KEGG pathway genes in the LEC subpopulation, the expression of Aquaporin 1(AQP1) in LEC was found to be significantly correlated with temporal changes in edema occurrence and resolution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Furthermore, the score of the degree of tissue edema in cardiac tissue post-MI, was analyzed and the mouse heart was found to rapidly develop edema on D1 after MI, with the edema reaching its maximum on D3. The edema gradually decreased on D7, and returned to normal on D14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). This was negatively correlated with the expression level of AQP1 in LEC after myocardial infarction(<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure6-figure supplement 1A</xref>). IF co-staining of AQP1 and LEC in heart tissue also revealed that the expression of AQP1 was significantly reduced in the early phase of MI D1 and D3, and markedly increased expressed in MI D7 and D14 post-MI (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure6-figure supplement 1B</xref>). mLECs (mouse LEC cell line) was used and CoCl<sub>2</sub> intervention (simulated hypoxia stimulation) was found to reduce the expression of AQP1 at both the transcriptional and expression levels in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures. 6E</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6J</xref>). These results suggest that AQP1 may be involved in the regulation of lymphatic edema metabolism after MI. Early intervention or increased gene expression may improve cardiac function in MI.</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Galectin9 secreted by LEC can affect macrophage migration</title>
<p>To clarify whether the Galectin9(Gal9)-CD44 axis is involved in the regulation of the interaction between LECs and monocyte-macrophages in the early stages of MI, we looked for the temporal expression changes of Gal9 in LECs post-MI. Consistent with the results of the bioinformatics analysis, Gal9 was highly expressed in LECs D3 and D7(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas CD44 expression gradually decreased from D1(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Further in vitro studies have found that Gal9 expression was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in IFNγ-stimulated cultured mLECs but not hypoxia-stimulated cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7C</xref>-<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>, <xref rid="fig7s1" ref-type="fig">Figure7-figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study reveals, for the first time, the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution of myocardial lymphatic vessels in different regions of myocardial tissue post-MI, these vessels were shown to form different functional subgroups that exhibit different bioeffects in the myocardial tissue post-MI. Following this, a preliminary overview of cardiac lymphatics in infarcted heart at transcriptional level was obtained and the lymphatic system was concluded to be involved in cardiac repair post-MI.</p>
<p>The lymphatic system plays an essential role in interstitial fluid balance and immune cell hemostasis in many organs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Petrova &amp; Koh, 2020</xref>), including the heart(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brakenhielm &amp; Alitalo, 2019</xref>). Stimulating lymphangiogenesis post-MI was found to alleviate myocardial edema and improve heart function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Henri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Houssari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Trincot et al., 2019</xref>). Henri et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Henri et al., 2016</xref>) observed lymphangiogenesis and heart function at 4 and 12 weeks post-MI, and found reduced myocardial edema and fibrosis in VEGFC stimulated mice as compared to the control group. However, lymphangiogenesis in the natural pathological process post-MI, especially in the early stage post-MI, was not observed in this study. Generally, myocardial edema and inflammation are occurred in MI early stage, what does cardiac lymphatics changed simultaneously caught our interest. So we established mice MI model to observe the physiological and pathological changes in cardiac lymphatics. Interestingly the rate and morphology of lymphatic vessel neogenesis were found to vary in different zone of the infarcted heart, and several large, dilated, continuous Lyve1-labeled lymphatic vessels appeared along the middle myocardium quickly in the border zone in D7 post-MI, which was mainly observed in epicardium and endocardium in the normal heart, this abnormal remolding indicate their new role in this pathological scenario.</p>
<p>Takeda et al(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Takeda et al., 2019</xref>) have unveiled LEC heterogeneity and their function in human lymphatics, dividing LEC into six subtypes, and found that CD209 on medullary sinuses LECs mediates neutrophil adhesion in the human lymphatic node medulla. Lymphatic vessels LECs, however, have been teeny elaborated. In this study, LECs of lymphatic vessels were clustered into one collecting LEC and three capillary LEC, and, after localized them in space, found that each subtype focuses on different functions in infarcted heart. LEC ca II and III mainly participate in inflammation in the early stage post-MI in the RZ and IZ, while ca I and co are involved in the regulation of myocardial edema in the middle and late stages after MI in the BZ and IZ. In addition to these traditional roles in immune regulation and interstitial fluid hemostasis, LEC capillaries, especially LEC ca III, also participate in metabolic regulation(glycolysis and gluconeogenesis), which might provide energy for immune cell migrantion or myocardium survival(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Guak &amp; Krawczyk, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Zuurbier et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that lymphangiogenesis stimulation post-MI can suppress T-cell infiltration and reduce infarct thinning(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Houssari et al., 2020</xref>), and that activated LECs penetrating the infarcted heart increase the number of tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells, thereby inhibiting the expansion of NKT cells and promoting reparative macrophage expansion to facilitate post-MI repair(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). This provides a clue for the treatment of lymphatics in infarcted heart.</p>
<p>Herein, we also identified some interesting findings from the Cell-chat analysis between LECs and immune cells. We found that LECs were mainly involved in the chemotactic function of neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages during the early stages of MI. Macrophage chemotaxis not only participates in the inflammatory response after myocardial infarction, but may also serve as an important immune presenting cell involved in the immune regulation of LEC in myocardial tissue after MI. Second, we found that LEC could regulate monocyte and macrophage infiltration through the Galectin9-CD44 pathway. Galectin9 release from LEC in hypoxia is reduced, which slows macrophage migration, increased Galectin9 in the medium of the macrophage can accelerates its migration. Galectin 9 is one of the β-galactoside binding lectins known for its immunomodulatory role in various microbial infections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Moar &amp; Tandon, 2021</xref>), it has been reported that serum Galectin 9 levels are associated with the severity of coronary artery disease, and the ST-segment elevation MI patients have the lowest serum level of Galectin9, followed by the non-ST segment elevation MI group and the stable angina groups(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, galectin9 may be a potential molecule involved in regulating the inflammation response post-MI.</p>
<p>Moreover, we screened out a key edema regulated gene, Aqp1, which is highly expressed in LEC subsets in the middle and late phases of MI. Aqp1 is expressed in many tissues, and its primary function is transmembrane water flux(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Trillo-Contreras, Toledo-Aral, Echevarría, &amp; Villadiego, 2019</xref>). A previous study showed that the knockout of the Aqp1 gene can result in impaired urine concentration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Z. Qiu, Jiang, Li, Wang, &amp; Yang, 2023</xref>) and lung edema(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bai et al., 1999</xref>) in mouse model. We showed that Aqp1 expression decreased at both the RNA and protein levels in mouse LECs under hypoxic stimulation, and that its expression was negatively correlated with myocardial edema in LECs post-MI. This suggests that Aqp1 may be an essential factor in myocardial edema and needs to be elucidated, along with the underlying mechanism.</p>
<p>In conclusion, LECs play an important role in regulating myocardial edema and inflammation post-MI, and stimulation of lymphangiogenesis or promotion of LEC function may become new targets for future clinical improvement of cardiac function post-MI. One limitation of this study is that the single-cell sequencing data that were analyzed for each time point was derived from a single sample, which resulted in resultant LEC counts being too small. This might have resulted in bias in the analyses. In future studies, multiple samples should be utilized to improve the yield of trace cells like LEC for single cell sequencing. Therefore, further validation tests must be designed and implemented.</p>

The Cellchat (v1.6.1) package includes a comprehensive signaling molecule interaction database that considers the known structural composition of receptor-ligand interactions, such as multimeric receptor-ligand complexes, soluble agonists and antagonists, as well as stimulatory and inhibitory membrane-bound coreceptors(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). The inference of cell-cell interactions includes the identification of differentially expressed signaling genes, calculation of ensemble average expression and intercellular communication probability, as well as identification of statistically significant intercellular communications. The single-cell transcriptomic data was divided into seven parts according to the stages and the differences in ligand-receptor interactions and signaling pathways, were explored across these seven stages.</p>

<p>Single nucleus and spatial transcriptome data at 1h, 3 days, and 7days were downloaded (GSE214611). We conducted spatial transcriptome data analysis using the deconvolution algorithm. The deconvolution algorithm refers to the application of feature genes to infer the full matrix information of single-cell transcriptome of cell subclusters. We then compared and anchored the matrix information of the single-cell transcriptome with the information of each SPOT in the spatial transcriptome, predicting cell types based on the similarity between the two sets of information.</p>

<label>4.13</label><title>Statistic analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean±standard error of mean (SEM). All data were analyzed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA). Differences between two groups were evaluated using an unpaired Student’s t-test. Differences among three or more groups were evaluated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance was set at P&lt;0.05.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Assessment of cardiac LEC transcriptomes post-MI may yield new targets to improve lymphatic function. scRNAseq is a valid approach as cardiac LECs are rare compared to blood vessel endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Extensive bioinformatics approaches employed by the group</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Too few cells included in scRNAseq data set and the spatial transcriptomics data that was exploited has little relevance, or rather specificity, for cardiac lymphatics. This study seems more a collection of preliminary transcriptomic data than a true scientific report to help advance the field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study integrated single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points post-MI. They identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of lymphatic endothelial cells and localized them in space. They observed that LECs subgroups are localized in different zones of infarcted heart with functions. Specifically, they demonstrated that LEC ca III may be involved in directly regulating myocardial injuries in the infarcted zone concerning metabolic stress, while LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory responses of the border zone in the early stage of MI. LEC ca I and LEC collection mainly participate in regulating myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI. Finally, cell trajectory and Cell-Chat analyses further identified that LECs may regulate myocardial edema through Aqp1, and likely affect macrophage infiltration through the galectin9-CD44 pathway. The authors concluded that their study revealed the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution of LECs in different regions of the infarcted heart and that LECs formed different functional subgroups that may exert different bioeffects in myocardial tissue post-MI.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study addresses a significant clinical challenge, and the results are of great translational value. All experiments were carefully performed, and their data support the conclusion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Language expression must be improved. Many incomplete sentences exist throughout the manuscript. A few examples: Line 70-71: In order to further elucidate the effects and regulatory mechanisms of the lymphatic vessels in the repair process of myocardial injury following MI. Line 71-73. This study, integrated single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points after MI from publicly available data (E-MTAB-7895, GSE214611) in the ArrayExpress and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases. Line 88-89: Since the membrane protein LYVE1 can present lymphatic vessel morphology more clearly than PROX1.</p>
<p>
(2) The type of animal models (i.e., permeant MI or MI plus reperfusion) included in ArrayExpress and gene expression omnibus (GEO) databases must be clearly defined as these two models may have completely different effects on lymphatic vessel development during post-MI remodeling.</p>
<p>
(3) Line 119-120: Caution must be taken regarding Cav1 as a lymphocyte marker because Cav1 is expressed in all endothelial cells, not limited to LEC.</p>
<p>
(4) Figure 1 legend needs to be improved. RZ, BZ, and IZ need to be labeled in all IF images. Day 0 images suggest that RZ is the tissue section from the right ventricle. Was RZ for all other time points sampled from the right ventricular tissue section?</p>
<p>
(5) The discussion section needs to be improved and better focused on the findings from the current study.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Q1: Please replace lymphocytes with lymphatic endothelial cells throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A1: Thank you for your conscientious review. Per your suggestion, we have replaced “lymphocytes” with “lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs)” throughout the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q2: Please re-analyse lymphatics using LYVE1 and CD68 or another macrophage marker, as Lyve1 is NOT specific for lymphatics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A2: Thank you for your suggestion. We completely agree with your opinion. Because both the CD68 (CST，97778S) and LYVE1 antibodies (Abcam，ab14917) are rabbit multiclonal antibodies and to more accurately label cardiac lymphatics, we performed immunofluorescence co-staining using LYVE1 and PDPN antibodies (Thermo，53-5381-82) and re-measured the lymphatic vessel area using the Image J software (version 1.53). The result is shown in Figure 1A and 1B. Further, we performed co-staining with PDPN and CD68 to observe the relationship between macrophage and cardiac lymphatic vessel distributions at different time points post-myocardial infarction (MI) (Figure1-figure supplement 1F). Per your comment, some LYVE1 markers are positive, whereas PDPN markers may be negative for macrophages in the heart tissue. We have added notes on the catalog numbers of anti-PDPN and anti-CD68 in the methods (Page 10, Lines 351‒352) and updated them in the KRT template and MDAR checklist.</p>

<p>Q3: Rephrase title 2.6, 2.7 to fit the results in these sections that are purely descriptive and do not add any insight into the functional relevance of the findings.</p>

<p>A3: Thank you for your suggestion. We have rephrased titles 2.6 and 2.7 as follows:</p>
<p>2.6 AQP1 in LEC is correlated with myocardial edema occurrence and resolution post-MI.</p>
<p>2.7 Gal9 secreted by LEC can affect macrophage migration.</p>

<p>Q4: Please refrain from extensive discussion of non-significant findings, such as Figures 6D, and 7A, B, and M (ifng vs ifng + antiGal9 is n.s).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A4: Thank you for your suggestions. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are a type of cell that exists in the myocardial tissue in small quantities. Owing to the extremely small number of LECs, elucidating their biological functions and regulation may be challenging during MI. To gain a deeper understanding of the role of the lymphatic system post-MI, we attempted to analyze the transcriptomic changes of LEC subsets at different time points after MI by combining single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data. We have selected relevant molecules with significant differences in transcription levels and conducted the validation analysis in LECs at different time points after MI. Among them, AQP1 and GAL9 showed significant differences. CD44， as a receptor for GAL9, showed significant differences in its expression in macrophages at different time points after MI. Therefore, we have added the relevant information to the discussion section (marked with yellow) on Page 9, Lines 299‒312.</p>

<p>Q5: Please explain the method used to calculate lymphatic areas in Figure 1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A5: Thank you for your observation. The method we used is consistent with that described in previous studies[1,2]. (PMID: 30582443 and PMID: 32404007). The detailed methods have been described in the Methods as follows (Page 10, Lines 358‒363):</p>
<p>For quantification of vessel area, vessels with visible co-staining were measured using Image J software. First, we selected an image, turned it into 8-bit, and then applied a suitable threshold adjustment (present co-stained areas wherever possible). Second, five equally sized squares were selected in the respective zones (remote, infarct, and border zones) of each slice. ROI manager tools were used to analyze the automatic signal intensity quantification by the software in the area inside this square. Finally, the GraphPad software was used to plot the results as a bar graph.</p>

<p>A9: Thank you for your suggestion. The y-axis represents the percentage of the total number of LECs at d1, d3, d7, d14, and d28 post-MI, relative to the number of LECs at d0, which is used as the reference value set at 100%. Meanwhile, different colors were applied to represent the proportion of different cell subtypes at different time points. We have updated Figure 3a.</p>

<p>A12: Thank you for your suggestion. The y-axis in Figure 6A (Figure to reviewer 7A) shows Aqp1 expression in LECs at different time points from the sc-RNA sequence data. We have also added the timepoint in Figure 6G, which is for 24 hours. To clarify the expression trend of APQ1 more clearly, we performed immunofluorescence staining of APQ1 and LYVE1 at different time points after MI (d0, d1, d3, d7, and d14). The results are shown in Figure to reviewer 7C. APQ1 expression was found to be increased in the border zone of infarction at d3 post-MI adjacent to LYVE1 staining positive area.</p>

As shown in the Figure to reviewer 9, little apoptosis of LECs was observed in this concentration gradient range. Therefore, we can exclude the potential impact of IFN-r-induced cell apoptosis.</p>

<p>Q15: Results with hypoxia in Figure 7 are mentioned but not shown.</p>

<p>A15: Thank you for your observation. In the revised article, we supplemented the detection of Gal9 expression after hypoxic stimulation. We conducted hypoxia intervention experiments using two methods. First, we applied 1% oxygen concentration stimulation to detect the expression of Gal9 at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 hours. Second, we applied CoCl2 intervention to activate HIF1α expression and simulated cell hypoxia stimulation to detect Gal9 expression. Both results confirmed that hypoxia could not stimulate LECs to secrete galectin 9. The results are presented in Figure 7-figure Supplement 1 (A-D).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Q1: In Figure 1, the so-called &quot;LYVE1-labeled lymphatic capillaries with discontinuous walls&quot; might be macrophages. The authors measured lymphatic area by measuring &quot;vessels with visible lumens&quot;, which is unclear. This may underestimate the number of capillaries that expand after MI in the border zone of the infarct area. The authors need to use CD68 and Pdpn markers, as Lyve1 is not specific for lymphatics and also stains macrophages, and Pdpn is more reliable for assessing lymphatic identity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A1: Thank you for your good suggestion. We totally agree with your opinion. Because both the CD68 (CST，97778S) and LYVE1 antibodies (Abcam，ab14917) are rabbit multiclonal antibodies and to more accurately label cardiac lymphatics, we performed immunofluorescence co-staining using LYVE1 and PDPN antibodies（Thermo，53-5381-82） and re-measured the lymphatic vessel area using the Image J software (version 1.53). The result is shown in Figure to reviewer 1 (Figure 1A and 1B in manuscript). Further, we performed co-staining with PDPN and CD68 to observe the relationship between macrophage and cardiac lymphatic vessel distributions at different time points post-myocardial infarction (Figure to reviewer 2，and Figure1-figure supplement 1F in manuscript). Per your comment, some LYVE1 markers are positive, whereas PDPN markers may be negative for macrophages in the heart tissue. We have added notes on the catalog numbers of anti-PDPN and anti-CD68 in the methods (Page 10, Lines 351‒352) and updated them in the KRT template and MDAR checklist.</p>

<p>Q3: Figure 1-supplement 1D: The authors claim that the observed structure is a lymphatic valve, however in 2D sections, this shape might result from membrane destruction due to the cutting and staining process. To accurately identify valves, the authors should employ 3D imaging of the lymphatic network, such as using a clearing protocol followed by lightsheet microscopy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A3: Thank you for your good suggestion. We performed a 3D scan using a confocal microscope on another slice. The results are shown in Figure 1-supplement 1D. We believe it is more like the lymphatic valve than chips from membrane destruction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q4: In Figure 2, the number of LECs is too little. Indeed, 242 LECs were identified over 44860 total cell numbers and 5688 endothelial cells cannot be representative and cannot afford to distinguish 4 different clusters.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A4: We further analyzed the percentage of LEC in the adult mouse heart in the physiological state on day d0 based on the results of single-cell nuclear sequencing from public databases (GSE214611). A total of 292 LEC cells were obtained from 26,779 cells captured on board in three samples, meaning that the percentage of LEC cells in the normal adult mouse heart is 1.09%. Cardiac LECs are really rare, and enrichment methods such as flow cytometry and magnetic beads separation for cardiac LECs are under marked probing, which might exhibit more irrefutable evidence in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Q5: The authors claimed that there is transcriptional heterogeneity in regenerated cardiac LECs post-MI, based on their over-clusterization. However, to substantiate this claim, they need to include a control comparison. Currently, the observed differences in cardiac LEC profiles lack a direct connection to the disease condition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A5: Thank you for pointing this out. Because we could not download spatial transcriptome data for day d0 in the public database (GSE214611) or from the authors, we have used data of 1 h after IR as a reference for approximating the physiological state in Figure 3 and in Supplemental Figure 1.</p>

<p>Q15: In Figure 6B, myocardial edema assessment using H&amp;E staining is not accurate. If the authors wish to analyse cardiac edema, they must use gravimetry or MRI techniques.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A15: Thank you for your comment. We totally agree with your opinion. However, owing to limitations in experimental conditions, we could not perform MRI detection of mouse myocardial injury. To evaluate whether edema occurred in the mouse heart tissue, we used classic pathological evaluation methods described in the literature (PMID: 30582443). This method has been described in detail as follows (Page 11, Lines 365‒370):</p>
<p>Four high-power (40×) representative images were chosen per animal under the H&amp;E stained section; each image must have a clear border of the section visible. Images were blinded, and five visual fields per sample were evaluated. Subsequently, an edema score was determined for each sample (Score 1=no edema, 2=mild edema, 3=severe edema).
