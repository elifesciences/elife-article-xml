<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Many proteins have been recently shown to undergo a process of phase separation that leads to the formation of biomolecular condensates. Intriguingly, it has been observed that some of these proteins form dense droplets of sizeable dimensions already below the transition concentration, which is the concentration at which phase separation occurs. To understand this phenomenon, which is not readily compatible with classical nucleation theory, we investigated the properties of the droplet size distributions as a function of protein concentration. We found that these distributions can be described by a scale-invariant log-normal function with an average that increases progressively as the concentration approaches the transition concentration from below. These results suggest the existence of a universal behaviour independent of the sequences and structures of the proteins undergoing phase separation, which is typically observed for second-order phase transitions. Based on these observations, we show that it is possible to use the scale invariance to estimate the critical concentration for phase separation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Many proteins have been shown to undergo a phase separation process into a liquid-like condensed state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This process appears to be of physiological significance since it may lead to the formation of biomolecular condensates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. As a consequence, it is closely controlled by the protein homeostasis system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and its dysregulation has been associated with a broad range of human diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. It is therefore important to understand the fundamental nature of this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> to provide insights for the identification of ways of modulating it through pharmacological interventions.</p>
<p>Several models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of protein phase separation. A commonly adopted theoretical framework is the Flory-Huggins theory of phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In its simplest form, this theory describes a first-order phase separation in a system of homopolymers, which can also be adapted to polyampholites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The Flory-Huggins theory has been extended to associative polymers, with the aim of modelling the sequence composition of proteins, by Flory and Stockmayer, who described the phase separation in terms of a thirdorder gelation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Semenov and Rubinstein modified the Flory-Stockmayer theory, reporting that the gelation process is not a phase transition, as all the derivatives of the free energy are analytical at the gelation point<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. It was also argued that another generalization of the Flory-Stockmayer theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> could describe phase transitions in cytoskeletal networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. More recently, it has been suggested that the protein phase separation process is coupled with percolation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In an older study, γ-crystallin was reported to undergo a second-order phase separation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, consistently with observations in lysozyme solutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To understand better the nature of the transition underlying protein phase separation on the basis of recent experimental observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, here we study the distribution of the size of the droplets below the value of the concentration at which the transition occurs, which here is referred to as the transition concentration, ρ<sub>t</sub>. This question appears as a promising starting point to develop new insights since it has been reported that proteins can form droplets of sizeable dimensions already well below the concentration at which phase separation occurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. This behaviour is not predicted by classical nucleation theory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, and not readily consistent with the idea that the protein phase separation process can be described as a firstorder phase transition. This is because, in a first-order phase transition, nucleation takes place in a supersaturated system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, while in a subsaturated system particles can still self-assemble, but with a probability that decreases exponentially with the size of the assemblies.</p>
<p>In the present study, we report the observation that the distributions of the sizes of the droplets of the proteins FUS and α-synuclein follow a scale-invariant log-normal distribution. These findings are consistent with a universal behaviour resulting from the presence of an increasingly large correlation length, ξ, as the concentration approaches the transition concentration from below. The correlation length is an emergent characteristic, and it is related to the typical spatial range over which density fluctuations are correlated. When ξ is sufficiently large, one can expect scale invariance and finite-size scaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> to occur within a range of lengths spanning from the molecular size to ξ. This means that physical observables do not depend explicitly on many microscopic details characterizing spatial scales smaller than ξ, thus leading to a universal behaviour characterized by quantities obtained by coarse graining over scales smaller than ξ.</p>
<p>At a first-order phase transition, ξ is finite, and if it is not large enough, the length range discussed above remains too short to observe scale invariance. However, the vicinity of the spinodal line (where nucleation disappears as the dilute phase becomes unstable) to the coexistence curve (where nucleation appears as the dilute phase becomes metastable) might cause a large increase of ξ as the first-order phase transition is approached by increasing the concentration. If it is not preceded by a first-order phase transition, the spinodal line would correspond to a second-order phase transition, resulting in infinite ξ, and thus scale invariance holds on all length scales larger than the molecular scale.</p>
<p>As an application of this observation, we address the question of whether scale invariance holds for droplet size distributions near the coexistence curve. As a practical consequence, we use this observation to propose a procedure to overcome the challenge of estimating the critical concentration, ρ<sub>c</sub>. Such challenge arises from the fact that close to the critical concentration, the timescale required for the equilibration of a system grows together with ξ, thus exceeding the timescale amenable to experimental observation. If a second order-phase transition is present, then ρ<sub>c</sub> is the concentration where the transition occurs (with ρ<sub>c</sub> = ρt), whereas in the case of a first-order phase transition, ρ<sub>c</sub> is where the spinodal occurs (with ρ<sub>c</sub> &gt; ρt).</p>
<p>Our analysis of experimental data indicates that: (i) scale invariance does indeed hold near the coexistence curve, and (ii) the droplet size distribution is log-normal. Based on the properties of the scale-invariant log-normal distribution of droplet sizes, we investigate a correlation between the moments of the distribution and the distance from ρ<sub>c</sub>.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that methods to assess the critical concentration are crucial for understanding the location of proteins in their phase diagram, their proximity to the phase boundary between the native and droplet states, and how pharmacological interventions can modify their phase behaviour. To address this problem, we report how the moments of the distribution can be used as a scale-invariant gauge to estimate the critical concentration. In this way, an accurate estimate of the critical concentration is possible because it is based on measurements carried out away from the critical point, under conditions such that fluctuations are small, and hence experimental errors are smaller than in the proximity of the transition.</p>

<title>Formulation of the scaling ansatz</title>
<p>Empirical evidence indicates that protein self-assembly into liquid-like condensates is characterized by: (i) a phase separation transition at a concentration ρt, (ii) a formation of droplets of sizeable dimensions already below ρt, and (iii) a droplet size distribution that, after an initial transient, does not change with the experimental observation time, although individual droplets can form, grow, shrink and dissolve. An initial analysis of droplet size distributions observed experimentally led us to ask whether the region near the transition could be described in terms of a scaling theory, as commonly done for critical phenomena (29), as summarized above. We also note that this approach is analogous to analyzing the cluster size distribution in a percolation problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we called <italic>P&gt;</italic>(<italic>s</italic>|<italic>ρ</italic>) the survival distribution function (SDF = 1-CDF, where CDF is the cumulative distribution function) corresponding to the probability to observe a droplet of size greater than <italic>s</italic>, when the concentration is <italic>ρ</italic>. The distance from the critical concentration ρ<sub>c</sub> is measured in terms of the dimensionless variable <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, which also allows to compare data from different experiments, as explained below. <italic>P&gt;</italic>(<italic>s</italic>|<italic>ρ</italic>) in general depends separately on <italic>s, ρ</italic> and many other parameters characterizing the process, including temperature, with ρ<sub>c</sub> and <italic>ρt</italic> approaching each other as the temperature approaches the critical temperature from below. However, if scale invariance holds in the vicinity of ρ<sub>c</sub>, i.e. when <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is small and the correlation length of the system is large enough, we would expect <italic>P&gt;(s</italic>|<italic>ρ)</italic> to depend on <italic>ρ</italic> and on other details pertaining to the microscopic scales only through the characteristic droplet size, <italic>sc</italic>. The characteristic size <italic>sc</italic> is defined, apart from a proportionality constant (see below), as the ratio of the second to the first moment of the droplet size distribution. This leads us to formulate the following scaling ansatz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where, <italic>sc</italic> depends on <italic>ρ</italic>, and it is expected to diverge at the critical concentration as<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="536478v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>α</italic> ≥ 0 and <italic>φ &gt;</italic> 0 are critical exponents, <italic>a</italic> is a constant and <italic>f</italic> is the so-called scaling function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Thus, the scaling of the SDF is equivalent to saying that, apart from the singular behaviour <italic>s</italic><sup>−<italic>α</italic></sup>, the remaining <italic>s</italic> and <italic>ρ</italic> dependence occurs only through the ratio <italic>s/s<sub>c</sub></italic>. All extra dependencies are encapsulated in <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub> through the constant <italic>a</italic>, ρ<sub>c</sub> and, possibly, on the specific form of the scaling function <italic>f</italic>. A consequence of scaling and singular behavior described by Eq. (2), i.e. the divergence of the characteristic size of the droplets, is that details of any specific system may not affect the value of the critical exponents, which are therefore expected to be universal, i.e. independent of specific details of the system.</p>
<p>To determine the exponents <italic>α</italic> and <italic>φ</italic>, we introduce the moments of <italic>P&gt;</italic>(<italic>s</italic>|<italic>ρ</italic>)

<graphic xlink:href="536478v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>

If the scaling ansatz of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq.

<title>Scaling behaviour of the droplet size distributions of FUS</title>
<p>We investigated the validity the ansatz in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq.

We used the estimates of the critical concentrations, ρ<sub>c</sub> = 5.0 μM for FUS and ρ<sub>c</sub> = 5.4 μM for SNAP-tagged FUS, obtained below, in a self-consistency check of the validity of the scaling ansatz. We observed that the moment ratios at different distances from the critical concentration fall onto straight lines, as predicted by the scaling ansatz. In addition, the weighted average slope (see Eqs. (15) and (16) below) of the lines for different moment ratios is 0.95 ± 0.05 for untagged FUS, and 0.95 ± 0.05 for SNAP-tagged FUS, which is in good agreement with φ=1 for the exponent in the scaling ansatz in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although growing experimental evidence indicates the presence of protein condensates both in vitro and in vivo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, the mechanisms responsible for the formation of these condensates are not fully understood. There is still the need of a general framework capable to fully account for all the experimental observations of protein phase separation. Here, to help build this framework, we aimed at describing phase separation as a universal phenomenon using a scaling ansatz.</p>
<p>With this aim, we analyzed a series of droplet size distributions of FUS and α-synuclein. We found that the droplet size distributions follow a log-normal behaviour and can be described by a scale-invariant model. Scale invariance means that the description of the behaviour of a system remains the same regardless of the scale of observation. It has been seen for example in self-similar systems like fractals, which repeat patterns at different length scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Scale invariance is vital in physics, biology, and economics, helping understand complex systems by identifying consistent patterns and fundamental properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. The critical exponents of the scaling model are consistent for different systems. The compatibility of the droplet distributions with a scale-invariant model underscores its universality, whereby the properties of a broad range of systems remain unaffected by specific dynamical details. We also note the generality of the log-normal model for nucleation and grain size growth ranging from crystal seeding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> to the mass size distributions in organism growth of various sea organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These observations may appear to be in contrast with the Flory-Huggins theory, which characterizes droplet formation as a consequence of nucleation processes within a metastable state of a supersaturated system. In such cases, however, when the correlation length exceeds the cellular dimensions, the remnants of what should have been a first-order phase transition in an infinite system may effectively exhibit indistinguishable characteristics from a secondorder phase transition. We also note that a power law distribution, but above the transition temperature, has recently been reported for nucleoli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Quite generally, the existence of scale invariance within the droplet size distribution, at least under the conditions investigated here, imposes stringent constraints on theoretical models that aim to elucidate protein phase separation. The elegance of a scaling analysis lies in its ability to uncover the fundamental aspects of universal phenomena, transcending models confined solely to specific systems for which they were originally designed.</p>
<p>As a practical consequence of the scaling model, we found that the moments of the droplet size distribution correlate with the critical concentration. This observation suggests that the analysis of the moments of the droplet size distribution can provide a quantitative gauge of the proximity to the phase boundary irrespective of the actual mechanism of phase transition.</p>

<sec id="s4">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>We have addressed the problem of understanding the nature of the transition that leads to protein phase separation. By analysing the functional form of the droplet size distribution, we have reported a scale-invariant log-normal behaviour, which suggests that protein phase separation exhibits features typical of both second-order and first-order phase transitions.</p>
<p>As a prediction derived from this functional form of the droplet size distribution, we have presented a method of estimating the critical concentration for protein phase separation. This distribution can be determined in the test tube, cell cultures or human tissues. The droplet dimensions could be assessed in 1D (length), 2D (area) or 3D (volume).</p>
<p>We note that second-order phase transitions usually result from critical phenomena, and that these processes tend to be highly sensitive to environmental conditions. The modulation of the formation and dimensions of protein droplets therefore could be more tunable than what expected from a standard first-order phase transition. This feature would appear to be favourable for the control of the formation of biomolecular condensates by the protein homeostasis system.</p>

(3)</xref>) versus the concentration, using a range of values of k to cover majority of the data. We performed a linear regression weighted by the inverse variance, determining the intercept on the x-axis. For each value of k, we calculated the regression errors of both intercept and slopes. We estimated the critical concentration from each fit as the intercept calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536478v2_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>q</italic> and <italic>m</italic> are the y-axis intercept and the slope retrieved by the fit, respectively, where the subscript <italic>i</italic> indicates each independent experiment. The estimated ρ<sub>c</sub> was obtained as the mean of the different independent values ρ<sub>c</sub>,i. The error on the estimate of <italic>ρ</italic><sub>c</sub> is obtained as the standard error of the mean of the ρ<sub>c</sub>,i.</p>

<p>The authors analyse droplet size distributions of multiple protein condensates and fit to a scaling ansatz to highlight that they exhibit features of first-order and second-order phase transitions. While the experimental evidence is solid, the text lacks connection and contextualization to the well-understood expectations from the coupling of percolation and phase separation in protein condensates - a phenomenon that is increasingly gaining consensus amongst the community. The evidence supports the percolation and phase separation model rather than being close to a true critical point in the liquid-gas phase space. Overall, the work is useful to the community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The experimental analysis of distinct protein condensates is very well done and the reported exponents/scaling framework provides a clear framework to help the community deconvolve signatures of percolation in condensates.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The principal concern this reviewer has is that the reviewers adopt a framing in this paper to present a discovery of second-order features and connections to criticality - however, they ignore/miss the connections to percolation (a well-understood second-order transition that is expected to play a major role in protein condensates). I believe this needs to be addressed and the paper suitably revised to help connect with these expectations.</p>
<p>- Protein condensates have been increasingly understood to be described as fluids whose assembly is driven by a connection of density (phase separation, first-order) and connectivity (percolation, second-order) transitions. This has been long known in the polymer community (Flory, Stockmayer, Tanaka, Rubinstein, Semenov, and others) and recently repopularized in the condensate community (by Pappu and Mittag, in particular, amongst others). The authors make no connections to any of these frameworks - which actually seem to be the essence of what they are describing.</p>
<p>- Percolation theory, which has been around for more than half a century, has clear-cut scaling laws that have essentially similar forms to the ansatz adopted by the authors, and the commonalities/differences are not discussed by the authors - this is essential since this provides a physical basis for their ansatz rather than an arbitrary mathematical formulation. In particular, percolation models connect size distribution exponents to factors like dimensionality, valence, etc. and if these connections can be made with this data, that would be very powerful.</p>
<p>- The connections between spinodal decomposition and second-order phase transitions are very confusing. Spindal decomposition happens when the barriers for first-order phase transitions are zero and systems can phase separate without crossing nucleation barriers. Further, the &quot;criticality&quot; discussed in the paper is confusing since it more likely refers to a percolation threshold and much less likely to a &quot;critical temperature&quot; (Tc -where spinodal and binodals become identical). I would recommend reframing this argument.</p>
<p>It's unlikely, in this reviewer's opinion, that the authors are actually discussing a &quot;first-order&quot; liquid-gas critical point - because saturation concentrations of these proteins can be much higher with temperature and the critical point would thus likely be at much higher concentrations (and ofc temperature). Further, the scaling exponents don't fall into that class naturally. However, if the authors disagree, I would appreciate clear quantitative reasons (including through the scaling exponents in that universality class) and be happy to be convinced to change my mind. As provided, the data does not support this model.</p>

<p>This is a potentially interesting study addressing a possible scale-invariant log-normal characteristic of droplet size distribution in the phase separation behavior of biomolecular condensates. Some of the data presented are valuable and intriguing. However, as it stands, the validity and utility of this study are uncertain because there are serious deficiencies in the execution and presentation of the authors' results. Many of these shortcomings are fundamental, including a lack of clarity in the basic conceptual framework of the study, insufficient justification of the experimental setup, less-than-conclusive experimental evidence, and inadequate discussion of implications of the authors' findings to future experimental and theoretical studies of biomolecular condensates. Accordingly, this reviewer considers that the manuscript should undergo a major revision to address the following. In particular, the discussion should be significantly expanded by including references mentioned below as well as other references pertinent to the issues raised.</p>
<p>1. The theoretical analysis in this study is based on experimental data on condensed droplet size distributions for FUS and α-synuclein. The size data for FUS droplet is indirect as it relies on the assumption that FUS droplet diameter is proportional to fluorescence intensity of labeled FUS (page 10 of manuscript), with fluorescence data adopted from a previously published work by another group (Kar et al. &amp; Pappu, ref.27). Because fluorescence of a droplet is expected to be dependent upon the condensed-phase concentration of FUS, this proportional relationship, even if it holds, must also be modulated by FUS concentration in the droplet. Moreover, why should fluorescence be proportional to diameter but not the cross-sectional area or volume of the FUS droplet, which would be more intuitive? These issues should be clarified. A new measure by microscopy is used to determine the size distribution of condensed α-synuclein; but no microscopy image is shown. It is of critical importance that such raw data (for example microscopy images) be presented for the completeness and reproducibility of the experiment because the entire study relies on the soundness of these experimental measurements.</p>
<p>2. Despite the authors' claim of a universal scaling relationship, the log-log scatter plots in Figure 1 (page 15 of the manuscript) exhibit significant deviations from linearity at low protein concentrations (ρ→0). Given this fact, is universal scaling really valid? Discussion of this behavior is conspicuously absent (except the statement that these data points are excluded in the fit). In any case, the possible origins of these deviations should be thoroughly discussed so that the regime of universal scaling can be properly delineated.</p>
<p>3. Droplet size distribution most likely depends on the time duration after the preparation of the sample. For α-synuclein, &quot;liquid droplet size characterisation images were captured 10 minutes post-liquid droplet formation&quot; (page 9 of the manuscript). Why 10 minutes? Have the authors tried imaging at different time points and, if so, do the distributions at different time points remain essentially the same? If they are different, what is the criterion for focusing only on a particular time point? Information related to these questions should be provided.</p>
<p>4. At least two well-known mechanisms can lead to the time-dependent distribution of liquid droplet sizes: (i) coalescence of droplets in spatial proximity to form a larger droplet, and (ii) Ostwald ripening, i.e., formation of larger droplets concomitant with the dissolution of smaller droplets without fusion of droplets. The implications of these mechanisms on the authors' droplet size distributions should be addressed. Indeed, maintaining a size distribution against these mechanisms in vivo often requires active suppression [Bressloff, Phys Rev E 101, 042804 (2020)] with possible involvement of chemical reactions [Kirschbaum &amp; Zwicker, J R Soc Interface 18, 20210255 (2021)]. These considerations are central to the basic rationale of this study and therefore should be carefully tackled.</p>
<p>5. If coalescence and/or Ostwald ripening do occur, given sufficient time after sample preparation, the condensed phase may become a single large &quot;droplet&quot; or a single liquid layer. Does this occur in the authors' experiments?</p>
<p>6. It is unclear whether the authors aim to address the kinetic phenomenon of liquid droplet formation and evolution or equilibrium properties. The two types of phenomena appear to be conflated in the authors' narrative. Clarification is needed. If this work aims to address time-independent (or infinite-time) equilibrium properties, how are they expected to be related to droplet size distribution, which most likely is time-dependent?</p>
<p>7. The relationship between the potentially time-dependent droplet size distribution and equilibrium properties of ρt and ρc (transition and critical concentrations, respectively) should be better spelled out. An added illustrative figure will be helpful.</p>
<p>8. The authors comment that their findings appear to be inconsistent with Flory-Huggins theory because Flory-Huggins &quot;characterizes droplet formation as a consequence of nucleation ...&quot; (page 8 of the manuscript). Here, three issues need detailed clarification: (i) In what way does Flory-Huggins mandate nucleation? (ii) Why are the findings of apparent scale invariance inconsistent with nucleation? (iii) If liquid droplet formations do not arise from nucleation, what physical mechanism(s) is (are) envisioned by the authors to be underpinning the formation of condensed liquid droplets in protein phase separation?</p>
<p>9. Are any of the authors' findings related to finite-system effects of phase separation [see, e.g., Nilsson &amp; Irbäck, Phys Rev E 101, 022413 (2020)]?</p>
<p>10. Since the authors are using their observation of an apparent scale-invariant droplet size distribution to evaluate phase separation theory, it is important to clarify whether their findings provide any constraint on the shape of coexistence curves (phase diagrams).</p>
<p>11. More specifically, do the authors' findings suggest that the phase diagrams predicted by Flory-Huggins are invalid? Or, are they suggesting that even if the phase diagrams predicted by Flory-Huggins are empirically correct (if verified by experimental testing), they are underpinned by a free energy function different from that of Flory-Huggins? It is important to answer this question to clarify the implications of the authors' findings on equilibrium phase behaviors and the falsifiability of the implications.</p>
<p>12. How about the implications of the authors' findings on other theories of protein phase separation that are based on interactions that are different from the short spatial range interactions treated by Flory-Huggins? For instance, it has been observed that whereas the Flory-Huggins-predicted phase diagrams always convex upward, phase diagrams for charged intrinsically disordered proteins with long spatial range Coulomb interactions exhibit a region that concave upward [Das et al., Phys Chem Chem Phys 20, 28558-28574 (2018)]. Can information be provided by the authors' findings regarding apparent scale-invariant droplet size distribution on the underlying interaction driving the protein molecules toward phase separation?</p>
<p>13. Table S1 (page 4) and Table S2 (page 7) are mentioned in the text but these tables are not in the submitted files.</p>
<p>14. The two systems studied (FUS and α-synuclein) have a single intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) component. It is not clear if the authors expect their claimed scaling relation to be applicable to systems with multiple IDP components and if so, why.</p>
