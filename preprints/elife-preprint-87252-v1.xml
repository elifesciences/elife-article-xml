<title>Abstract</title><p>Although the cerebellum is now recognized as part of a long-range brain network that serves limbic functions and motivated behavior, knowledge of cerebello-limbic connectivity is limited, and nothing is known about how the cerebellum connects functionally to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Here, we report that stimulation of cerebellar nuclei in mice of both sexes modulates spiking activity in both NAc core and medial shell with fast excitation and slower, less synchronized inhibition. Fast responses would be well poised to support rapid communication of information critical to the control of motivated behavior, whereas slower responses may be suggestive of a regulatory function, such as gain control. Tracing experiments to chart cerebellar nuclei-NAc pathways identified disynaptic pathways that recruit the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and intralaminar thalamus (Centromedial and Parafascicular nuclei) as intermediary nodes. Optogenetic activation of cerebellar axons in each of these nodes was sufficient to evoke responses in both NAc core and medial shell, albeit with distinct, node-dependent properties. These pathways and the functional connectivity they support could underlie the role of the cerebellum in motivated behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cerebellum (CB) exploits the modular organization of its circuitry to integrate information and perform complex computations. Most cerebellar research sheds light on this complexity in the context of updating and predicting motor movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Ito, 2006</xref>). However, accumulating evidence supports cerebellar involvement in high-order non-motor functions as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Buckner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Sokolov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Liang and Carlson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hull, 2020</xref>). In humans, the CB is consistently activated during decision making, particularly during risk- or reward- based tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ernst, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Guo et al., 2013</xref>), and during aversive experiences and emotional learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Moulton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>). Further support for non-motor roles of the CB stems from clinical translational studies, which have linked CB dysfunction with neurodevelopmental disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, addiction, and cognitive and emotional disturbances known as cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Roy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Volkow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Moulton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; D’Mello and Stoodley, 2015; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Miquel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Lanius et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Rabellino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sathyanesan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Schmahmann, 2019</xref>). These findings are further corroborated by evidence from animal studies, which solidify a role for the CB in the processing of valence, aversion, reward, reward anticipation and omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Heffley and Hull, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Shuster et al., 2021</xref>); emotional learning and aggression (Supple et al., 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Sacchetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Lorivel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Strata, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Otsuka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adamaszek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Frontera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jackman et al., 2020</xref>); and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Caston et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bauer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Peterson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baek et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The ability of the CB to derive a complex repertoire of non-motor functions from its relatively invariant cellular organization is largely attributed to its diverse outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Reeber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Xiao and Scheiffele, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Judd et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to the heavily emphasized non-motor cerebellar influences on cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ito, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Mittleman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Strick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Watson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Brady et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kelly et al., 2020</xref>), functional and/or anatomical cerebellar connections with subcortical structures that are critical for cognition and emotion have also been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Snider and Maiti, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Heath et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dietrichs and Haines, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Rochefort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Zeidler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Jung et al., 2022</xref>). Here, we focused on the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a key limbic structure that shares reward, motivation and affective functionality with the CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Floresco, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Klawonn and Malenka, 2018</xref>). The core and medial shell (NAc<sub>Core</sub>, NAc<sub>Med</sub>) subregions of NAc exhibit distinct input-output organization, anatomy, and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Groenewegen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Zahm, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Corbit and Balleine, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Ito and Hayen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Badrinarayan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Li et al., 2018</xref>), with roles in social behavior and reward learning that are often opposing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Floresco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Shan et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the investigation of CB connections to NAc subregions could offer insights into the complexities of CB limbic functionality. Stimulation of CB cortex or deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) modulates levels of NAc dopamine -- an important, but not exclusive, regulator of NAc functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dempesy et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albert et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Holloway et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Root et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Zell et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Low et al., 2021</xref>). However, how the CB connects to NAc functionally is unknown.</p>
<p>Here we used in vivo electrophysiology in anesthetized mice to examine the effects of DCN stimulation on spiking activity in the NAc. We provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, of an electrophysiological connection between CB and NAc, which shows NAc subregion-dependent specificity. Using viral tracing approaches, we offer insights on an anatomical blueprint of disynaptic CB-NAc connectivity, which includes nodal neurons in VTA and limbic thalamus (Centromedial nucleus, CM; and Parafascicular nucleus, PF). Through optogenetic stimulation of DCN projections to each of these nodes, we uncover circuit- dependent connectivity features that are NAc subregion-specific. These findings offer foundational insights into the contribution of the CB to limbic functions such as motivation, reward learning, and affective processing.</p>

<title>DCN microstimulation bidirectionally modulates NAc spiking activity</title>
<p>To examine functional connectivity between CB and NAc, we recorded ongoing spiking activity from 546 putative single units (N = 42 mice) in NAc <italic>in vivo</italic> while electrically microstimulating the DCN (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We primarily targeted the lateral DCN, activation of which has been shown to modulate levels of dopamine in NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Holloway et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Low et al., 2021</xref>). In a subset of experiments, post-hoc analysis localized the bipolar stimulating electrode in the interposed DCN, and these data were included in our analyses. Stimulation of DCN with five 100-μA current pulses at 200 Hz (total stimulus duration: 25 ms) evoked bidirectional modulation of NAc spiking activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Across all recorded units, average spiking initially increased to 12.8 ± 0.4 spikes/s from a pre-stimulus baseline of 10.4 ± 0.5 spikes/s, followed by a modest, slow-recovering decrease to 9.8 ± 0.3 spikes/s. Because of jitter in response latency across neurons, the average spiking rate is an underrepresentation of the true magnitude of modulation, which is more accurately reflected in the average maximum activity. In response to stimulation, average maximum activity increased to 20 ± 0.6 spikes/s for all recorded single-units (t-test for paired samples: t<sub>1017</sub> = -33; p &lt; 0.001), followed by a decrease to an average minimum of 4 ± 0.3 spikes/s (t<sub>1017</sub> = 35.7; p &lt; 0.001) (n = 1018 units x stimulation sites). Further analysis identified three distinct response-types: excitatory (defined as firing rate increase &gt;3σ above the baseline) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), inhibitory (defined as firing rate decrease &gt;1σ below the baseline for 3 consecutive time bins) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), and mixed (both excitatory and inhibitory) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>Of the 546 recorded NAc neurons, 66% responded to DCN stimulation, with most (47%) displaying an excitatory response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). An inhibitory response was elicited in 11% of neurons, whereas a smaller fraction (8%) displayed mixed responses.

<title>Effects of DCN microstimulation on NAc core and medial shell spiking activity</title>
<p>The NAc is divided into two distinct subregions: a core subregion (NAc<sub>Core</sub>) surrounded by an outer subregion, the medial aspect of which is known as the medial shell (NAc<sub>Med</sub>). Each of these subregions has unique microanatomical, functional and connectivity features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Floresco, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Salgado and Kaplitt, 2015</xref>). We aimed to examine whether the difference in proportions (i.e., prevalence) between DCN-evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses in NAc stemmed from regional differences (core vs. medial shell) at NAc recording sites. Our axial multi- electrode array approach enabled recordings from multiple NAc sites in both NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Out of 169 neurons we recorded in NAc<sub>Core</sub>, more than half (53%) responded with excitatory modulation to 100-µA stimulation of at least one site in DCN, while 8% responded with inhibitory modulation, and another 8% with mixed modulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> <italic>left</italic>). Similarly, out of 377 neurons we recorded in NAc<sub>Med</sub>, 44% responded to DCN stimulation with excitation, 12% with inhibition, and 8% with mixed modulation of spiking activity. The frequency distributions of these response-types in NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> were not significantly different (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(3)</sub> = 4.7, p = 0.19).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then examined whether the amplitude of excitatory and/or inhibitory responses varied between NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2C-D</xref>). For this analysis, the excitatory and inhibitory components of mixed responses were considered together with the excitatory and inhibitory response types, respectively. In both NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub>, DCN stimulation elicited significant excitatory modulation of firing rate (mean ± sem, spikes/s in NAc<sub>Core</sub>: baseline: 12.2 ± 1.1, peak excitatory response: 52.2 ± 2.5, paired t<sub>162</sub> = -24.2, p &lt; 0.0001; in NAc<sub>Med</sub>: baseline: 7.9 ± 0.6, peak excitatory response: 42.2 ± 1.5, paired t<sub>267</sub> = -32.4, p &lt; 0.0001), which did not differ between subregions (% baseline: NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 856.2 ± 79.2, NAc<sub>Med</sub>: 978.8 ± 62.5, t<sub>429</sub>= -1.2, p = 0.23). Similarly, both NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> showed significant inhibitory modulation (mean ± sem, spikes/s in NAc<sub>Core</sub>: baseline: 24.3 ± 3.9, peak inhibitory response: 4.0 ± 2.3, paired t<sub>42</sub> = 9.7, p &lt; .0001; in NAc<sub>Med</sub>: baseline: 22.1 ± 1.6, peak inhibitory response: 1.3 ± 0.4, paired t<sub>92</sub> = 15.5, p &lt; 0.0001), which did not differ between subregions (% baseline: NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 4.3 ± 2.1, NAc<sub>Med</sub>: 2.6 ± 0.8, t<sub>134</sub> = 0.9, p = 0.36)(p-values corrected for multiple comparisons). These results suggest that cerebellar signals are equally likely to reach NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub>. Upon further inspection, we found that irrespective of subregion, the baseline firing rate of excitatory responses was significantly lower than the baseline of inhibitory responses (F(1,563) = 88, p &lt; 0.001). Differences in baseline between excitatory and inhibitory responses could arise from potentially different NAc cellular properties, although the fact that neurons with elevated firing rates are more likely to satisfy our criterion for inhibitory responses should also be considered.</p>

<title>Differential and non-linear dependence of NAc responses on DCN stimulation intensity</title>
<p>To further probe the functional connectivity between DCN and NAc, we assessed the effectiveness of DCN microstimulation at two more intensities, 30 μA and 300 μA, in addition to 100 μA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>; <italic>middle</italic> and <italic>right</italic>). In NAc<sub>Core,</sub> the proportion of excitatory responses changed from 42% (with 30 μA stimulation) to 53% (with 100 μA), to 57% (with 300 μA); the proportion of inhibitory responses changed from 7% (30 μA) to 8% (100 μA) to 10% (300 μA); and finally, the proportion of mixed responses changed from 18% (30 μA) to 8% (100 μA) to 8% (300 μA). Contingency table analysis did not find a significant effect of stimulation intensity on the frequency distribution of response-types in NAc<sub>Core</sub> (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(6)</sub> = 9.4; p = 0.15). In NAc<sub>Med</sub>, the proportion of excitatory responses changed from 38% (30 μA) to 44% (100 μA) to 45% (300 μA); the proportion of inhibitory responses changed from 6% (30 μA) to 12% (100 μA) to 7% (300 μA); and the proportion of mixed responses changed from 13% to 8% to 14%. The effect of stimulation intensity on the frequency distribution of response-types in NAc<sub>Med</sub> was statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(6)</sub> = 13.6; p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the NAc subregions displayed differential sensitivity to the intensity of DCN microstimulation. For both NAc subregions, the prevalence of the different response-types did not change proportionally to the ∼3-fold change in stimulation intensity, which suggests non-linear dependence to stimulation intensity.</p>

<title>The bidirectional NAc modulation is not a reflection of topographical DCN organization</title>
<p>In our experiments we used bipolar stimulation electrodes to contain the spread of electrical current at DCN stimulation sites. To confirm that the stimulation was indeed localized, we examined the likelihood of NAc neurons that responded to stimulation of individual DCN sites to also respond to adjacent stimulation sites along anatomical axes in the same experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A1-2</xref>). We found that the probability of a NAc<sub>Core</sub> neuron that responded to stimulation of a DCN site to also respond to stimulation of a site ∼100 μm away dropped by 66%. In NAc<sub>Med</sub>, this probability dropped by 33%. The subregion-dependent difference in the likelihood of adjacent DCN sites to evoke a response in the same neuron most likely reflects differences in the architecture of the neural circuits. Regardless of the difference between NAc subregions, the probability decrease is consistent with localized stimulation.</p>
<p>Given that DCN stimulation appeared spatially restricted, could the observed differences in NAc response-types arise from regional differences within DCN? To address this question, we examined whether there was topographical clustering of DCN sites with respect to their effectiveness to evoke significant excitatory or inhibitory responses in NAc<sub>Core</sub> and/or NAc<sub>Med</sub>. We did not find indications of such clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3, C1-3</xref>), which argues against topographical organization of lateral/interposed DCN with respect to NAc response types. Using a similar approach, we examined whether there was topographical clustering of sites with excitatory and/or inhibitory responses within NAc subregions, but we did not find evidence for any such organization either (not shown).</p>

<title>Anatomical blueprint of DCN-NAc connectivity</title>
<p>There are no direct, monosynaptic connections between DCN and NAc (Allen Brain Atlas, and our own observations); we therefore hypothesized the existence of at least disynaptic anatomical pathways between the two areas. To test this hypothesis, we adopted a 2-pronged approach. First, we combined injection of a retrograde tracer (cholera toxin subunit B (ctb) -640 or -568) in NAc with injection of an anterograde viral tracer (AAV9-CAG-GFP) in DCN to identify areas of overlap (nodes) in a putative disynaptic CB-NAc circuit (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>) (N = 6 mice). Histological processing and high-resolution confocal imaging of brain sections revealed two regions of overlap between ctb-filled neurons that project to NAc and GFP- labelled DCN axonal projections: the VTA and limbic thalamus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,D</xref>). In VTA, most areas of overlap localized medially and caudally and involved both TH+ (dopaminergic) neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) and TH- neurons. In the thalamus, we found areas of overlap in centromedial (CM) and parafascicular (PF) intralaminar nuclei (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). We found overlap in these same regions also when DCN injections were restricted to the lateral cerebellar nucleus only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E,F</xref>). These results are consistent with the existence of a disynaptic DCN-NAc anatomical circuit and point to VTA, and CM and PF thalamic nuclei, as putative circuit nodes.</p>

<p>To confirm these observations through an independent approach, we performed AAV1- mediated anterograde transsynaptic tracing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Zingg et al., 2017</xref>) via stereotactic injections of AAV1-Cre in DCN and AAV-FLEX-tdTomato in VTA or limbic thalamus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>) (N = 4 mice). This approach relies on the transsynaptic transfer of Cre to postsynaptic neurons, which, once infected with a floxed fluorophore, become fluorescently labeled. With this method, we confirmed the existence of neurons receiving CB input in VTA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C1,C2</xref>) and CM, PF intralaminar thalamus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D1,D2</xref>).

<title>Photostimulation of DCN axonal projections in nodes supports the existence of disynaptic circuits between cerebellum and NAc</title>
<p>Our combined electrophysiological and neuroanatomical data point to the existence of neural circuits connecting the CB to the NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub>, with putative nodal regions in VTA and/or intralaminar thalamus. We sought to determine whether these anatomically defined nodes are also functional nodes serving CB-NAc connectivity.

<p>As with electrical microstimulation of DCN sites, targeted photostimulation of ChR2- expressing DCN axons in each of the three putative nodes modulated spiking activity in both NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> (example units in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C2</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D2</xref>,<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E2</xref>; group averages in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A1,B1,C1</xref>), establishing the VTA, CM and PF as functional nodes of the CB-NAc circuitry. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> shows the normalized group average excitatory responses of NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> neurons elicited by photostimulation in VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A1</xref>), CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B1</xref>), and PF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C1</xref>). Because of jitter, the group average response underestimates the true magnitude of modulation, as discussed previously for electrical responses. Therefore, to further evaluate the connectivity strength in the three CB-NAc circuits, we computed the average peak amplitude of light-evoked excitatory responses in NAc subregions and asked whether it varied across nodes or between NAc subregions. In NAc<sub>Core</sub>, neurons displayed an average peak excitatory response to photostimulation in VTA of 43 ± 8 spikes/s; in CM: 44 ± 5 spikes/s; in PF: 36 ± 4 spikes/s. In NAc<sub>Med</sub>, the average peak excitatory response to photostimulation in VTA was 39 ± 6 spikes/s; in CM: 34 ± 3 spikes/s; and in PF: 41 ± 6 spikes/s. There was no statistically significant effect of NAc subregion, or of node, on peak responses (NAc subregion: F(1,120) = 0.4; p = 0.5; node: F(2,120) = 0.1; p = 0.9), and no significant interaction (F(2,120) = 0.9; p = 0.4). These NAc responses were specific to ChR2 expression, as no-opsin (EGFP-alone) controls did not show an effect of photostimulation on peak firing rate, even at 15 mW (response window vs. baseline: NAc<sub>Core</sub>: t<sub>4</sub> = 0.53, p = 0.62; NAc<sub>Med</sub>: t<sub>35</sub> = -1.41, p = 0.17) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>Light-evoked responses were excitatory in their majority, with frequency distribution that varied between NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> in a node-dependent manner: photostimulation of DCN projections in VTA evoked more excitatory responses in NAc<sub>Core</sub> than in NAc<sub>Med</sub> (excitatory responses in NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 86%, in NAc<sub>Med</sub>: 38%; χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 13.6; p &lt; 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7A2</xref>), whereas no such differences were observed upon photostimulation in CM (NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 77%, NAc<sub>Med</sub>, 72%; χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 0.20; p = 0.44) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7B2</xref>) or PF (excitatory responses in NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 65%, in NAc<sub>Med</sub> : 85%; χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 2.63; p = 0.11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7C2</xref>) (p-values corrected for multiple comparisons). Excitatory responses were also readily elicited in NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> with as little as 1 or 5 mW photostimulation (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Even at the lowest intensity (1 mW), a single pulse was sufficient to elicit a response (percent responses elicited by first pulse in VTA: NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 54%, NAc<sub>Med</sub>, 58%; in CM: NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 72%, NAc<sub>Med</sub>, 57%; in PF: NAc<sub>Core</sub>: 67%, NAc<sub>Med</sub>: 58%) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), pointing to high-fidelity connectivity that does not strictly require activity-dependent synaptic enhancement to propagate information to NAc. The proportion of responses elicited by the first light pulse tended to increase with photostimulation intensity more than expected by chance alone in VTA (permutation test: p &lt; 0.001, n = 41, N = 4) and CM (p &lt; 0.01, n = 52, N = 4), but not in PF (p = 0.08, n = 45, N = 3) (p-values corrected for multiple comparisons). This finding could potentially suggest convergent connectivity within the CB-VTA-NAc and CB-CM-NAc circuits.</p>

<title>Temporal aspects of light-evoked responses</title>
<p>We wondered whether temporal aspects of CB-NAc communication differed between excitatory and inhibitory responses. This question cannot be addressed accurately in electrical stimulation experiments because of electrical artifacts, which can place a lower bound on the onset latency of detected responses, but can be readily addressed in optogenetic experiments. Analysis of onset latency of responses elicited by 10 mW CB axonal photostimulation indicated that, overall, excitatory responses had significantly shorter onset latencies than inhibitory ones (mean ± sem: excit.: 45.4 ± 5.0 ms, inh.: 256.7 ± 46.2 ms, t<sub>147</sub>= -10.0, p &lt; 0.001; N = 10, n<sub>exc.</sub>= 136, n<sub>inh.</sub>= 13). To dissect node-specific effects, we computed the cumulative distributions of onset latencies for excitatory responses elicited by photostimulation in VTA, CM and PF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). A relatively broad distribution of onset latencies was evident in all nodes, with half-rise latencies of 11 ms for VTA, 20 ms for CM and 40 ms for PF. Further analysis indicated that the probability of eliciting short-latency responses (≤ 10 ms), which are consistent with disynaptic connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Assous et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), was greater for photostimulation in VTA compared to CM and/or PF (proportion of latencies ≤ 10 ms: VTA: 0.34, CM: 0.08, PF: 0.11; VTA vs CM: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 10.3, p &lt; 0.01; VTA vs PF: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 6.4, p &lt; 0.01; CM vs PF: χ<sup>2</sup><sub>(1)</sub> = 0.4, p = 0.54; p-values corrected for multiple comparisons) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> <italic>inset</italic>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we examined the previously uncharted functional connectivity between the cerebellum and nucleus accumbens using in vivo electrophysiology, neuroanatomy, and optogenetics. We found that electrical microstimulation of DCN elicits responses in both NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub>, manifested as excitatory and/or inhibitory modulations of neural firing rate. Neuroanatomical studies identified three disynaptic pathways through which cerebellar signals can reach the NAc. These pathways go through the VTA or the intralaminar thalamus (centromedial or parafascicular nucleus). Optogenetic activation of DCN axons in each of these intermediary nodes revealed that all three pathways can communicate cerebellar signals to NAc, albeit with distinct node-dependent properties.</p>

<title>Bidirectional regulation of NAc through fast excitation and slow inhibition</title>
<p>Results from both electrical microstimulation and optogenetic experiments converged on the conclusion that the cerebellum sends strong excitatory signals to NAc. The strength of these excitatory signals did not show any NAc subregion-, or node-, dependence. However, the relative frequency of NAc neurons that receive excitatory vs. inhibitory (or mixed) signals varied, depending on the route that the DCN signals followed: the CB-VTA pathway was more likely to communicate excitatory signals to neurons in NAc<sub>Core</sub> than in NAc<sub>Med</sub>, whereas the CB- thalamic pathways did not show a clear preference for either NAc subregion.</p>
<p>Our neuroanatomical studies identified three disynaptic pathways for CB-NAc communication through the VTA and intralaminar thalamus (CM, PF) nodes. Disynaptic pathways that utilize fast classical neurotransmitters (e.g., glutamate) would be expected to support rapid signal propagation and result in short-latency responses, whereas neuromodulatory (e.g., dopaminergic) pathways would be expected to operate at longer time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Assous et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Sippy and Tritsch, 2023</xref>). The shortest-latency responses we recorded upon photostimulation of cerebellar axons in each of the intermediary nodes occurred within 10 ms, a finding that is consistent with the monosynaptic connections known to exist between DCN and VTA, and DCN and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Jung et al., 2022</xref>), and which agrees with our newly identified structural connectivity. Particularly for responses elicited by photostimulation in VTA, DCN axons are known to synapse onto both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Beier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baek et al., 2022</xref>), including vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive (vGlut2+) VTA neurons, which project to NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Beier et al., 2015</xref>) and which could, at least partly, mediate cerebellar signaling. Longer- latency excitatory responses dominate CB-NAc communication through the intralaminar thalamus and could arise from polysynaptic circuitry, in agreement with the diffuse patterning of intralaminar projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Jones and Leavitt, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Van der Werf et al., 2002</xref>). Subthreshold synaptic signaling that requires activity-dependent short-term facilitation in order to propagate to NAc neurons could also account for longer latencies. Given that optogenetic stimulation of CB axons with a single pulse could elicit NAc responses, short-term plasticity does not appear to be strictly required for successful CB-NAc communication. However, it could account for the excitatory NAc responses evoked through PF, which displayed more gradual buildup than excitatory responses through the other nodes.</p>
<p>Inhibitory responses are also a key component of CB-NAc connectivity and may be important for global gain control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Buzsáki et al., 2007</xref>). Inhibitory responses (and/or inhibitory components of mixed responses) were seen upon stimulation in DCN, or in any of the nodes, and occurred with longer latencies compared to excitatory responses. They also appeared to depend on photostimulation intensity, with higher prevalence at lower photostimulation intensities. Multiple cellular mechanisms could underlie inhibitory responses and could involve dopamine release as well as non-dopaminergic signaling through the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Beier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baek et al., 2022</xref>) and/or CB-thalamic (CM, PF) projections to NAc, which are known to contact not only medium spiny neurons but also cholinergic inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Yamanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Polysynaptic pathways could also be involved, although their recruitment seems at odds with the inverse relationship between inhibitory response prevalence and photostimulation intensity. The nature of synaptic signaling and plasticity in CB-NAc circuits is an exciting route for further investigation.</p>

<title>Technical considerations</title>
<p>Our recordings were performed in ketamine-anesthetized mice. Although ketamine at anesthetic doses does not alter the number of spontaneously active striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kelland et al., 1991</xref>), it affects the pattern of spontaneous activity, promoting step-like membrane potential fluctuations between “up-” and “down-states” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Mahon, 2001</xref>). Such bursting behavior would contribute to “noisy” baseline activity; however, we would not expect it to distort our analyses because we have defined neural responses as changes in spiking rate from the preceding baseline. Moreover, by using electrical and/or optogenetic, rather than sensory, stimuli to probe connectivity, we have overcome any concerns stemming from the known inhibitory effect of ketamine on sensory-evoked activity in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bengtsson and Jörntell, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to anesthesia, the stimulation modality (electrical, optogenetic) warrants consideration. Electrical stimulation could potentially result in antidromic activation of DCN inputs, which could lead to recruitment of alternate polysynaptic pathways to NAc. This concern was mitigated by our optogenetic experiments, in which ChR2-expessing DCN axons were specifically activated in the nodes. Moreover, although electrical current propagates widely in the brain, the use of bipolar electrodes allowed us to restrict the spread of DCN stimulation to ∼100 µm, as shown by the substantial drop in the probability to activate the same NAc neuron with DCN stimuli delivered 100 µm apart. Lastly, optogenetic stimulation of DCN axons in a node could induce back-propagating action potentials that could, in turn, elicit NAc responses through axonal collaterals. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no evidence for DCN collaterals that form synapses onto NAc-projecting neurons in both VTA and intralaminar thalamic nuclei. Even if such collaterals existed, their activation would result in unreliable responses with relatively long latencies, due to synaptic delays and the failure-prone asymmetric nature of action potential conduction velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Grill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Mateus et al., 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Novelty of anatomical connections</title>
<p>Anatomical and functional connections between DCN and VTA, and DCN and intralaminar nucleus nodes, have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Snider and Maiti, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hendry et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Phillipson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Gornati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Jung et al., 2022</xref>). VTA and thalamic projections to NAc are also well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Beckstead et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Su and Bentivoglio, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bentivoglio et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bassareo and Di Chiara, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Garris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Groenewegen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Van der Werf et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ikemoto, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). It might therefore be unsurprising that the DCN recruit these nodes to communicate with NAc. However, the VTA and thalamus are exquisitely complex areas with multiple output streams. For example, the VTA projects not only to NAc but also to hippocampus, hypothalamus, lateral habenula, entorhinal cortex, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Oades and Halliday, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Stamatakis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Beier et al., 2015</xref>). None of these downstream target regions appears to be disynaptically connected to DCN through the VTA, which points to specificity in circuit wiring. Our study is the first one, to our knowledge, to map DCN-NAc circuits through VTA and thalamus. A recent study provided anatomical evidence for a medial DCN-NAc circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Fujita et al., 2020</xref>). Here we extend these observations to lateral DCN and also provide evidence for the centromedial and parafascicular nuclei as parts of the thalamic node.</p>

<title>Ideas and Speculations</title>
<p>It is tempting to speculate on network-wide implications of the different CB-NAc pathways. Fast excitatory signals would be well poised to support the rapid communication of information critical to the control of motivated behavior, such as prediction or prediction-error signals, which are well established in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Heffley and Hull, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Larry et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that DCN signals can reach NAc<sub>Core</sub> and NAc<sub>Med</sub> through distinct anatomical (and possibly cellular) pathways leaves room for distinct multiplexing with signals originating elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cerebellar signals that arrive to NAc<sub>Core</sub> through VTA could be behaviorally relevant for reward learning through signaling of value, which has been correlated with dopamine release in NAc<sub>Core</sub>, but not in NAc<sub>Med</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). Alternatively (or additionally), the CB-VTA- NAc<sub>Core</sub> pathway could be rewarding in itself, as stimulation of dopaminergic projections from VTA to NAc<sub>Core</sub> are sufficient to establish self-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Han et al., 2017</xref>) and previous studies have shown that the CB can signal reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Medina, 2019</xref>). The CB-VTA-NAc<sub>Core</sub> pathway could also be involved in social cognition, given that NAc<sub>Core</sub> activation promotes social dominance in mice and that cerebellar Purkinje neurons are known to modulate social aggression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Jackman et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, the CB-VTA- NAc<sub>Core</sub> pathway could also be important for signaling salience, regardless of valence, to promote learned responses to behaviorally relevant stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref>). The short response latencies of the CB-VTA-NAc<sub>Core</sub> pathway could be key for temporally precise control of behavioral states including attentional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Flores-Dourojeanni et al., 2021</xref>), and could gate incoming signals to NAc, including signals from PF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akaike et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hara et al., 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed bias of CB-PF neurons to preferentially influence NAc<sub>Med</sub> over NAc<sub>Core</sub> could support a role in behavioral flexibility. Indeed, both NAc<sub>Med</sub> and NAc<sub>Core</sub> neurons encode rewarding and aversive stimuli via changes in neural firing rate, however, only neurons in NAc<sub>Med</sub> adaptively shift population response type to track the motivational value of a stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Loriaux et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that NAc<sub>Med</sub> can flexibly modulate encoding based on relative stimulus valence and/or acquired salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aquili et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">West and Carelli, 2016</xref>). Given that the PF is known to play a role in behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Kato et al., 2021</xref>), the CB-PF-NAc<sub>Med</sub> circuit may communicate teaching signals for updating past learning and altering behavior adaptively.</p>
<p>Future investigations into the cellular basis of DCN-NAc communication as well as potential circuit-specificity of behavioral contributions are clearly in order. Here, we have broken new ground by providing the first evidence of rapid functional connectivity between CB and NAc, through the midbrain and intralaminar thalamus.</p>

<p>C57Bl/6J mice of both sexes were used in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines and the policies of the University of California Davis Committee for Animal Care. Acute in vivo recordings were performed at postnatal days P43-P91. All animals were maintained on a light/dark cycle (light 7 am - 7 pm), and experiments were performed during the light cycle.</p>

<title>Surgery</title>
<p>Mice of both sexes (P35 - P49; N = 11) were used for optogenetic experiments. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% - 5% induction; 1.5% maintenance) and secured to a stereotactic frame (Kopf Insruments, Tujunga, CA). After exposing the top of the skull, the head was leveled and small craniotomies were drilled over the DCN. Channelrhodopsin-expressing adeno-associated virus (AAV2-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP, UNC Vector Core, Chapel Hill, NC; 100 nl, 5.6x10<sup>12</sup> gc/ml, 1:2 dilution) was injected into the three DCN using a Micro4 controller and UltraMicroPump 3 (VWR, Radnor, PA). Glass needles were made from 1-mm outer diameter glass pipettes (Wiretrol II, Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA) pulled to a fine tip (20 - 50 µm tip diameter, 3 - 4 mm tip length) using a pipette puller (P-97, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA). Injection needles were left in place for 5- 10 min following injections to minimize diffusion. The following coordinates were used for targeting pipettes to each nucleus (relative to lambda): medial n.: -2.55 AP, +/-0.8 ML, -2.15 DV; interposed n.: -2.45 AP, +/-1.7 ML, -2.15 DV; lateral n.: -1.82 AP, +/- 2.37 ML, -2.17 DV. Following surgery and analgesia administration (0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine, 5 mg/kg meloxicam), mice were allowed to recover on a warm heating pad before being transferred back to the vivarium. Animals were given 4-5 weeks expression time before being used in in vivo recording experiments.</p>
<p>For electrophysiological recordings, anesthesia was initially induced by brief inhalation of 4-5% isoflurane followed by an intraperitoneal injection of anesthetic cocktail (100 mg/kg ketamine; 10 mg/kg xylazine; 1 mg/kg acepromazine) and was maintained with periodic injections of the anesthetic cocktail (20-50 mg/kg), as needed. After confirmation of anesthesia depth using a toe pinch response test, mice were placed in a stereotactic frame (Stoelting Co., Wood Dale, IL) on a heating pad. Breathing rate and toe pinch responses were monitored to ensure maintenance of anesthesia. For electrical stimulation experiments (N = 42 mice of both sexes), a small craniotomy and durectomy were performed over the DCN (lateral/interposed n.: relative to lambda, in mm: -2.1 to -2.6 AP; +/-2.1 to +/-2.3 ML). For optogenetic experiments, optic fibers were implanted over the CM (relative to bregma: -1.3 AP; -.85 ML; - 3.55 DV, 10° angle), PF (relative to bregma: -1.87 AP; -.95 ML; -2.95 DV, 12° angle), or VTA (relative to bregma: -3.1 AP; -0.5 ML; -4.05 DV) ipsilaterally to recording site and secured with temporary resin acrylic (Keystone Industries, Gibbstown, NJ). For recordings, craniotomy and durectomy were made over NAc, targeting the medial shell and/or core (relative to bregma: +1.7 to +1.54 AP; +/- 0.4 to +/-1.15 ML).</p>

<title>Electrical/Optical Stimulation</title>
<p>For electrical stimulation, a custom stereotrode (∼200 μm distance between tips) was lowered 1.95 - 2.45 mm below the brain surface (in DV axis) through the cerebellar craniotomy to reach the DCN. Ten trials of bipolar constant-current electrical microstimulation were delivered at each location at a 15-s inter-trial interval. Each stimulation trial consisted of a 200- Hz burst of five 0.5-ms monophasic square-waveform pulses at 100 μA. In a subset of experiments (N = 15 mice), the stimulation intensity was varied between 30, 100, and 300 μA in interleaved blocks of 5 trials per intensity. When stimulation was repeated at different DCN sites in the same experiment, an effort was made to move the stereotrode in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the two poles, so that an at least partly distinct pool of cerebellar neurons could be stimulated. For optical stimulation, 20-50 trials of ten 5-ms light pulses (473- nm DPSS laser, Opto Engine LLC, Midvale, UT) were delivered at 20 Hz (inter-trial interval: 30 s or 1 min). Optical stimulation was primarily delivered at 10 mW intensity at fiber tip, but lower intensities were also tested (1 and 5 mW).</p>

<title>Acquisition of Electrophysiological Data</title>
<p>Recordings were performed with a 12-channel (platinum; 0.2 - 2 MΩ impedance) axial multi-electrode array (FHC Inc., Bowdoin, ME; 150 μm distance between channels), dipped in fluorescein dextran (3000 MW) and lowered into the NAc at a depth of 3.75 - 5.25 mm below the brain surface (DV axis). Electrode signals were fed to a digital headstage (RHD 2132, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA) for amplification (x20), filtering (0.7 - 7500 Hz) and digitization (30 kS/s with 16-bit resolution), before transfer to an open-source acquisition system (OpenEphys) for display and storage.</p>

<title>Histology for Verification of Electrode/Optic Fiber Placement</title>
<p>Positioning of electrodes and fibers was initially guided by atlas-based stereotactic coordinates (Paxinos &amp; Franklin) and, upon completion of experiments, histologically verified through electrolytic lesions (for location of DCN microstimulation electrodes; single 10-s cathodal pulse of 300 µA), fiber track inspection (for optic fiber) and fluorescence imaging (for recording array; NAc fluorescein dye track). Coordinates for subsequent animals of the same litter were further adjusted accordingly. At the end of experiments, electrodes were retracted and animals were perfused with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were dissected and post-fixed in 4% PFA, sliced in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and inspected under a fluorescence stereoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan; SZX2). NAc slices containing the dye track from the recording array were identified under 488 nm light; CB slices with electrolytically lesioned tissue, and thalamic and/or VTA slices with optic fiber tracts, were identified under brightfield illumination. Slices of interest were subsequently stained with DAPI (1:20,000, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA), mounted on slides, and imaged using a VS120 Olympus slide scanner. Images were manually registered to the Paxinos and Franklin Mouse Brain Atlas and the location of the recording electrode tip and optic fiber were mapped. Only channels along the recording array that were determined to be within NAc<sub>Core</sub> and/or NAc<sub>Med</sub> were included in analysis. Experiments with misplaced optic fibers, viral expression outside the DCN region, or cerebellar electrolytic lesions localized outside the lateral and/or interposed DCN, were excluded from analysis.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis Electrophysiological data processing and quantification</title>
<p>Custom-written MATLAB scripts (Mathworks, Natick, MA) were used for data processing and analysis. Filtering of spikes was achieved through a 4<sup>th</sup>-order Butterworth high-pass filter (cutoff at 300 Hz). The filtered signal was thresholded at 3-3.5 standard deviations below the average voltage. Spikes were subsequently sorted in putative single-unit clusters with Plexon Offline Sorter (version 3.3.5, Plexon Inc., Dallas, TX) using principal component analysis. All well-isolated neurons were included in the analyses. Firing rates were computed from spike counts in consecutive 10-ms time bins (peri-stimulus time histogram; PSTH). Spikes with time differences less than 7 ms from stimulus artifacts or 1 ms from the previous spike were discarded.</p>
<p>Quantification of stimulation-induced modulation of NAc spiking activity followed recent studies of cerebellar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Washburn et al., 2022</xref>) and our own evaluation of the dataset. Specifically, we averaged the PSTH across all trials of the same intensity for any given pair of recording and stimulation sites and normalized to the average pre-stimulus baseline (z-score). We defined an excitatory response as an increase in firing rate that exceeded 3 standard deviations (σ) above the baseline within the first 500 ms after the stimulus onset. An inhibitory response was defined as a decrease in firing rate of more than 1 σ below the baseline that persisted for a minimum of three time bins (i.e., 30 ms) and started within the first 500 ms after stimulus onset. The 500-ms time window captured more than 90% of responses (not shown). For single-unit responses that included both excitatory and inhibitory components (mixed responses), we quantified each component individually for amplitude and latency. For illustration purposes only, all firing rates were convolved with a Gaussian kernel (σ = 16 ms). Response onset latency was defined as the first instance at which firing rate changed from baseline as described above, using 1-ms time bins.

<p>The study expands our understanding of the neural circuitry downstream of the cerebellum by describing pathways between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the nucleus accumbens. The authors use a combination of in vivo electrophysiology, electrical and optogenetic stimulation, and both anterograde and retrograde tracing to demonstrate two functional neural pathways. The experiments <bold>convincingly</bold> support the claims. The finding extends previous investigations about the connections between these two brain areas, and are <bold>important</bold> for elucidating the role of the cerebellum in influencing functions supported by the nucleus accumbens, such as motivation and reward.</p>

<p>This is a well-written manuscript, aiming to seek experimental evidence to establish anatomical and functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The authors combined anatomical, neural tracing, and electrophysiological approaches with electrical stimulation and optogenetics and provided a novel and solid set of data supporting the existence of disynaptic connections between the cerebellum and the NAc. The results are convincing and the main conclusion is supported by the data. Overall, this was a well-conceived project, and the experiments were conducted carefully, though some gaps remain to be filled. The knowledge generated from this manuscript will build a foundation for further research focusing on the interaction between cerebellum and limbic system as well as the role of such interaction in controlling motivated behavior.</p>

<p>It is increasingly recognized that the cerebellum is involved in a wide range of cognitive and behavioral processes beyond motor coordination and motor learning. This work contributes to the recent body of work showing functional connections between the cerebellum and many other brain regions. This study uses a combination of in vivo electrophysiology, viral tracing, and optogenetics to identify pathways from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) to the nucleus accumbens (NA) core and medial shell running through &quot;nodes&quot; in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and centromedial and parfascicular nuclei of the thalamus. The significance of this work is in providing function data and anatomical pathways that may underlie the role of the cerebellum in reward behavior.</p>
<p>This work makes two significant contributions to the field. First, the authors show that electrical stimulation in the DCN (the output of the cerebellar circuit) elicits (primarily excitatory) responses in neurons of the NA core and medial shell. Previous studies have shown that stimulation in the cerebellum increases dopamine in the NA, but this study is the first to use in vivo electrophysiology to measure changes in neuronal firing rates. Responses in NA neurons are primarily excitatory, with a small number of neurons showing inhibitory or mixed excitatory/inhibitory responses. The data here are clear and support the conclusions. The only caveat, acknowledged by the authors, is the use of ketamine/xylazine to anesthetize the mice may alter the firing properties of NA neurons and the balance of excitation and inhibition in neuronal responses. The specific mechanisms (neurotransmitters, synapses, or circuits) resulting in excitation or inhibition of NA neurons are not investigated here, though this may be an interesting avenue of future work.</p>
<p>The second significant contribution of this work is identifying anatomical pathways that connect DCN to the NA. The identification of these pathways is well supported by the viral injection data. The data using cre-expressing AAV in the DCN and floxed td-tomato AAV in the VTA or thalamus is particularly convincing. However, the inclusion of additional controls would strengthen the conclusions (see below).</p>
<p>In general, the conclusions are well-supported by the data. However, in a few places inadequate controls or description of the experiments weakens the conclusions.</p>
<p>1. In Figure 4, the authors injected a retrograde tracer in the NA and an anterograde tracer in DCN to find potential &quot;nodes&quot; of overlap. From this experiment, the authors identify the VTA and regions of the thalamus as potential areas of tracer overlap, but it is unclear how many other brain regions were examined. Did the authors jump straight to likely locations of overlap based on previous findings, or were large swaths of the brain examined systematically? If other brain regions were examined, which regions and how was this done? A table listing which brain regions were examined and the presence/intensity of ctb-Alexa568 and GFP fluorescence would be helpful.</p>
<p>
2. In Figure 5, the authors inject AAV1-Cre in DCN and AAV-FLEX-tdTomato in VTA or thalamus. This is an interesting experiment, but controls are missing. An important control is to inject AAV-FLEX-tdTomato in the VTA or thalamus in the absence of AAV1-Cre injection in DCN. Cre-independent expression of tdTomato should be assessed in the VTA/thalamus and the NA.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, D'Ambra and colleagues report the effects of stimulating the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) on neurons in the core and the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Electrical stimulation results in both excitation and inhibition, with excitation preceding the inhibition. In general, neurons that underwent excitation had lower baseline activity than neurons that underwent inhibition. They observed no relationship between the location of the stimulation site within the DCN, and the type of response observed in the NAc. In order to identify disynaptic connections between the two areas, the authors combined the injection of a retrograde tracer in the NAc with an anterograde tracer in the DCN. These experiments led them to describe co-localization of the anterograde and retrograde signals within two regions, the intralaminar thalamus (IL), and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In order to confirm these results, they then used an anterograde transsynaptic viral tracing strategy to mark neurons in the IL and the VTA that project to the NAc. In addition, by injecting an excitatory opsin into the DCN, and stimulating these axons within the VTA and the IL, the authors were able to demonstrate increased activity in the NAc and describe the latency of these responses. Thus, using a series of rigorous and complementary experiments, the authors provide evidence for a disynaptic connection between the DCN and the NAc, via the VTA and the IL.</p>
<p>Novelty and relationship to previous studies: The presence of a disynaptic connection between the DCN and the NAc has previously been shown, as has the projection from the DCN to the parafascicular nucleus of the intralaminar thalamus (Fujita et al. 2020); however, the intermediary nodes of the disynaptic connection between the DCN and NAc have not previously been mapped. Some other pieces of these results have also been shown previously: DCN to VTA: Watabe-Uchida et al. 2012, DCN-VTA-NAc Beier et al. 2015, Xiao and Schieffele 2018) Interestingly, the Beier et al. paper suggests that the connection from DCN-VTA-NAc is an extremely small proportion of the total inputs to the NAc. In contrast to the Fujita et al. paper, here the authors also stimulate or trace projections from the two other deep cerebellar nuclei, the lateral and the interposed (this is relevant for a comment below). In addition, previous studies have shown a projection from the DCN to the IL and, separately, from the IL to the NAc. Thus, the existence of the pathways described here is in line with previous work. Moreover, this study expands on previous ones through its electrophysiological measurement and description of neural responses to stimulation of DCN and DCN projections.</p>
<p>Strengths: The strengths of this paper include the authors' use of multiple techniques to confirm the presence of the connections that they describe. Any one of the experiments using electrical stimulation, combining anterograde and retrograde tracing, transsynaptic tracing, or optical stimulation of DCN axons in the IL and VTA has its own caveats. However, the combination of these techniques nullifies many of these caveats.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: While this is an interesting and exciting paper, there are a few weaknesses, listed below:</p>
<p>- The novelty of this paper lies in the mapping of projections from the interposed and the lateral nuclei of the cerebellum, as the authors themselves mention. However, in some of the experiments the medial nucleus is also clearly injected (Fig. 4B and 6B). In those experiments, it is impossible to distinguish which nucleus these projections come from, and they could be the ones from the medial nucleus that were previously described (see above).</p>
<p>
- A strength of the paper is the use of both electrical and optogenetic stimulation. However, the responses to the two in the NAc are very different - electrical stimulation results in both excitation and inhibition, whereas opto stimulation mostly results in only excitation.</p>
<p>
- The stimulation frequency at which the electrical stimulation in Fig 1 is done to identify responses in the NAc is 200 Hz for 25 ms. Is this physiological? In addition, responses in the NAc are measured for 500 ms after, which is a very long response time.</p>
<p>
- Previous studies have described how different cell types within the DCN have different downstream projections (Fujita et al. 2020). However, the experiments here bundle together all this known heterogeneity.</p>
<p>
- Previous studies have also highlighted the importance of different cell types within the NAc and how input streams are differentially targeted to them. Here, that heterogeneity is also obscured.</p>
<p>
- In Fig. 4C, E and F, the experiments on overlap between anterograde and retrograde tracers are not particularly convincing - it's hard to see the overlap.</p>

<p>1. In Figure 4, the authors injected a retrograde tracer in the NA and an anterograde tracer in DCN to find potential &quot;nodes&quot; of overlap. From this experiment, the authors identify the VTA and regions of the thalamus as potential areas of tracer overlap, but it is unclear how many other brain regions were examined. Did the authors jump straight to likely locations of overlap based on previous findings, or were large swaths of the brain examined systematically? If other brain regions were examined, which regions and how was this done? A table listing which brain regions were examined and the presence/intensity of ctb-Alexa568 and GFP fluorescence would be helpful.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for their comments. Exhaustive characterizations of inputs into nucleus accumbens (NAc) as well as of direct outputs of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) have appeared elsewhere (e.g, Ma et al., 2020 doi: 10.3389/fnsys.2020.00015; Novello et al., 2022 doi: 10.1007/s12311-022-01499-w). Our anatomical investigations with retrograde and anterograde tracers were focused on putative intermediary nodal regions with robust inputs from the DCN, clear outputs to NAc, and limbic functionality. Only a handful of brain regions fulfill these criteria, and from those, we chose to target the VTA and intralaminar thalamus based on the observation that cerebellar activation induces dopamine release in the NAc medial shell and core (Holloway et al., 2019 doi: 10.1007/s12311-019-01074-w; Low et al., 2021 10.1038/s41586-021-04143-5) and on our previous work on DCN projections to the midline thalamus (Jung et al., 2022 doi: 10.3389/fnsys.2022.879634).</p>

<p>1. In Figure 5, the authors inject AAV1-Cre in DCN and AAV-FLEX-tdTomato in VTA or thalamus. This is an interesting experiment, but controls are missing. An important control is to inject AAV-FLEX-tdTomato in the VTA or thalamus in the absence of AAV1-Cre injection in DCN. Cre-independent expression of tdTomato should be assessed in the VTA/thalamus and the NA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important control. We routinely perform this control experiment to test for any “leakiness” of floxed vectors prior to use but we did not include it in the paper. In response to the Reviewer’s comment, we show results from this control below. Briefly, we performed a large injection (300 nl) of AAV-FLEX-tdTomato in the thalamus area together with AAV-EGFP (to visualize the injection). No Cre-expressing virus was injected anywhere in the brain. PFA-fixed brain slices were obtained at 3 weeks post-injection and imaged for EGFP and tdTomato. Author Response Figure 1 shows images of the injected thalamus area. No tdTomato expression (Fig. 1C, red) was observed despite abundant EGFP expression (Fig. 1B, green), which confirms that in the absence of Cre the floxed construct does not “leak”.</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for their comments. As stated in the Results and in the legend of Fig. 4, in addition to experiments with injections in all DCN (Fig. 4B-D), we also performed experiments with injections in only the lateral nucleus (Fig. 4E and F). The results of these experiments support the existence of lateral DCN projections that overlap with NAc-projecting neurons in VTA and thalamus. This finding is further corroborated by our transsynaptic experiments with lateral DCN-only injections (Fig. 5E,F). Regarding the optophysiological experiments, as mentioned in the Results, all DCN were injected (Fig. 6B) in order to maximize ChR2 expression and the chances of successful stimulation of projections.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. At least two different explanations could account for the observed differences in the prevalence of inhibitory responses elicited by optogenetic vs electrical stimulation: i) inhibitory response prevalence is sensitive to stimulation intensity (Table 1 and Fig. 2B). Because of inherent differences between optogenetic and electrical stimulation, it is not possible to directly compare intensities between the two modalities in order to determine at which intensities, if at all, the prevalence of responses should match. The observation that, at least in the VTA, the prevalence of inhibitory responses elicited by 1 mW light intensity (the lowest intensity that we tested) was comparable to the prevalence of inhibitory responses elicited by 100 µA electrical stimulation is in line with this explanation; ii) DCN electrical stimulation is not node-specific. To our knowledge, there is currently no evidence to support mesoscale topographic organization in lateral and interposed DCN that is node-specific. Consequently, electrical stimulation of DCN could, in principle, result in NAc responses through various polysynaptic pathways and/or nodes. This possibility would still exist even if electrical stimulation had limited spread of a few hundred microns (as in our experiments) and is at least partly supported by the observed long latencies of electrically-evoked inhibitory responses (NAcCore: 268 ± 25 ms (10th percentile: 42 ms), NAcMed: 259 ± 14 ms (10th percentile: 60 ms). Our recognition of this intrinsic limitation of DCN electrical stimulation was the impetus behind the node-specific optogenetic experiments.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Regarding stimulation frequency, DCN neurons readily reach firing rates between 100-200 Hz in vivo and ex vivo (e.g., Beekhof et al., 2021 doi.org/10.3390/cells10102686; Sarnaik &amp; Raman, 2018 doi:10.7554/eLife.29546; Canto et al., 2016 doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0165887). Regarding the duration of the response window, at the outset of our experiments we were agnostic to the type of responses that our stimulation protocols would evoke in NAc. We therefore established a response time window that would allow us to capture both fast neurotransmitter-mediated responses as well as neuromodulatory (e.g., dopaminergic) responses, which are known to occur at hundred-millisecond latencies or longer (Wang et al., 2017 doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.02.062; Chuhma et al., 2014 doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2013.12.027; Gonon, 1997). A posteriori analysis indicated that even if we reduced the response time window by 50%, the ratio of DCN-evoked excitatory vs inhibitory responses in NAc would not change substantially (E/I500: 4.3 vs E/I250: 5).</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the Reviewer that dissecting the contributions of specific DCN cell types to NAc circuits is an important next step, which we are excited to undertake in future studies. Here we have broken new ground by identifying for the first time nodes and functional properties of DCN-NAc connectivity. Performing these studies with DCN cell type-specificity was not justified or feasible, given that the molecular identity of participating DCN neurons is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Along the same lines as #4, we agree with the Reviewer about the importance of examining the cellular identity of NAc neurons that participate in DCN-NAc circuitry. We are excited to undertake these examinations using ex vivo approaches, which are well suited to dissect cellular and molecular mechanisms.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have included revised figure panels 4C5, E3, Author Response Figure 1 and Figure 2 below. Single optical sections with altered color scheme and orthogonal confocal views are presented in order to show the overlap between DCN projections and NAc-projecting nodal neurons more clearly. The findings of these imaging experiments are corroborated by the results of our transsynaptic labeling approach (Fig. 5), which we have validated elsewhere (Jung et al., 2022 doi:10.3389/fnsys.2022.879634; and Author Response Figure 1).</p>
