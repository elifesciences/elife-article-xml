<abstract>
<title>Summary</title><p>We present near-atomic-resolution cryo-EM structures of the mammalian voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.2 in open, C-type inactivated, toxin-blocked and sodium-bound states at 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 3.2 Å, and 2.9Å. These structures, all obtained at nominally zero membrane potential in detergent micelles, reveal distinct ion-occupancy patterns in the selectivity filter. The first two structures are very similar to those reported in the related Shaker channel and the much-studied Kv1.2-2.1 chimeric channel. On the other hand, two new structures show unexpected patterns of ion occupancy. First, the toxin α-Dendrotoxin, like Charybdotoxin, is seen to attach to the negatively-charged channel outer mouth, and a lysine residue penetrates into the selectivity filter, with the terminal amine coordinated by carbonyls, partially disrupting the outermost ion-binding site. In the remainder of the filter two densities of bound ions are observed, rather than three as observed with other toxin-blocked Kv channels. Second, a structure of Kv1.2 in Na<sup>+</sup> solution does not show collapse or destabilization of the selectivity filter, but instead shows an intact selectivity filter with ion density in each binding site. We also attempted to image the C-type inactivated Kv1.2 W366F channel in Na<sup>+</sup> solution, but the protein conformation was seen to be highly variable and only a low-resolution structure could be obtained. These findings present new insights into the stability of the selectivity filter and the mechanism of toxin block of this intensively studied, voltage-gated potassium channel.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Among the most-studied ion channel proteins is the Kv1 family of tetrameric, six-transmembrane-segment, voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. The best-known member of this family is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaker channel, first cloned in the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Iverson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Papazian et al., 1987</xref>) and which quickly became the favorite object for biophysical studies due to its small size and ease of heterologous expression. The potassium current in the squid giant axon described by Hodgkin and Huxley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hodgkin &amp; Huxley, 1952</xref>) is carried by a closely related Shaker homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rosenthal &amp; Bezanilla, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2005 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al. (2005)</xref> obtained the 2.9 Å crystal structure of Kv1.2, a mammalian Shaker-family channel. This structure showed clearly the overall architecture of the channel, but unfortunately the densities were weak in the all-important voltage-sensor domains (VSDs). Two years later Long et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Long et al., 2007</xref>) presented the 2.4Å X-ray structure of the “paddle chimera” Kv1.2-2.1 channel in which a portion of the voltage-sensor domain (the S3-S4 paddle) was replaced by the corresponding Kv2.1 sequence. This structure presented the VSDs in fine detail, and so was a watershed in the structural understanding of the many functional measurements of Shaker channels. It has also formed the basis of computational studies of voltage-sensing and gating mechanisms. A subsequent cryo-EM structure of Kv1.2-2.1 channels reconstituted into nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matthies et al., 2018</xref>) has excellent agreement with the X-ray structure. Meanwhile, a very welcome recent development is the cryo-EM structure of the original Shaker channel itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The high-resolution structure of the Kv1.2 paddle chimera channel has been the basis for much research, but the native Kv1.2 channel has been used for more functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ishida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suarez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). The properties of the native and chimeric channels are similar but not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tao &amp; MacKinnon, 2008</xref>). The chimeric channel has 27 amino-acid differences in the S3-S4 paddle region, but the VSD structures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al. (2005</xref> and 2007) are remarkably similar; in the transmembrane region the !-carbon traces are nearly superimposable. Our structure of Kv1.2 confirms this remarkable structural conservation.</p>
<p>Inactivation is an important process that diminishes voltage-gated channel current even when the activating membrane depolarization is maintained. A relatively slow inactivation process, usually called C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>) involves conformational changes in the pore domain and the selectivity filter. Various mutations in the pore domain have been shown to accelerate or impede C-type inactivation. The Shaker pore-domain mutation W434F renders the channel almost completely non-conductive through a process like C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pless et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suarez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). Structures of this mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) and of a corresponding mutant Kv1.2-2.1 paddle-chimera channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) show a dramatic dilation of the selectivity filter that disrupts two of the four ion-binding sites in the selectivity filter. We report here the structure of the corresponding W366F mutant in the Kv1.2 channel background, which shows a nearly identical dilation.</p>
<p>An important aspect of C-type inactivation is that it is enhanced when potassium ions are absent. In KcsA the replacement of most K<sup>+</sup> with Na<sup>+</sup> results in a collapse of the selectivity filter region, occluding the two central ion-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>). Other channels including NaK2K and members of the K2P family show a destabilization of the external part of the pore at low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, abolishing the two outer ion-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lolicato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matamoros et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). In low potassium the NaK2K channel actually shows a dilation of the outer selectivity filter very similar to that seen in Shaker-W434F and the corresponding K1.2-2.1 mutant. On the other hand, a lengthy molecular-dynamics simulation of deactivation in the Kv1.2-2.1 chimera channel in symmetrical K<sup>+</sup> solutions showed that, with the closing of the channel gate, there is a complete loss of water and ions from the cavity below the selectivity filter. Under these conditions however the selectivity filter remains intact and is populated by K<sup>+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>); M. Ø. Jensen, personal communication). In view of the variety of effects of low K<sup>+</sup>, in our current study we sought to observe experimentally the structure of the Kv1.2 channel when potassium ions are absent.</p>
<p>Finally, Kv channels are targets for many toxins that inhibit channel conductance, with a common mechanism being occlusion of the pore. This occlusion has been seen directly in two cases. Crystal structures of the Kv1.2 paddle-chimera channel have been obtained with charybdotoxin (CTx) bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>), and cryo-EM structures of Kv1.3 with the ShK toxin bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selvakumar et al. 2022</xref>). In the present work we consider dendrotoxins (DTxs) produced by the mamba snake <italic>Delodiaspis</italic>. These are distinct from CTx but also block Kv channels with high potency and selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gasparini et al., 1998</xref>). In this study we have determined the structure of Kv1.2 with α-DTX bound.</p>

<title>Overview of mammalian Kv1.2 structure</title>
<p>For this study we employed a full-length Kv1.2 α-subunit construct containing three mutations in disordered regions of the N-terminus and S1-S2 linker. We denote this construct used for structure determination Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>. We co-expressed a construct of of Kvβ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gulbis et al., 1999</xref>) containing residues 36 to 367. Each β2-subunit contained five mutations chosen to neutralize positive charges on the cytoplasmic face of the subunit; these remove strong, interfering interactions with cryo-EM carbon substrates. We find that the mutations have no effect on β-subunit secondary structure. Although α and β subunits were co-expressed, in cryo-EM micrographs we observed many α<sub>4</sub> complexes along with the expected α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>4</sub> particles. As the structures of the transmembrane regions of these two populations of channels were indistinguishable, we combined the two particle sets. This is reasonable as the presence of β2 subunits has very little effect on the structure of the α-subunit T1 domains to which they bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gulbis et al., 2000</xref>) and also little effect on channel function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rettig et al., 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The constructs encoding the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> or Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W366F mutant α-subunits, along with the β2 subunits, were expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Channel complexes were affinity-purified in the presence of dodecylmaltoside detergent and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in buffers containing either 150 mM K<sup>+</sup> or 150 mM Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The channel complexes were plunge-frozen on grids for cryo-EM analysis. Focusing on the transmembrane region of the Kv1.2 channel complexes, we obtained structures of nominally open, C-type inactivated, DTx-bound, and K<sup>+</sup> free states at resolutions of 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 3.2 Å and 2.9 Å respectively. Most main-chain and sidechain densities were clearly visible in the resulting maps allowing atomic models to be built with high confidence.</p>
<p>Structures of the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> channel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) are very similar to those of the Kv1.2-2.1 chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Long et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) channels. As observed in other Kv1 and Kv2 structures, the voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) contain the membrane-spanning S1-S4 helixes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D and E</xref>) while the S5, S6, pore helix and selectivity filter P-loop form the ion-conduction pore in a domain-swapped configuration. Densities of lipids bound to the VSDs and pore domains (PDs) are clearly visible in the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> maps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>In the critical region of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD) the sidechains of the voltage-sensing Arg and the coordinating Glu and Asp residues, as well as the charge-transfer center phenylalanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tao et al., 2010</xref>) are essentially superimposable with Shaker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), with an RMS difference of all Arg sidechain atoms of 0.85 Å. As Kv1.2 is a member of the Shaker potassium channel family and has 68% amino-acid identity with <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaker, it is not surprising that the fold is very similar.</p>
<p>As in the other homologues an open S6 gate is visible in the detergent-solubilized Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> structure; this is expected for the open conformation at zero membrane potential. Seeing no evidence of a barrier to ion flux, we call this the open-channel structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite the very closely matched open-state structures of the VSDs it is therefore puzzling that the total gating charge movement in Shaker channels is larger, about 13 elementary charges per channel, while it is only 10 e<sub>0</sub> per channel in Kv1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Islas, 2016</xref>). The most likely explanation is that in Kv1.2 there is some additional restraint, lacking in Shaker, on the physical displacement of each S4 helix.</p>
<p>In the paddle chimera a region including the N-terminal half of the S4 helix in Kv1.2 is replaced by the corresponding Kv2.1 sequence. One difference in the voltage-sensing residues is that a glutamine replaces the arginine at the first position (R1) in the chimera. Another difference is that there is an earlier Arg residue R0 that replaces leucine, but is unlikely to contribute to charge movement. A direct measurement of charge movement in the paddle chimera is lacking, but macroscopic activation and inactivation show lower voltage sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tao &amp; MacKinnon, 2008</xref>) as if its gating charge movement were reduced. Nevertheless, as was observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Long et al. (2007)</xref>, the structures of the S4 regions are very similar: comparing Kv1.2 with the paddle chimera (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) the rms deviation of Arg sidechain atoms is less than 0.75 Å.</p>

While the corresponding mutation W434F in Shaker essentially abolishes ion current through the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>) the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> mutant allows currents to flow transiently on depolarization, but decay to less than 3% of the peak within 80 ms (<xref rid="figs2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Inactivation in these channels can be slowed by raising extracellular K<sup>+</sup> or by applying tetraethylammonium ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suarez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>), properties that are hallmarks of C-type inactivation. Here we shall call the cryo-EM structure of Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W366F the “inactivated channel” structure, keeping in mind that other distinct inactivated channel conformations are likely to exist. The overall conformational difference between open and inactivated structures in Kv1.2s is identical to the difference observed in structures of Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) and in structures of Kv1.2-2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Long et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>For detailed comparison with structures of other voltage-gated potassium channels, we borrow from Miller (1990) the numbering of the 39 residues in the S5-S6 linking region, which we will denote as residue numbers 1’ to 39’. (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The 39-residue numbering is appropriate for Kv1 through Kv4 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shealy et al., 2003</xref>) and is fortuitously convenient in comparisons with KcsA, because it differs numerically by exactly 50 from the residue numbering of KcsA. In the Miller system for example the Kv1.2 W366 residue is W17’, and we can denote the W366F mutant channel as Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W17’F. In KcsA the W17’ residue is W67.</p>
<p>The selectivity filter of potassium channels consists of an array of four copies of the extended loop (the P-loop) formed by a highly conserved sequence, in this case TTVGYGD. The main-chain carbonyl oxygens of the residues TVGY, positions 25’ to 28’, delineate ion binding sites S3, S2 and S1, respectively, while the lower (most intracellular) edge of binding-site S4 is formed by the T25’ hydroxyl. Hydrogen bonds involving two P-loop residues anchor the outer half of the selectivity filter and are particularly important in inactivation mechanisms (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, right panels) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pless et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). Normally, the tyrosine Y28’ (Y377 in Kv1.2) is constrained by hydrogen bonds to residues in the pore helix and helix S6 and is key to the conformation of the selectivity filter. The final aspartate of the P-loop, D30’ (D379 in Kv1.2) is normally located near the extracellular surface and has a side chain that also participates in H-bonds with W17’ (W366 in Kv1.2) on the pore helix.</p>
<p>The difference between the open and inactivated Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> structures, like the open-inactivated state differences in Kv1.2-2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) and in Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) can be imagined as resulting from a two-step process. The first step is a partial twist of the P-loop backbone involving D30’. When W17’ is mutated to phenylalanine, it is no longer an H-bond donor to D30’ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> right upper panel). The resulting destabilization of D30’ allows it to reorient toward the external water-filled vestibule.</p>
<p>The second step is the reorientation of Y28’ and further twisting of the polypeptide backbone. Y28’ normally participates in H-bonds with the pore-helix residues W18’ and S22’ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, right-hand panels), but with the release of D30’, and presumably the entry of water molecules into the space surrounding the P-loop, the side chain of Y28’ also reorients toward the external solution, filling some of the original volume occupied by the side chain of D30’. The reorientation of the phenol group of Y28’ is through a very large pitch angle of about 120° (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G,H</xref>,I). The reorientations of the D30’ and Y28’ side chains drag and twist the backbone. The result is an enlargement of the ion-binding site IS2 to a width of 5.1Å between opposing carbonyl oxygens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) and an even wider (11 Å) cavity is formed at the level of IS1. There are no clear ion densities in the upper selectivity filter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the lower binding sites IS3 and IS4 show relatively small disturbances in the inactivated state. The largest change is a rise of 1.3Å in the position of the G27’ carbonyl, the one which defines the top of IS3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). As in the inactivated Shaker structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) strong ion densities are seen in IS3 and IS4.</p>
<p>Might symmetry-breaking accompany Kv1.2 inactivation? MD simulations of inactivated paddle chimera, KcsA and hERG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kondo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li, Shen, Reddy, et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Li, Shen, Rohaim, et al., 2021</xref>), all homotetramers, show a change to two-fold symmetry in the pore region such that the selectivity filter has distinct conformations for each pair of opposing subunits. However, we were not able to detect any evidence of reduced symmetry in the inactivated Kv1.2 channel. We were able to build the atomic model unambiguously into the 2.5 Å map that was obtained with C4 symmetry imposed. Further, there was no evidence of broken symmetry when using symmetry expansion and local C1 refinements of the cryo-EM dataset.</p>
<p>A comparison of our open-channel and inactivated Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> structures show subtle but noticeable differences in the VSDs. Salt bridges involving the S4 Arg and Lys residues are shifted slightly (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-D</xref>). Arg300 (R3) is in close proximity to Glu226 on the S2 helix for the open channel, while R3 is closer to Glu183 in the S2 helix. The Glu226 side chain adopts a visible interaction with R4 in the inactivated state. In both open and inactivated states of Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>, K5 interacts more closely with S2 Phe233 than is the case in the paddle chimera channel (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Functional interactions have been observed between residues in the voltage-sensing domains and pore residues involved in C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bassetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>). Leucine and valine residues on the S4 helix interface with serine and leucine residues on S5, which in turn contact F16’ and W17’ on the pore helix. We see very little relative movement of the residues at the S4-S5 interface, much less than 1Å difference between open and inactivated structures.</p>
<p>When individual VSD domains are aligned the VSD helices in Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> and the inactivated Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W17’F superimpose very well at the top (including the S4-S5 interface described above), there is a general twist of the VSD helix bundle that yields an overall rotation of about 3° at the bottom of the bundle (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E-F</xref>). In moving to the inactivated state, the axes of the helices S0, S1 and S2 tilt by 6°, 4° and 3.2° in a clockwise direction as viewed from the cytoplasmic side, while S4 is stationary. This lower VSD rotation provides a good explanation of the shifts in the S2 residues Glu183 and Glu226 that interact with R2 and R3 (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A-D</xref>). In contrast to Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>, neither Shaker and Kv1.2-2.1 structures show this rotation between open and inactivated states (<xref rid="figs2-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G-H</xref>) but instead the VSDs remain superimposable.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the difference between Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> and the others in conformational changes might arise from the variety of systems used for structure determination, which include DDM micelles, MSP-bounded nanodiscs, and crystals grown in different laboratories (but under very similar conditions and having the same space group). In the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> case for example, the DDM detergent micelles might allow the VSDs to be particularly mobile.</p>

<title>A dendrotoxin blocks Kv1.2 by inserting a lysine into the pore</title>
<p>Dendrotoxins are peptide neurotoxins from mamba snakes that bind with nanomolar affinities and block potassium channels. Alpha-dendrotoxin (α-DTX) consists of a peptide chain of 59 amino acids stabilized by three disulfide bridges (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and, like other dendrotoxins, exhibits the same fold as Kunitz protease inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Skarzynski, 1992</xref>). In α-DTX arginine and lysine residues are concentrated near the N-terminus (Arg3, Arg4, Lys5), the C-terminus (Arg54, Arg55) and at the narrow β-turn region (Lys28, Lys29, Lys30). The Lys5 side chain protrudes from the surface of the molecule, and its modification by acetylation markedly reduces binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Harvey et al., 1997</xref>). Replacement of Lys5 by alanine or ornithine decreased the affinity for potassium channels by 1000-fold and 100-fold, respectively, suggesting that the sidechain geometry is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gasparini et al., 1998</xref>). The Lys5 sidechain therefore has been the prime candidate for the pore-blocking moiety.</p>

</fig>
<p>By adding an excess of α-DTx to detergent-solubilized Kv1.2 protein we obtained a dataset of about 300,000 particles where an additional cap of density can be seen outside the pore (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). In 3D classification only a small fraction (&lt;1%) of toxin-free particles was detected, and this class was removed before further processing. The processing of particle images is summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> – figure supplement 1. Refined structures with imposition of four-fold symmetry (C4) or with no symmetry (C1), yielded resolutions 2.8 and 3.2 Å respectively. In the C4 reconstruction the additional cap of density from the toxin was not interpretable, as it arises from the four-fold superposition of the asymmetric toxin bound in alternative poses to the symmetric channel. Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) have demonstrated however that small asymmetric ligands can be distinguished in large single-particle datasets by focused classification and refinement. Similarly we used symmetry expansion, a reference mask covering only the toxin and upper selectivity filter, and a set of four asymmetric starting references to obtain, through 3D classification without alignment in the Relion software, a C1 reconstruction. The refined C1 density map and model are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, D. Due to the C4 symmetry of Kv1.2, there are four equivalent DTx binding sites on the channel. The top and side views display the DTx on the negatively charged outer mouth of the Kv1.2 channel pore, with the density map fitted to the atomic model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>The X-ray structure of α-DTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Skarzynski, 1992</xref>) could be docked with minor adjustments into the map, with the Lys5 sidechain extending into the channel pore. The positively-charged toxin is tethered to the negatively-charged outer mouth of the pore by three salt bridges: toxin residues K30, R15 and R3 bind to three channel residues D355, D363 and D363 (D6’, D14’ and D14’ in the turret and pore helix). Each of the three channel residues is located on a different subunit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, H).</p>
<p>In the selectivity filter of the toxin-bound channel (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) a continuous density is seen to extend downward from the toxin to the boundary of IS1. This density is well modeled by the side chain of Lys5, with the terminal amine coordinated by the carbonyls of Y377 (Y28’). We conclude that block by α-DTx is occlusion of the selectivity filter through binding of the Lys5 terminal amine. In the selectivity filter a large density peak, presumably a K<sup>+</sup> ion, is seen in a somewhat offset IS1 binding site; a second, larger K<sup>+</sup> ion peak is seen in IS3.</p>
<p>Like the nearby Lys5 residue, substitution of alanine for Leu9 also results in a 1000-fold reduction in toxin affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gasparini et al., 1998</xref>). In the structure, however, the Leu9 sidechain does not show contacts with either the channel or other residues in the toxin itself. It is therefore not obvious why it is important in toxin binding.</p>
<p>We also tried mixing an excess of α-DTX with the Kv1.2s W366F protein sample in an attempt to observe a pore-blocker-bound inactivated structure. However, we found no evidence of bound toxin density on the channel in the cryo-EM 2D classes. This is no surprise in view of the large rearrangement of the extracellular pore entrance in the inactivated state, where the IS1 and IS2 sites are abolished and the corresponding carbonyls point away from the pore axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), eliminating the site of binding of the lysine side chain. It should be noted however that in the case of a ShK toxin derivative binding to the Kv1.3 channel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tyagi et al. (2022)</xref> observed that binding occurs to inactivated channels. In that case the inactivated state has a less drastically remodeled selectivity filter, and binding of the toxin restores the selectivity filter to its conducting configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tyagi et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>The Kv1.2 selectivity filter in nominally K<sup>+</sup>-free medium</title>
<p>The X-ray crystal structure of the KcsA channel in low K<sup>+</sup> solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>) shows a collapsed selectivity filter, in which the residues V26’ and G27’ are rearranged, abolishing the binding sites IS2 and IS3. In low K<sup>+</sup> other channels including KirBac2.2 and K2p10.1 show large conformational fluctuations of the outer pore in low K+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matamoros et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and in the model potassium channel NaK2K the outer half of the selectivity filter unravels at low K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, Shaker channels are seen to conduct Na<sup>+</sup> in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melishchuk et al., 1998</xref>). Thus it is of interest to observe the structure of Kv1.2 under this condition.</p>
<p>We obtained the structure of Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> in a nominally zero K<sup>+</sup> solution, with potassium replaced with sodium in all buffers from affinity purification to size-exclusion chromatography (see Methods). We were surprised to find that it is little changed from the K<sup>+</sup> bound structure, with an essentially identical selectivity filter conformation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref rid="figs4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unfortunately, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions cannot be distinguished in the density maps, and we therefore cannot rule out the possibility that peaks in the selectivity filter region might come from contaminating K<sup>+</sup> ions. Like Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> in the usual potassium solution, the major density peaks are seen in the IS1 and IS3 ion binding sites, with somewhat lower occupancy of IS2 and IS4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B and E</xref>). Increased asymmetry in ion occupancy is expected to accompany a reduction in ion conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morais-Cabral et al. 2001</xref>).</p>

<p>We conclude that the Kv1.2s selectivity filter is stable in low K<sup>+</sup> solutions, and that the channel most likely conducts Na<sup>+</sup> in the absence of potassium; both of these features have been observed in the NaK2K channel (Sauer et al., 2013), where the electron density profile in the selectivity filter in Na<sup>+</sup> is little changed when K<sup>+</sup> is added in a small amount—1 mM—that produces partial K<sup>+</sup> occupancy.

<title>Large conformational fluctuations of the W366F mutant in K<sup>+</sup>-free medium</title>
<p>We also collected cryo-EM data from the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>W17’F mutant channels, using the same procedures to replace K<sup>+</sup> with Na<sup>+</sup> during purification. The corresponding Shaker-W17’F channel stably carries large Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> currents in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Starkus et al., 1998</xref>). In 2D classification of our single-particle images we saw large variability in the structure, as if the connection between the transmembrane domain and the intracellular domains (the T1 domain and the Kvβ2 subunits) was highly flexible (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref>). The intracellular domains were resolved to 3.0 Å resolution in a focused reconstruction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) but the complementary focused reconstruction of the transmembrane domain yielded only about 7 Å resolution.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The potassium channel signature sequence TTVGYGD was first identified by Heginbotham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heginbotham et al., 1994</xref>) as critical for potassium selectivity. The residues fold as an extended loop (the P-loop) and is part of the P-region, about 20 residues of conserved sequence located between the S5 and S6 helices. We use here a system of numbering the entire linking region between S5 and S6, as identified in Shaker by Miller (Miller, 1990). The P-loop (residues 24’-30’ in this numbering, TTVGYGD) forms four ion binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>) through which K<sup>+</sup> ions and water molecules can pass sequentially in a knock-on fashion. The geometry and flexibility is finely tuned to allow high K<sup>+</sup> selectivity with a high transport rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Noskov &amp; Roux, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Roux, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In this paper we have considered the ion occupancy and conformation of the P-region under four conditions: the conducting state, a C-type inactivated state, the channel blocked by dendrotoxin, and in the absence of permeant ions. In the conducting state, the cryo-EM structure of our rat Kv1.2 construct (Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>) in DDM detergent micelles agrees with the crystal structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al. (2005)</xref> and is very similar to the structure of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Shaker in lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). Also, apart from local differences in the chimeric region of the voltage sensor domains (VSDs), we confirm the observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Long et al., 2007</xref>) that the rat Kv1.2 structure is essentially identical to the structure of the rat Kv1.2-2.1 paddle chimera as obtained from X-ray crystallography. In turn, the structure from cryo-EM imaging of Kv1.2-2.1 channels in lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matthies et al., 2018</xref>) is also nearly identical to the X-ray structure. Thus the conformation of the entire transmembrane region of the Kv1.2 channel and its variants appears to be remarkably insensitive to its environment, whether lipid or detergent.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Inactivation</title>
<p>After the opening of the intracellular activation gate formed by the S6 helices, C-type inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hoshi et al., 1991</xref>) causes channel currents to switch off spontaneously. The inactivation process is very sensitive to mutations in the selectivity filter and nearby residues of the P-region and is influenced by the state of the S6 gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cuello et al., 2017</xref>; Li, Shen, Rohaim, et al., 2021) and the VSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bassetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>). Low K<sup>+</sup> concentrations, especially in the extracellular solution, accelerate inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Levy &amp; Deutsch, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Is C-type inactivation a reflection of selectivity filter instability? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sauer et al. (2011)</xref> investigated the structural stability of a channel selectivity filter, using a model system based on the NaK prokaryotic nonselective channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2006</xref>). NaK’s selectivity filter (P-loop sequence TVGDGN) has only two ion binding sites, and opens into a wide extracellular vestibule. A similarly wide vestibule is seen in the nonselective HCN1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee &amp; MacKinnon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Shi et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). NaK can however be converted to a highly K<sup>+</sup> selective channel, termed NaK2K, through just the two mutations D28’Y and N30’D, yielding the P-loop sequence TVGYGD. NaK2K has the four-site selectivity filter seen in all K<sup>+</sup>-selective channels, and the residues Y28’ and D30’ participate in a hydrogen-bonded network to stabilize the selectivity filter just as in KcsA channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>). Y28’ also participates in hydrophobic packing interaction. The removal of any of these interactions results in a loss of selectivity, and unraveling of the selectivity filter, returning to the large vestibule seen in NaK channels. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sauer et al. (2011)</xref> conclude that the standard four-ion-site, K<sup>+</sup> selective configuration of potassium channel selectivity filters is an energetically unfavorable, strained backbone conformation, and the weakening of the specific interactions that hold it in place lead to its unraveling, producing a lower-energy configuration that yields a nonselective conduction path. Similarly, the removal of K<sup>+</sup> ions from NaK2K destabilizes the selectivity filter, resulting in large fluctuations of the outer pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matamoros et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>The H-bond interactions involving Y28’ and D30’ are also key to C-type inactivation in Shaker channels. Weakening those interactions produce channels that inactivate quickly or are found permanently inactivated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pless et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore no surprise that the loosening of H-bond restraints, resulting in the unraveling of the selectivity filter, yields a preferred, low-energy conformation with a large extracellular vestibule for the inactivated state of Kv channels.</p>
<p>In the case of Kv1.2, structural and molecular-dynamics studies have focused on the mutation W17’F (W366F in Kv1.2) which induces an inactivation-like process that is slowed in the presence of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> ions or pore blockers. In Shaker this mutation (W434F) causes the near total loss of open-channel current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Perozo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>); in Kv1.2 it greatly accelerates inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suarez-Delgado et al., 2020</xref>). A large expansion of the outer selectivity filter in W17’F mutants is seen in structures of Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>), Kv1.2-2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) and also in Kv1.2 as reported here. Quantified as the distance between the diagonally-positioned Y28’ alpha-carbons, the expansion in Shaker is from 8.6 to 12.8 Å. In both the Kv1.2-2.1 paddle chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>) and in Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> the expansion is approximately from 7.2 to 10.7 Å. The expanded outer pore is very similar to the large extracellular vestibules observed in NaK and HCN1 channels (Fig. 7).</p>
<p>A striking feature of the inactivated state structure reported by Tan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Reddi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) is the high occupancy by potassium ions of the two remaining binding sites IS3 and IS4. During normal conduction, ion binding sites in the selectivity filter are usually occupied by K<sup>+</sup> and water molecules in alternation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morais-Cabral et al., 2001</xref>). However, in molecular-dynamics simulations based on their Shaker W434F structure, Tan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>) observed with high probability the simultaneous occupancy of IS3 and IS4 by two K<sup>+</sup> ions. The ions did not leave the sites during a (relatively long) 2 µs simulation with 300mV membrane potential applied, but knock-on permeation events were observed at a low rate, two events during 1µs, at the very high potential of 450 mV. A similar result was observed in earlier MD simulations of the Kv1.2-2.1 chimera where the W17’F mutation was artificially introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kondo et al., 2018</xref>). Those simulations did not show the large rearrangement of the outer pore, but they did demonstrate small shifts in the geometry of IS3 and IS4 that, like those seen by Tan et al., produced simultaneous occupancy by K<sup>+</sup> ions and blockage of ion permeation. We also see strong ion densities in the two remaining ion binding sites in the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-W17’F channel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), and a similar tight binding of adjacent K<sup>+</sup> ions seems also to block K<sup>+</sup> permeation in the structure of an inactivated Kv1.3 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In a study of the Shaker mutant W17’F, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al. (1997)</xref> observed, with symmetrical high K+ concentrations to maximize channel activity, brief (1 ms) openings of channels that occurred with a peak open probability of 10<sup>-5</sup> immediately following a large depolarization to +80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>). When open, the single-channel currents were the same magnitude as the currents in wildtype channels. It is unlikely that these currents arose from rare ion-conduction events through destabilization of the tightly-bound K<sup>+</sup> ions in the inactivated configuration, as such currents would be too small to be observed. Instead, the simplest explanation is that these currents arise when structural fluctuations transiently reconstitute the normal four-site selectivity filter, and the channel conducts normally for brief intervals. The normal selectivity filter is expected to be stabilized by bound K<sup>+</sup> ions. In the absence of external potassium ions the peak open probability drops to about 10<sup>-7</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Inactivation is voltage-dependent: it occurs less in channels held at a negative membrane potential, but is enhanced in a time-dependent manner with depolarization. This was observed for example in the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yang et al. (1997)</xref> in our recordings from Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> W17’F channels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, figure supplement 1). This voltage dependence could arise from a coupling between voltage sensors and the pore domain, which would be reflected in a difference in gating-charge movement (reporting VSD conformational changes) between wildtype and W17’F channels. There is however little difference in gating-charge movement between Shaker and Shaker W17’F channels, although Shaker with certain mutations in S4 and S6 do show differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bassetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Conti et al., 2016</xref>). A more important mechanism seems to be coupling between the S6 activation gate of the channel and the inactivation mechanism, such that steps in the physical opening of the channel would in increase the inactivation rate. Such a coupling is clearly seen in a series of KcsA X-ray structures by Cuello et al., (2010): with increased opening of inner bundle gate there is an increased steric clash between residues of the M2 helix and residues on the pore helix that could lead to inactivation. They identified a similar interface in the Kv1.2-2.1 structure, which provides a simple explanation for coupling between channel opening and inactivation processes.</p>
<p>Are the structures of the various W17’F channels valid models for C-type inactivation? In recent cryo-EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref>) the human Kv1.3 channel was found to spontaneously exist in one or two alternative conformations that appear to be inactivated states. The D1 conformation shows a large displacement of D30’ and is reminiscent of the cryo-EM structure of the Kv1.3 rapidly-inactivating mutant H20’N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). It exhibits a partially twisted P-loop (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> and <xref rid="figs6-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) as if it were an intermediate state between open and the W17’F structures. Meanwhile the D2 conformation is very similar to that of the W17’F variants considered here. This strongly supports the widely-held view that these mutant channels are in a conformation close to, if not identical to, a true C-type inactivated state.</p>
<p>Why is inactivation much more complete in the Shaker mutant W17’F than in Kv1.2 or Kv1.2-2.1? Clearly one can compare the stabilities of the conducting and the inactivated conformations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wu et al. (2022)</xref> mutated several of the residues that form important interactions in these channels, and found that the inactivation behaviors of Kv1.2 and Kv1.2-2.1 are different from that of Shaker. In the conducting state, the H-bond networks stabilizing the key residues Y28’ and D30’ in Shaker and Kv1.2 very similar, with the only obvious difference being at position 22’ where Shaker has Thr but Kv1.2 has Ser. It turns out that the mutation S22’T in the Kv1.2 background has little effect on inactivation; thus to a first approximation the conducting state is equivalently stabilized.</p>
<p>In the inactivated state structures, all obtained with the W17’F mutation, a variety of H-bond interactions arise in the linker sequence between the P-loop and the S6 helix, with the variety arising from different conformations of Loop 1 and Loop 2, two regions of the linker (<xref rid="figs6-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Details of the interactions are discussed in the Figure legend. We conclude that a quantitative evaluation of the stability of the inactivated state will require more than simply an enumeration of H-bonds in this region of the protein sequence.</p>

<title>Block of the channel by dendrotoxin</title>
<p>Potassium currents can be inhibited by five distinct families of toxins. The spider toxins Hanatoxin, SGTx1 and VSTx1 interact with the voltage sensors of Kv channels to inhibit voltage-dependent channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lee &amp; MacKinnon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Other toxins bind directly to the extracellular mouth of the channel to block current. The cone-snail toxin Cs1 binds to the extracellular surface of Kv channels and is thought to block currents by inducing a conformational change in the protein, collapsing the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Karbat et al., 2019</xref>). In X-ray crystal structures the scorpion toxin Charybdotoxin is seen to block Kv1.2-paddle chimera channels by inserting a lysine residue directly into the selectivity filter, disrupting the ion-binding site IS1 to inhibit ion flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>). The same mechanism holds for block of Kv1.3 by the sea anemone toxin ShK as studied by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selvakumar et al., 2022</xref>); in the latter two cases the lysine terminal amine interacts with the Y17’ carbonyls which form the top of binding site IS1. We now report that Kv1.2 block by the snake toxin α-Dendrotoxin (α-DTx) is by a similar mechanism.</p>
<p>Obtaining the structure of an asymmetric ligand bound to a four-fold symmetric channel, is challenging, and the four structural studies that have been done have used different strategies. In their X-ray crystallographic study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banerjee et al. (2013)</xref> were able to interpret and model at low resolution the four-fold superimposed toxin density, using heavy-atom derivatives in a series of crystal structures to establish the pose of the toxin molecule. The difficulty of modeling the CTx molecule precluded assigning a precise location to the Lys22 channel-blocking sidechain; nevertheless, in the 2.5 Å map of the selectivity filter are seen three well-resolved, discrete ion densities in the sites IS2, IS3 and IS4, and the authors conclude that the toxin interaction prevents ion occupancy of the IS1 site. A cryo-EM study that yielded a similar C4 symmetric reconstruction of Kv1.3 with bound dalazatide, a derivative of the ShK toxin, was obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Tyagi et al. (2022)</xref>. The C4-symmetric reconstruction did not yield an interpretable map of the toxin, but clear ion densities in IS2, IS3 and IS4 were visible.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Selvakumar et al. (2022)</xref> also obtained a structure of ShK bound to Kv1.3, but in this case the ShK toxin was fused to a Fab fragment; this yielded an asymmetric ligand large enough to allow C1 reconstruction from the cryo-EM images. The resulting 3.4Å map allowed the toxin K22 sidechain to be modeled entering the pore and extending to near the Y17’ carbonyl oxygens.</p>
<p>From our cryo-EM data we obtained a C1 map of α-DTx bound to Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> at 3.2 Å; this was done by extensive image processing and was helped by the larger size of α-DTx (59 residues as compared to 35 for ShK). With this map the side chain of the toxin residue K5 could be traced, apparently with the terminal amine directly coordinated by the Y17’ carbonyls. A surprise in this map are the positions of the K<sup>+</sup> ion peaks in the selectivity filter (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Ion density is visible in IS3, and somewhat lower density is seen in IS1; there is no density peak in IS2. The different pattern of ion densities with DTx compared to CTx, having two rather than three peaks in the selectivity filter, implies that the interaction between the lysine side chain and the selectivity filter is in some way different in DTx compared to the other toxins.</p>

<title>The selectivity filter in the absence of K<sup>+</sup></title>
<p>In the absence of K<sup>+</sup>, large voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> currents are observed in wildtype Kv2.1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Korn &amp; Ikeda, 1995</xref>) and in Shaker channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melishchuk et al., 1998</xref>). The Kv1.2 structure reported here with Na<sup>+</sup> replacing essentially all K<sup>+</sup> in the solution shows a selectivity filter conformation that is little changed from the K<sup>+</sup> structure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Ion densities are seen in the ion-binding sites, and the occupancies of the sites are altered, but the limited resolution precludes an analysis of the coordination of ions.</p>
<p>The Shaker-W17’F channel in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> stably carries large Na<sup>+</sup> and Li<sup>+</sup> currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Starkus et al., 1997</xref>). These currents are blocked by low concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, and this would be expected as potassium binding to the sites IS3 and IS4 in this mutant is very tight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). We therefore sought to obtain the structure of the corresponding Kv1.2-W17’F channel in Na<sup>+</sup> solution (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In 2D classes the complex appeared to be highly unstable, with large variations in the “wobble” angle between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Attempts to recover the structure of the transmembrane region by focused refinement yielded only low-resolution structural information. We conclude that this channel, at least as solubilized in detergent, has a highly unstable conformation when K<sup>+</sup> ions are absent.</p>

<title>Kv1.2-Kvβ expression and purification</title>
<p>The rat Kv1.2 alpha-subunit constructs were derived from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al. (2005)</xref>, having the full-length (GenBank: X16003) sequence containing the mutation N207Q to eliminate a glycosylation site. Our Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> construct contained the additional mutations L15H and G198S in unstructured regions; the inactivating construct contained the further mutation W366F. To each of these was added at the N-terminus two tandem Strep tags (sequence WSHPQFEK) separated by a Gly-Ser linker. The beta-subunit construct was derived from the rat beta2 core, residues 36-357 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gulbis et al., 1999</xref>). To eliminate very strong electrostatic interactions between the many Lys residues on the “bottom” of the beta-subunits and the negatively-charged carbon film or graphene substrates, we mutated to glutamine the five lysine residues at positions 94, 104-106 and 258 of the beta2 subunit. The fold of the beta subunits containing these mutations is indistinguishable from the wildtype structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Long et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>To express both subunits in a single construct, Kv1.2 and Kvβ genes were separately inserted into pPicZ-B (Thermo-Fisher) vectors between the XhoI and AgeI sites in the multi-restriction-sites region. Subsequently the pPicZ-B vector carrying Kvβ was opened at BglII and BamHI restriction sites, and the insert including the AOX1 promoter was inserted into the other pPicZ-B vector, upstream of the AOX1-driven Kv1.2 cDNA, at the BglII site.</p>
<p>The <italic>P. pastoris</italic> strain SMD1168 (Invitrogen) was electroporated with the pPicZ-B plasmids. YPDS (yeast extract, peptone, dextrose, and sorbitol) plates containing Zeocin (800 ug/ml) were used to select transformants. Stocks were stored in 15% glycerol at -80°C.</p>
<p>The expression and purification procedures were based on those of Long et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Long et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, we inoculated 1 liter of BMGY medium (this and the other yeast media were obtained from Invitrogen) with 10 ml of an overnight culture grown in YPD medium with Zeocin (100 ug/ml). After centrifugation (5500× %, 10 minutes), the cells were transferred to BMMY medium including 0.5% (v/v) methanol and grown for 24 h. After adding an additional 0.5% methanol to increase protein expression, cells were grown for 2-3 days. Cells were centrifuged (5500× %, 20 minutes), the pellet was frozen and stored at -80°C.</p>
<p>Thawed cells were lysed at 4° in a French Press. One gram of cell lysate was resuspended in 5mL of Lysis buffer consists of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM KCl, 300 mM sucrose, 5 mM EDTA, 0.05 mg deoxyribonuclease I, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin and aprotin, and 0.1 mg/mL of soy trypsin inhibitor. Lysis buffer plus 30 mM dodecylmaltoside (DDM) was used to solubilize the membranes for 3 hours at room temperature. Centrifugation (13000×<italic>g</italic>, 20 minutes) separated the unsolubilized material. The supernatant was added to Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads (IBA Lifesciences) preequilibrated with Membrane Resuspension Buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 3mM TCEP, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol, and 5 mM DDM. The bead slurry (approximately 1 ml) was incubated 1h at 4°C with gentle rotation. A column was used to collect the beads after incubation, followed by washing with 14 volumes of Wash Buffer, which was Membrane Resuspension Buffer with added lipids (0.1 mg/ml of the mixture 3:1:1 of POPC:POPE:POPG). The addition of 10 mM desthiobiotin was used to elute the bound protein. The eluted protein was concentrated with a Millipore Amicon Ultra 100 K filter and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superose S6 column pre-equilibrated with Running Buffer: 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 2 mM TCEP, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM dodecylmaltoside (Anatrace, anagrade) and 0.1 mg/ml lipid mixture (3:1:1 of POPC:POPE:POPG). We pooled fractions containing both alpha and beta subunits, and when necessary concentrated the protein to 1∼2 mg/ml (Amicon Ultra 100 KDa, Millipore). For experiments under K<sup>+</sup>-free conditions, the protein bound to Strep-Tactin was washed with 5 column volumes of K<sup>+</sup>-free Wash Buffer (150 mM NaCl replacing KCl) and eluted in 3 mL of K<sup>+</sup>-free elution buffer. As for SEC, the column was first washed with three volumes of K<sup>+</sup>-free Running Buffer before running the protein sample.</p>

<p>Quantifoil holey carbon grids (R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh, Au) were glow-discharged at 15 mA for 1 min with carbon side facing upwards in the chamber. The chamber of the freezing apparatus (Vitrobot Mark IV, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was preequilibrated at 16 °C and 100% humidity. A 3 μL droplet of protein sample was applied to the carbon side of each grid and blotted for 3 or 5 s with zero blotting force after 15 s wait time before plunge-freezing in liquid ethane. For the DTX bound sample, about 400nM α-DTX (Alomone Labs) was mixed with Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> protein 30 min prior to cryo-EM grid preparation.</p>
<p>For the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub>-Na<sup>+</sup>, W366F-Na<sup>+</sup>, and DTX-bound samples, graphene-covered grids were used to allow lower protein concentrations (0.05 to 0.1 mg/ml) to be used. These were prepared from commercial graphene (Trivial Transfer Graphene, single layer; ACS Material LLC) using the recommended transfer protocol and floated onto quantifoil grids. To make the graphene layer hydrophilic, grids were then plasma-cleaned (Gatan 950 Advanced Plasma System) under Ar/O<sub>2</sub> at 10 W for 10 s with the graphene coated surface facing upwards in the chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fan et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>Cryo-EM samples were imaged on a Titan Krios cryo-EM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 keV, equipped with a Bio Quantum energy filter (20 eV slit width) and K3 camera (Gatan). Micrographs were collected using super-resolution mode, physical pixel size 1.068 Å, with SerialEM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schorb et al., 2019</xref>) using image shift patterns and one shot per hole. A total of 6335, 8310, 4507, 2572, 4680 micrographs were collected for WT, W366F, DTX-bound, Na<sup>+</sup> bound WT, and Na<sup>+</sup> bound W366F, datasets respectively.</p>
<p>Processing for each dataset is summarized in the Figure Supplements to <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Beam-induced motion was corrected by MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) and CTF values were estimated by Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Particles were picked either by reference-free Laplacian-of-Gaussian autopicking; an adversarial-template-based program Demo Picker written by F.J.S.; or RELION reference-based auto-picking. All further processing used RELION 3.1. Picked particles were extracted and subjected to rounds of 2D and 3D classification before refinement. Transmembrane-domain masks were used for focused refinement to optimize the resolution of the transmembrane region. Beam-tilt and per-particle CTF refinement followed by per-particle motion correction were applied to further improve the resolution.</p>
<p>Analysis of the DTx-Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> complex started with a C4 reconstruction of the complex from 323k particles. We then performed a rough docking into the Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> apo density of a toxin map created from the 1DTX model. The toxin pose was chosen not to be inconsistent with the symmetrized toxin density visible in the DTx-Kv1.2<sub>s</sub> C4 map. Four of these composite maps were created, with the toxin pose rotated 90° each time about the z-axis. These were filtered to 20Å resolution for use as 3D references. Meanwhile a C4 symmetry expansion of the 323k particles was performed, resulting in a 1.294M particle stack. A soft cylindrical mask of radius 24 Å and height 48 Å was created, centered on the z-axis at the interface between the toxin and the pore region. Using this mask and the four 3D references, we performed 3D classification without alignment in RELION, and chose one of the four resulting classes as a C1 reconstruction of the masked region. Using the corresponding set of 312k particles we performed C1 homogeneous reconstruction in CryoSPARC to yield the refined structure at 3.2 Å resolution.</p>

<p><italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes were injected with mRNA for the alpha subunit constructs used in this study. <bold>A</bold>, native Kv1.2 currents elicited from pulses to -60 to + 60mV in 10 mV steps, from a holding potential of -80mV. <bold>B</bold>, Same voltage protocol applied to channels with W366F alpha subunits, recorded with 96 mM K<sup>+</sup> bath solution. <bold>C</bold>, Comparison of currents elicited from an oocyte at +40 mV with 96mM K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> bath solutions. The potassium-free Na<sup>+</sup> solution yielded faster inactivation, as expected for C-type inactivation. The apparently sustained current in 95 mM Na<sup>+</sup> solution is an artifact of P/4 leak subtraction at -120mV holding potential.</p></caption>

Loop 1 conformational differences with Shaker W434F side view (B), top view (C); or with Kv1.2-2.1-3m side view (G), top view (H). Loop 2 conformational changes with Shaker W434F side view (D), top view (E); Kv1.2-2.1 3m side view (I), top view (J). (K) Table lists of the differences among the inactivated Kv channels. (L) H-bonds among the inactivated Kv channels. Adjacent subunits are shown as different colors, and a dashed black line denotes the subunit boundary. H-bonding patterns affect the stability of the inactivated state and an obvious difference is at the location 32’, where Shaker has Thr and Kv1.2 has Val. The mutation V32’T in the Kv1.2-2.1 background provides a new hydrogen bond that stabilizes the important residue D30’ in the inactivated conformation; this can be seen in the Kv1.2-2.1-3m structure (L, panel 3). Our inactivated Kv1.2s structure (containing V32’) nevertheless shows an H-bond network that includes Y28’ and D30’ along with main-chain atoms, possibly yielding a similar stabilization of the inactivated state (L, panel 1). The inactivated Shaker structure lacks H-bond partners for either Y28’ or D30’, which instead are exposed to solvent; however another H-bond network stabilizes the P-loop-S6 linker (L panel 2).</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> manuscript presents several structures of the Kv1.2 voltage-gated potassium channel, based on state-of-the-art cryoEM techniques and algorithms. The authors present <bold>solid</bold> evidence for structures of an inactivating mutant of Kv1.2, DTX-bound Kv1.2 and of Kv1.2 in potassium-free solution (with presumably sodium ions bound within the selectivity filter). These structures advance our knowledge of the molecular basis of the slow inactivation process of potassium channels.</p>

<p>In this manuscript by Wu et al., the authors present the high resolution cryoEM structures of the WT Kv1.2 voltage-gated potassium channel. Along with this structure, the authors have solved several structures of mutants or experimental conditions relevant to the slow inactivation process that these channels undergo and which is not yet completely understood.</p>
<p>One of the main findings is the determination of the structure of a mutant (W366F) that is thought to correspond to the slow inactivated state. These experiments confirm results in similar mutants in different channels from Kv1.2 that indicate that inactivation is associated with an enlarged selectivity filter.</p>
<p>Another interesting structure is the complex of Kv1.2 with the pore blocking toxin Dendrotoxin 1. The results shown in the revised version indicate that the mechanism of block is similar to that of related blocking-toxins, in which a lysine residue penetrates in the pore. Surprisingly, in these new structures, the bound toxin results in a pore with empty external potassium binding sites.</p>
<p>The quality of the structural data presented in this revised manuscript is very high and allows for unambiguous assignment of side chains. The conclusions are supported by the data. This is an important contribution that should further our understanding of voltage-dependent potassium channel gating. In the revised version, the authors have addressed my previous specific comments.</p>

<p>Wu et al. present cryo-EM structures of the potassium channel Kv1.2 in open, C-type inactivated, toxin-blocked and presumably sodium-bound states at 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 2.8 Å, and 2.9 Å. The work builds on a large body of structural work on Kv1.2 and related voltage-gated potassium channels. The manuscript presents a plethora of structural work, and the authors are commended on the breadth of the studies. The structural studies are well-executed. Although the findings are mostly confirmatory, they do add to the body of work on this and related channels. Notably, the authors present structures of DTx-bound Kv1.2 and of Kv1.2 in a low concentration of potassium (which may contain sodium ions bound within the selectivity filter). These two structures add considerable new information. The DTx structure has been markedly improved in the revised version and the authors arrive at well-founded conclusions regarding its mechanism of block. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, a nice addition to the field, and a crowning achievement for the Sigworth lab.</p>

In the revised version, the authors have addressed my previous specific comments, which are appended below.</p>
<p>(1) In the main text's reference to Figure 2d residues W18' and S22' are mentioned but are not labeled in the insets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This has been fixed: line 229, p. 9.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) On page 8 there is a discussion of how the two remaining K+ ions in binding sites S3 and S4 prevent permeation K+ in molecular dynamics. However, in Shaker, inactivated W434F channels can sporadically allow K+ permeation with normal single-channel conductance but very reduced open times and open probability at not very high voltages.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is noted in the discussion Lines 497-500, p. 18</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The structures of WT in the absence of K+ shows a narrower selectivity filter, however Figure 4 does not convey this finding. In fact, the structure in Figure 4B is constructed in such an angle that it looks as if the carbonyl distances are increased, perhaps this should be fixed. Also, it is not clear how the distances between carbonyls given in the text on page 12 are measured. Is it between adjacent or kitty-corner subunits?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed Fig. 4B to show the same view as in Fig. 4A. In the legend we explain that opposing subunits are shown. We no longer give distances, in view of the lack of detectable carbonyl densities.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It would be really interesting to know the authors opinion on the driving forces behind slow inactivation. For example, potassium flux seems to be necessary for channels to inactivate, which might indicate a local conformational change is the trigger for the main twisting events proposed here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We address this in the Discussion, line 506-523, pp. 18-19.</p>

<p>Review of the resubmission:</p>
<p>I thank the authors for making the changes in their manuscript as suggested in the previous review. The changes in the figures and the additions to the text do improve the manuscript. The new findings from a further analysis of the toxin channel complex are welcome information on the mode of the binding of dendrotoxin.</p>
<p>A few minor concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Line 93-96, 352: I am not sure as to what is it the authors are referring to when they say NaK2P. It is either NaK or NaK2K. I don't think that it has been shown in the reference suggested that either of these channels change conformation based on the K+ concentration. Please check if there is a mistake and that the Nichols et. al. reference is what is being referred to.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for noticing the error. We meant NaK2K and we have changed this throughout.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 365: In the study by Cabral et. al., Rb+ ions were observed by crystallography in the S1, S3 and S4 site, not the S2 site. Please correct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We have re-written this section, lines 364-381, pp. 13-14.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Wu et al. present cryo-EM structures of the potassium channel Kv1.2 in open, C-type inactivated, toxin-blocked and presumably sodium-bound states at 3.2 Å, 2.5 Å, 2.8 Å, and 2.9 Å. The work builds on a large body of structural work on Kv1.2 and related voltage-gated potassium channels. The manuscript presents a plethora of structural work, and the authors are commended on the breadth of the studies. The structural studies are well-executed. Although the findings are mostly confirmatory, they do add to the body of work on this and related channels. Notably, the authors present structures of DTx-bound Kv1.2 and of Kv1.2 in a low concentration of potassium (which may contain sodium ions bound within the selectivity filter). These two structures add considerable new information. The DTx structure has been markedly improved in the revised version and the authors arrive at well-founded conclusions regarding its mechanism of block. Regarding the Na+ structure, the authors claim that the structure with sodium has &quot;zero&quot; potassium - I caution them to make this claim. It is likely that some K+ persists in their sample and that some of the density in the &quot;zero potassium&quot; structure may be due to K+ rather than Na+. This can be clarified by revisions to the text and discussion. I do not think that any additional experiments are needed. Overall, the manuscript is well-written, a nice addition to the field, and a crowning achievement for the Sigworth lab.</p>
<p>Most of this reviewer's initial comments have been addressed in the revised manuscript. Some comments remain that could be addressed by revisions of the text.</p>
<p>Specific comments on the revised version:</p>
<p>Quotations indicate text in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(1) &quot;While the VSD helices in Kv1.2s and the inactivated Kv1.2s-W17'F superimpose very well at the top (including the S4-S5 interface described above), there is a general twist of the helix bundle that yields an overall rotation of about 3o at the bottom of the VSD.&quot;</p>
<p>Comment: This seemed a bit confusing. I assume the authors aligned the complete structures - the differences they indicate seem to be slight VSD repositioning relative to the pore rather than differences between the VSD conformations themselves. The authors may wish to clarify. As they point out in the subsequent paragraph, the VSDs are known to be loosely associated with the pore.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We aligned the VSDs alone, and it is a twist of the VSD helix bundle.</p>
<p>This is now clarified in lines 269-273, p. 10.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Comment: The modeling of DTx into the density is a major improvement in the revision. Figure 3 displays some interactions between the toxin and Kv1.2 - additional side views of the toxin and the channel might allow the reader to appreciate the interactions more fully. The overall fit of the toxin structure into the density is somewhat difficult to assess from the figure. (The authors might consider using ChimeraX to display density and model in this figure.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added new panels, and stereo pairs, to Figure 3.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) &quot;We obtained the structure of Kv1.2s in a zero K+ solution, with all potassium replaced with sodium, and were surprised to find that it is little changed from the K+ bound structure, with an essentially identical selectivity filter conformation (Figure 4B and Figure 4-figure supplement 1).&quot;</p>
<p>Comment: It should be noted in the manuscript that K+ and Na+ ions cannot be distinguished by the cryo-EM studies - the densities are indistinguishable. The authors are inferring that the observed density corresponds to Na+ because the protein was exchanged from K+ into Na+ on a gel filtration (SEC) column. It is likely that a small amount of K+ remains in the protein sample following SEC. I caution the authors to claim that there is zero K+ in solution without measuring the K+ content of the protein sample. Additionally, it should be considered that K+ may be present in the blotting paper used for cryo-EM grid preparation (our laboratory has noted, for example, a substantial amount of Ca2+ in blotting paper). The affinity of Kv1.2 for K+ has not been determined, to my knowledge - the authors note in the Discussion that the Shaker channel has &quot;tight&quot; binding for K+. It seems possible that some portion of the density in the selectivity filter could be due to residual K+. This caveat should be clearly stated in the main text and discussion. More extensive exchange into Na+, such as performing the entire protein purification in NaCl, or by dialysis (as performed for obtaining the structure of KcsA in low K+ by Y. Zhou et al. &amp; Mackinnon 2001), would provide more convincing removal of K+, but I suspect that the Kv1.2 protein would not have sufficient biochemical stability without K+ to endure this treatment. One might argue that reduced biochemical stability in NaCl could be an indication that there was a meaningful amount of K+ in the final sample used for cryo-EM (or in the particles that were selected to yield the final high-resolution structure).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now explain in the Methods section, in more detail the steps taken to avoid any residual Na+ contamination during purification, lines 683-687, pp. 24-25. We have changed the text to point out that the ion species cannot be distinguished in the maps, and note results in NaK2K and KcsA (lines 368-381, pp. 13-14).</p>
<p>We note that the same procedures to remove K+ were used for the Kv1.2sW17’F structure (line 385, p. 14). We qualify the ion replacement to say that Na+ replaces “essentially” all K+ (line 607, p. 21).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Referring to the structure obtained in NaCl: &quot;The ion occupancy is also similar, and we presume that Kv1.2 is a conducting channel in sodium solution.&quot;</p>
<p>Comment: Stating that &quot;Kv1.2 is a conducting channel in sodium solution&quot; and implying that conduction of Na+ is achieved by an analogous distribution of ion binding sites as observed for K+ are strong statements to make - and not justified by the experiments provided. Electrophysiology would be required to demonstrate that the channel conducts sodium in the absence of K+. More complete ionic exchange, better control of the ionic conditions (Na+ vs K+), and affinity measurements for K+ would be needed to determine the distribution of Na+ in the filter (as mentioned above). At minimum, the authors should revise and clarify what the intended meaning of the statement &quot;we presume that Kv1.2 is a conducting channel in sodium solution&quot;. As mentioned above, it seems possible/likely that a portion of the density in the filter may be due to K+.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now present a more detailed argument (lines 376 to 381, pp. 13-14.)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p>
<p>After consultation, the reviewers agree that, although the authors have answered most of the comments raised in the previous review, there remains a concern about the structure obtained in the presence if Na. Given that Kv1.2 is more reluctant to slow inactivation, the conducting structure in Na+ could be due to this fact or that it really has higher affinity for K+ than Na+. In the presence of even a small contamination by K+, this ion could thus occupy the selectivity filter, resulting in an open conformation. The authors should clearly state the steps taken to ensure no contamination by K+. It is also possible that indeed the open structure occurs even in the presence of Na+ in the selectivity filter. This should be also discussed, given that this has been observed in other potassium channel structures.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In this revised version of the manuscript, the authors have adequately addressed my previous points and improved the clarity and readability of the manuscript. This is a compelling work that shows inactivated structures if the Kv1.2 potassium channel, especially interesting is a structure in the absence of extracellular potassium ions, that can help understand how a reduction in the availability of these ions speed up entrance into the inactivated state in these ion channels.</p>
<p>I would just recommend that in the absence of functional data (current recordings) when potassium is removed, the authors just use caution in ascribing this structure to an inactivated state. Also, it should be mentioned that the observed ion densities observed in the pore cannot unambiguously be identified as sodium ions.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1)  &quot;The nearby Leu9 is also important as its substitution by alanine also decreases affinity 1000-fold, but we observe no contacts between this residue and residues of the Kv1.2s channel.&quot;</p>
<p>Comment: It seems early in the text to mention the potential interaction of Leu9 to the channel structure. The authors may wish to discuss Leu9 later in the manuscript - a figure showing the location of Leu9 would strengthen the statement. Any hypothesis on why mutation of it has such a profound effect?</p>
<p>Add a figure panel showing Leu9 position.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have rewritten the text as suggested, and have identified Leu9 in several panels of Fig. 3.</p>
