<abstract>
<p>In the healthy brain, microglia maintain homeostasis by continuously surveying neuronal health through highly dynamic processes that form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas. These mechanisms are finely tuned for the rapid detection of acute injuries. However, during the transition to a chronically reactive state in neurodegenerative diseases, microglial ramification decreases even as the need for neuronal monitoring escalates. How reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies under these conditions remains poorly understood. Using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-infected mice, we identified a previously unrecognized mode of neuronal surveillance employed by reactive microglia. Unlike homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility and high process motility, enabling broad, simultaneous monitoring, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. These cells actively migrate through the brain parenchyma, pausing to form direct and extensive body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. Contact durations ranged from minutes to several hours, often involving partial or full somatic envelopment, with transitions between these states being both frequent and reversible. Notably, reactive microglia exhibited sustained intracellular calcium bursts correlated with their increased mobility. Pharmacological inhibition of the P2Y6 receptor partially reduced microglial migration without disrupting their ability to form neuronal contacts. Furthermore, this highly mobile behavior persisted in acutely isolated reactive microglia <italic>in vitro</italic>, even in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that dynamic mobility is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. These findings reveal a fundamental shift in microglial surveillance architecture during chronic neurodegeneration - transforming from static, multi-neuron monitoring to dynamic, neuron-by-neuron engagement. This work uncovers a novel, adaptive strategy of microglial behavior with critical implications for understanding microglia-neuron interaction under chronic neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Under homeostatic conditions, microglia continuously monitor neuronal health through specialized structures known as somatic purinergic junctions - sites where microglial processes make direct contact with neuronal cell bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. A key molecular component of these junctions is the P2Y12 receptor, which plays a critical role in mediating microglia-neuron communication <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Homeostatic, ramified microglia exhibit highly dynamic behavior, extending and retracting their processes in a phenomenon termed <italic>microglial motility</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. These transient process-to-soma contacts constitute the primary mode of neuronal surveillance in the healthy brain.</p>
<p>Under chronic neurodegenerative conditions, microglia acquire a sustained reactive phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Reactive microglia differ markedly in morphology from their homeostatic counterparts, displaying an amoeboid shape with reduced process complexity. Both microglial ramification and P2Y12 receptor expression are significantly diminished as microglia transition to the reactive state <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Paradoxically, this occurs at a time when the demand for neuronal surveillance intensifies due to increased neuronal stress and disfunction. How microglia maintain effective surveillance of neurons under conditions of chronic neuroinflammation remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Prion diseases, or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are fatal and infectious neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The hallmark pathological event in these diseases is the accumulation and spread of the misfolded, β-sheet-rich isoform of the prion protein (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) throughout the central nervous system (CNS). This process involves the templated conversion of the host’s normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into the disease-associated PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Chronic neuroinflammation is a prominent neuropathological feature of prion diseases, as well as other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Notably, unlike animal models of other neurodegenerative diseases, prion-infected animals including mice develop authentic ultimately lethal neurodegenerative disease, that recapitulates key features of the human prion disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Previously, we demonstrated that in prion-infected mice, reactive microglia engage in a distinct form of microglia-neuron interaction characterized by partial envelopment of neuronal cell bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. These extensive body-to-body contacts differ from typical process-based surveillance. The enveloped neurons appear structurally intact, lack classical apoptotic markers, but exhibit functional impairments. This phenomenon is consistently observed across multiple brain regions exhibiting neuroinflammation in both prion-infected mice and human cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Strikingly, genetic ablation of P2Y12 increases the frequency of neuronal envelopment and accelerates disease progression in prion-infected mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In non-infected mice, P2Y12 deletion also increase the prevalence of microglia-neuron body-to-body interactions at the expense of process-to-body contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that neuronal envelopment represents an alternative, P2Y12-independent mode of microglial surveillance, employed by reactive microglia under pathological conditions.</p>
<p>To date, quantification of neuronal envelopment has relied on fixed brain tissue <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, leaving key questions about the temporal dynamics of these interactions unresolved. Although the frequency of envelopment increases with disease progression, it remains unclear whether individual interactions are sustained over time or whether reactive microglia sequentially engage multiple neurons through transient contacts.</p>
<p>The current study employed <italic>ex vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging of acute organotypic brain slices prepared from prion-infected mice to investigate the surveillance behavior of reactive microglia under chronic neurodegenerative conditions. Unlike homeostatic microglia, reactive myeloid cells loose territorial confinement. In contrast to homeostatic microglia, which exhibit low somatic mobility but high process motility enabling simultaneous monitoring of multiple neurons, reactive microglia display high somatic mobility. Reactive microglia move dynamically through tissue, engaging in sequential body-to-body contacts with individual neurons. This shift in behavior represents a fundamental reorganization of microglial surveillance strategies in the diseased brain. Surprisingly, acutely isolated reactive microglia retained high mobility <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of external stimuli, indicating that this dynamic behavior is an intrinsic feature of the reactive phenotype. The current studies reveal that in the reactive state, microglia adopt fundamentally different surveillance strategies to respond to the altered demands of the chronically inflamed and degenerating brain.</p>

<title>Reactive microglia envelop neurons</title>
<p>To investigate microglial dynamics, we performed ex vivo time-lapse imaging using acute organotypic brain slices prepared from Cx3cr1/EGFP mice (fractalkine receptor knockout/EGFP knock-in). These mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of the endogenous <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> promoter, restricting expression to myeloid cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency does not influence disease pathogenesis, survival, or microglial activation in mice infected with the 22L or RML prion strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In agreement with these findings, we observed that <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> deficiency and EGFP knock-in in Cx3cr1/EGFP mice did not alter the incubation time to disease following infection with mouse-adapted SSLOW or 22L prion strains, compared to wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) controls (Figure S1a–c). Moreover, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation levels were comparable between SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP and WT mice (Figure S1c,d).</p>
<p>For subsequent experiments, we selected the SSLOW strain due to its strong induction of neuroinflammation and the shortest incubation time among mouse-adapted prion strains <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In prior studies, neuronal envelopment by microglia was consistently observed across all brain regions exhibiting prion-induced neuroinflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. In the present study, we focused on the cortex, where the temporal dynamics of neuronal envelopment during disease progression have been well characterized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Examination of fixed brain slices from SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice at the clinical stage revealed extensive envelopment of neurons by Iba1<sup>+</sup> reactive microglia, characterized by prominent body-to-body contacts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), consistent with our previous report in WT mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Notably, the cortices of SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice exhibited a high prevalence of neuronal envelopment events (Figure S1f). In contrast, brain slices from age-matched, non-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice displayed microglia with a highly ramified morphology, primarily engaging in process-to-cell body interactions with neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, Figure S1g), typical of homeostatic microglia.</p>

<title>Reactive myeloid cells exhibit high mobility</title>
<p>To investigate microglial dynamics in prion-affected brains, <italic>ex vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging was performed on cerebral cortices of Cx3cr1/EGFP mice infected with the SSLOW prion strain via intraperitoneal (ip) injection. Imaging was conducted at three stages of disease progression: late subclinical (111–113 days post-inoculation, dpi), early clinical (125–128 dpi), and advanced (162–169 dpi). In mice inoculated with SSLOW via ip route, clinical onset typically occurs around 122 dpi <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Western blotting confirmed the presence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the brains of mice examined at all three stages, with progressive accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> correlating with disease advancement (Figure S2a,b). Age-matched non-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice (160–164 days old) served as healthy controls.</p>
<p>To be consistent with previously established terminology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, the term “motility” will be used to refer to the movement of microglia processes, whereas the movement of cell bodies to new position will be referred to by the term “mobility”. Initial time-lapse recordings of acute brain slices from non-infected adult Cx3cr1/EGFP mice, acquired at a rate of one frame every five minutes, demonstrated that microglial morphology remained ramified - indicative of a homeostatic state - for at least six hours of continuous imaging (Video S1). During this period, microglia largely remained within defined territories, displaying limited somatic mobility but sustained dynamic process activity, confirming cellular viability (Video S1). However, noticeable photobleaching occurred after approximately three hours of imaging, with accelerated photobleaching observed at higher imaging frequencies. Accordingly, all subsequent time-lapse videos were captured at a frame rate of one frame every five minutes.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that transcriptomic changes in slice cultures are most pronounced one day post-preparation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, though morphological, functional, and gene expression alterations can begin as early as four hours post-slicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In contrast to the stable process motility observed in homeostatic microglia, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in slices from SSLOW-infected animals exhibited both high process activity and active somatic translocation (Video S2). To define the optimal imaging window for capturing dynamic behavior, we tracked individual cell movements across six consecutive one-hour intervals following slice preparation. Microglial activity progressively declined after 3–4 hours in both SSLOW-infected and control slices (Figure S3a–c), prompting us to restrict all subsequent imaging experiments to a three-hour window. At all examined disease stages, EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells in prion-infected brains displayed significantly increased mobility compared to controls, as reflected by elevated mean speed and total soma displacement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a–c</xref>). A comprehensive heatmap analysis of mobility parameters, including soma displacement, speed, and directionality, demonstrated a progressive enhancement of microglial activity with advancing disease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>).</p>

<title>‘Kiss-and-ride’ surveying behavior of reactive myeloid cells</title>
<p>Analysis of SSLOW-infected brain slices based on the distance traveled by EGFP<sup>⁺</sup> cell somas revealed two distinct behavioral patterns: high mobility and low mobility. Low-mobility cells remained confined to a limited area, displaying minimal displacement and exhibiting localized, jiggling movements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). In contrast, high-mobility cells traversed significantly longer distances across the tissue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3a,c</xref>,d). These two phenotypes also differed in their mean directional change rate, a metric quantifying the average shift in movement direction over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). Low-mobility cells exhibited higher directional change rates, consistent with their confined, wobbling behavior, whereas high-mobility cells demonstrated more linear and directed trajectories. To assess whether these patterns reflected genuine biological differences rather than inter-animal variation, we re-plotted the data as Superplots, in which mobility parameters for individual cells were averaged per animal. These analyses demonstrate that mobility metrics are highly consistent across animals within each group, indicating limited inter-animal variability (Figure S4a,b,c).</p>

<p>Detailed tracking of high-mobility cells uncovered a distinctive, intermittent surveying pattern. EGFP⁺ cells extended processes in multiple directions, often simultaneously reaching out to several neurons. Subsequently, the cell somas translocated along some of these processes while others retracted (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4a</xref>, 4d; Videos S3–S6, S12). While migrating through the extracellular matrix, these cells paused to establish transient, soma-to-soma contact with neurons before resuming movement to engage with subsequent neurons. We refer to this dynamic pattern as ‘kiss-and-ride’ behavior. The duration of these transient contacts ranged from several minutes to over an hour (Videos S3–S5). Notably, this behavior was consistently observed across all three stages of disease progression: subclinical, early clinical, and advanced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4a</xref>, 4d; Videos S3–S6).</p>

<p>During a three-hour imaging window, some EGFP⁺ cells were observed to contact up to six different neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>; Videos S4, S7), while others engaged with only one or two neurons, maintaining prolonged interactions with each (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4c</xref>, 4d; Videos S3, S5, S8). Occasionally, a single EGFP⁺ cell simultaneously contacted or partially enveloped two or three neuronal somas (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4a</xref>, 5a, 5b; Videos S8, S9). Interestingly, some neurons were sequentially surveyed by two different EGFP⁺ cells within the same three-hour period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>; Video S10). Collectively, the behaviors of high-mobility EGFP⁺ cells underscore a lack of territorial restriction, contrasting with the spatially constrained dynamics typically seen in ramified microglia under homeostatic conditions.</p>

<title>Enveloping behavior of reactive myeloid cells</title>
<p>Some low-mobility EGFP⁺ cells showed no apparent contact with neurons, whereas others maintained continuous contact with a single neuronal soma throughout the entire duration of time-lapse imaging (Videos S8, S11). Occasionally, low-mobility EGFP⁺ cells were observed slowly transitioning between neuronal somas or oscillating between two or three somas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a,b</xref>; Videos S3, S8, S9). Body-to-body contact between EGFP⁺ myeloid cells and neurons was often sustained for extended periods and could progress to full envelopment of the neuronal soma (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, 5c; Videos S12–S15). Notably, full envelopment did not necessarily culminate in phagocytosis; EGFP⁺ cells frequently reversed the process, returning from full envelopment to partial envelopment or contact (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>; Video S12).</p>

<p>Previous analyses of fixed brain sections have shown that reactive myeloid cells selectively envelop neuronal cells, avoiding other cell types such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In the current study, we attempted to visualize neuronal somas during time-lapse imaging using the calcium-sensitive dye Calbryte-590, following protocols from earlier research <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. However, this proved challenging. Unlike neurons in non-infected animals, neurons in prion-infected slices exhibited markedly reduced Calbryte-590 fluorescence, suggesting dysfunction in calcium signaling. Despite the weak signal, some neuronal somas undergoing envelopment still showed detectable Calbryte-590 fluorescence in SSLOW-infected slices (Video S16). Interestingly, brighter calcium puncta were frequently observed in association with reactive myeloid cells (Videos S14, S18).</p>
<p>The same behavioral patterns observed in SSLOW-infected brains were also evident in brain slices from Cx3cr1/EGFP mice infected with the 22L mouse-adapted prion strain. These included both high-mobility EGFP⁺ cells exhibiting ‘kiss-and-ride’ interactions and low-mobility cells engaged in neuronal envelopment (Video S17).</p>
<p>The interaction patterns between reactive myeloid cells and neurons that are seen in time-laps imaging in dynamics, could be captured at a much higher resolution using confocal microscopy imaging of fixed brain slices. Confocal imaging confirmed extensive body-to-body contact between Iba1⁺ cells and neurons, ranging from partial to full envelopment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d,e</xref>). Some Iba1⁺ cells enveloped one neuron while simultaneously extending processes to contact or even envelop additional neurons. Cases were also observed where two Iba1⁺ cells partially enveloped a single neuron simultaneously. These patterns emphasize the profound body-to-body interactions between reactive myeloid cells and neurons in prion-infected brains, contrasting sharply with the predominantly process-mediated interactions seen under homeostatic conditions.</p>
<p>All behavioral patterns - ‘kiss-and-ride’, partial envelopment, and full envelopment - were consistently observed across all three stages of disease progression: preclinical, early clinical, and advanced. Notably, the percentage of high-mobility myeloid cells increased from the preclinical to early clinical stages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), possibly reflecting heightened surveillance demands in response to emerging neuronal dysfunction. At advanced stages, however, this percentage declined (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>), which may indicate a shift toward prolonged interactions with severely impaired neurons and/or the onset of intrinsic dysfunction within the reactive myeloid population.</p>

<title>Morphology of both high- and low-mobility myeloid cells is consistent with reactive phenotype</title>
<p>To examine the morphological features associated with different patterns of EGFP⁺cell behavior, morphological parameters were quantified for individual EGFP⁺ cells in each time frame, and then averaged across all time frames across the entire three-hour imaging period to obtain a single mean value per cell. This statistical averaging approach accounts for the dynamic and continuously changing shapes of individual cells over time. Notable morphological differences were observed between cells from healthy animals and those from SSLOW-infected animals. Based on parameters such as cell radius, area, and perimeter, EGFP⁺ cells from SSLOW-infected animals exhibited a hypertrophic, amoeboid morphology - consistent with a reactive phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a–c</xref>). These morphological changes were evident in both high-and low-mobility cell populations, suggesting that regardless of mobility behavior, the cells adopted a reactive phenotype. A similar pattern was observed for the shape index, a dimensionless metric that quantifies overall cell shape (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Interestingly, in comparison to low-mobility cells, the high-mobility cells from SSLOW-infected animals appeared to be closer to the cells from healthy controls compared (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). This may reflect the elongated morphology adopted by mobile cells as they navigate the extracellular matrix, influencing the overall statistical representation of their shape. A trend toward lower values in cell radius, area, perimeter, and shape index with disease progression aligned with confocal imaging data, which illustrated a more pronounced amoeboid morphology and reduced ramification at advanced disease stages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d-e</xref>, 6a-d).</p>
<p>Overall, the statistical averaging of morphological parameters supports the classification of cells based on the clinical status of the animals from which brain slices were derived. Myeloid cells with similar mobility but different clinical backgrounds (e.g., normal vs. SSLOW low-mobility) exhibited clear morphological distinctions, whereas cells with differing mobility within the same pathological condition (SSLOW high- vs. low-mobility) were morphologically similar.</p>

<p>Due to the time-lapse imaging interval of one frame every five minutes, we were unable to precisely quantify the duration or frequency of individual calcium bursts.

These signals were primarily localized to the soma, although occasional bursts were also observed within cellular processes (Videos S18–S20).

<title>Inhibition of P2Y6 Receptor Reduces the Mobility of Reactive Myeloid Cells</title>
<p>Calcium transients in microglia are regulated by the P2Y6 receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Activation of this receptor by its endogenous ligand, UDP, has been implicated in multiple microglial functions, including migration, phagocytosis of damaged neurons, and clearance of apoptotic debris and Aβ plaques <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In addition to P2Y6, several members of P2Y receptors and ATP-gated P2X channels contribute to microglial surveillance, activation, motility, and phagocytic responses. We therefore examined the expression of P2ry6, P2ry13, P2rx7, and P2rx4 alongside activation markers Tlr2, Cd68, and Trem2. Bulk brain tissue analysis revealed that all examined genes were upregulated in SSLOW-infected mice relative to controls (Figure S5a). However, because microglial proliferation markedly increases cell numbers during disease progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, bulk expression changes may not accurately reflect per-cell expression levels. To account for this, we normalized gene expression to the microglia-specific marker Tmem119. Although Tmem119 is considered a marker of homeostatic microglia, its per-cell expression remains relatively stable during prion disease progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. After normalization, <italic>Tlr2, Cd68</italic>, and <italic>Trem2</italic> were upregulated approximately 10-, 6-, and 4-fold, respectively, whereas P2 receptor gene expression showed more modest increases: <italic>P2ry6</italic> by 3-fold, <italic>P2ry13</italic> by 2-fold, and <italic>P2rx7</italic> by 1.3-fold, while P2rx4 remained unchanged (Figure S5a). Given its role in calcium signaling, the magnitude of upregulation, and its specific expression in microglia, P2Y6 was selected for further functional analysis.</p>
<p>To assess the role of P2Y6 signaling in the dynamics of reactive myeloid cells, we acutely inhibited the receptor using the selective antagonist MRS-2578. This was performed on brain slices obtained at the early clinical disease stage, when the proportion of highly mobile EGFP⁺ cells was maximal (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>).</p>
<p>MRS-2578 treatment reduced both mean cell speed and total distance traveled by EGFP⁺ cells in SSLOW-infected slices compared to mock-treated controls (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8a</xref>). However, mobility did not decrease to the levels observed in uninfected slices, suggesting a partial rather than complete effect of P2Y6 inhibition (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8a</xref>). In MRS-2578-treated slices, the majority of reactive EGFP⁺ cells were observed either enveloping neuronal somata or remaining closely associated with them (Videos S22, S23). In some cases, individual EGFP⁺ cells were seen alternating between neighboring neuronal bodies, sequentially enveloping each soma (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8b</xref>; Video S23). These findings suggest that P2Y6 signaling facilitates long-range migration of reactive myeloid cells. While its inhibition diminishes overall mobility, it does not abolish localized movements or neuron-associated behaviors such as soma-to-soma interactions.</p>

<title>Myeloid cells that envelop neurons are TMEM119<sup>+</sup> and P2Y12<sup>+</sup></title>

To determine the identity of cells involved in neuronal envelopment, brain sections from SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice were immunostained for TMEM119 and P2Y12, markers characteristic of resident microglia.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the healthy brain, microglia continuously monitor neuronal activity via highly dynamic processes that extend and retract to form purinergic junctions with neuronal somas <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. These surveillance mechanisms in the homeostatic state are primarily tuned to detect acute injuries, as microglia respond to changes in neuronal activity and environmental signals such as ATP, ADP, and UDP released by damaged neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. In contrast to acute or focal injuries, neuronal dysfunction in chronic conditions evolves gradually and spreads across broader regions. It is commonly assumed that reactive microglia continue to rely on the same cues and surveillance strategies as in the homeostatic state. However, during the transition to a reactive phenotype in the context of chronic neurodegeneration, both the complexity and number of microglial processes involved in surveillance decrease, even as the demand for neuronal monitoring intensifies. Additionally, expression of P2Y12, a key receptor for sensing ATP and ADP at purinergic junctions, is significantly reduced <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This raises a critical question: how do reactive microglia adapt their surveillance strategies to meet the increasing demands of chronic neurodegeneration?</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that, in the reactive state, microglia adopt a distinct approach to neuronal monitoring. In the homeostatic brain, individual microglial cells occupy well-defined territories, extending their processes to simultaneously contact multiple neurons. By contrast, in the reactive state, myeloid cells lose this territorial organization, becoming highly mobile and migrating through the extracellular matrix. They pause intermittently to form direct body-to-body contacts, typically with one neuron at a time. This movement begins with process extension, followed by somal translocation along the path of the extended process.</p>
<p>On average, each myeloid cell surveyed one neuron per hour. However, the duration of contact varied considerably - from a few minutes to several hours - as did the extent of neuronal envelopment. Partial envelopment of neuronal somas was the most common form of interaction, though full envelopment was also observed. Notably, full envelopment was often reversible, transitioning back to partial envelopment or complete retraction. These ongoing morphological changes - including the appearance, disappearance, and reappearance of intercellular contacts - underscore the highly dynamic nature of communication between reactive myeloid cells and neuronal somas. Although individual contacts were fluid, they could be maintained for several hours. It is tempting to speculate that the duration and degree of envelopment may reflect both the extent of neuronal damage and the complexity of the underlying decision-making processes governing neuronal fate.</p>
<p>Reactive myeloid cells frequently interacted with two or three neuronal somas simultaneously, exhibiting oscillatory or “wobbling” movements between them. This behavior suggests a capacity for multitarget surveillance,. Moreover, within a three-hour window, multiple myeloid cells could be observed sequentially interacting with the same neuron, indicating again a breakdown of territorial organization.</p>
<p>To navigate the extracellular matrix, an amoeboid morphology offers clear advantages over a ramified one. In the reactive state, microglia upregulate matrix-degrading enzymes that facilitate migration by clearing paths through the adhesive matrix <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. The mobility pattern of reactive myeloid cells observed in our study resembles that of embryonic mouse microglia, which alternate between phases of process extension and subsequent somal translocation along the axis of the extended processes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. This mechanical similarity suggests that reactive microglia may engage migratory mechanisms akin to those used during developmental stages to support their surveillance functions. However, unlike their embryonic counterparts, reactive myeloid cells appear to actively scan their environment to select among multiple potential neuronal targets, indicating a more decision-oriented migratory behavior.</p>
<p>In our study, the average speed of the highly mobile microglial population ranged from 13.2 μm/h at the subclinical stage to 19.1 μm/h at the advanced disease stage. These velocities are lower than those reported for hippocampal microglia at postnatal day 2 (∼36 μm/h) and cortical microglia at embryonic day 17.5 (∼25 μm/h) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. It is important to note that our measurements likely underestimate actual migration speeds due to the low frequency of frame acquisition in time-lapse experiments and potential movements occurring between frames that were not captured.</p>
<p>In this work, we classified cells into two categories - high and low mobility - based on their behavior during the three-hour observation period. It remains unclear whether these categories represent distinct phenotypic subpopulations. Given the limited time window, the observed mobility differences may reflect transient stages within the dynamic surveying behavior, rather than stable phenotypic traits. At the advanced disease stage, the proportion of highly mobile cells declined, potentially due to prolonged interactions between myeloid cells and neurons. This observation raises compelling questions for future investigation, including whether distinct phenotypes emerge among reactive myeloid cells as a consequence of neuronal interactions, and what the functional implications of such differences might be.</p>
<p>The activation and migration of homeostatic microglia in response to acute neuronal injury are known to be mediated by calcium signaling <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In the present study, sustained calcium bursts were observed in association with the migratory activity of high-mobility myeloid cells, suggesting that calcium signaling is crucial for migration in the reactive state too. However, unlike the brief calcium transients typically observed in homeostatic microglia, which last up to a minute, reactive myeloid cells exhibited elevated calcium levels for extended durations of at least three hours.</p>
<p>In microglia, calcium signaling is regulated in part by the metabotropic P2Y6 receptor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Activation of P2Y6 by its endogenous ligand UDP has been implicated in various microglial functions, including migration, phagocytosis of damaged neurons, and clearance of apoptotic bodies and Aβ plaques <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In the present study, we found that the P2Y6 antagonist MRS-2578 partially suppressed the migration of reactive myeloid cells but did not prevent their association with neurons. These findings suggest that while P2Y6 signaling facilitates the mobility of myeloid cells, it does not mediate their physical interaction with neurons. This points to a specific role for P2Y6 in the surveillance behavior of reactive myeloid cells under conditions of chronic neurodegeneration. Multiple purinergic receptors, including P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y12, P2RY13, P2X4, and P2X7, have been implicated in microglial chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and directed movement in response to acute injury <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In prion-infected mice, we observed modest upregulation of <italic>P2ry6, P2ry13</italic>, and <italic>P2rx7</italic>, with no detectable change in <italic>P2rx4</italic> expression, whereas prior studies have reported downregulation of P2Y12 receptor when normalized per cell <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the observation that MRS-2578 only partially inhibited cell movement supports the idea that multiple, potentially redundant pathways govern microglial mobility.</p>
<p>A particularly intriguing finding of this study is that reactive myeloid cells maintained elevated mobility upon acute isolation <italic>in vitro</italic>, even in the absence of external stimuli or neuronal activity. This indicates that heightened mobility is an intrinsic property of the reactive phenotype, in stark contrast to homeostatic microglia, which typically require external cues to initiate soma migration. These results imply that signaling mechanisms beyond purinergic pathways contribute to the enhanced mobility of reactive myeloid cells. It is possible that this behavior is sustained through autocrine or paracrine signaling involving proinflammatory factors secreted by reactive microglia themselves. Supporting this notion, recent work has demonstrated that IFNγ promotes microglial migration in the adult mouse cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and genes associated with IFNγ signaling are upregulated in microglia from prion-infected mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Future studies will be needed to determine whether such autonomous signaling mechanisms underlie the highly mobile phenotype.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, the mean speed and total distance traveled by reactive myeloid cells <italic>in vitro</italic> were two- to threefold greater than those observed in acute brain slices. This is not unexpected, given that in situ, cells must navigate the extracellular matrix and often pause to establish direct contacts with neurons. Notably, co-culturing reactive microglia with N2a neuronal cells further increased their mobility even further. In the presence of N2a cells, reactive microglia exhibited more directed and less stochastic movement patterns. These observations suggest that, in a reactive state, myeloid cells retain a heightened responsiveness to environmental cues that do not elicit similar behavioral changes in homeostatic microglia. Several limitations of this study warrant discussion. In Cx3cr1/EGFP mice, all myeloid cells, including monocytes and macrophages, express EGFP, raising questions about the specific identity of the myeloid cells that establish extensive contacts with neurons. Our current and previous work demonstrated that myeloid cells enveloping neurons are positive for TMEM119 and P2Y12 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, markers generally associated with resident microglia. Additionally, prior studies have shown that microglial expansion in prion diseases primarily results from the proliferation of resident microglia, with minimal contribution from peripheral myeloid cell recruitment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, infiltration of peripheral myeloid cells and their potential role in neuronal surveillance cannot be completely ruled out.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether reactive myeloid cells in other neurodegenerative diseases employ similar strategies for neuronal surveillance. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms and docking pathways mediating the formation of close body-to-body contacts between reactive myeloid cells and neurons are not yet understood. In earlier work, we found that knockout of CD11b, a component of complement receptor 3 involved in the phagocytosis of newborn neurons during neurodevelopment, does not affect the prevalence of neuronal envelopment or the progression of prion diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Conversely, knockout of the P2Y12 receptor, which mediates purinergic junctions between microglial processes and neuronal soma, led to an increased prevalence of neuronal envelopment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. These findings suggest that P2Y12 is not required for body-to-body contact formation; rather, its absence facilitates neuronal envelopment by microglia.</p>
<p>The role of the high-mobility phenotype of reactive microglia in neuronal health and disease progression is poorly understood too. In a previous study, the onset of neuronal envelopment followed a decline in cellular levels of Grin1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor essential for synaptic plasticity. Reactive microglia were observed to envelop Grin1-deficient neurons, suggesting that myeloid cells respond to neuronal dysfunction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Notably, P2Y12 knockout increased the prevalence of neuronal envelopment and accelerated disease progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Collectively, these observations suggest that while microglial envelopment may represent an adaptive response to heightened neuronal surveillance demands, excessive envelopment, as seen in the absence of P2Y12, appears to be maladaptive.</p>
<p>Cx3cr1 is a chemokine receptor expressed by microglia that binds its neuronal ligand Cx3cl1, which exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. The Cx3cr1-Cx3cl1 axis plays a role in homeostatic functions such as immune surveillance, chemotaxis and phagocytosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. While CX3CR1 is known to regulate microglial process dynamics and migration, whether Cx3cr1 signaling reduce or accelerated microglial motility remains a matter of debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In the present study, we observed robust neuronal envelopment by reactive microglia in Cx3cr1/EGFP mice, which lack functional Cx3cr1, indicating that microglia-neuronal docking does not require Cx3cr1-Cx3cl1 signaling. Furthermore, microglia isolated from prion-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP and C57BL/6J mice exhibited comparably high mobility <italic>in vitro</italic>, suggesting that Cx3cr1 contributes minimally to the regulation of surveillance behavior reactive microglia.</p>
<p>To summarize, the transformation of myeloid cells into a reactive phenotype involves a fundamental reorganization of microglial surveillance strategies. In the homeostatic state, microglia monitor a limited territory surrounding their location and require chemical cues to initiate migration toward sites of injury. In contrast, reactive myeloid cells exhibit high intrinsic mobility and actively search for neurons. These cells adopt a distinct surveillance pattern characterized by migration from one neuron to another, pausing to form extensive, body-to-body contacts - typically with a single neuron at a time. Prion-infected animals develop a lethal form of authentic prion disease. The observation of neuronal envelopment by reactive myeloid cells in both individuals with sporadic CJD and prion-infected mice underscores that this aspect of human disease pathology is faithfully recapitulated in prion-infected mice. To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of microglial surveillance behavior in the context of a bona fide neurodegenerative disease rather than a disease model.</p>

<p>B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J mice (Strain 005582, The Jackson Laboratory) were purchased from the Jackson laboratory and breed in house. B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J have an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence replacing the first 390 bp of the coding exon of the chemokine (C-X3-C motif) receptor 1 (<italic>Cx3cr1</italic>) gene.</p>
<p>Brain-derived material for inoculations was prepared from terminally ill SSLOW- or 22L-infected wild type (WT, C57Bl/6J) mice as 10% (w/v) brain homogenate (BH) in PBS, pH 7.4, using glass/Teflon homogenizers attached to a cordless 12 V compact drill <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Immediately before inoculation, the inoculum was further dispersed by 30 sec indirect sonication at ∼200 watts in a microplate horn of a sonicator (Qsonica, Newtown, CT) and diluted to 1% in PBS, pH 7.4. B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J and WT mice were inoculated with 200 μl 1% BH intraperitoneally under 3% isoflurane anesthesia. Alternatively, mice were inoculated with 20 μl 1 % BH intracranially (Figure S1a). Animals were scored weekly using four categories, each of which was graded using score ‘0 – 3’, with ‘3’ being the most severe impairment. The scoring categories were: clasping hind legs, posture (kyphosis, rigid tail, rearing difficulties), mobility (difficulties in ambulation and navigating the cage edge), and gate (keeping balance while walking, wobbly gate, disorientation, lethargy). The animals were deemed symptomatic when they displayed a consistent increase in the combined score starting from ‘4’. The mice were considered terminal when they were unable to rear and/or lost 20% of their weight. The following animal groups were used for main experiments: SSLOW-inoculated B6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J mice at late subclinical (111-113 dpi, dpi), early clinical (125-128 dpi), and advanced stages (162-169 dpi), and non-infected 160-164 days-oldB6.129P2(Cg)-<italic>Cx3cr1<sup>tm1Litt</sup></italic>/J mice.

<title>Acute brain slice preparation and <italic>ex vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging</title>
<p>Before euthanizing an animal, sterile PTFE hydrophilic membrane inserts (PICM0RG50, Sigma) of 0.4 μm pore size were kept in a 6-well plate supplemented with serum free culture media and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1-2 hours in a standard cell culture incubator. For acute slice preparation, the whole mouse brain was removed from the skull and were immersed in ice cold oxygenated ACSF media (LRE-S-LSG10001, Ecocyte Bioscience LLC) saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The cerebellum and olfactory bulb were cut off and the remaining portion of the brain was glued to the bottom of the specimen holder within the tissue slicing chamber of the Vibratome (Leica VT1200) filled with oxygenated ACSF media such that the ventral part of the brain was facing towards us and the dorsal region (surface of cortex) was facing the back of the vibratome blade holder. Subsequently, acute coronal cortical sections of 20 μm thickness were prepared using the vibratome at 4.5 mm amplitude, 84-86 Hz frequency and 2.0-2.5 mm/sec speed. Next, the membrane inserts were incubated with fresh complete growth medium containing 50% MEM (INV-42360032, Invitrogen), 25% BME (INV-21010046, Invitrogen), 5% heat inactivated horse serum (INV-26050070, Invitrogen), 10 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF) (INV-A42627, Invitrogen) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (INV-AF-450-44, Invitrogen). The cut sections were then transferred using a sterile pasteur pipette to the inserts. For nuclear staining, slices were stained with 0.5 mkM Hoechst 33342 (INV-H3570, Invitrogen) for 10 minutes followed by successive washing steps in ACSF media. The slices were then transferred to coverslip bottom petri dish (VWR-MSPP-P35G014C-CS, Mattek Corp MS) for their time-lapse imaging in Leica MICA fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems). In experiments on P2Y6 inhibition, acute brain slices were incubated for 30 minutes with 2 μM P2Y6 inhibitor MRS-2578 (SIG-M0319, SIGMA) re-suspended in 0.1% DMSO with complete growth media, or mock alone (0.1 % DMSO). For Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, slices were incubated simultaneously with 0.5 mkM Hoechst and 0.5 mkM Calbryte 590 AM (VWR-76484-390-EA, AAT Bioquest) for 45 minutes.</p>

<title>Time-lapse imaging</title>
<p>The time-lapse imaging experiments were performed using environmental climate setup in Leica MICA for live cell imaging supplemented with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37 °C to ensure slice viability. Image acquisition parameters for all channels (EGFP, Hoechst and Calbryte 590AM) were kept at 100 ms exposure, with the constant focusing on the green channel (EGFP) to avoid any focal drift. All the time-lapses were subjected to a 3D z stacking of optical sections (1024*1024 pixels) with a total of 10 z-stacks at an average step size of 2 μm from the upper layer of cortex until the bottom of the 20 μm thin cortical brain slice. The entire images were captured by the 10X objective collecting the frames for every 5 mins time interval for the complete 3 hour’s duration. Background for the videos were then deduced from Leica MICA using the thunder and lightning module. 3D representations were drawn by Leica MICA software and image processing of the time lapse videos were further analyzed using ImageJ (FIJI).</p>

<title>Microglial cell tracking and analysis</title>
<p>Time-lapse videos generated by Leica MICA were loaded onto ImageJ (FIJI). Using Manual tracking (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>) and MtrackJ plugin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>), the individual microglial cells were tracked for 3 hours to obtain the quantitative differential cell mobility parameters. Briefly, length was measured by the plugin as the path-length between the first and last current point of the cell track. Accumulated distance was calculated as the sum of the incremental distance measured from all the frames. Euclidean distance as the straight-line distance between the frames. Displacement as the change in position from the first to the last point of the cell track. Mean straight line speed as the total track displacement divided by the net tracking time. Velocity measured by the ratio of accumulated distance to the total track migration time. Track mean speed as the average of all the velocities linking the various tracks. Linearity of forward progression by the ratio between the track mean straight line speed and track mean speed. Finally, the tracking coordinates for each microglial cell for various groups were represented as ross plots by importing these values into the Chemotaxis tool software (Ibidi GmbH, Germany).</p>

Microglial cell mobility, calcium signal intensity and distance were detected by the thresholding detector, where auto generated threshold values were used for each group. Spot filtering was carried out by the quality feature above 42.4. Each spot was linked by the advanced Kalman tracker algorithm (max frame gap=1, alternative linking cost factor=1.05, Kalman search radius = 20, linking max distance=5.0, gap closing max distance=15.0, merging max distance=15.0, cutoff percentile=0.9). For differentiating high and low mobility microglia, track displacement cutoff of 15 μm was set based on the average obtained from the mobility values of normal microglia (displacement &lt; 15 μm; low and displacement ζ 15 μm; high). The mean directional change rate was calculated by averaging the successive angle values for the entire frame.</p>
<p>For microglial morphology analysis, we quantified morphological parameters (radius, area, perimeter, and shape index) for individual EGFP⁺ cells in each time frame of the time-lapse recordings using the TrackMate 7.13.2 plugin in FIJI. Parameter values for each cell were then averaged across the entire three-hour imaging period to obtain a single mean value per cell.</p>

<p>For Western blots, 10% (w/v) brain homogenates (BH) were prepared as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> using RIPA Lysis Buffer (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To analyze brain-derived PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, BH aliquots were diluted with RIPA buffer to achieve 5% BH final concentration and treated with 20 µg/ml proteinase K (New England BioLabs) in the presence of 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 2% Sarcosyl, for 30 min at 37°C. To analyze other proteins, BH was diluted with RIPA buffer to 1% and proteinase digestion was omitted. The resulting samples were supplemented with 4xSDS loading buffer and heated for 10 min in a boiling water bath before loading onto NuPAGE 12% Bis-Tris gels. Wet transfer onto PVDF membranes and probing of Western blots was done according to standard procedures.

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study provides new evidence of a change in how microglia survey neurons during the chronic phase of neurodegeneration, which researchers studying neuroinflammation and its role in neurodegenerative disease should find interesting. In this research, using time-lapse imaging of acute brain slices from prion-affected mice, the researchers show that, unlike in healthy brains, microglia become reactive, lose their territorial boundaries, and become highly mobile, exhibiting &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; behavior, migrating into brain tissue and forming reversible, transient body-to-body contact with neurons. The evidence is <bold>compelling</bold>, with well-executed time-lapse imaging, good quantitative analysis across several disease stages, pharmacological validation of P2Y6 involvement, and the very surprising finding that this mobile behavior persists after microglia are removed from the brain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Subhramanian et al. carefully examined how microglia adapt their surveillance strategies during chronic neurodegeneration, specifically in prion-infected mice. The authors used ex vivo time-lapse imaging and in vitro strategies and found that reactive microglia adopt a highly mobile, &quot;kiss-and-ride&quot; behavior, contrasting the more static surveillance typical of homeostatic microglia. The manuscript provides fundamental mechanistic insights into the dynamics of microglia-neuron interactions, implicates P2Y6 signaling in regulating mobility, and suggests that intrinsic reprogramming of microglia might underlie this behavior, the conclusions are therefore compelling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The novelty of the study is high, particularly the demonstration that microglia lose territorial confinement and dynamically migrate from neuron to neuron under chronic neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>(2) The possible implications of a stimulus-independent high mobility in reactive microglia are particularly striking. Although this is not fully explored.</p>
<p>(3) The use of time-lapse imaging in organotypic slices rather than overexpression models provided a more physiological approach.</p>
<p>(4) Microglia-neuron interactions in neurodegeneration have broad implications for understanding the progression of diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, that are associated with chronic inflammation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Previous weaknesses were addressed.</p>

<p>This is a nice paper focused microglial responses to different clinical stages of prion infection in acute brain slices. The key here is the use of time-lapse imaging that captures the dynamics of microglial surveillance, including morphology, migration, and intracellular neuron/microglial contacts. The authors use a myeloid GFP-labeled transgenic mouse to track microglia in SSLOW-infected brain slices, quantifying differences in motility and microglial-neuronal interactions via live fluorescence imaging. Interesting findings include the elaborate patterns of motility among microglia, the distinct types and durations of intracellular contacts, the potential role of calcium signaling in facilitating hypermobility, and the fact that this motion-promoting status is intrinsic to the microglia, persisting even after the cells have been isolated from infected brains. Although largely a descriptive paper, it offers mechanistic insights, including the role of calcium in supporting microglial movement, with bursts of signaling identified even within the time lapse format, and inhibition studies implicating the purinergic receptor and calcium transient regulator P2Y6 in migratory capacity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The focus on microglia activation and activity in the context of prion disease is interesting</p>
<p>(2) Two different prions produce largely the same response</p>
<p>(3) Use of time-lapse provides insight into the dynamics of microglia, distinguishing between types of contact - mobility vs motility - and providing insight on the duration/transience and reversibility of extensive somatic contacts that include brief and focused connections in addition to soma envelopment.</p>
<p>(4) Imaging window selection (3 hours) guided by prior publications documenting preserved morphology, activity, and gene expression regulation up to 4 hours.</p>
<p>(5) The distinction between high- and low-mobility microglia is interesting, especially given that hypermobility seems to be an innate property of the cells.</p>
<p>(6) The live-imaging approach is validated by fixed tissue confocal imaging.</p>
<p>(7) The variance in duration of neuron/microglia contacts is interesting, although there is no insight into what might dictate which status of interaction predominates</p>
<p>(8) The reversibility of the enveloping action, which is not apparently a commitment to engulfment, is interesting, as is the fact that only neurons are selected for this activity.</p>
<p>(9) The calcium studies use the fluorescent dye calbryte-590, which picks up neuronal and microglial bursts -prolonged bursts are detected in enveloped neurons and in the hyper-mobile microglia - the microglial lead is followed up using MRS-2578 P2Y6 inhibitor that blunts the mobility of the microglia</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my concerns in full - I think this is a very nice addition to the literature.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review)</bold></p>
<p>The Cx3cr1/EGFP line labels all myeloid cells, which makes it difficult to conclude that all observed behaviors are attributable to microglia rather than infiltrating macrophages. The authors refer to this and include it as a limitation. Nonetheless, complementary confirmation by additional microglia markers would strengthen their claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment regarding the cellular identity of the enveloping myeloid cells. As suggested, we performed triple co-immunostaining of SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice using markers for neurons (NeuN), myeloid cells (IBA1), and resident microglia (TMEM119 or P2Y12). Because formic acid treatment used to deactivate prions abolishes the EGFP signal, we relied on IBA1 staining to identify the myeloid population. Our results confirmed that IBA1⁺ cells exhibiting the envelopment behavior are also TMEM119⁺ and P2Y12⁺, consistent with a resident microglial phenotype. These new data are presented in Figures S3 and S4 and described in the final section of the Results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although the authors elegantly describe dynamic surveillance and envelopment hypothesis, it is unclear what the role of this phenotype is for disease progression, i.e., functional consequences. For example, are the neurons that undergo sustained envelopment more likely to degenerate?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this important question regarding the functional implications of neuronal envelopment. At present, technical limitations prevent us from continuously tracking the fate of individual enveloped neurons in prion-infected mice. Nevertheless, our recent study demonstrated that P2Y12 knockout increases the prevalence of neuronal envelopment and accelerates disease progression (Makarava et al., 2025, J. Neuroinflammation). These findings suggest that while microglial envelopment may represent an adaptive response to increased neuronal surveillance demands, excessive envelopment, as observed in the absence of P2Y12, appears to be maladaptive. A new paragraph has been added to the Discussion to address this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, although the increase in mobility is a relevant finding, it would be interesting for the authors to further comment on what the molecular trigger(s) is/are that might promote this increase. These adaptations, which are at least long-lasting, confer apparent mobility in the absence of external stimuli.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. The molecular mechanisms underlying the increased mobility of microglia in prion-infected brains remain to be identified, and we plan to pursue this question in future studies. One possibility we briefly discuss in the revised manuscript is that proinflammatory signaling, mediated by secreted cytokines or interleukins, may drive this phenotype. Supporting this hypothesis, recent work has shown that IFNγ enhances microglial migration in the adult mouse cortex (doi:10.1073/pnas.2302892120). This work has been cited in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors performed, as far as I could understand, the experiments in cortical brain regions. There is no clear rationale for this in the manuscript, nor is it clear whether the mobility is specific to a particular brain region. This is particularly important, as microglia reactivity varies greatly depending on the brain region.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this insightful comment highlighting the importance of regional determinants of microglial reactivity, which indeed aligns with our ongoing research interests. In our previous studies, neuronal envelopment by microglia was observed consistently across all prion-affected brain regions exhibiting neuroinflammation. Assuming that envelopment requires microglial mobility, it is reasonable to speculate that microglia are mobile in all brain regions affected by prions and displaying neuroinflammatory responses. In the current study, we focused exclusively on the cortex because this region was used for quantifying the prevalence of neuronal envelopment as a function of disease progression in our prior work (DOI: 10.1172/JCI181169), which guided the present study design. Our ongoing investigations indicate that the prevalence of envelopment is region-dependent and correlates with microglial reactivity/the degree of neuroinflammation. In prion diseases, the degree of microglial reactivity is dictated by the tropism of specific prion strains to distinct brain regions. Notably, our prior studies have shown that strain-specific sialylation patterns of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> glycans play a key role in determining both regional strain tropism and the extent of neuroinflammatory activation (DOI: 10.3390/ijms21030828, DOI: 10.1172/JCI138677). In response to this comment, we have added a brief rationale for using the cortex in the Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would be relevant information to have an analysis of the percentage of cells in normal, sub-clinical, early clinical, and advanced stages that became mobile. Without this information, the speed/distance alone can have different interpretations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. The percentage of mobile cells across normal, sub-clinical, early clinical, and advanced disease stages is presented in Figure 3b and described in the final paragraph of the section “Enveloping behavior of reactive myeloid cells.”</p>

<p>The number of individual cells tracked has been provided, but not the number of individual mice. The sex of the mice is not provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used N = 3 animals per group throughout the study; this information has now been added to the figure legends. Animals of both sexes were included in random proportions. The sex information is now listed for each experiment in the Animals subsection of the Methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The statistical approach is not clear; was each cell treated as a single observation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, with the exception of the heat map in Figure 2d, all mobility parameters are analyzed and presented at the level of individual cells, with each cell treated as an independent observation. The primary aim of this study is to characterize behavioral patterns of single reactive myeloid cells. Analyzing data at the cell level allows us to capture the full distribution of cell behaviors and to preserve biologically meaningful heterogeneity within and across animals. By contrast, averaging values per animal would largely mask this variability. In the heat map in Figure 2d, data are averaged per animal, specifically to illustrate inter-animal variability within each group and to visualize changes across disease progression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The potential for heterogeneity among animals has not been addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address this concern, we now include a new Supplemental Figure (Figure S4)  presenting the data using Superplots, in which individual cells are shown as dots, animal-level average as circles, and group means calculated based on animals as black horizontal lines. These plots demonstrate that cell mobility measures are highly consistent across animals within each group, indicating limited inter-animal heterogeneity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Validation of prion accumulation at each clinical stage of the disease is not provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide validation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation across disease stages by Western blot, along with quantitative analysis, in a new Supplemental Figure (Figure S2). This confirms progressive PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation with advancing disease.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How were the numerous captures of cells handled to derive morphological quantitative values? Based on the videos, there is a lot of movement and shape-shifting.</p>

<p>The following description has been added to Methods to clarify morphology analysis: For microglial morphology analysis, we quantified morphological parameters (radius, area, perimeter, and shape index) for individual EGFP⁺ cells in each time frame of the time-lapse recordings using the TrackMate 7.13.2 plugin in FIJI. Parameter values for each cell were then averaged across the entire three-hour imaging period to obtain a single mean value per cell.</p>

<p>While it is recognized that there are limits to what can be measured simultaneously with live imaging, the authors appear to have fixed tissues from each time point too - it would be very interesting to know if the extent or prion accumulation influences the microglial surveillance - i.e., do the enveloped ones have greater pathology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is very interesting question which is difficult to answer due to technical challenges in monitoring the pathology or faith of individual neuronal cells as a function of their envelopment in live prion-infected animals. Our previous work revealed that both accumulation of total PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in a brain and  accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> specifically in lysosomal compartments of microglia due to phagocytosis precedes the onset of neuronal envelopment (DOI: 10.1172/JCI181169).  Moreover, the onset of neuronal envelopment occurred after a noticeable decline in neuronal levels of Grin1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor essential for synaptic plasticity. Reactive microglia were observed to envelop Grin1-deficient neurons, suggesting that microglia respond to neuronal dysfunction. However, considering that envelopment is very dynamic and - in most cases - reversible, correlating the degree of envelopment with dysfunction of individual neurons is technically challenging.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) More details on members of the PY2 receptor family expressed in microglia would be helpful. The study highlights a previously published prion-induced decline in the expression of P2Y12, a microglial marker that is required for intracellular neuron-microglial contacts, and P2Y6, involved in calcium transients, which is required for hypermotility. How are members of this family of receptors regulated at the gene and/or protein level in microglial and given their responsiveness to nucleotide ligands, are other members implicated in the properties being quantified here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. To address this point, we examined the expression of multiple P2Y receptors and ATP-gated P2X channels known to contribute to microglial surveillance, activation, motility, and phagocytosis, alongside the activation markers Tlr2, Cd68, and Trem2. Bulk brain transcript analyses indicated that all examined genes were upregulated in SSLOW-infected mice relative to controls (new Figure S5a). However, because microglial proliferation substantially increases microglial numbers during prion disease progression, bulk tissue measurements do not necessarily reflect per-cell expression levels. Therefore, we normalized gene expression values to the microglia-specific marker Tmem119, whose per-cell expression remains stable across disease stages (Makarava et al., 2025, J. Neuroinflammation). After normalization, Tlr2, Cd68, and Trem2 were increased approximately 10-, 6-, and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, P2 receptor genes showed more modest changes: P2ry6 increased ~3-fold, P2ry13 ~2-fold, and P2rx7 ~1.3-fold, while P2rx4 remained unchanged (Figure S5a). Within the scope of the present study, we focused on P2Y6 due to (i) its role in regulating calcium transients, (ii) the magnitude of its upregulation relative to other P2 receptors, and (iii) its highly microglia-specific expression in the CNS. We note that currently available commercial P2Y6 antibodies lack sufficient specificity, making reliable assessment of protein-level expression challenging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Is P2Y6 expressed in any other cell type that might account for the blunted mobility of the microglia? The authors mention P2Y12 also identifies the GFP cells; however, it would be beneficial to highlight the specificity of the target in the ex vivo treatment of the infected slices.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the brain, both P2Y12 and P2Y6 are considered highly specific to resident microglia under physiological and neuroinflammatory conditions. P2Y12 is, in fact, widely used as a canonical marker of homeostatic and resident microglia. While P2Y6 is also expressed in peripheral myeloid cells such as macrophages, our phenotypic characterization indicates that the cells exhibiting neuronal envelopment are TMEM119⁺ and P2Y12⁺, consistent with a resident microglial identity. These data, including new analyses added to the revised manuscript, support that the cells responding to P2Y6 signaling in our ex vivo slice experiments are resident microglia.</p>

<p>(3) The fluorescent mouse lacks Cx3cr1 - have the authors investigated why there were no apparent consequences, at least in the context of prion infection? Are there functional redundancies that might be harnessed? Does this impact the generalizability of the findings here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The role of Cx3cr1 in prion disease has been directly examined in two independent studies (doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.000442; doi: 10.1186/1471-2202-15-44). One study reported no effect of Cx3cr1 deficiency on disease incubation time, whereas the other observed only a minor difference. Importantly, both studies found no detectable alterations in microglial activation patterns, cytokine expression, or PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition in Cx3cr1-deficient mice compared to wild-type controls. Our own data (Figure S1) are consistent with these findings: disease course and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition were comparable between Cx3cr1/EGFP and wild-type mice. Moreover, we observed reactive microglial envelopment of neurons in both genotypes. Microglia isolated from SSLOW-infected Cx3cr1/EGFP mice also displayed similarly elevated mobility in vitro, in agreement with our previous observations of high mobility of microglia isolated from SSLOW-infected wild-type mice (Makarava et al., 2025, J. Neuroinflammation). Taken together, these results indicate that Cx3cr1 is not a key determinant of reactive microglial mobility or envelopment behavior in prion disease. Thus, the use of the Cx3cr1/EGFP reporter line does not compromise the generalizability of our conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The distinction between high mobility and low mobility microglia is interesting - is there any evidence to suggest that the slow-moving microglia are actually a separate class - do enveloping microglia exhibit both mobility states - can the authors comment on plasticity here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this insightful comment, which closely aligns with our ongoing interests. At present, we do not have evidence to support that high- versus low-mobility microglia represent distinct molecular phenotypes. Given that our time-lapse imaging spans only a three-hour window, it remains unclear whether these mobility states reflect stable cell-intrinsic properties or transient phases within a dynamic surveillance process. Notably, we observed that individual cells can transition between more stationary, neuron-associated states and highly mobile states within the same imaging session. In future work, we intend to investigate whether prolonged interactions with neuronal somas or other microenvironmental cues may drive diversification of reactive myeloid cell phenotypes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In the discussion, the authors speculate about &quot;collective coordinated decision making&quot; - that seems a stretch unless greater context is provided. The fact that several microglia can be found in contact with an individual neuron and that each microglia can connect with multiple neurons simultaneously is certainly interesting; however, evidence for hive behavior is entirely lacking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that our previous wording overstated the interpretation. The statement regarding collective decision-making has been removed.</p>
