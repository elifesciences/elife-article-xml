<title>Abstract</title><p>Asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) generate two daughter cells with identical genetic information but distinct cell fates through epigenetic mechanisms. However, the process of partitioning different epigenetic information into daughter cells remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell rather than the apoptotic one during ACDs in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. The absence of NuRD triggers apoptosis via the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 pathway, while an ectopic gain of NuRD enables apoptotic daughter cells to survive. We identify the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>– adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase) complex as a crucial regulator of NuRD’s asymmetric segregation. V-ATPase interacts with NuRD and is asymmetrically segregated into the surviving daughter cell. Inhibition of V-ATPase disrupts cytosolic pH asymmetry and NuRD asymmetry. We suggest that asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase may cause distinct acidification levels in the two daughter cells, enabling asymmetric epigenetic inheritance that specifies their respective life-versus-death fates.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>1. We have revised statements related to &quot;NuRD asymmetry being regulated by differential RNA amounts&quot; and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript on page 14 line 2.
2. To further clarify our quantification approach, we have updated Figure S4A and the &quot;Live-Cell Imaging and Quantification&quot; section in the Materials and Methods.
3.For Figure 3D, due to the small sample size precluding normality verification, we applied the Wilcoxon test with 1 as the theoretical median. The revised Figure 3D illustrates the updated statistical significance.
For Figure 3E, where the sample size also hindered normality verification, we conducted the Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate the overall effect. Additionally, Dunn' s multiple comparisons test was utilized to examine the differences between groups. The revised Figure 3E illustrates the updated statistical significance.
For Figure 3G, the reviewer pointed out the small sample size and the limited statistical power due to having only three data points per group. To address this, we revised the figure to visually present each data point, aiming to more clearly illustrate the variation trends.
For Figure 6B, following the reviewer's suggestion, we compared the DMSO group directly with the Baf A1 group, updating Figure 6B to reflect this comparison as advised.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Asymmetric cell division (ACD) gives rise to two daughter cells that possess identical genetic material but distinct cell fates, playing a crucial role in both development and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Royall and Jessberger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wooten et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zion et al., 2020</xref>). Both extrinsic and intrinsic mechanisms determine distinct daughter cell fates after ACD. While extrinsic mechanisms, such as exposure to signaling cues from the local niche, have been extensively studied and are known to define stem cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>), the intrinsic mechanisms are more complex and largely unresolved, despite several proteins, RNA molecules, and organelles having been implicated in the regulation of some types of ACD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zion et al., 2020</xref>). Epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in guiding the two daughter cells toward establishing differential gene expression profiles, ultimately defining their unique cell identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allis and Jenuwein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Escobar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stewart-Morgan et al., 2020</xref>). During the ACD of <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs), pre-existing and newly synthesized histones H3 and H4 are asymmetrically segregated towards the stem daughter cell and the differentiating daughter cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wooten et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the extent to which epigenetic information is asymmetrically inherited through ACD in other organisms and the mechanism by which this process occurs remains elusive.</p>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> represents a valuable model for investigating ACD, given its invariant cell lineage and conserved mechanisms of ACD. During hermaphrodite development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 131 somatic cells undergo programmed cell death, with the majority produced through ACD that create a large cell programmed for survival and a small cell programmed to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sulston et al., 1983a</xref>) The opposing cell fates of daughter cells, i.e., to live or die, offer a compelling experimental system for investigating how epigenetic inheritance determines life versus death decisions during ACD. It is noteworthy that 105 of the 131 apoptotic cells arise from neuronal lineages, of which the Q neuroblast represents a tractable system for studying ACD and apoptosis at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ellis and Horvitz, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hedgecock et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sulston and Horvitz, 1977</xref>). During the first larval stage, Q neuroblasts on the left (QL) and right (QR) undergo three rounds of asymmetric divisions, which produce three different neurons and two apoptotic cells (Q.aa and Q.pp), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>In the nematode, the classic apoptotic pathway initiates upon activation of the BH3-only protein EGL-1 in the cells that are fated to die. EGL-1 binds to the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like protein CED-9, which facilitates the release of the pro-apoptotic protein CED-4, leading to caspase CED-3 activation. Activated caspase promotes the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic cells, which triggers the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells via partially redundant signaling pathways such as the CED-1/CED-6/CED-7 pathway and the CED-2/CED-5/CED-12 pathway. Proper transcriptional regulation of the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene is vital for life-versus-death decisions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Conradt and Horvitz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nehme and Conradt, 2008</xref>). Although the cell-specific transcriptional regulator has been identified in certain cells, including the sexually dimorphic HSN and CEM neurons, M4 motor neuron, NSM neuron, P11.aaap cell, ABpl/rpppapp, and the tail spike cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hirose et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jiang and Wu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nehme and Conradt, 2008</xref>), the general upstream regulators of <italic>egl-1</italic> at the chromatin remodeling or epigenetic level are unclear. Two NSM neuroblasts undergo ACDs to each generate a larger NSM cell programmed to survive and a smaller NSM sister cell programmed to die (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sulston et al., 1983b</xref>). The PIG-1 kinase-dependent asymmetric partitioning of the Snail-like transcription factor, CES-1, represses <italic>egl-1</italic> transcription in the larger NSM sister cells, thereby preventing their apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hatzold and Conradt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wei et al., 2020</xref>) However, the mechanism underlying the asymmetrical activation of <italic>egl-1</italic> in other ACDs remains elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate the enrichment of the NuRD complex in cells that are predetermined to survive, and its role in suppressing the EGL-1-CED-9-CED-4-CED-3 apoptotic pathway through repression of the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene. Furthermore, we report the interaction between the NuRD complex and the V-ATPase complex, and reveal that during asymmetric cell division, the localization of the V-ATPase complex and cytoplasmic pH are asymmetrical, thereby contributing to the polarized segregation of the NuRD complex.</p>

<title>NuRD asymmetric segregation during neuroblast ACDs</title>
<p>In order to gain insights into the molecular distinctions between apoptotic and surviving cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, we employed the SPLiT single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) platform to compare their transcriptomes (Figure S1A-S1C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rosenberg et al., 2018</xref>). The expression of the critical somatic apoptosis-inducing gene <italic>egl-1</italic> was used to distinguish the apoptotic and surviving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conradt et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, we identified transcripts encoding subunits of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD; also known as Mi-2) complex in cells where <italic>egl-1</italic> expression was indiscernible (Figure S1D-S1F, Supplementary Table 1). The NuRD complex represents an evolutionarily conserved protein complex associated with chromatin that couples the activities of chromatin-remodeling ATPases with histone deacetylases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lai and Wade, 2011</xref>). NuRD-mediated alterations in chromatin structure are vital for appropriate transcriptional regulation during cell fate determination and lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lai and Wade, 2011</xref>), suggesting that NuRD may serve as a candidate epigenetic factor to specify cell fate between survival and death.</p>
<p>To investigate whether NuRD components are distributed asymmetrically between apoptotic and surviving daughter cells, we overexpressed GFP-tagged NuRD subunits within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> Q neuroblast lineages. Q.a neuroblast undergoes ACD to generate a large surviving Q.ap cell and a small apoptotic Q.aa cell (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that GFP-tagged NuRD subunits, including the histone deacetylase HDA-1, the histone binding protein LIN-53, the nucleosome remodeling factor CHD-3, and the MEP-1 protein were enriched asymmetrically in the surviving QR.ap cell during QR.a division (Figure S2, Supplementary Movie S1 and S2). Notably, NuRD asymmetric distribution occurred within several minutes after metaphase, while GFP protein translation and chromophore maturation require approximately 30 min in Q neuroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ou and Vale, 2009</xref>), suggesting that the asymmetric enrichment of NuRD is likely the result of protein redistribution.</p>
<p>To investigate the dynamic distribution of endogenous NuRD during ACD, we generated a GFP knock-in (KI) strain for HDA-1 and an mNeonGreen (NG, green fluorescence) KI line for LIN-53 using CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In QR.a cells, nuclear HDA-1 and LIN-53 were released into the cytoplasm and evenly distributed until metaphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary Movie S3 and S4). At anaphase, HDA-1 and LIN-53 became enriched in the posterior part of QR.a but became less detectable in the anterior part (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A-B</xref>, Supplementary Movie S3 and S4). We quantified the fluorescence intensity ratio between the posterior and anterior chromatids of QR.a, and between QR.ap and QR.aa nuclei, and found that nuclear HDA-1 or LIN-53 asymmetry gradually increased from 1.1-fold at anaphase onset to 1.5 or 1.8-fold upon completion of cytokinesis, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>). We also measured the ratios of fluorescence intensities between the posterior and anterior halves of QR.a, and between QR.ap and QR.aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4A</xref>, see Materials and Methods). NuRD asymmetry became evident at ∼4 minutes and reached a plateau at ∼6 minutes after the anaphase onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4B</xref>). QR.a spent ∼6 minutes from anaphase to the completion of cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ou et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that QR.a cell establishes NuRD asymmetry during ACD.</p>
<p>Similar to QR.a , the dynamic and progressively developing NuRD asymmetry was also observed in the QL.a, QR.p and QL.p cell lineages, which generate apoptotic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4B</xref>). In contrast, an even distribution of HDA-1 and LIN-53 was observed in two surviving daughters of QR, QL, QL.pa and QR.pa cells, which generate two viable siblings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3B</xref>). To investigate whether other epigenetic factors are also asymmetrically segregated during Q cell ACDs, we tagged the MYST family histone acetyltransferase (MYS-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) with GFP. We found that MYS-1::GFP was symmetrically segregated into the apoptotic and surviving daughter cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4B</xref>, Supplementary Movie S5), indicating the specificity of the polarized NuRD partition. The total fluorescence of HDA-1, LIN-53, and MYS-1 remained constant during ACDs, suggesting that protein redistribution may establish NuRD asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figure S4C</xref>). Inhibition of a PAR-1 family kinase PIG-1 led to symmetric Q cell divisions, producing extra neurons derived from some of their apoptotic daughters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cordes et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>pig-1 (gm344)</italic> mutants, HDA-1 and LIN-53 were evenly partitioned during ACDs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>, Supplementary Movie S6 and S7), indicating that asymmetric NuRD segregation depends on the PIG-1 kinase.</p>

<title>NuRD asymmetric segregation in embryonic cell lineages</title>
<p>Given that a significant portion of somatic apoptotic events in <italic>C. elegans</italic>-113 out of 131-occur during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sulston et al., 1983a</xref>), we employed live imaging and automated cell lineage tracing algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Du et al., 2014</xref>) to monitor the asymmetry of NuRD distribution in embryos from the early two- or four-cell stage up to the 350-cell stage. Our analysis indicated that in 15 out of 17 embryonic ACDs that produce apoptotic daughter cells, the surviving daughter cells showed enrichment of HDA-1 and LIN-53, with an average enrichment ratio exceeding 1.5-fold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Supplementary Table 2). Notably, this enrichment reached statistical significance in 6 out of 17 embryonic ACDs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Intriguingly, the MSpppaa cell lineage’s two daughter cells received comparable levels of NuRD, yet its apoptotic daughter cell completes apoptosis approximately 400 minutes post-division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hsieh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sulston et al., 1983b</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that lower NuRD concentrations might promote apoptosis. Conversely, the apoptotic daughter cell of ABaraaaap completes apoptosis within 35 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sulston et al., 1983a</xref>), despite receiving a similar amount of NuRD as its non-apoptotic sibling. Therefore, while the regulation of apoptosis in certain embryonic cells appears to be governed by NuRD-independent mechanisms, NuRD asymmetric segregation is evident in several embryonic cell lineages.</p>

<title>Loss of the deacetylation activity of NuRD causes ectopic apoptosis</title>
<p>To investigate the role of NuRD in determining cell fate, we reduced the deacetylation activity of NuRD using RNA-mediated interference (RNAi). The <italic>hda-1</italic> and <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi efficacy was confirmed by the reduced green fluorescence in the germlines of HDA-1::GFP and LIN-53::mNeonGreen KI animals, as well as the increased acetylation level of histone H3K27 (Figure S6). As reported before, RNAi of either <italic>hda-1</italic> or <italic>lin-53</italic> caused embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shi and Mello, 1998</xref>). RNAi of <italic>lin-53</italic> led to embryos arrested at the gastrulation stage before the generation of apoptotic cells, preventing us from analyzing its roles in somatic apoptosis. In contrast, <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi embryos were arrested between the late gastrulation stage and the bean stage, allowing us to track some of the apoptotic events. To quantify apoptotic events, we used a secreted Annexin V (sAnxV::GFP) sensor to label apoptotic cells with externalized phosphatidylserine (exPS) on the surface of the plasma membrane in <italic>ced-1(e1735)</italic> mutant embryos which inhibits engulfment of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Conradt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mapes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>).

Considering the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by the loss of HDA-1, we cannot exclude the possibility that ectopic cell death might result from global changes in development, even though HDA-1 may directly contribute to the life-versus-death fate determination.</p>

<title>NuRD RNAi upregulates the <italic>egl-1</italic> expression by increasing its H3K27 acetylation</title>
<p>To understand how NuRD regulates apoptotic cell fates, we performed RNA-Seq analyses on WT, <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi and <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi embryos. In both RNAi conditions, we observed 287 or 575 genes that were upregulated or downregulated (|log<sub>2</sub>FD| &gt; 2 and FDR &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary Table 3). Notably, we found that the apoptosis-inducing gene <italic>egl-1</italic> was among the upregulated genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Our quantitative RT-PCR results further confirmed that <italic>egl-1</italic> transcripts were more abundant in <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi and <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi embryos than in control RNAi embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We also used a P<italic>egl-1</italic>::NLS::GFP transcriptional reporter to examine the <italic>egl-1</italic> transcription activity during embryonic development, which allowed us to detect <italic>egl-1</italic> expression while avoiding the adverse effects of <italic>egl-1</italic> overexpression on apoptosis. We found that RNAi of <italic>hda-1</italic> or <italic>lin-53</italic> caused an increased number of P<italic>egl-1</italic>::NLS::GFP positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">S7B</xref>). These results indicate that the loss of NuRD abnormally activates the <italic>egl-1</italic> gene expression.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the loss of histone deacetylase activity in NuRD increased the H3K27ac levels at the <italic>egl-1</italic> locus, as the histone H3K27ac levels are associated with transcription activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heinz et al., 2015</xref>). To test this, we performed ChIP-Seq experiments with the anti-H3K27ac antibody and found that the transcription start site (TSS) and the gene body region of <italic>egl-1</italic> had higher levels of H3K27ac in <italic>hda-1</italic> or <italic>lin-53</italic> RNAi embryos compared to WT, while the H3K27ac levels of genes adjacent to <italic>egl-1</italic> showed no significant changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). This was supported by ChIP-qPCR in <italic>hda-1</italic> RNAi embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).

<title>V-ATPase regulates asymmetric segregation of NuRD during somatic ACDs</title>
<p>To investigate how NuRD is asymmetrically segregated during ACD, we used affinity purification with an anti-GFP antibody and mass spectrometry (MS) to isolate NuRD binding partners from the lysate of HDA-1::GFP KI animals. Our analysis revealed all the previously known NuRD subunits from HDA-1::GFP KI animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Figure S8</xref>, Supplementary Table 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bracken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lai and Wade, 2011</xref>), validating our experimental method. Interestingly, our co-immunoprecipitation and MS with HDA-1::GFP identified 12 subunits of the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (V-ATPase) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>), consistent with a previous report that used FLAG-tagged LIN-53 to identify 4 V-ATPase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Muthel et al., 2019</xref>).

<p>To investigate the role of V-ATPase in NuRD asymmetric segregation in Q neuroblast, we used a pharmacologic inhibitor, bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), to inhibit V-ATPase proton pumping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Furuchi et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yoshimori et al., 1991</xref>). To assess the inhibitory effect of BafA1 on the proton translocation activity of V-ATPase in Q neuroblast, we monitored the cytosolic pH dynamics in dividing QR.a using the super-ecliptic pHluorin. The pHluorin is a pH-sensitive GFP reporter whose fluorescence can be quenched by the acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miesenbock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>). Although BafA1-mediated disruption of lysosomal pH homeostasis is recognized to elicit a wide array of intracellular abnormalities, we found no evidence of such pleiotropic effects at the organismal level with the dosage and duration of treatment employed in this study. In DMSO-treated animals, the pHlourin fluorescence intensity remained constant in the posterior portion that forms QR.ap but was significantly reduced in the anterior portion that forms QR.aa, indicating that the cytoplasm of the future apoptotic cell became more acidic (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S8). This observation is consistent with the recognition that cytosolic acidification is a common feature of both death receptor-mediated and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lagadic-Gossmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matsuyama et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Matsuyama and Reed, 2000</xref>). Notably, BafA1 treatment reduced the pHluorin fluorescence intensity ratio between QR.ap and QR.aa from 1.6-fold to 1.3-fold (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S8), suggesting that BafA1 may disrupt the cytosolic pH asymmetry in dividing QR.a cells by inhibiting V-ATPase activity, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the changes in fluorescence could be due to changes in the amount of pHluorin protein.</p>
<p>We observed that BafA1 treatment resulted in the symmetric segregation of HDA-1 during QR.a division (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref> and Supplementary Movie S9). Notably, neither DMSO nor BafA1 treatment affected the asymmetry in daughter cell size (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref> and Supplementary Movie S9), suggesting that intracellular acidification, regulated by V-ATPase activity, specifically affects the NuRD asymmetric segregation without affecting the asymmetry in daughter cell size. We also investigated whether the small QR.aa cell carrying ectopic NuRD could escape apoptosis. In DMSO-treated animals, QR.aa cells underwent apoptosis, and 12 out of 13 QR.aa cells were engulfed and degraded by a neighboring epithelial cell within 120 min after birth. However, in BafA1-treated animals, QR.aa inherited similar levels of HDA-1::GFP as its sister cell, and 11 out of 12 QR.aa cells carrying ectopic NuRD survived for over 120 min and formed a short neurite-like outgrowth (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). To confirm whether the long-lived QR.aa was a consequence of the ectopic gain of NuRD, we depleted HDA-1 within Q cell lineages using the auxin-inducible protein degradation (AID) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). By introducing the degron sequence into the <italic>hda-1</italic> locus and expressing the TIR1 F-box protein under the Q cell-specific <italic>egl-17</italic> promoter, we showed that HDA-1::GFP fluorescence in Q cells was substantially decreased under auxin treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Administration of auxin restored QR.aa apoptosis in BafA1-treated animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). These results suggest that V-ATPase activity-dependent NuRD asymmetric segregation contributes to the specification of the live-death fate.</p>
<p>To understand how the V-ATPase regulates NuRD asymmetric segregation, we generated a transgenic strain expressing wrmScarlet-tagged VHA-17, which is the e subunit of the V0 domain. Using this strain, we were able to examine the dynamic distribution of V-ATPase during QR.a cell division. Like HDA-1, V-ATPase was also asymmetrically enriched in the surviving QR.ap portion (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S10). This observation suggests that V-ATPase and NuRD may co-segregate asymmetrically during ACD. We also found that BafA1 treatment disrupted V-ATPase asymmetric distribution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-B</xref> and Supplementary Movie S10), indicating the importance of the proton-pumping activity of V-ATPase in its asymmetric segregation. Therefore, our results suggest that V-ATPase may facilitate the asymmetric distribution of NuRD through its proton pumping activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex during ACD is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, and is critical for the differential expression of apoptosis activator <italic>egl-1</italic> and the life-versus-death fate decision (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Specifically, we have provided evidence that the reduced level of NuRD in the apoptotic daughter cell leads to an increased level of H3K27ac, an epigenetic modification known to be associated with active gene expression, at the <italic>egl-1</italic> locus, resulting in the upregulation of <italic>egl-1</italic> expression and subsequent induction of apoptosis. Based on our results, we propose a dual-function model of V-ATPase in NuRD asymmetric segregation: (i) V-ATPase interacts with NuRD, both of which are asymmetrically segregated into the surviving cell; (ii) the asymmetrical activity of V-ATPase generates a more acidic cytoplasmic environment in the future apoptotic cell portion compared to the surviving portion, which might contribute to the asymmetric segregation of V-ATPase and NuRD. This model sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis during ACD, and opens up new avenues for further investigation into the intricate interplay between V-ATPase, NuRD, and epigenetic modifications in the context of cell fate decisions.</p>
<p>The transcript asymmetry detected by scRNA-seq may not correspond to the protein asymmetry detected by microscopic imaging. Our scRNA-seq data shows that 6487 out of 8624 genes were not detected in <italic>egl-1</italic>-positive cells, the putative apoptotic cells. Cells that are <italic>egl-1</italic> positive may be undergoing apoptosis, rendering the asymmetry of NuRD complex transcripts insignificant in inferring protein asymmetry. Thus, the observed transcript asymmetry of the NuRD subunits between live and dead cells may be coincidental with NuRD protein asymmetry during asymmetric neuroblast division, rather than serving as a regulatory mechanism.</p>
<p>The intrinsic mechanisms governing binary cell fate decisions involve asymmetric cortical localization of cell fate determinants, polarized partitioning of RNA species, unequal segregation of organelles, and biased distribution of damaged proteins or protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sunchu and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Venkei and Yamashita, 2018</xref>). Despite this, little is known about the asymmetric segregation of epigenetic modification enzymes during ACDs, nor the functions of polarized V-ATPase distribution and cytoplasmic proton asymmetry during this process. Our findings provide new insights into the asymmetric segregation of cell-intrinsic factors and the previously unrecognized roles of V-ATPase and cytosolic acidification in this process.</p>
<p>Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain the V-ATPase-dependent asymmetric segregation of NuRD. Firstly, a polarized intracellular transportation system could selectively deliver NuRD-V-ATPase-containing organelles to the surviving daughter cell. Although V-ATPase is primarily known for its localization and function in the late endosome and lysosome, recent evidence suggests that V-ATPase subunits are synthesized and assembled on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abbas et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Graham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings demonstrate that V-ATPase colocalizes with the ER marker during ACDs, suggesting that NuRD-V-ATPase may be delivered as cargo on the ER or ER-derived vesicles (Figure S9). As reported in previous studies, a polarized microtubule transportation system, governed by specific motor proteins and the microtubule tracks, is responsible for the asymmetric segregation of signaling endosomes during ACDs of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sensory organ precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Derivery et al., 2015</xref>). A similar biased transportation system may play a role in the asymmetric segregation of NuRD-V-ATPase-containing organelles.</p>
<p>Secondly, the surviving daughter cell chromatids may have a greater ability to recruit NuRD than their apoptotic sister. This could be due to a higher number of yet unknown NuRD recruiting factors on chromatids or specific posttranslational modifications of chromosomal proteins that enhance the chromosomal recruitment of NuRD. Despite having an identical DNA sequence, sister chromatids can be distinguished by chromosomal proteins or modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tran et al., 2012</xref>), which likely provides the specific molecular cues for asymmetric NuRD recruitment. The NuRD asymmetry on chromosomes (1.5∼1.8-fold between QR.ap and QR.aa nuclei) is greater than that between the two daughter cells (approximately 1.3-fold) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), suggesting that polarized NuRD-V-ATPase transportation and distinct NuRD affinity from sister chromatids may act in concert to establish NuRD asymmetry.</p>
<p>The observation of asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex during cell divisions suggests that the mother cell may play a role in initiating the fate specification of its daughter cells. This notion is supported by studies conducted on <italic>Drosophila</italic> male germline stem cells (GSCs) which demonstrated that the old and new histone H3-H4 or unequal amounts of histone H3 variant CENP-A were incorporated into sister chromatids prior to cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ranjan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tran et al., 2012</xref>). Although these patterns were not observed in cell types other than GSCs, asymmetric NuRD segregation was found to be common in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref>). In 395 tracked embryonic cell divisions that generated two surviving daughter cells, NuRD was equally distributed in 390 cases, but in five cases, significant differences in HDA-1 and LIN-53 levels were observed between siblings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). This observation suggests that biased NuRD segregation may contribute to binary cell fate decisions beyond apoptosis. In the embryonic cerebral cortex of mammals, approximately 30% of newborn cells undergo programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Voiculescu et al., 2000</xref>), which is a significantly higher rate than observed in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> where only 12% of somatically born cells undergo apoptosis (131 apoptotic cells among 1090 somatically born cells). Thus, it is worth exploring whether brain stem cell divisions employ asymmetric NuRD segregation to specify daughter cell fates. Further studies on polarity establishment hold promise in elucidating the mechanisms underlying the asymmetric inheritance of epigenetic information.</p>

<title>Live-cell imaging and quantification</title>
<p>Live imaging of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, larvae, or young adults followed our established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). L1 larvae or young-adult worms were anesthetized with 0.1 mmol/L levamisole in M9 buffer, mounted on 3% (wt/vol) agarose pads maintained at 20°C. Our imaging system includes an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) equipped with a Zeiss 100×/1.46 numerical aperture (NA) objective, an Andor iXon+ EM-CCD camera, and 488 and 561-nm lines of a Sapphire CW CDRH USB Laser System attached to a spinning disk confocal scan head (Yokogawa CSU-X1 Spinning Disk Unit). Images were acquired by μManager (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.micro-manager.org">https://www.micro-manager.org</ext-link>). Time-lapse images of Q cell divisions were acquired with an exposure time of 200 msec every 1 min. Recent advancements in optical and camera technologies permit the acquisition of Z-stacks without perturbing Q cell division or overall animal development. Z-stack images were acquired over a range of -1.6 to +1.6 μm from the focal plane, at intervals of 0.8 μm. The field-of-view spaned 160 μm × 160 μm, and the laser power, as measured at the optical fiber, was approximately 1 mW. ImageJ software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) was used to perform image analysis and measurement. Image stacks were z-projected using the average projection for quantification and using the maximum projection for visual display. To follow the cell fate of QR.aa in WT, BafA1- or BafA1 and IAA-treated worms, time-lapse images were acquired with 300 msec for 561 nm and 100 msec for 488 nm exposure time at 5-minute intervals. To image P<italic>hsp-16.41</italic>::sAnxV::GFP positive cells in WT, mutant, or RNAi animals, we incubated the eggs at 33 °C for 30 min to induce the reporter expression 3 hours post-egg-laying. After we kept the eggs at 20 °C for 2 hours, we imaged them with an exposure time of 200 msec. To acquire time-lapse images of P<italic>egl-1</italic>::NLS::GFP positive cells during embryonic development, we dissected 2-4 cell-stage embryos from gravid adults and imaged them with an exposure time of 300 msec every 5 min.</p>
<p>The quantifications of cellular fluorescence intensity ratios in Q cell lineages were described in Figure S4A. We used the mCherry-labeled plasma membrane to circumscribe Q cells (Region of Interest). To determine the ratios of fluorescence intensities in the posterior to anterior half (P/A) of Q.a lineages or A/P of Q.p lineages, the cell in the mean intensity projection was divided into posterior and anterior halves. ImageJ software was used to measure the mean fluorescence intensities of two halves with background subtraction. The slide background’s mean fluorescence intensity was measured in a region devoid of worm bodies. The background-subtracted mean fluorescence intensities of the two halves were divided to calculate the ratio. The same procedure was used to determine the fluorescence intensity ratios between two daughter cells. Total fluorescence intensity was the sum of the posterior and anterior fluorescence intensities or the sum of fluorescence intensities from two daughter cells (Figure S4A). The ROIs for measuring the mean fluorescence intensities of nuclei were delineated as areas containing mCherry-tagged histone within each cell. The background-subtracted mean fluorescence intensities of the two nuclei were divided to calculate the nuclear intensity ratios.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry</title>
<p>GFP transgenic or knock-in worms were raised on one hundred 90-mm NGM plates. Animals were collected and washed with M9 buffer three times. For each replicate, the lysate was made from 1∼2 ml packed worms with 3∼4 ml of 0.5-mm diameter glass beads using FastPrep-24 (MP Biomedicals) in lysis buffer [pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1x cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche (Complete, EDTA free), 40 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>]. Worm lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000g for 30 min at 4 °C. For anti-GFP immunoprecipitation (IP), the supernatant was incubated with GFP-Trap A beads (Chromoteck, GTA20) for 1 hr. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. To detect the interaction between the V-ATPase subunit and HDA-1, beads are boiled with 1X SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer for SDS–PAGE and western blot. Otherwise, proteins were eluted from beads with 300 μl 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 2.5) Add 15 μl 1.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) to the eluted protein, followed by precipitation using 100 μl trichloroacetic acid and re-dissolution in 60 μl 8 M Urea, 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) for MS. MS Samples were then reduced in 5 mM TCEP, alkylated by 10 mM iodoacetamide, and diluted four-fold with 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The 0.2 μg trypsin was used to digest 10 μg protein in 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 20 mM methylamine overnight at 37°C. The resultant peptides were desalted by ZipTip pipette tips (Merck Millipore). For liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis, peptides were separated by an EASY-nLCII integrated nano-HPLC system (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark) directly interfaced to a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were loaded on an analytical fused-silica capillary column (150 mm in length, 75 mm in internal diameter; Upchurch) packed with 5 mm, 300 Å C-18 resin (Varian). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid, while mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid and 100% acetonitrile. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer was operated through Xcalibur 2.1.2 software in data-dependent acquisition mode. A single full-scan mass spectrum was used in the orbitrap (400–1,800 m/z in mass range, 60,000 in resolution) followed by ten data-dependent tandem mass spectrometry scans at 27% normalized collision energy (HCD). The tandem mass spectrometry spectra results were searched against the <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteome database by the Proteome Discoverer (version PD1.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<p>To block V-ATPase proton pump activity in the L1-L2 larvae, which have cuticle layers that may compromise agent penetration, the Bafilomycin A1 treatment was designed based on the published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kumsta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Papandreou and Tavernarakis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pivtoraiko et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, gravid worms were placed in 1 drop of ddH<sub>2</sub>O containing 3% (v/v) pelleted OP50 and 100 μM bafilomycin A1 (Abcam, dissolved in DMSO) for 16 h at 20 ℃. After incubation, L1 larvae were washed with M9 buffer and recovered for 5 h on NG agar plates before imaging.</p>
<p>To achieve Q cell conditional HDA-1 depletion, the auxin-inducible degradation (AID) was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The natural auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) was purchased from Alfa Aesar (#A10556). A 400 mM solution in ethanol was stored at 4°C as stock. Before imaging, L1 larvae were transferred to the S basal buffer supplemented with 3% (v/v) pelleted OP50 and 4 mM of auxin for a 1.5 h treatment.</p>

<title>Coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot</title>
<p>For immunoprecipitation of endogenous V-ATPase A subunit with HDA-1, HDA-1-GFP knock-in worms were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer [pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 2x cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche (Complete, EDTA free), 40 mM NaF, 5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>]. The soluble fractions from worm lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP GFP-Trap A beads (Chromoteck, GTA20) for 1 hr at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer containing 1x cocktail of protease inhibitors from Roche (Complete, EDTA free) and were then transferred to new tubes. Beads were washed again with 100 mM PB (pH 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, or 7.5) and boiled in 1X SDS loading buffer under 95 ℃ for 5min. The protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting.</p>
<p>Protein samples were resolved by SDS–PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Each membrane was divided into two parts to be incubated with GFP (Abcam ab290, 1:4,000) or ATP6V1A (Abcam ab199326, 1:2,000) primary antibodies, followed by HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H&amp;L) (Easybio, 1:5,000) secondary antibodies.</p>
<p>Quantification of the endogenous V-ATPase A subunit interacting with HDA-1 was performed using HDA-1::GFP bands as a calibration standard. Quantitative densitometry of chemiluminescent bands was performed using ImageJ software.</p>

<p>The authors make the intriguing proposal that the NuRD complex in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which has been linked to regulation of the cell death protein EGL-1 before, becomes asymmetrically distributed after cell division and that this asymmetry relies on V-ATPase activity. Whereas some disagreement remained between the reviewers' and the authors' interpretation, the final version incorporated alternative possibilities in the text, and with careful interpretation, the current manuscript's model is supported by <bold>solid</bold> data, and represents a <bold>valuable</bold> contribution to the field.</p>

<p>Xie et al. propose that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, and plays a crucial role in determining the differential expression of the apoptosis activator egl-1 and thus critical for the life/death fate decision.</p>
<p>Remaining concerns are the following:</p>
<p>The authors should provide the point-by-point response to the following issues. In particular, authors should provide clear reasoning as to why they did not address some of the following comments in the previous revisions. The next response should be directly answering to the following concerns.</p>
<p>(1) Discussion should be added regarding the criticism that NuRD asymmetric segregation is simply a result of daughter cell size asymmetry. It is perfectly fine that the NuRD asymmetry is due to the daughter cell size difference (still the nucleus within the bigger daughter would have more NuRD, which can determine the fate of daughter cells). Once the authors add this clarification, some criticisms about 'control' may become irrelevant.</p>
<p>(2) ZEN-4 is a kinesin that predominantly associates with the midzone microtubules and a midbody during mitosis. Given that midbodies can be asymmetrically inherited during cell division, ZEN-4 is not a good control for monitoring the inheritance of cytoplasmic proteins during asymmetric cell division. Other control proteins, such as a transcriptional factor that predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm during mitosis and enters into nucleus during interphase, are needed to clarify the concern.</p>
<p>As for pHluorin experiments, symmetric inheritance of GFP and mCherry is not an appropriate evidence to estimate the level of pHluorin during asymmmetric Q cell division. This issue remains unsolved.</p>
<p>(3) Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) in Figure S10 can be used for visually checking normality of the data, but it does not guarantee that the distribution of each sample is normal and has the standard deviation compared with the other samples. I recommend the authors to show the actual statistical comparison P-values for each case. The authors also need to show the number of replicate experiments for each figure panel.</p>
<p>The authors left inappropriate graphs in the revised manuscript. In Figure 3E, some error bars are disconnected and the other are stuck in the bars. In Figure S4C, LIN-53 in QR.a/p graph shows lines disconnected from error bars.</p>
<p>I am bit confused with the error bars in Figure 2B. Each dot represents a fluorescent intensity ratio of either HDA-1 or LIN-53 between the two daughter cells in a single animal. Plots are shown with mean and SEM, but several samples (for example, the left end) exhibit the SEM error bar very close to a range of min and max. I might misunderstand this graph but am concerned that Figure 2B may contain some errors in representing these data sets. I would like to ask the authors to provide all values in a table format so that the reviewers could verify the statistical tests and graph representation.</p>
<p>(4) The authors still do not provide evidence that the increase in sAnxV::GFP and Pegl-1gfp or the increase in H3K27ac at the egl-1 gene in hda-1(RNAi) and lin-53(RNAi) animals is not a consequence of global effects on development. Indeed, the images provided in Figure S7B demonstrate that there are global effects in these animals. no causal interactions have been demonstrated.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 4: Due to the lack of appropriate controls for the co-IP experiment (Fig. 4), I remain unconvinced of the claim that the NuRD complex and V-ATPase specifically interact. Concerning the co-IP, the authors now mention that the co-IP was performed three times: &quot;Assay was performed using three biological replicates. Three independent biological replicates of the experiment were conducted with similar results.&quot; However, the authors did not use ACT-4::GFP or GFP alone as controls for their co-IP as previously suggested. This is critical considering that the evidence for a specific HDA-1::GFP - V-ATPase interaction is rather weak (compare interactions between HDA-1::GFP and V-ATPase subunits in Fig 4B with those of HDA-1::GFP and subunits of NuRD in Fig S8B).</p>
<p>(6) Based on Fig 5E, it appears that Bafilomycin treatment causes pleiotropic effects on animals (see differences in HDA-1::GFP signal in the three rows). The authors now state: &quot;Although BafA1-mediated disruption of lysosomal pH homeostasis is recognized to elicit a wide array of intracellular abnormalities, we found no evidence of such pleiotropic effects at the organismal level with the dosage and duration of treatment employed in this study&quot;. However, the 'evidence' mentioned is not shown. It is critical that the authors provide this evidence.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Joint Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>Xie et al. propose that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, and plays a crucial role in determining the differential expression of the apoptosis activator egl-1 and thus critical for the life/death fate decision.</p>
<p>Remaining concerns are the following:</p>
<p>The authors should provide the point-by-point response to the following issues. In particular, authors should provide clear reasoning as to why they did not address some of the following comments in the previous revisions. The next response should be directly answering to the following concerns.</p>
<p>(1) Discussion should be added regarding the criticism that NuRD asymmetric segregation is simply a result of daughter cell size asymmetry. It is perfectly fine that the NuRD asymmetry is due to the daughter cell size difference (still the nucleus within the bigger daughter would have more NuRD, which can determine the fate of daughter cells). Once the authors add this clarification, some criticisms about 'control' may become irrelevant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We will add the following text in the revised discussion on page 14, line 26:</p>
<p>“…We cannot rule out the possibility that NuRD asymmetric segregation results from daughter cell size asymmetry. According to this perspective, the nucleus in the larger daughter cell could possess more NuRD, potentially influencing the fate of the daughter cells. However, it is important to note that the nuclear protein histone or the MYST family histone acetyltransferase is equally segregated in daughter cells of different sizes.….”</p>

<p>(2)    ZEN-4 is a kinesin that predominantly associates with the midzone microtubules and a midbody during mitosis. Given that midbodies can be asymmetrically inherited during cell division, ZEN-4 is not a good control for monitoring the inheritance of cytoplasmic proteins during asymmetric cell division. Other control proteins, such as a transcriptional factor that predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm during mitosis and enters into nucleus during interphase, are needed to clarify the concern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We clarified the issue of ZEN-4 below:</p>
<p>The critique assumes that &quot;midbodies can be asymmetrically inherited during cell division.&quot; However, this assumption does not apply to our study of Q cell asymmetric divisions. In our earlier research, we demonstrated that midbodies in Q cells are released post-division and subsequently engulfed by surrounding epithelial cells (Chai et al., Journal of Cell Biology, 2012). Moreover, we have shown that midbodies from the first cell division in C. elegans embryos are also released and engulfed by the P1 cell (Ou et al., Cell Research, 2013). Therefore, the notion of midbody asymmetric inheritance is irrelevant to this manuscript. Additionally, our manuscript already presents the example of the MYST family histone acetyltransferase, illustrating a nuclear protein that predominantly localizes in the cytoplasm during mitosis and symmetrically enters the nucleus during interphase.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>As for pHluorin experiments, symmetric inheritance of GFP and mCherry is not an appropriate evidence to estimate the level of pHluorin during asymmmetric Q cell division. This issue remains unsolved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the limitation of pHluorin in measuring the pH level in a living cell. Future studies could be performed to measure the dynamics of pH levels when advanced tools are available.</p>

<p>(3) Q-Q plot (quantile-quantile plot) in Figure S10 can be used for visually checking normality of the data, but it does not guarantee that the distribution of each sample is normal and has the standard deviation compared with the other samples. I recommend the authors to show the actual statistical comparison P-values for each case. The authors also need to show the number of replicate experiments for each figure panel.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We will provide P-values for each case and the number of replicate experiments in the revised Figure 5-figure supplement 1 ( corresponding to Figure S10) and the figure legend.</p>

<p>We conducted GFP pull-down experiments and MS spectrometric analysis for

<p>We thank the Reviewer for pointing out this issue. We only checked the viability of the L1 larvae and morphology of animals at the organismal level with the BafA1 dosage and duration of treatment and did not notice any death of the animals and apparent abnormality in morphology (N &gt; 20 for each treatment). However, as the reviewer pointed out, there can be some abnormalities at the cellular level. We thus revised this above description as the following, on page 11, line 27:</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>The authors propose that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex in C. elegans is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, that this plays a crucial role in determining the differential expression of the apoptosis activator egl-1, and that it is therefore critical for the life/death fate decision in this species. If proven, the proposed model of the V-ATPase-NuRD-EGL-1-Apoptosis cascade would shed light onto the mechanisms underlying the regulation of apoptosis fate during asymmetric cell division, and stimulate further investigation into the intricate interplay between V-ATPase, NuRD, and epigenetic modifications. However, the strength of evidence for this is currently incomplete.</p>
<p><bold>Public Review:</bold></p>
<p>Xie et al. propose that the asymmetric segregation of the NuRD complex is regulated in a V-ATPase-dependent manner, and plays a crucial role in determining the differential expression of the apoptosis activator egl-1 and thus critical for the life/death fate decision.</p>
<p>While the model is very intriguing, the reviewers raised concerns regarding the rigor of the method. One issue is with statistics (either insufficient information or inadequate use of statistics), and second is the concern that the asymmetry observed may be caused by one cell dying (resulting in protein degradation, RNA degradation etc). We recommend that the authors address these issues.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We extend our sincere thanks to the Editors and Reviewers for their insightful comments on this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major #1:</p>
<p>There are still many misleading statements/conclusions that are not rigorously tested or that are logically flawed. These issues must be thoroughly addressed for this manuscript to be solid.</p>
<p>(1) Asymmetry detected by scRNA seq vs. imaging may not represent the same phenomenon, thus should not be discussed as two supporting pieces of evidence for the authors' model, and importantly each method has its own flaw. First, for scRNA seq, when cells become already egl-1 positive, those cells may be already dying, and thus NuRD complex's transcripts' asymmetry may not have any significance. The data presented in FigS1D, E show that there are lots of genes (6487 out of 8624) that are decreased in dying cells. Thus, it is not convincing to claim that NuRD asymmetry is regulated by differential RNA amount.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's comment. Indeed, scRNA-seq reveals phenomena different from those observed in protein imaging, and NuRD asymmetry may not be regulated by differential RNA levels. Seven years ago, when we started this project, NuRD asymmetry during asymmetric neuroblast division was unknown. We first found NuRD mRNA asymmetry using scRNA-seq and then NuRD protein asymmetry using fluorescence imaging. We have documented the whole process of discovering NuRD asymmetry, although the asymmetry of NuRD complex transcripts does not necessarily imply protein asymmetry. We have revised statements related to &quot;NuRD asymmetry being regulated by differential RNA amounts&quot; and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript on page 14, line 2:</p>
<p>&quot; The transcript asymmetry detected by scRNA-seq may not correspond to the protein asymmetry detected by microscopic imaging. Our scRNA-seq data shows that 6487 out of 8624 genes were not detected in egl-1-positive cells, the putative apoptotic cells. Cells that are egl-1 positive may be undergoing apoptosis, rendering the asymmetry of NuRD complex transcripts insignificant in inferring protein asymmetry. Thus, the observed transcript asymmetry of the NuRD subunits between live and dead cells may be coincidental with NuRD protein asymmetry during asymmetric neuroblast division, rather than serving as a regulatory mechanism.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Regarding NuRD protein's asymmetry, there are still multiple issues. Most likely explanation of their asymmetry is purely daughter size asymmetry. Because one cell is much bigger than the other (3 times larger), NuRD components, which are not chromatin associated, would be inherited to the bigger cell 3 times more than the smaller daughter. Then, upon nuclear envelope reformation, NuRD components will enter the nucleus, and there will be 3 times more NuRD components in the bigger daughter cell. It is possible that this is actually the underling mechanism to regulate gene expression differentially, but this possibility is not properly acknowledged. Currently, the authors use chromatin associated protein (Mys-1) as 'symmetric control', but this is not necessarily a fair comparison. For NuRD asymmetry to be meaningful, an example of protein is needed that is non-chromatin associated in mitosis, distributed to daughter cells proportional to daughter cell size, and re-enter nucleus after nuclear envelope formation to show symmetric distribution. And if daughter size asymmetry is the cause of NuRD asymmetry, other lineages that do not undergo apoptosis but exhibit daughter size asymmetry would also show NuRD asymmetry. The authors should comment on this (if such examples exist, it is fine in that in those cell types, NuRD asymmetry may be used for differential gene expression, not necessarily to induce cell death, but such comparison provides the explanation for NuRD asymmetry, and puts the authors finding in a better context).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>For more than one decade, we have meticulously explored the relationship between protein asymmetry and cell size asymmetry during ACDs of Q cells. A notable example of even protein distribution is the cytokinetic kinesin ZEN-4, as documented in our 2012 publication in the Journal of Cell Biology (Chai et al., JCB, 2012). This study, primarily focusing on the fate of the midbody post-cell division, also showcased the dynamics of GFP-tagged ZEN-4 during ACDs of QR.a cells in movie S1. Intriguingly, beyond its role in the cytokinetic ring, we observed a uniform dispersal of ZEN-4 throughout the cytoplasm. Remarkably, following cell division, ZEN-4 transitions evenly into the nuclei of the daughter cells, a phenomenon with implications yet to be fully understood. One hypothesis is that ZEN-4's nuclear localization may prevent the formation of ectopic microtubule bundles in the cytosol during interphase. Below, we present a snapshot from our original movie, clearly showing the symmetrical distribution of ZEN-4 into the nuclei of the two daughter cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For the analysis of protein asymmetry between two daughters in Fig S4C, the method of calibration is unclear, making it difficult to interpret the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Figure S4C, we quantified the relative total fluorescence of the Q cell, with the quantification method illustrated in Figure S4A. To further clarify our quantification approach, we have updated Figure S4A and the &quot;Live-Cell Imaging and Quantification&quot; section in the Materials and Methods:</p>
<p>“…To determine the ratios of fluorescence intensities in the posterior to anterior half (P/A) of Q.a lineages or A/P of Q.p lineages, the cell in the mean intensity projection was divided into posterior and anterior halves. ImageJ software was used to measure the mean fluorescence intensities of two halves with background subtraction. The slide background's mean fluorescence intensity was measured in a region devoid of worm bodies. The background-subtracted mean fluorescence intensities of the two halves were divided to calculate the ratio. The same procedure was used to determine the fluorescence intensity ratios between two daughter cells. Total fluorescence intensity was the sum of the posterior and anterior fluorescence intensities or the sum of fluorescence intensities from two daughter cells (Figure S4A). …”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) As for pHluorin experiments, the authors were asked to test the changes in fluorescence observed are due to changes in pH or changes in the amount of pHluorin protein. They need to add a ratio-metric method in this manuscript. A brief mention to Page 12 line 12 is insufficient to clarify this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the concerns about potential changes in pH or pHluorin protein levels. While we cannot completely dismiss the impact of changes in the amount of pHluorin protein, it appears improbable that the asymmetry of pHluorin fluorescence is attributed to an asymmetric amount of pHluorin protein. This inference is supported by the observation that other fluorescent proteins, such as GFP or mCherry, did not exhibit any asymmetry during ACDs of Q cells. An example of GFP alone during the ACD of QL.p is illustrated in figure 5A from Ou and Vale, JCB, 2009. The fluorescence intensities in the large QL.pa cell and the small QL.aa are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Major #2:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Some issues surrounding statistics must be resolved.</p>
<p>(1) Fig. 1FG, 2D, 3BDEG, 5BD and 6B used either one-sample t-test or unpaired two-tailed parametric t-test for statistical comparison. These t-tests require a verification of each sample fitting to a normal distribution. The authors need to describe a statistical test used to verify a normal distribution of each sample.</p>
<p>(2) Fig. 2D, 3D, and 3G have very small sample size (N=3-4, N=6, N=3, respectively), it is possible that a normal distribution cannot be verified. How can the authors justify the use of one-sample t-test and unpaired parametric t-test ?</p>
<p>(3) Statistical comparison in Fig. 2D and Fig. 6B should be re-assessed. For Fig. 2D, the authors need to compare the intensity ratio of HDA-1/LIN53 between sister cells dying within 35 min and those over 400 min. For Fig. 6B, they need to compare the intensity ratio of VHA-17 between DMSO- and BafA1- treated cells at the same time point after anaphase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's advice on the statistical analysis of our data. In response, we performed normality tests on the datasets presented in Figures 1F, 1G, 3B, 5B, 5D, and 6B, all of which passed the tests (as demonstrated in Figure S10). We also acknowledge the reviewer's comment on the inadequate sample sizes in Figures 2D, 3D, 3E, and 3G for fitting a normal distribution. Therefore, we have revised our statistical analysis methods for these figures and updated both the figures and their legends. The revised statistical results support the primary conclusions of this study.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer's observation regarding the small sample size in Figure 2D , which precluded normality verification, and the suggestion to compare sister cells that die within 35 minutes to those surviving over 400 minutes, we adapted our approach. We implemented the Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate the differences among the groups. To assess the specific differences between each group and the 400 min MSpppaap group, we conducted the Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. The revised Figure 2D illustrates the updated statistical significance.</p>
<p>For Figure 3D, due to the small sample size precluding normality verification, we applied the Wilcoxon test with 1 as the theoretical median. The revised Figure 3D illustrates the updated statistical significance.</p>
<p>For Figure 3E, where the sample size also hindered normality verification, we conducted the Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate the overall effect. Additionally, Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was utilized to examine the differences between groups. The revised Figure 3E illustrates the updated statistical significance.</p>
<p>For Figure 3G, the reviewer pointed out the small sample size and the limited statistical power due to having only three data points per group. To address this, we revised the figure to visually present each data point, aiming to more clearly illustrate the variation trends.</p>
<p>For Figure 6B, following the reviewer's suggestion, we compared the DMSO group directly with the Baf A1 group, updating Figure 6B to reflect this comparison as advised.</p>
<p>These adjustments have been made to ensure the statistical analyses are robust and appropriate given the sample sizes and to align with the reviewer's recommendations, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>We recommend using grey scale (instead of 'heatmap' representation) to show the protein distribution of interest. Heatmap does not help at all, because 'total protein amount per cell' (instead of signal intensity on each pixel) is what matters in the context of this paper. Heatmap presentation does not allow readers to integrate signal intensity with their eyes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the editor for pointing this out. We have changed heatmaps to inverted fluorescence images in grey scale.</p>
