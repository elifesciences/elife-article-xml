<abstract><p>The ability to update the valence of sensory perception to influence behavior is crucial for survival. A common phenotype in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is defects in sensory processing, but whether these defects impair flexible sensory encoding is largely unexplored. In particular, how genetic risk factors such as <italic>Shank3</italic> deletion affect the adaptability of cortical taste processing and downstream behavior is unknown. To address this gap, we performed two-photon calcium imaging during a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning paradigm, an ethologically relevant form of associative learning that depends on taste processing in the anterior insular cortex (AIC), to examine how Shank3 knockout alters taste-related neuronal activity in AIC and influences CTA learning. We found that AIC neurons in <italic>Shank3</italic> knockout mice exhibited reduced stimulus-evoked suppression and increased trial-to-trial correlated variability during the acquisition of CTA memory. These activity changes, which likely reduced signal-to-noise ratio in AIC, were associated with slower CTA acquisition in knockout mice. In both genotypes, CTA learning enhanced, while subsequent extinction reduced, taste discriminability in AIC, and both extinction and the associated reduction in discriminability were faster in knockout than in wild-type mice. Together, these results show that <italic>Shank3</italic> loss is associated with destabilized cortical activity dynamics in AIC, which may contribute to inefficient encoding and maintenance of learned taste aversion. These findings show that loss of Shank3 compromises the ability of animals to update behavior to incorporate negative outcomes, and suggest this loss of flexibility may be an important feature of monogenic ASDs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ethological experiences can modify fundamental features of sensory coding, such as the valence of a taste, through changes in synaptic and network functions within sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Harris and Mrsic-Flogel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Choi, 2018</xref>). This flexibility in sensory coding ensures that animals’ perceptions and downstream behaviors are updated to reflect current experiences and enhance survival. Sensory processing, including taste, is often defective in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Leekam et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Avery et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Scheerer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Goldschlager et al., 2025</xref>), and several rodent monogenic ASD models, including Shank3 knockout, exhibit sensory deficits resembling those observed in patients with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kloth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Copping et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Monteiro and Feng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Delling and Boeckers, 2021</xref>). This altered sensory processing could contribute to downstream defects in flexible sensory coding in Shank3 knockout rodent models, but this possibility has not been directly tested. Here, we used conditioned taste aversion (CTA), an ethologically relevant form of associative learning that involves taste processing, to examine how disrupted cortical taste coding impacts the learning and extinction of aversive taste associations in Shank3 knockout mice.</p>
<p>CTA arises when a normally palatable taste is paired with agents (such as lithium chloride) that cause gastric malaise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Garcia et al., 1955</xref>); this aversive learning is fast (requiring one or two conditioning trials) and strongly suppresses the consumption of the conditioned tastant. Like other forms of aversive learning, CTA undergoes extinction when the tastant no longer predicts the adverse outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berman and Dudai, 2001</xref>). Extinction occurs gradually over repeated exposures to the conditioned tastant alone; thus, during CTA and subsequent extinction, the valence of a tastant can shift from positive to negative and back to positive again in an ethologically relevant manner, providing a nice paradigm for studying the adaptability of sensory coding. CTA relies on the anterior insular cortex (AIC), where much of taste coding occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Katz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fletcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Vincis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). CTA’s acquisition and extinction induce distinct forms of plasticity within AIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Escobar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rodríguez-Durán et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yiannakas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kolatt Chandran et al., 2023</xref>) as internal representations of taste are reshaped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moran and Katz, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arieli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raymond et al., 2024</xref>). Loss of Shank3 affects multisensory integration in the insular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gogolla et al., 2014</xref>) and impairs several cellular forms of cortical synaptic and intrinsic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kouser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raynaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wen and Turrigiano, 2021</xref>), raising the possibility that loss of Shank3 might impair CTA learning and extinction.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed two-photon calcium imaging and a head-restrained CTA paradigm to compare AIC activity in Shank3 knockout and wild-type mice during learning and extinction. We first discovered that Shank3 knockout mice learned CTA more slowly. During memory encoding, AIC neurons in these mutant mice were less suppressed by taste stimuli, with increased correlated variability that likely reduced the signal-to-noise ratio critical for taste processing within AIC. Although Shank3 knockout mice eventually formed CTA, their aversive memory was fragile and extinguished more rapidly than in wild-type mice. Following learning, AIC neurons in both groups became more reliable in their taste responsiveness; however, this reliability was accompanied by a gradual reduction in single-cell taste selectivity and a convergence of population activity as extinction progressed. This loss of taste selectivity and convergence of population activity was faster and more pronounced in Shank3 knockout than in wild-type mice. Finally, the ability to discriminate between tastants using population activity was enhanced by CTA and then maintained during extinction in wild-type mice but was rapidly lost during extinction in the Shank3 knockout condition. This work demonstrates that loss of Shank3 degrades the discriminability of single-cell and population activity in AIC, leading to slower learning and faster extinction of CTA. More broadly, this work shows that flexible sensory coding is defective in Shank3 knockout mice, and provides insight into how maladaptive sensory coding impacts associative learning in ASD.</p>

<title>Shank3 knockout diminishes taste-elicited insular suppression and perturbs CTA acquisition</title>
<p>Loss of Shank3 is known to affect some aspects of sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balasco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ortiz-Cruz et al., 2022</xref>), but whether it disrupts ethologically relevant associative learning paradigms such as CTA that rely on sensory processing is unknown. To examine this, we performed longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of AIC neurons from wild-type (WT) and Shank3-knockout mice (KO, Δexon 13-16, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Peça et al., 2011</xref>) in a head-restrained CTA learning paradigm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>).

<p>We then trained water-restricted, head-restrained mice (WT or KO littermates) to lick a motorized spout in daily sessions, each consisting of approximately 30 trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). This trial-based structure enabled us to control the type of the tastant animals received in each trial, as well as the duration and timing of its delivery, while simultaneously recording the corresponding neuronal calcium signals in AIC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, C</xref>). To ensure that animals learned CTA effectively, we subjected habituated animals to two conditioning sessions (CST1 and CST2); within each session animals received, on average, 30 deliveries of the novel tastant saccharin (conditioned stimulus, CS), followed by a LiCl injection (unconditioned stimulus, US) (referred to as the “CTA group”). A separate group of animals received saline instead of LiCl and served as the “non-learned” comparison (referred to as the “CS-only group”). In subsequent retrieval test sessions that spanned five days (T1-5), we measured the expression and extinction of CTA by giving animals saccharin (the conditioned tastant) and water (a neutral tastant) in an alternative-choice task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kogan and Fontanini, 2024</xref>). While animals in the CS-only group maintained their preference for saccharin across the first and second conditioning sessions (CST1 and CST2, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), WT mice that received LiCl significantly reduced licks to saccharin between CST1 and CST2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Although KO animals also showed a significant reduction in their saccharin consumption between CST1 and CST2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), this reduction was smaller than in WT mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To ensure reduced CTA during CST2 in KO mice was not an artifact of measuring aversion without a choice between saccharin and water, we used a modified paradigm where a separate group of animals received an alternative-choice test after CST1 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A</xref>). In this paradigm as well, KO mice showed a significantly higher preference for saccharin across concentrations compared to WT littermates (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1B</xref>); further, comparable lick counts in WT and KO mice suggest no major differences in the thirst state or motivation between groups (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C, D</xref>).</p>
<p>Since taste responses are processed in AIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Katz et al., 2002</xref>), we wished to know whether saccharin-elicited activity in AIC during CTA acquisition is different in WT and KO animals. We identified neurons that were activated or suppressed during various phases of CST1 and 2, and (as observed previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) found that AIC neurons could be influenced by acoustic cues (1-2), lick movements (2-3), and tastant exposure (3-4, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Most of these neurons responded to more than one sensorimotor stimulus (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2D</xref>), highlighting the multi-modal and integrative nature of the insular cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Samuelsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gogolla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Vincis and Fontanini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gogolla, 2017</xref>). In most AIC neurons, the strongest trial-averaged responses were tied to tastant delivery (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2A, B</xref>; between yellow dashed lines marked 3 and 4); in this study, we focus on these taste-elicited responses. In both WT and KO mice that underwent CTA, we detected neuronal populations that were either suppressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I, J</xref>) or activated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H, I, K</xref>) by tastant presentations during CST1 and CST2. There were no significant changes between CST1 and 2 for either the CTA or the CS alone groups (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure supplement 2E-J</xref>). Strikingly, however, the neuronal suppression in response to saccharin was significantly reduced in the KO mice; a smaller fraction of neurons were suppressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>), and the average magnitude of suppression decreased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J, M</xref>). There was a smaller reduction in the population and magnitude of activated neurons as well, but this did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1N, O</xref>). These data reveal that Shank3 KO mice have less cortical suppression during tastant delivery and exhibit reduced or slowed acquisition of CTA.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Shank3 knockout increases the correlated variability in AIC during CTA acquisition</title>
<p>We wondered what other features of AIC activity during CTA acquisition might differ between WT and Shank3 KO mice. The correlated variability between neurons – the trial-to-trial co-fluctuation of their activity over repeated presentations of the same stimulus – has been shown to limit the information-encoding capacity of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bartolo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kafashan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hazon et al., 2022</xref>). We thus wondered whether Shank3 KO might impede CTA by increasing the correlated variability in AIC during tastant presentations. We first characterized the trial-to-trial coactivity between AIC neurons by measuring the pairwise correlations of their mean calcium responses across CS (saccharin) presentations (see methods). There was a rightward shift in the cumulative distribution function of these pairwise correlations in KO compared to WT animals, which was apparent in both conditioning sessions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, B</xref>). Comparing the mean pairwise correlation calculated by animal confirmed a persistent increase in the average strength of coactivity in the KO mice across conditioning sessions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

<p>Neuronal coactivity could result from “signal” correlations, which reflect the similarity of average stimulus-tuning properties between neurons, and “noise” correlations that measure trial-to-trial activity co-fluctuations between neurons independent of stimulus tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Panzeri et al., 2022</xref>). To determine if the “noise” component is the driving force of the increased coactivity observed in the KO mice, we performed a different correlation analysis that allowed us to separate signal-induced correlations from the residual (noise) correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marks and Goard, 2021</xref>). For a given neuron, we first obtained the stimulus-induced signal by averaging response traces (3 seconds) across trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, top). We then estimated the neuron’s trial-to-trial variability (‘noise’) by subtracting this averaged ‘signal’ from individual trials and concatenating the residuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom). The signal correlation was then quantified by calculating the pairwise correlations of the averaged signal, while the noise correlation was calculated as the pairwise correlations in the trial-to-trial variability. While the signal correlation was reduced from CST1 to CST2, there was no difference between WT and KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>). By contrast, the correlated variability was significantly higher in the KO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G, H</xref>). The activity correlations between neurons generally decrease when the intraneuronal distances grow wider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rothschild et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rosenbaum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Khoury et al., 2022</xref>). To determine the spatial extent of enhanced correlations in Shank3 KO mice, we measured correlated variability as a function of the inter-somatic distance between neuron pairs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>); strikingly, the increased coactivity was observed even in neuronal pairs &gt; 300 μm apart (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>), indicating a network-wide, rather than local, origin. Thus, in the Shank3 KO mice, there is a widespread increase in correlated variability between AIC neurons, suggesting there is more “noise” in insular cortical circuits.</p>
<p>Finally, to determine if this coactivity is stimulus-dependent, we repeated the correlation analysis using the mean calcium responses two seconds prior to cue onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Measuring the trial-to-trial correlations of this spontaneous activity showed that coactivity was enhanced in KO animals even at baseline (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Furthermore, as for taste-elicited activity, this increased baseline coactivity had a broad spatial extent (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1D</xref>). Altogether, these analyses demonstrate that Shank3 KO mice have increased network-wide, stimulus-independent correlated variability within AIC. This heightened background noise is likely to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio during tastant processing, crucial for the induction of CTA.</p>

<title>Extinction of CTA in Shank3 knockout mice is faster than in wild-type littermates</title>
<p>The reduced expression of CTA in KO mice after the first conditioning session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) could be due to a reduction or a delay in the learning process. To differentiate between these possibilities, we measured taste aversion after the second round of conditioning (after CST2), by comparing the ratio of licks to saccharin and water during the first retrieval test session (T1, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).

To test this, we identified AIC neurons that could be recorded in each retrieval test session (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, see methods) and tracked their daily responsiveness to taste. We first focused on cells that were activated by saccharin in at least one session and found that in the CS-only group, a majority of neurons dropped in and out of the population responses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, both WT and KO CTA groups had a higher proportion of neurons reliably activated by saccharin across days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, D</xref>). While no neurons in the CS-only group were active across all five sessions, 16 (WT) and 15 (KO) percent of neurons in the CTA conditions were responsive throughout (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The same pattern was found for AIC neurons that were responsive to water, an independent and neutral taste modality that induces distinct neuronal activities in AIC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rosen et al., 2010</xref>).

<title>The stimulus selectivity of individual AIC neurons degrades faster in Shank3 knockout mice during memory extinction</title>
<p>The feature selectivity of individual neurons within primary sensory cortices is dynamic and experience-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chéreau et al., 2020</xref>). We reasoned that taste selectivity – the “breadth of tuning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>) – of individual AIC neurons might evolve during CTA extinction, and that this process might be accelerated in Shank3 KO mice to promote faster extinction. To test this, we identified neurons activated by water or saccharin delivery, and in test sessions estimated the percentage of neurons that responded to one or both stimuli (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Our analysis revealed a comparable proportion of nonselective AIC neurons (∼40 percent) in both genotypes during the first test session (T1, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>While binarizing calcium signals into “active” and “non-active” is widely used to describe single-cell stimulus-elicited responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhang and Li, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gehrlach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Staszko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Biane et al., 2023</xref>), it ignores changes in response amplitude that could encode stimulus-related information. We therefore performed a complementary analysis and calculated a discriminability index based on the amplitude differences between each neuron’s trial-averaged calcium responses to saccharin and water (see methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2023</xref>). A more positive index indicates the neuron has a higher response preference for saccharin, while neurons with a more negative index respond more strongly to water. We first quantified the spread of the distribution by pooling the discriminability indices from all recorded neurons, where a narrowing of the distribution indicates that neurons within the population become more similar in their response preference. In the CS-only group, the variance was similar for the first and last test sessions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In WT mice that underwent CTA, there was a gradual reduction in the variance (narrowing) of the distribution from T1 to T5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), and this decrease was already apparent during T2 in KO mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Calculating the absolute discriminability index (which reflects the degree of a neuron’s selectivity regardless of the taste stimulus it responds to) revealed that by T5, the mean absolute index was significantly smaller in the CTA group compared to the CS-only group (CS-only (WT) vs. CTA (WT) at T5, p = 0.0213, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This reduction in taste discriminability was again faster and more pronounced in KO mice (CTA (WT) vs. CTA (KO) at T2: p = 0.0301, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). This reduction in discriminability was not due to changes in the number and response amplitude of both taste-activated and suppressed AIC neurons, as these remained stable throughout extinction (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, although the responses of individual AIC neurons become more reliable after CTA, they gradually provide less information about taste identity during CTA extinction, and this process is accelerated in the KO condition.</p>

<title>Learning improves population coding of taste in AIC, but this enhancement rapidly decays in Shank3 knockout mice</title>
<p>To determine whether the experience-dependent changes in taste discriminability are reflected in population-level activity, we calculated the Euclidean distance between population vectors in response to water or saccharin exposures; this is a widely used measure of the similarity between population neuronal responses to a pair of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arieli et al., 2022</xref>). In the CS-only group, the population responses to water and saccharin remained highly similar, as shown by the consistently small distance between the two (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). By comparison, CTA roughly doubled the distance (dissimilarity) between the two taste-elicited population responses, and while this distance decreased during extinction, it remained higher than for the CS-only group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). To determine whether these population differences are sufficient to reliably classify tastants, we trained a support vector classifier to predict the taste class (water or saccharin) based on the ΔF values in the neuronal feature space (see methods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bishop, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Woods et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raymond et al., 2024</xref>). We trained and evaluated a classifier for each animal within each session to capture potential behavioral variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Twarkowski et al., 2022</xref>). While decoding accuracy was close to chance in the CS-only group, CTA learning led to significantly better classification performances across sessions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-C</xref>). The distance between population responses to water and saccharin was reduced faster and to a larger degree in KO mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, linear mixed-effects model: T1 vs. T2 in WT, β = −0.099, p = 0.697; T2 WT vs. KO, β = −0.901, p = 0.015; post hoc paired t-test: T1 vs. T2 in KO, p = 0.009), and this could also be seen in degraded decoding accuracy in these mutant mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E, F</xref>).

<p>Lastly, we examined the stability of taste representations in AIC during memory extinction (across sessions) by using the classifiers trained on T1 responses to predict taste classes in the subsequent sessions (T2-5). In the CS-only group, the classifier performed poorly across sessions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, in the CTA (WT) condition, the cross-session classifier performed well during the early stages of memory extinction, and the accuracy gradually decreased (T1 vs. T5, p = 0.037, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, H</xref>). Finally, consistent with our previous findings, in the CTA (KO) condition, the decoding accuracy declined sharply from T1 to T2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G, H</xref>). In summary, taste representations in AIC become and remain discriminative after learning. In WT animals, these representations continue to diverge from those during the early memory retrieval as CTA is extinguished, and in KO animals, this shift is faster.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Flexible sensory coding ensures that perceptions are updated to reflect their value to an organism, to enable adaptive behaviors. While sensory coding deficits have been reported in mouse models of ASD, including Shank3 KO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Monday et al., 2023</xref>), it is unknown whether flexible coding is impaired in ethological learning paradigms, such as CTA. Here, we used 2-photon calcium imaging and a head-restrained CTA learning paradigm to address this question in Shank3 WT and KO mice. We show that neuronal ensembles in AIC, the cortical region critical for taste processing, have higher correlated noise and lower taste discriminability in Shank3 KO compared to WT littermates, and these changes are correlated with slower CTA learning, indicating that Shank3 KO animals require repeated exposure to aversive experiences to enable updating of taste valence. Once CTA is established, responses of AIC neurons in both wild-type and Shank3 KO mice are initially able to encode and discriminate between different tastants, both at the single-cell and population levels. However, during repeated exposure to the conditioned tastant, taste discriminability in Shank3 KO mice degrades faster than in their wild-type counterparts, and this coincides with the premature extinction of CTA. This work demonstrates that loss of Shank3 compromises the flexibility of sensory coding, and thus the ability of these animals to adapt their behavior in response to negative outcomes.</p>
<p>The increased correlated variability between AIC neurons observed in Shank3 KO mice during CTA learning may impede information encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Moreno-Bote et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bartolo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rumyantsev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kafashan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hazon et al., 2022</xref>) and contribute to the slower acquisition of CTA. Reduced cortical feedback inhibition has been shown to increase the correlated variability (noise correlation) in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stringer et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we detected reduced neuronal suppression in the AIC of Shank3 KO mice, and because Shank3 deletion impairs cortical interneuron functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pagano et al., 2023</xref>), the observed heightening of correlated variability could stem from weakened local inhibition within the AIC network. Heightened noise correlation has been observed across sensory cortices in different animal models of ASD, including the somatosensory and visual cortices of mice with cell-type-specific deletion of Syngap1 and MeCP2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banerjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Zhao and Kwon, 2023</xref>), but the spatial extent of the noise correlations in these mutant animals has not been examined. Because the increased correlated variability in Shank3 KO mice occurs over a large spatial scale, it could reflect stimulus-independent, correlated activity of divergent inputs to AIC. Regardless of the source, this increased correlated noise is likely to degrade taste-elicited responses and thus hinder CTA encoding. Our behavioral results are also consistent with a recent study showing a slower acquisition of CTA in a pharmacologically induced rat model of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pal et al., 2025</xref>). Taken together with our finding that excessive cortical noise correlations impede discriminative sensory learning in Shank3 KO mice, these observations suggest that a reduced signal-to-noise ratio driven by high correlated variability in the sensory cortex is a common mechanism underlying maladaptive sensory processing in ASD.</p>
<p>AIC neurons exhibit a wide range of tuning properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fletcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Staszko et al., 2022</xref>), and we found that, similar to neurons in the primary visual and somatosensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Poort et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chéreau et al., 2020</xref>), the stimulus selectivity (response preference) in AIC can be dynamically adjusted at the cellular level, from being selective to nonselective during CTA extinction. While CTA learning can still initiate selective response preferences in AIC neurons of Shank3 KO mice, this stimulus selectivity was rapidly degraded during the premature extinction of CTA memory. The maintenance and extinction of a faithful CTA memory rely on both Hebbian and homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms within AIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Escobar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rodríguez-Durán et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Because Shank3 KO is known to perturb several of these critical plasticity processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bozdagi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raynaud et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tatavarty et al., 2020</xref>), rapidly reduced stimulus selectivity of AIC neurons could result from defects in one or more of these local plasticity mechanisms. An alternative, though not mutually exclusive, possibility is that the rapid loss of stimulus selectivity and CTA memory results from the impairment in other brain regions that project to AIC, such as BLA and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Levitan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gil-Lievana et al., 2022</xref>). Hebbian plasticity can be induced at synaptic inputs from BLA to AIC during CTA learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Escobar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rodríguez-Durán et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Haley et al., 2020</xref>), and dopaminergic projections from VTA facilitate the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP within AIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rodríguez-Durán et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, Shank3 KO could disrupt function in these upstream brain regions to impair plastic changes in AIC during extinction. This possibility is consistent with the finding that Shank3 down-regulation in VTA accelerates extinction of socially induced conditioned place preference (CPP) memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bariselli et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>During CTA extinction, population responses to the neutral and conditioned taste stimuli in AIC gradually become more similar. Because CTA learning can be suppressed by the familiarity of a tastant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">De la Casa and Lubow, 1995</xref>), we were not able to compare the population responses to different taste stimuli before and after CTA learning; however, even after extinction these population responses were more distinct in the CTA than the CS-only group (demonstrated by the Euclidean distance and the classifier prediction), suggesting that taste coding in AIC does not revert to its naïve state even when the behavioral aversion is gone. This is consistent with previous <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology demonstrating that, during CTA extinction, the population-level taste coding in AIC continuously evolves but does not return to the pre-CTA state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Moran and Katz, 2014</xref>). In contrast, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raymond et al., 2024</xref>) reported that the population responses to conditioned and appetitive taste stimuli converge to a much greater degree than we observed after CTA extinction. One explanation for the difference between Raymond et al. and our findings is that we used two conditioning sessions with a novel tastant, while Raymond et al. used a single conditioning session with a familiar tastant. Thus, our paradigm likely elicited stronger CTA, and thus a more enduring ability to discriminate tastants. Interestingly, in contrast to the WT condition, extinction in the Shank3 KO leads to a rapid and stronger convergence of population taste-evoked responses in AIC, which ultimately reduces the ability to decode the identity of taste stimuli from their responses. Degraded sensory coding has been observed in sensory cortices of other ASD mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Monday et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wang and Feldman, 2024</xref>); thus, unstable and poorly differentiated cortical responsivity to sensory stimuli is a pathogenic feature shared across brain regions and gene mutations in ASD.</p>
<p>Our finding that taste representations remain discriminative in AIC throughout CTA extinction raises an important question: what taste information does AIC population activity actually encode? In the hippocampus, representations of odor “identity” remain stable independent of learning, while those encoding odor “values” are susceptible to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Biane et al., 2023</xref>). In AIC, ensemble activity encodes both the identity and palatability of taste stimuli, as well as related decision-making, in sequential temporal epochs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Katz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Sadacca et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lavi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Staszko et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kogan and Fontanini, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raymond et al., 2024</xref>). The population AIC activity we analyzed (3-second duration after delivery) is unlikely to simply encode taste identity, because if that were the case, the defined taste representations would be independent of learning and should be present even in animals that didn’t receive LiCl. Instead, the AIC population activity we measure likely encodes primarily taste palatability, or “valence.” This possibility would also explain the poor decoding performances of classifiers trained in the CS-only condition, where water and saccharin share similar innate palatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Staszko et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Flexible processing of new sensory information in the cortex enables animals to update their perceptions and modify behaviors that are critical for survival, and disruptions in this process could contribute to maladaptive behaviors in neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we show that a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the AIC of Shank3 KO mice may hinder the updating of taste valence following negative experiences, leading to slower CTA learning and faster extinction. This rapid extinction is associated with rapid loss of taste discriminability within AIC, and this response instability ultimately compromises the ability to decode taste identity from AIC responses. More broadly, these data suggest that behavioral inflexibility in some forms of ASD could arise from a reduced ability to update behavior when the valence of a sensory input changes.</p>

<title>Experimental Model and Subject Details</title>
<p>All experimental procedures were approved by Brandeis University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and followed the National Institute of Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. C57BL/6 and Shank3B knockout (Δexon 13-16, JAX: 017688) mouse strains were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, and the colonies were maintained in Foster Biomedical Research Labs at Brandeis University. Adult mice (8-16 weeks old) were used in experiments performed in this study. All animals were grouped with their littermates or housed individually once they entered the behavioral training paradigm. In all cases, animals were housed in a humidity- and temperature-controlled environment and entrained to a 12-hour light-dark cycle (light phase from 7:00-7:00), with ad libitum access to food and water unless described otherwise. Mice of each sex were assigned equally to each experimental condition. In this paper, 7, 9, and 9 animals were assigned to the CS-only (WT), CTA (WT), and CTA (KO) groups in the two-conditioning behavior experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For calcium imaging analysis, 1 and 2 animals were excluded from the CTA (WT) and CTA (KO) groups, respectively, due to a lack of sufficient GCaMP expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). In the separate single-conditioning paradigm, 13 and 13 animals were used in the CTA (WT) and CTA (KO) groups.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic Surgery</title>
<p>Mice (8-10 weeks old) were anesthetized with a constant airflow containing 2% isoflurane throughout the procedure. The skull was exposed, and a craniotomy was created above the right AIC. AAV expressing GCaMP8s (titer: ∼1.2 x 10<sup>13</sup>, 1:3 dilution, 800 nL in total) was slowly infused into AIC (anterior-posterior (AP) with reference to bregma: 1.0 mm, medial-lateral (ML): - 3.8 mm, dorsal-ventral (DV): with reference to the brain surface: −2.0 mm) through a micropipette connected to a microinjector (Narishige, MO-10), at a rate of approximately 200 nL/min. To allow the virus particles to spread, the pipette was kept in place for another 5 minutes before being slowly withdrawn from the site. Two weeks after the virus injection, the mice (10-12 weeks old) then underwent the implantation of a gradient-index (GRIN) lens and a customized titanium head bar. Mice were anesthetized as described above, and a dose of dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously at the beginning of the surgery to minimize brain swelling. Once the skull was revealed, a craniotomy slightly larger than 0.5 mm x 0.5 mm was made at the site of the previous virus injection. To create a leading track, a 25-gauge blunt needle was slowly lowered until it reached above AIC (AP: + 1.0 mm, ML: −3.8 mm, DV: −1.8 mm), remained in place for five minutes and was withdrawn from the site. A GRIN lens (diameter: 0.5 mm, length: ∼4 mm, CLHS050GFT126, GoFoton) was then gradually lowered through a customized holder until its bottom surface rested on top of AIC (AP: + 1.0 mm, ML: −3.8 mm, DV: −2,0 mm). The lens was secured to the skull by Vetabond and the UV-curable adhesive, after which a titanium head-bar was installed. Metabond tinged with black ink was applied to further cement the lens and the head bar while covering and sealing the skull. After the operation, animals were kept and monitored individually in their home cages, and a daily dose of meloxicam (1-2 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously for at least three days to reduce brain inflammation. Animals were allowed for at least one week of recovery before starting behavioral training.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Head-restrained CTA Learning Paradigm</title>
<p>One day before the mice (13-15 weeks old) began training in the head-fixed position, ad libitum water access was removed from their home cages to motivate their engagement in the subsequent tasks. The restricted water access was then given daily through the motorized spout during the training task or in the home cage for thirty minutes (described in detail below). Each training day, animals were placed on a customized wheel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Livneh et al., 2017</xref>) with their heads restrained and underwent a thirty-minute training session consisting of 30-35 trials. In each trial, a two-second monotonal acoustic cue (2 kHz) was initiated to signal the onset of the trial, with a motorized spout simultaneously moving to the location close to the animal’s mouth. Mice then learned to perform five dry licks in order to receive the liquid through the spout. The gravity-based liquid delivery, once initiated, lasted 3 seconds, after which the spout was moved away from the animal. A 10-second intertrial rest followed before the next trial started. A trial was considered failed if the animal did not reach the threshold to initiate the liquid delivery within sixty seconds after the spout was in place.</p>
<sec id="s4f1">
<title>Habituation</title>
<p>During the habituation stage, water was used as the tastant. If animals refused to lick the spout throughout the session or their body weight dropped over 15 percent of the initial weight, an additional ad libitum access to water was granted for 30 minutes in the home cage. On average, it took 10 days for the animals to become familiarized with the task, reaching consistent performance without failed trials within thirty minutes. By the end of the habituation, the spout became the only daily source of liquid the animals received, and their body weight stabilized.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f2">
<title>Conditioning</title>
<p>Once habituated, animals then received two conditioning sessions to induce the formation of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). On each conditioning day, animals underwent the training session with the same scheme as in habituation, except that saccharin (25 mM, CS) was given instead of water. Five minutes after the session, a dose of lithium chloride (LiCl, 0.15 mM, 2% body weight, US) was intraperitoneally injected to induce gastric malaise. Afterward, animals remained in place for another 25 minutes before returning to the home cage. To overcome the potential association between malaise and the context, which might confound animals’ subsequent performance, animals were allowed to receive water in a recovery session (in the same environment) the next day after each conditioning; during this time, animals usually resumed their engagement in the task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f3">
<title>CTA retrieval and extinction testing</title>
<p>After the second recovery session, we subjected animals to consecutive test sessions for five days to measure the retrieval and extinction of CTA memory. In each test session, water was given for the first three trials to engage animals in the task. Afterward, water and saccharin were delivered in a semi-randomized order such that animals could not predict the identity of the tastant in the upcoming trial while overall receiving similar numbers of trials that delivered water and saccharin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4f4">
<title>Single-conditioning CTA paradigm</title>
<p>A modified taste learning paradigm was conducted to examine whether Shank3 knockout mice expressed taste aversion when presented with choices after one conditioning. After the first conditioning session and the subsequent recovery session, animals were immediately subjected to a retrieval test session in which water and saccharin at various concentrations (25 mM, 10 mM, 5 mM, 1 mM) were delivered in a semi-randomized order. Trial-averaged licks and lick ratios were quantified as described below.</p>

<p>Throughout the paradigm, licks were detected by a capacitive sensor (MPR121, Adafruit) attached to the spout, which generated TTL signals recorded with the customized code and time-stamped to the frames during two-photon image acquisition. To obtain trial-averaged licks of a tastant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), total lick counts during the 3-second delivery were averaged across trials delivering that tastant in a given session.

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Animals were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The whole brain was extracted, post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours, and sliced on a vibrating microtome (Leica Vibratome VT 1200s). Coronal brain slices (50 µm) containing AIC were collected; to verify the placement of the GRIN lens, the slices with the visible track left by the lens were selected, washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with the blocking buffer (5% goat serum/3% BSA/0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) at room temperature for 2 hours, and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. To confirm the expression of GCaMP8s, chicken anti-GFP (1:1000, Aves Labs) and mouse anti-NeuN (1:500, MAB-377, Millipore) were used. On the next day, the slices were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in the buffer containing 5% goat serum and 3% BSA at room temperature for 3 hours (goat anti-chicken Alexa-488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa-594, 1:400, Thermo-Fisher). After another three washes with PBS, the slices were mounted on the slides using the DAPI-Fluoromount-G mounting medium (SouthernBiotech), cover-slipped, and stored at 4°C until imaging.</p>

GCaMP8s was excited at 920 nm using a tunable ultrafast laser (SpectraPhysics Insight X3, 50-80 mW measured at the front aperture of the objective).

<sec id="s4j2">
<title>Processing and registration</title>
<p>For each imaging session, frames from all successful trials were included and concatenated into a series. In each movie, the movement was corrected, the regions of interest (ROI) corresponding to individual neurons in the field of view were identified, and the raw fluorescence from the cell bodies and neuropils was extracted using Suite2P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). The processed images were then inspected, and if needed, the ROIs were manually selected or excluded using the Suite2P GUI so that only the cell bodies were used for further analysis. Only the ROIs near the center of the field of view were included to avoid any potential peripheral distortion of fluorescence by spherical aberration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sattin et al., 2024</xref>). The time series of neuropil-corrected calcium signals of individual neurons were obtained by subtracting the time series of neuropil fluorescence (scaled by 0.7) from that of the raw fluorescence of cell bodies. In the case where multi-day cell registration was required (i.e., identification of the same cells across sessions, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), Spatial footprints of each neuron were extracted from the field of view of each session with in-house customized code and were aligned across sessions using the probabilistic modeling method implemented in CellReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Sheintuch et al., 2017</xref>).

<title>Calculation of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and stimulus responsiveness</title>
<p>Z-scored changes in calcium signals were used to represent the temporal activity dynamics of individual neurons in all analyses. In each trial, neuropil-corrected calcium traces of the same duration (total 656 frames) were first extracted, which consisted of 155 frames of baseline (5 seconds before the cue onset), 62 frames of the acoustic cue (2 seconds), 15 frames of dry licks (∼ 0.5 seconds), 112 frames of tastant delivery (3.5 seconds), and 312 frames of post-delivery rest (10 seconds). On average, it took animals no more than 0.5 seconds (15 frames) to reach the threshold of five dry licks; however, during the early stages of memory extinction, animals occasionally hesitated or even failed to participate in some trials, prolonging the dry-lick period to varying degrees. In such cases, we only included 15 frames starting from the initiation of the first dry lick to ensure that the lengths of the time series were consistent across animals, trials, and sessions. For each neuron in a given trial, we first computed its changes in fluorescence (ΔF<sub>/</sub>F<sub>0</sub>) by subtracting the mean fluorescence of baseline (F<sub>0</sub>) from the fluorescence at each time point and dividing the result values by F<sub>0</sub>. Next, we calculated the z-scores using the formula (F<sub>(t)</sub> – F<sub>baseline</sub>) / SD, where F<sub>(t)</sub> represents the ΔF<sub>/</sub>F<sub>0</sub> at time t, and F<sub>baseline</sub> and SD denote the mean and standard deviation of the ΔF<sub>/</sub>F<sub>0</sub> values during the baseline. To determine whether a neuron is responsive to a taste stimulus in a given session (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), we compared the mean z-scored activity during the taste delivery (last 2 seconds) to the mean z-scored baseline activity (2 seconds before the cue onset) across trials using paired t-test. A neuron was categorized as “activated” and “suppressed” during the tastant delivery if there was a significant increase and decrease in activity compared to the baseline, respectively. We omitted the first second of the tastant delivery when calculating the mean activity to avoid a potential carryover from the dry lick responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). In the analyses that used the amplitude of the trial-averaged response (z-scored ΔF<sub>/</sub>F<sub>0</sub>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), we first averaged the z-scored calcium traces across trials and then calculated the values of the mean activity during tastant deliveries as described above.</p>

<sec id="s4k2">
<title>Coactivity analysis</title>
<p>The calculation of taste-elicited coactivity patterns between neuronal pairs was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Twarkowski et al., 2022</xref>. Within each session, trials of the same tastant deliveries were selected, and the Pearson correlation coefficient between two neurons’ mean z-scored ΔF<sub>/</sub>F<sub>0</sub> values during the tastant delivery across these trials was calculated. To determine the stimulus-independent baseline coactivity, the mean z-scored ΔF<sub>/</sub>F<sub>0</sub> values during the 2-second period before the cue onset were used to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k3">
<title>Pairwise signal and noise correlations</title>
<p>The signal and noise correlations were calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marks and Goard, 2021</xref>). The signal correlation was obtained in a given session by calculating the Pearson correlation between two neurons’ full trial-averaged activity traces during the tastant delivery. To estimate the correlated variability (noise), we first subtracted a neuron’s trial-averaged activity trace from its z-scored activity trace in each trial. The subtracted traces (residuals) from all trials within a session were then concatenated into a whole series representing trial-to-trial variability in the neuron’s activities. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated between two neurons’ concatenated, subtracted traces to represent correlated variability.</p>

<sec id="s4k4">
<title>Single-cell discriminability index</title>
<p>The discriminability index was adapted from the previously reported method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kong et al., 2023</xref>) and indicated a neuron’s response preference between taste stimuli (water or saccharin). In a given session, the discriminability index for each neuron is defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="671527v1_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>µ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>µ<sub>2</sub></italic> denote the trial-averaged activity amplitude averaged across saccharin and water trials, respectively, and the denominator is the pooled standard deviation. A positive index indicates that the neuron responds more preferentially to saccharin, while a more negative index indicates a higher response preference for water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k5">
<title>Euclidean distance</title>
<p>We calculated the pairwise Euclidean distance to estimate the similarity between population responses to saccharin and water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raymond et al., 2024</xref>). In a given test session, for each animal, we constructed the trial-averaged ΔF values of all neurons into two population vectors, one responding to saccharin and the other to water. The Euclidean distance between these two vectors is then defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="671527v1_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Where <italic>v<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>v<sub>2</sub></italic> denote the population vector in response to saccharin and water, respectively, and <italic>n</italic> is the number of neurons included in the vectors. To mitigate the influence on Euclidean distance by the number of neurons included in the calculation (i.e., the dimension), we normalized the distance by the square root of the dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Levitan et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4k6">
<title>Decoding analysis</title>
<p>We trained a support vector classifier for each animal to predict the tastant class (water or saccharin) in a given session, using the SVC function with a linear kernel in the Python scikit-learn module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Woods et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Twarkowski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Raymond et al., 2024</xref>). We first constructed population response vectors for each trial (labeled as saccharin or water), and these vectors constituted the dataset for model training and testing. The linear decoder is defined as:
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="671527v1_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>L(t)</italic> is the predicted tastant class, and <italic>v(t)</italic> is the population response vector for the trial <italic>t</italic>. <italic>θ(z)</italic> is the Heaviside step function that ensures hard classification, while <italic>w</italic> denotes the vector that contains weights assigned to each neuron, and <italic>b</italic> is the bias term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bishop, 2006</xref>). We then used 10-fold cross-validation, a standard method for model validation and evaluation, to train and test the data. Cross-validation produced an averaged accuracy score that indicated the classifier’s performance. To calculate chance-level prediction, we shuffled the labels and trained the classifier as described above for 1000 iterations. This shuffling process resulted in an average 50-percent accuracy score by chance. To test the stability of insular taste representations, we used the classifier trained on the data in test 1 to predict the tastant classes in the subsequent sessions and calculated the accuracy score accordingly.</p>

<title>Quantification and Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using the Python scipy, statsmodels, or pingouin packages. To assess the main effects and interactions in experiments comparing the same animals or neurons across sessions under different conditions, a paired t-test or repeated-measures mixed ANOVA was used unless stated otherwise. For experiments requiring specific comparisons between conditions, a linear mixed-effect model was fitted to the data, and the relevant coefficient was extracted. If the comparison could not be directly inferred from the coefficient, a post hoc t-test was performed. The significance levels were labeled by asterisks (*): *: <italic>P &lt; 0.05</italic>; **: <italic>P &lt; 0.01</italic>; ***: <italic>P &lt; 0.001</italic>; ****: <italic>P &lt; 0.0001</italic>.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence for deficits in aversive taste learning and taste coding in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorders. Specifically, the authors found that Shank3 knockout mice exhibit behavioral deficits in learning and extinction of conditioned taste aversion, and calcium imaging of the gustatory cortex identified impaired neuronal responses to taste stimuli. This paper will likely be of interest to researchers studying how learning and sensory processes are affected by genetic causes of autism spectrum disorders.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study from Wu and Turrigiano investigates how disruption of taste coding in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affects aversive learning in the context of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. The experiments combine 2-photon calcium imaging of neurons in the gustatory portion of the anterior insular cortex (i.e., gustatory cortex) with behavioral training and testing. The authors rely on Shank3 knockout mice as a model for ASDs. The authors found that Shank3 mice learn CTA more slowly and extinguish the memory more rapidly than control subjects. Calcium imaging identified impairments in taste-evoked activity associated with memory encoding and extinction. During memory encoding, the authors found less suppressed neuronal activity and increased correlated variability in Shank3 mice compared to controls. During extinction, they observed a faster loss of taste selectivity and degradation of taste discriminability in mutants compared to controls.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript that presents interesting findings. The results on the learning and extinction deficits in Shank3 mice are of particular interest. Analyses of neural activity are well conducted and provide important information on the type of impaired cortical activity that may correlate with behavioral deficits.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The experiments rely on three groups: CS-only WT, CTA WT, and CTA KO. Can the authors provide a rationale for not having a CS-only KO group?</p>
<p>(2) The authors design an effective behavioral paradigm comparing consumption of water and saccharin and tracking extinction (Figure 3). This paradigm shows differences in licking across distinct behavioral conditions. For instance, during T1, licking to water strongly differs from licking to saccharin for both WT and KO. During T2, licking to water strongly differs from licking to saccharin only for WT (much less for KO), and licking to saccharin in WT differs from that in KO. These differences in taste sampling across conditions could contribute to some of the effects on neural activity and discriminability reported in Figures 5 and 6. That is sucrose and water trials may be highly discriminable because in one case the mouse licks and in the other it does not (or licks much less). The author may want to address this issue.</p>
<p>(3) Are there any omission trials following CTA? If so, they should be quantified and reported. How are the omission trials treated with regard to the analyses?</p>
<p>(4) The authors describe the extinction paradigm as &quot;alternative choice&quot;. In decision-making, alternative choice paradigms typically require 2 lateral spouts to report decisions following the sampling from a central spout. To avoid confusion, the authors may want to define their paradigm as alternative sampling.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 4 reports that CTA increases the proportion of neurons that consistently respond to saccharin and water across days. While the saccharin result could be an effect of aversive learning, it is less clear why the phenomenon would generalize to water as well. Can the authors provide an explanation?</p>
<p>(6) The recordings are performed in the part of the anterior insular cortex that is typically defined as &quot;gustatory cortex&quot; (GC). Given the functional heterogeneity of the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and given that the authors do not sample all of the anteroposterior extent of AIC, I would suggest being more explicit about their positioning in GC. Also, some citations (e.g., Gogolla et al, 2014) refer to the posterior insular cortex, which is considered more inherently multimodal than GC. GC multimodality is typically associative in nature, as only a few neurons respond to sound and light in naïve animals.</p>
<p>(7) It would be useful to add summary figures showing the extent of viral spread as well as GRIN lens placement.</p>
<p>(8) I encourage the authors to add Ns every time percentages are reported. How many neurons have been recorded in each condition? Can the authors provide the average number of neurons recorded per session and per animal?</p>
<p>(9) It looks like some animals learned more than others (Figure 1E or Figure 3C). Is it possible to compare neural activity across animals that showed different degrees of learning?</p>

<p>Wu and Turrigiano investigated how cortical taste coding during conditioned taste aversion (CTA) learning is affected in Shank3 knockout (KO) mice, a model of monogenic ASD. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging of AIC neurons, the authors show that Shank3 KO mice exhibit reduced suppression of activity in a subset of neurons and a higher correlated variability in neural activity. This is accompanied by slower learning and faster extinction of aversive taste memories. These results suggest that Shank3 loss compromises the flexibility and stability of cortical representations underlying adaptive behaviour.</p>
<p>Major strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Conceptual significance: The study connects a molecular ASD risk gene (Shank3) to flexible sensory encoding, bridging genetics, systems neuroscience, and behaviour.</p>
<p>(2) Technical rigour: Longitudinal calcium imaging with cell-registration across learning and extinction sessions is technically demanding and well-executed.</p>
<p>(3) Behavioural paradigm: The use of both acquisition and extinction paradigms provides a more nuanced picture of learning dynamics.</p>
<p>(4) Analyses: Correlated variability, discriminability indices, and population decoding analyses are robust and appropriate for addressing behavioural and network-level coding changes.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Causality: The paper infers that increased correlated variability causes learning deficits, but no causal tests (e.g., optogenetic modulation of inhibition or interneuron rescue) are presented to confirm this.</p>
<p>(2) Behavioural scope: The study focuses exclusively on taste aversion; generalisation to other flexible learning paradigms (e.g., reversal or probabilistic tasks) is not addressed.</p>
<p>(3) Mechanistic insights: While providing interesting findings of altered sensory perception and extinction of learning-related signals in AIC, it offered nearly no mechanistic insights. This makes the interpretation, especially on how generalisable these findings are, difficult. Also, different reported findings are &quot;potentially&quot; connected, but the exact relation between increased correlated variability and faster loss of taste selectivity cannot be assessed.</p>

<p>In this study, Wu &amp; Turrigiano investigate an ethologically relevant form of associative learning (conditioned taste aversion - CTA) and its extinction in the Shank3 KO mouse model of ASD. They also examine the underlying circuits in the anterior insular cortex (AIC) simultaneously, using two-photon calcium imaging through a GRIN lens. They report that Shank3 KO mice learn CTA slower and suggest that this is mediated by a reduction in tastant-stimulus activity suppression of AIC neurons and a reduced signal-to-noise ratio due to increased noise correlations in AIC neurons. Interestingly, once Shank3 KO mice acquire CTA, they extinguish the aversive memory more rapidly than wild-type mice. This accelerated extinction is accompanied by a faster loss of neuronal and population-level taste selectivity and coding in the AIC compared to WT mice.</p>
<p>This is an important study that uses in vivo methods to assess circuit dysfunction in a mouse model of ASD, related to sensory perception valence (in this case, taste). The study is well executed, the data are of high quality, and the analytical procedures are detailed. Furthermore, the behavioural paradigm is well thought out, particularly the approach for assessing extinction through repeated retrieval sessions (T1-T5), which effectively tests discrimination between saccharin and water rather than relying solely on lick counts or total consumption as a measure of extinction. Finally, the statistical tests used are appropriate and justified.</p>
<p>There is, however, a missing link between the behavioural findings and the underlying mechanisms. More specifically:</p>
<p>(1) The authors don't make a causal link between the behaviour and AIC neurophysiology, both the percentage of suppressed cells and the coactivity measurements. For the % of suppressed cells, it seems that both WT and KO cells are suppressed in the transition between CST1 and CST2 (Figure 1L), yet only the WT mice exhibit CTA (at least by CST2). For the taste-elicited coactivity measure, it seems that there is an increase in coactivity from CST1 to CST2 in WT (Figure 2C - blue, although not statistically tested?), but persistently higher coactivity in KO. Is this change of coactivity in WT important for the expression of CTA? Plotting behavioral performance (from Figure 1G) against coactivity (from Figure 2C) for each animal would be informative.</p>
<p>(2) Shank3 KO cells already show an increase in baseline coactivity (Figure 2- figure supplement 1), and the authors never examine CS-only responses in the KO group, therefore making it difficult to determine whether elevated coactivity and noise correlations reflect a generalized AIC abnormality in Shank3 KOs (perhaps through impaired PV-mediated inhibition in insular cortex - Gogolla et al, 2014) that is not directly responsible/related to CTA?</p>
<p>(3) How do the authors interpret the large range of lick ratios (Figure 1G) for WT (almost bi-modal distribution)? Is there a within-subject correlation with any of the neurophysiological measurements to suggest a relationship between AIC neurophysiology and behavioural expression of CTA?</p>
<p>(4) Indeed, CTA appears to be successfully achieved for Shank3 KO mice delayed by 1 day, as the level of saccharin aversion during the first retrieval session (T1) is comparable between Shank3 KO and WTs. In this context, not extending the first part of the paradigm to include CST3 seems to be a missed opportunity. Doing so would have allowed for within-cell and within-subject comparison of taste-elicited pairwise correlation across the learning and to investigate the neural mechanism of delayed extinction in KOs more effectively.</p>
<p>(5) How to interpret Figure 5F: Absolute discriminability is lower for T5 for CTA WT and CTA KO compared to CS-only? Why would AIC neurons have less information on taste identity by the end of extinction than during the unconditioned (CS-only) condition? And if that is the case, how is decoding accuracy in Figure 6C higher in T5 for CTA WT vs CS-only?</p>
