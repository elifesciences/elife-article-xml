<title>Abstract</title><p>Apart from ancestry, personal or environmental covariates may contribute to differences in polygenic score (PGS) performance. We analyzed effects of covariate stratification and interaction on body mass index (BMI) PGS (PGS<sub>BMI</sub>) across four cohorts of European (N=491,111) and African (N=21,612) ancestry. Stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates, 18/62 covariates had significant and replicable R<sup>2</sup> differences among strata. Covariates with the largest differences included age, sex, blood lipids, physical activity, and alcohol consumption, with R<sup>2</sup> being nearly double between best and worst performing quintiles for certain covariates. 28 covariates had significant PGS<sub>BMI</sub>-covariate interaction effects, modifying PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effects by nearly 20% per standard deviation change. We observed overlap between covariates that had significant R<sup>2</sup> differences among strata and interaction effects – across all covariates, their main effects on BMI were correlated with their maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences and interaction effects (0.56 and 0.58, respectively), suggesting high-PGS<sub>BMI</sub> individuals have highest R<sup>2</sup> and increase in PGS effect. Using quantile regression, we show the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> increases as BMI itself increases, and that these differences in effects are directly related to differences in R<sup>2</sup> when stratifying by different covariates. Given significant and replicable evidence for context-specific PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance and effects, we investigated ways to increase model performance taking into account non-linear effects. Machine learning models (neural networks) increased relative model R<sup>2</sup> (mean 23%) across datasets. Finally, creating PGS<sub>BMI</sub> directly from GxAge GWAS effects increased relative R<sup>2</sup> by 7.8%. These results demonstrate that certain covariates, especially those most associated with BMI, significantly affect both PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance and effects across diverse cohorts and ancestries, and we provide avenues to improve model performance that consider these effects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polygenic scores (PGS) provide individualized genetic predictors of a phenotype by aggregating genetic effects across hundreds or thousands of loci, typically estimated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In recent years it has become increasingly apparent that the transferability of PGS performance across different cohorts is poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Most analyses to date have focused on ancestry differences as the main driver of this lack of portability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>However, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that PGS performance and effect estimates are influenced by differences in certain contexts i.e., environmental (classically termed “gene-environment” effects or interactions) or personal-level covariates – different phenotypes seem to be differently affected by these covariates, with adiposity traits such as body mass index (BMI) having substantial evidence for these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). In one previous study, they showed that GWAS stratified by sample characteristics had better PGS performance in cohorts that matched the sample characteristics of the stratified GWAS, and that differences in heritability between the stratified cohorts partially explained this observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>).</p>
<p>There are several gaps in current knowledge about these covariate-specific effects. Many analyses have assessed only a handful of these covariates due to the myriad of choices possible in typical large-scale biobanks. Little investigation has been done to systematically understand why certain covariates affect PGS performance, with such knowledge being useful to reduce the potential search for variables that impart context-specific effects. Furthermore, most studies investigating PGS-covariate interactions have been in European ancestry individuals; notably, comparing differences in PGS performance and prediction while controlling for differences in ancestry versus differences in context has not been assessed in previous studies. Moreover, covariate-specific effects are notorious for replicating poorly in human genetics studies, and previous studies of PGS-covariate interactions have been predominantly performed in the UK Biobank (UKBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), where the majority of individuals are aged 40-69 (i.e., excluding young adults), are overall healthier than those from other e.g., hospital-based cohorts, and are predominantly European ancestry. Additionally, PGS performance is often assessed using linear models and in isolation of clinical covariates, which in practice would often be available.</p>
<p>Machine learning models can have increased performance over linear models and are capable of modeling complex relationships and interactions between variables, which may serve to increase predictive performance, especially given evidence for PGS-covariate specific effects. Finally, given evidence for context-specific effects, it should be possible to directly incorporate SNP-covariate interaction effects from a GWAS directly to improve prediction performance, instead of relying on post-hoc interactions from a typical PGS calculated from main GWAS effects.</p>
<p>Using genetic data with linked-phenotypic information from electronic health records, we estimated the effects of covariate stratification and interaction on performance and effect estimates of PGS for BMI (PGS<sub>BMI</sub>) – a flowchart summarizing our analyses is presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. These analyses were done across four datasets (Supplemental Table 1): UK Biobank (UKBB), Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), and Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA). These datasets include participants from two ancestry groups (N=491,111 European ancestry (EUR), N=21,612 African ancestry (AFR)), and 62 covariates (25 present in multiple datasets) representing laboratory, survey, and biometric data types typically associated with cardiometabolic health and adiposity. After constructing PGS<sub>BMI</sub> using out-of-sample multi-ancestry BMI GWAS, we assessed effects of covariate stratification on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup>, the significance of PGS<sub>BMI</sub>-covariate interaction terms and their increases to model R<sup>2</sup> over models only using main effects, as well as correlation of main effect, interaction effect, and R<sup>2</sup> differences. We then assessed ways to increase model performance through using machine learning models, and creating PGS<sub>BMI</sub> using GxAge GWAS effects. This study addresses a plethora of open issues considering performance and effects of PGS on individuals from diverse backgrounds.</p>

<title>Effect of covariate stratification on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance</title>
<p>We assessed 62 covariates for PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> differences (25 present, or suitable proxies, in multiple datasets (Supplemental Table 2) after stratifying on binary covariates and quintiles for continuous covariates. With UKBB EUR as discovery (N=376,729), 18 covariates had significant differences (Bonferroni p&lt;.05/62) in R<sup>2</sup> among groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), including age, sex, alcohol consumption, different physical activity measurements, Townsend deprivation index, different dietary measurements, lipids, blood pressure, and HbA1c, with 40 covariates having suggestive (p&lt;.05) evidence of R<sup>2</sup> differences. From an original PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> of 0.076, R<sup>2</sup> increased to 0.094-0.088 for those in the bottom physical activity, alcohol intake, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol quintiles, and decreased to 0.067-0.049 for those in the top quintile, respectively, comparable to differences observed between ancestries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). We note that the differences in R<sup>2</sup> due to alcohol intake and HDL were larger than those of any physical activity phenotype, despite physical activity having one of the oldest and most replicable evidence of interaction with genetic effects of BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Despite considerable published evidence suggesting covariate-specific genetic effects between BMI and smoking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), we were only able to find suggestive evidence for R<sup>2</sup> differences when stratifying individuals across several smoking phenotypes (minimum p=0.016, for smoking pack years). R<sup>2</sup> differences due to educational attainment were also only suggestive (p=0.015), with published evidence on this association being conflicting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>).</p>

<p>We replicated these analyses in three additional large-scale cohorts of European and African ancestry individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Supplemental Table 3), as well as in African ancestry UKBB individuals. Among covariates with significant performance differences in the discovery analysis, we were able to replicate significant (p&lt;.05) R<sup>2</sup> differences for age, HDL cholesterol, alcohol intake frequency, physical activity, and HbA1c, despite much smaller sample sizes. We again observed mostly insignificant differences across cohorts and ancestries when stratifying due to different smoking phenotypes and educational attainment. For each covariate and ancestry combination, we combined data across cohorts and conducted a linear regression weighted by sample size, regressing R<sup>2</sup> values on covariate values across groupings. Slopes of the regressions across cohorts had different signs between ancestries for the same covariate (triglyceride levels, HbA1c, diastolic blood pressure, and sex), although larger sample sizes may be needed to confirm these differences are statistically significant.</p>
<p>Several observations related to age-specific effects on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> we considered noteworthy. First, in the weighted linear regression of all R<sup>2</sup> values across ancestries, expected R<sup>2</sup> for African ancestry individuals can become greater than that of European ancestry individuals among individuals within bottom and top age quintiles observed in these data. For instance, the predicted R<sup>2</sup> of 0.048 for 80 year-old European ancestry individuals would be lower than that of African ancestry individuals aged 24.7 and lower, indicating that differences in covariates can affect PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance more than differences due to ancestry. Second, we obtained these results despite the average age of GWAS individuals being 57.8, which should increase PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> for individuals closest to this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). This result suggests that PGS performance due to decreased heritability with age cannot be fully reconciled using GWAS from individuals of similar age being used to create PGS<sub>BMI</sub> (as heritability is an upper bound on PGS performance). Finally, we observed that PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> increases as age decreases, consistent with published evidence suggesting that the heritability of BMI decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>).</p>

<title>PGS-covariate interaction effects</title>
<p>Next, we estimated difference in PGS effects due to interactions with covariates, by modeling interaction terms between PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and the covariate for each covariate in our list (described in Methods). We implemented a correction for shared heritability between covariates of interest and outcome (which can inflate test statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>)) to better measure the environmental component of each covariate, and show that this correction successfully reduces significance of interaction estimates (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Again, using UKBB EUR as the discovery cohort, we observed 28 covariates with significant (Bonferroni p&lt;.05/62) PGS-covariate interactions (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), with 38 having suggestive (p&lt;.05) evidence (Supplemental Table 4). We observed the largest effect of PGS-covariate interaction with alcohol drinking frequency (20.0% decrease in PGS effect per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase, p=2.62×10<sup>-55</sup>), with large effects for different physical activity measures (9.4%-12.5% decrease/SD, minimum p=3.11×10<sup>-66</sup>), HDL cholesterol (15.3% decrease/SD, p=1.71×10<sup>-96</sup>) and total cholesterol (12.7% decrease/SD, p=1.64×10<sup>-71</sup>). We observed significant interactions with diastolic blood pressure (10.8% increase/SD, p=6.06×10<sup>-</sup> <sup>60</sup>), but interactions with systolic blood pressure were much smaller (1.17% increase/SD, p=4.41×10<sup>-3</sup>). Significant interactions with HbA1c (4.63% increase/SD, p=5.37×10<sup>-14</sup>) and type 2 diabetes (27.2% PGS effect increase in cases, p=1.83×10<sup>-7</sup>) were also observed. Other significant PGS-covariate interactions included lung function, age, sex, and LDL cholesterol – various dietary measurements also had significant interactions, albeit with smaller effects than other significant covariates. We were able to find significant interaction effects for smoking pack years (4.78% increase/SD, p=3.68×10<sup>-7</sup>), but other smoking phenotypes had insignificant interaction effects after correcting for multiple tests (minimum p=2.7×10<sup>-3</sup>); interactions with educational attainment were also insignificant (p= 4.54×10<sup>-2</sup>).</p>

<p>We replicated these analyses across ancestries and the other non-UKBB EUR cohorts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Supplemental Table 4). For age and sex, which were available for all cohorts, interactions were significant (p&lt;.05) and directionally consistent across cohorts and ancestries (except for GERA AFR which had small sample size (N=1,789)). We were able to test interactions with alcohol intake frequency and physical activity in GERA, and replicated significant and directionally consistent associations. We observed poor replication for LDL cholesterol, HbA1c, and smoking pack years, with insignificant and directionally inconsistent interaction effects across cohorts. Educational attainment was available in GERA, and interactions were once again insignificant. We observed significant and directionally consistent interaction effects for TG in eMERGE EUR and PMBB EUR, while the effect was inconsistent in UKBB EUR despite much larger sample size.</p>

<p>However, despite significance of interaction terms, increases in model R<sup>2</sup> when including PGS-covariate interaction terms were small. For instance, the maximum increase among all covariates in UKBB EUR was only 0.0024 from a base R<sup>2</sup> of 0.1049 (2.1% relative increase), for alcoholic drinks per week. Across all cohorts and ancestries, the maximum increase in R<sup>2</sup> was only 0.0058 from a base R<sup>2</sup> of 0.09454 (6.1% relative increase), when adding a PGS-age interaction term for eMERGE EUR (p=5.40×10<sup>-46</sup>) – this was also the largest relative increase among models with significant interaction terms. This result suggests that, while interaction effects can significantly modify PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect, their overall impact on model performance is relatively small, despite large differences in R<sup>2</sup> when stratifying by covariates.</p>

<title>Correlations between R<sup>2</sup> differences, interaction effects, and main effects</title>
<p>We next investigated the relationship between interaction effects, maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences across quintiles, and main effects of covariates on BMI. We first estimated main effects of each covariate on BMI (Methods, Supplemental Table 5), and then calculated the correlation weighted by sample size between main effects, maximum PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> across quintiles, and PGS-covariate interaction effects (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) across all cohorts and ancestries – GERA data were excluded from these analyses due to slightly different phenotype definition (Supplemental Table 6), as were binary variables. Interaction effects and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences had a 0.80 correlation (p=2.1×10<sup>-27</sup>), indicating that variables with larger interaction effects also had larger effects on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance across quintiles, and that covariates that increase PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect also have the largest effect on PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance i.e., individuals most at risk for obesity will have both disproportionately larger PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect and R<sup>2</sup>. Main effects and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences had a 0.56 correlation (p=1.3×10<sup>-11</sup>), while main effects and interaction effects had a 0.58 correlation (p=7.6×10<sup>-12</sup>) again suggesting that PGS<sub>BMI</sub> are more predictive in individuals with higher values of BMI-associated covariates, although less predictive than estimating the interaction effects themselves directly. However, this result demonstrates that covariates that influence both PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect and performance can be predicted just using main effects of covariates, which are often known for certain phenotypes and easier to calculate, as genetic data and PGS construction would not be required.</p>

<p>Increase in PGS effect for increasing percentiles of BMI itself, and its relation to R<sup>2</sup> differences when stratifying by covariates Given large and replicable correlations between main effects, interaction effects, and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences for individual covariates, it seemed these differences may be due to the differences in BMI itself, rather than any individual or combination of covariates. To assess this, we used quantile regression to evaluate the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> on BMI at different deciles of BMI itself. We observed that the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> consistently increases from lower deciles to higher deciles across all cohorts and ancestries (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) – for instance, in European ancestry UKBB individuals, the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> (in units of log(BMI)) when predicting the bottom decile of log(BMI) was 0.716 (95% CI: 0.701-.732), and increased to 1.31 (95% CI: 1.29-1.33) in the top decile. Across all cohorts and ancestries, the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> between lowest and highest effect decile ranged from 1.43-2.06 times larger, with all cohorts and ancestries having non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals between their effects (except for African ancestry eMERGE individuals, which had much smaller sample size).</p>

</fig>
<p>While this analysis showed that the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> increases as BMI itself increases, which may help explain significant interaction effects between PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and different covariates, it does not directly explain differences in R<sup>2</sup> when stratifying by different covariates – we describe several points that help explain this result and suggest they may actually be closely related. Essentially, as the magnitude of the slope of a regression line increases while the mean squared residual does not increase, model R<sup>2</sup> will increase – we demonstrate this using simulated data (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 2</xref>). As the magnitude of the regression line’s slope decreases, the regression line becomes a comparatively worse predictor compared to just using the mean, which decreases R<sup>2</sup> despite the mean error being the same across models. To demonstrate this in real data, we compared simple univariable models of log(BMI) ∼ PGS<sub>BMI</sub> (in units of log(BMI)) between the bottom and top age quintiles in the European ancestry UKBB (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). As shown in previous sections, R<sup>2</sup> and PGS<sub>BMI</sub> beta are higher in younger individuals (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.088 versus R<sup>2</sup> = 0.066, and beta=1.12 and 0.87, respectively), which seem to be a direct consequence of one another, as the mean squared error in younger individuals is actually higher (0.027 versus 0.022, respectively). This description suggests that the use of R<sup>2</sup> as the sole performance metric for evaluation of PGS may not always be appropriate, despite its overwhelming usage. Furthermore, this explanation helps explain the seemingly paradoxical results of significant interaction terms yet small increases in overall model R<sup>2</sup>, and comparably much larger differences in R<sup>2</sup> in the stratified analyses.</p>

<title>Effects of machine learning approaches on predictive performance</title>
<p>Given evidence of PGS-covariate dependence, we aimed to assess increases in R<sup>2</sup> when using machine learning models (neural networks), which can inherently model interactions and other nonlinearities, over linear models even with interaction terms. We first included age and sex as the only covariates (along with genotype PCs and PGS<sub>BMI</sub>), as age and sex were present in all datasets and had significant and replicable evidence for PGS-dependence across our analyses. Three models were assessed – L1-regularized (i.e., LASSO) linear regression without any interaction terms, LASSO including a PGS-age and PGS-sex interaction term, and neural networks (without interaction terms). When comparing neural networks to LASSO with interaction terms, the relative 10-fold cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> increased up to 67% (mean 23%) across cohorts and ancestries (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Supplemental Table 7). The inclusion of interaction terms increased cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> up to 12% (mean 3.9%) when comparing LASSO including interaction terms to LASSO with main effects only.</p>

<p>We then modeled all available covariates and their interactions with PGS for each cohort and did similar comparisons. Cross-validated R<sup>2</sup> increased by up to 17.6% (mean 9.5%) when using neural networks versus LASSO with interaction terms, and up to 7.0% (mean 2.0%) when comparing LASSO with interaction terms to LASSO with main effects only. Increases in model performance using neural networks were smaller in UKBB, perhaps due to the age range being smaller than other cohorts (all participants aged 39-73). This result suggests that additional variance explained through non-linear effects with age and sex are explained by other variables present in the remainder of the datasets. Our findings show machine learning methods can improve model R<sup>2</sup> that include PGS<sub>BMI</sub> as variables beyond including interaction terms in linear models, even when variable selection is performed using LASSO, demonstrating that model performance can be increased beyond modeling nonlinearities through linear interaction terms and a feature selection procedure.</p>

<title>Calculating PGS directly from GxAge GWAS effects</title>
<p>Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>) have created PGS using GWAS stratified by different personal-level covariates, but for practical purposes this leads to a large loss of power as the full size of the GWAS is not utilized for each strata and continuous variables are forced into bins. We developed a novel strategy where PGS are instead created from a full-size GWAS that includes SNP-covariate interaction terms (Methods). We focused on age interactions, given their large and replicable effects based on our results – similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), we conducted these analyses in the European UKBB. We used a 60% random split of study individuals to conduct three sets of PGS using GWAS of the following designs: main effects only, main effects also with a SNP-age interaction term, and main effects but stratified into quartiles by age. 20% of the remaining data were used for training and the final 20% were held-out as a test set. The best performing PGS created from SNP-age interaction terms (PGS<sub>GxAge</sub>) increased test R<sup>2</sup> to 0.0771 (95% bootstrap CI: 0.0770-0.0772) from 0.0715 (95% bootstrap CI: 0.0714-0.0716), a 7.8% relative increase compared to the best performing main effect PGS (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Supplemental Table 8 – age-stratified PGS had much lower performance than both other strategies (unsurprising given reasons previously mentioned). Including a PGS<sub>GxAge</sub>-age interaction term only marginally increased R<sup>2</sup> (0.0001 increase), with similar increases for the other two sets of PGS, further demonstrating that post-hoc modeling of interactions cannot reconcile performance gained through directly incorporating interaction effects from the original GWAS. The strategy of creating PGS directly from full-sized SNP-covariate interactions is potentially quite useful as it increases PGS performance without the need for additional data – there are almost certainly a variety of points of improvement (described more in Discussion), but we consider their investigation outside the scope of this study.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We uncovered replicable effects of covariates across four large-scale cohorts of diverse ancestry, on both performance and effects of PGS<sub>BMI</sub>. When stratifying by quintiles of different covariates, certain covariates had significant and replicable evidence for differences in PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup>, with R<sup>2</sup> being nearly double between top and bottom performing quintiles for covariates with the largest differences. When testing PGS-covariate interaction effects, we also found covariates with significant interaction effects, where, for the largest effect covariates, each standard deviation change affected PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effect by nearly 20%. Across analyses, we found age and sex had the most replicable interaction effects, with levels of serum cholesterol, physical activity, and alcohol consumption having the largest effects across cohorts. Interaction effects and R<sup>2</sup> differences were strongly correlated, with main effects also being correlated with interaction effects and R<sup>2</sup> differences, suggesting that covariates with the largest interaction effects also contribute to the largest R<sup>2</sup> differences, with simple main effects also being predictive of expected differences in R<sup>2</sup> and interaction effects. Relatedly, we observed the effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> increases as BMI itself increases, and reason that differences in R<sup>2</sup> when stratifying by covariates are largely a consequence of difference in PGS<sub>BMI</sub> effects. Next, we employed machine learning methods for prediction of BMI with models that include PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and demonstrate that these methods outperform regularized linear regression models that include interaction effects. Finally, we employed a novel strategy that directly incorporates SNP interaction effects into PGS construction, and demonstrate that this strategy improves PGS performance when modeling SNP-age interactions compared to PGS created only from main effects.</p>
<p>These observations are relevant to current research and clinical use of PGS, as individuals above a percentile cutoff are designated high-risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), implying that individuals most at-risk for obesity have both disproportionately higher predicted BMI and increased BMI prediction performance compared to the general population. More broadly, these results may likely extend to single variant effects instead of those aggregated into a PGS, which may inform the cause of previous GxE discoveries – for instance, variants near <italic>FTO</italic> that interact with physical activity discovered through GWAS of BMI are robust and well-documented. However, individuals engaging in physical activity will generally have lower BMI than those that are sedentary, and these results suggest it may not be the difference in physical activity that’s driving the interaction, rather the difference in BMI itself. This concept may also apply to other traits – for instance, sex-specific analyses are commonly performed, and variants with differing effects between males and females GWAS may largely be explained by phenotypic differences, rather than any combination of biological or lifestyle differences.</p>
<p>Future work may include replicating these analyses across additional traits, and trying to understand why these differences occur, as well as further exploring machine learning and deep learning methods on other phenotypes to determine if this trend of inclusion of PGS along with covariate interaction effects outperforms linear models for risk prediction. Additionally, inclusion of a PGS for the covariate to better measure its environmental effect is potentially worth exploring further, and should improve in the future as PGS performance continues to increase. A slight limitation of this method in our study is that for the UKBB analyses the GWAS used for PGS construction were also from UKBB thus not out-of-sample, although many of the covariates only have GWAS available through UKBB individuals. Furthermore, a variety of improvements are likely possible when creating PGS directly from SNP-covariate interaction terms. First, we used the same SNPs that were selected by pruning and thresholding based on their main effect p-values, but selection of SNPs based on their interaction p-values should also be possible and would likely improve performance. Additionally, performance of pruning and thresholding-based strategies have largely been overtaken by methods that first adjust all SNP effects for LD and don’t require exclusion of SNPs, and a method that could do a similar adjustment for interaction effects would likely outperform most current methods for traits with significant context-specific effects. Next, incorporating additional SNP-covariate interactions (e.g., SNP-sex) would also likely further improve prediction performance, although any SNP selection/adjustment procedures may be further complicated by additional interaction terms.</p>
<p>Finally, if SNP effects do truly differ according to differences in phenotype, then SNP effects would differ depending on the alleles one has, implying epistatic interactions are occurring at these SNPs.</p>
<p>While difference in phenotype itself may be able to explain difference in genetic effects, it still may be that specific environmental or lifestyle characteristics are driving the differences. We propose several ideas about why BMI-associated covariates have larger interaction effects and impact on R<sup>2</sup> for PGS<sub>BMI</sub>. First, age may be a proxy for accumulated gene-environment interactions as younger individuals have less exposure to environmental influences on weight compared to older individuals; therefore, one may expect that in younger individuals their phenotype could be better explained by genetics compared to environment. Second, PGS may more readily explain high phenotype values especially for positively skewed phenotypes, as large effect variants (e.g., associated with very high weight or height (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>)) may be more responsible for extremely high phenotypic values. For example, the distribution of BMI is often positively skewed, and effects in trait-increasing alleles may have a larger potential to explain trait variation compared to trait-reducing variants. This explanation would likely be better suited to positively skewed traits and is not fully satisfactory as first log-transforming or rank-normal transforming the phenotype, as was done in this study, may invalidate this explanation.</p>
<p>PGS is a promising technique to stratify individuals for their risk of common, complex disease. To achieve more accurate predictions as well as promote equity, further research is required regarding PGS methods and assessments. This research provides firm evidence supporting the context-specific nature of PGS and the impact of nonlinear covariate effects for improving polygenic prediction of BMI, promoting equitable use of PGS across ancestries and cohorts.</p>

<title>PGS construction</title>
<p>PGS for BMI (PGS<sub>BMI</sub>) were constructed using PRS-CSx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>), using GWAS summary statistics for individuals of European (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), African (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), and East Asian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) ancestry that were out-of-sample of study participants. A set of 1.29 million HapMap3 SNPs provided by PRS-CSx was used for PGS calculation, which are generally well-imputed and variable frequency across global populations. Default settings for PRS-CSx (downloaded November 22, 2021) were used, which have been demonstrated to perform well for highly polygenic traits such as BMI (list of parameters in Supplemental Table 9). The final PGS<sub>BMI</sub> per ancestry and cohort was calculated by regressing log(BMI) on the PGS<sub>BMI</sub> per ancestry without covariates – the combined, predicted value was used as a single PGS<sub>BMI</sub> in downstream analyses.</p>
<p>For GERA, BMI was not transformed, as it was already binned into a categorical variable with 5 levels (18≤, 19-25, 26-29, 30-39, &gt;40). Additionally, for GERA the uncombined ancestry-specific PGS<sub>BMI</sub> were used in the final models, as it had higher R<sup>2</sup> than using the combined PGS<sub>BMI</sub> (data not shown).</p>

<title>PGS<sub>BMI</sub> performance after covariate stratification</title>
<p>Analyses were performed separately for each cohort and ancestry. For each covariate, individuals were binned by binary covariates or quintiles for continuous covariates. Incremental PGS<sub>BMI</sub> R<sup>2</sup> was calculated by taking the difference in R<sup>2</sup> between:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="23289777v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We performed 5,000 bootstrap replications to obtain a bootstrapped distribution of R<sup>2</sup>. P-values for differences in R<sup>2</sup> were calculated between groups by calculating the proportion of overlap between two normal distributions of the R<sup>2</sup> value using the standard deviations of the bootstrap distributions. Again for GERA, BMI was not transformed.</p>

<title>PGS<sub>BMI</sub> interaction modelling</title>
<p>Evidence for interaction with each covariate with the PGS<sub>BMI</sub> was evaluated using linear regression. It has been reported that the inclusion of covariates that are genetically correlated with the outcome can inflate test statistic estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). To assuage these concerns, we introduced a novel correction, where we first calculated a PGS for the covariate (PGS<sub>Covariate</sub>) and included it in the model, as well as an interaction term between PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and PGS<sub>Covariate</sub>. The PGS<sub>Covariate</sub> terms were calculated using the European ancestry Neale Lab summary statistics (URLs) and PRS-CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). To standardize effect sizes across analyses, PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and Covariate were first converted to mean zero and standard deviation of 1 (binary covariates were not standardized). We demonstrate inclusion of PGS<sub>Covariate</sub> terms successfully reduced significance of the PGS<sub>BMI</sub>*Covariate term (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). The final model used to evaluate PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and Covariate interactions was:

<title>Correlation between R<sup>2</sup> differences, interaction effects, and main effects</title>
<p>We estimated main effects of each covariate on BMI with the following model:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="23289777v2_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Note that we ran new models with main effects only, instead of using the main effect from the interaction models (as the main effects in the interaction models depend on the interaction terms, and main effects used to create interaction terms are sensitive to centering of variables despite the scale invariance of linear regression itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>)). We then estimated the correlation between main effects, interaction effects, and maximum R<sup>2</sup> differences across all cohorts and ancestries weighting by sample size, analyzing quantitative and binary variables separately.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Quantile regression to measure PGS effect across percentiles of BMI</title>
<p>The effect of PGS<sub>BMI</sub> on BMI at different deciles of BMI was assessed using quantile regression. Tau – the parameter that sets which percentile to be predicted – was set to .10, .20, …, .90.</p>
<p>Models included age, sex, and the top 5 genetic PCs as covariates. Analyses were stratified by ancestry and cohort, and BMI was first log transformed. GERA was excluded from these analyses, as a portion of the models failed to run (as BMI values from GERA were already binned, some deciles all had the same BMI value – additionally, difference in effects between bins would be harder to evaluate as BMI within each decile would be more homogeneous).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4h">
<title>Machine learning models</title>
<p>UKBB EUR and GERA EUR models were restricted to 30,000 random individuals, for computational reasons – BMI distributions did not differ from the full-sized datasets (Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value of 0.29 and 0.57, respectively). PGS<sub>BMI</sub> and top five genetic principal components were included as features in all models. Two sets of models were evaluated for each cohort and ancestry: including age and sex as features, and including all available covariates in each cohort as features. Interactions terms between PGS and each covariate were included for models using interaction terms. ‘Ever Smoker’ status was used in favor of ‘Never’ vs ‘Current smoking’ status (if present), as individuals with ‘Never’ vs ‘Current’ status are a subset of those with ‘Ever Smoker’ status. UKBB AFR with all covariates was excluded due to small sample size (N=53).</p>
<p>Neural networks were used as the model of choice, given their inherent ability model interactions and other nonlinear dependencies. Prior to modeling, all features were scaled to be between 0 and 1. We used average 10-fold cross validation R<sup>2</sup> to evaluate model performance. Separate models were trained using untransformed and log(BMI). L1-regularized linear regression was used with 18 values of lambda (1.0, 5.0×10<sup>-1</sup>, 2.0×10<sup>-1</sup>, 1.0×10<sup>-1</sup>, 5.0×10<sup>-2</sup>, 2.0×10<sup>-</sup> <sup>2</sup>, …, 1.0×10<sup>-5</sup>, 5.0×10<sup>-6</sup>, 2.0×10<sup>-6</sup>). Models were trained without inclusion of interaction terms (which neural networks can implicitly model), using 1,000 iterations of random search with the following hyperparameter ranges: size of hidden layers [10, 200], learning rate [0.01, 0.0001], type of learning rate [constant, inverse scaling], power t [0.4, 0.6], momentum [0.80, 1.0], batch size [32, 256], and number of hidden layers [1, 2].</p>

<title>GxAge PGS<sub>BMI</sub> creation and assessment</title>
<p>Analyses were conducted in the European UKBB (N=376,629), as was done in a study on a similar topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Three sets of analyses were performed, using GWAS conducted in a 60% random split of individuals using the following models (BMI was rank-normal transformed before GWAS):
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>BMI ∼ SNP + Age + Sex + PCs<sub>1-5</sub></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>BMI ∼ SNP + Age*SNP + Age + Sex + PCs<sub>1-5</sub></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Using the model in 1) but stratified into quartiles by age. BMI was rank-normal transformed within each quartile.</p></list-item>
</list>
Using each set of GWAS, PGS was first calculated in a 20% randomly selected training set of the dataset using pruning and thresholding using 10 p-value thresholds (0.50, 0.10, …, 5.0×10<sup>-5</sup>, 1.0×10<sup>-5</sup>) and remaining settings as default in Plink 1.9. For 2), GxAge PGS<sub>BMI</sub> were calculated using SNPs clumped by their main effect p-values from 1), and additionally incorporating the GxAge interaction effects per SNP. In other words, instead of typical PGS construction as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="23289777v2_ueqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>PGS<sub>i</sub> = β<sub>1</sub>k<sub>1</sub> + β<sub>2</sub>k<sub>2</sub> + … + β<sub>n</sub>k<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>For an individual <italic>i</italic>’s PGS calculation, with main SNP effect β, and <italic>n</italic> SNPs, PGS incorporating GxAge effects (PGS<sub>GxAge</sub>) was calculated as:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="23289777v2_ueqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Where β<sub>GxAge</sub> is the GxAge effect for each SNP <italic>n</italic> and Age<sub>i</sub> is the age for individual <italic>i</italic>.</p>
<p>For each of the three analyses, the parameters and models resulting in the best performing PGS (highest incremental R<sup>2</sup>, using same main effect covariates as in the three GWAS) from the training set were evaluated in the remaining 20% of the study individuals. For 3), models were first trained within each quartile separately. To maintain sense of scale across quartiles (after rank-normal transformation), R<sup>2</sup> between all predicted values and true values was calculated together. For R<sup>2</sup> confidence intervals, the training set was bootstrapped and evaluated on the test set 5,000 times.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>convincing</bold> analysis of the effects of covariates, such as age, sex, socio-economic status, or biomarker levels, on the predictive accuracy of polygenic scores for body mass index; The work is further supported by <bold>important</bold> approaches for improving prediction accuracy by accounting for such covariates across a variety of association studies. The authors did a commendable job addressing reviewer suggestions and comments. The work will be of interest to colleagues using and developing methods for phenotypic prediction based on polygenic scores.</p>

<p>In this paper Hui and colleagues investigate how the predictive accuracy of a polygenic score (PGS) for body mass index (BMI) changes when individuals are stratified by 62 different covariates. After showing that the PGS has different predictive power across strata for 18 out of 62 covariates, they turn to understanding why these differences and seeing if predictive performance could be improved. First they investigated which types of covariates result in the largest differences in PGS predictive power, finding that covariates with with larger &quot;main effects&quot; on the trait and covariates with larger interaction effects (interacting with the PGS to affect the trait) tend to better stratify individuals by PGS performance. The authors then see if including interactions between the PGS and covariates improves predictive accuracy, finding that linear models only result in modest increases in performance but nonlinear models result in more substantial performance gains.</p>
<p>Overall, the results are interesting and well-supported. The results will be broadly interesting to people using and developing PGS methods, as well as the broader statistical genetics community.</p>
<p>A few of the important points of the paper are:</p>
<p>A major impediment to the clinical use of PGS is the interaction between the PGS and various other routinely measure covariates, and this work provides a very interesting empirical study along these lines. The problem is interesting, and the work presented here is a convincing empirical study of the problem.</p>
<p>The result that PGS accuracy differs across covariates, but in a way that is not well-captured by linear models with interactions is important for PGS method development.</p>
<p>The quantile regression analysis is an interesting approach to explore how and why PGS may differ in accuracy across different strata of individuals.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We previously responded to reviewer comments in a previous iteration of this draft, edited the manuscript accordingly, and have no further comments on the majority of them. However, we performed additional analyses mainly in response to weaknesses Reviewer 1 highlighted related to “one shortcoming [being] the lack of a conceptual model explaining the results”, and the eLife assessment stating “the study falls short of providing a cogent interpretation of key findings, which could be of great interest and utility”. We provide a conceptual explanation that ties together many of our results, which we demonstrate using real data and further explore using simulated data – these analyses are in a new section titled “Increase in PGS effect for increasing percentiles of BMI itself, and its relation to R2 differences when stratifying by covariates”, with the Discussion also being updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Essentially, we demonstrate that the effect of PGSBMI increases as BMI itself increases (using quantile regression – newly created Figure 5). This finding helps explain the correlation between covariate main effects, interaction effects, and maximum R2 differences when stratifying on different covariates, and also why any one or combination of covariates did not seem to be of unusual interest. While this result readily explains why covariates with larger main effects have larger interaction effects, by itself it does not seem to explain the differences in R2 in covariate-stratified bins, but we show using portions of real data and simulated data that in the case of this study they are closely related.</p>
<p>Effectively, as the effect of PGSBMI increases, variance in the phenotype will also increase – so long as the residuals do not increase proportionately, this causes R2 to also increase as R2 directly depends on outcome variance. We demonstrate this using simulated data (newly created S Figure 2) and real data (newly created S Figure 3). So the largest R2 differences between certain covariate-stratified bins seems to be a direct consequence of those covariates also having the largest PGSBMI*covariate interaction effects. These results tie into our previous response to Reviewer 1, where essentially there is not only heteroskedasticity in the relationship between PGSBMI and BMI, but a cause of the heteroskedasticity is an increasing effect in PGSBMI as BMI itself increases.</p>
<p>In the Discussion, we highlight several broad implications of these findings. First, these results may, in part, provide a generalizable explanation for epistasis, as the effect of a PGS (or any individual SNP) seems to depend on phenotype, and as phenotype depends on many SNPs, the effect of PGS and individual SNPs depends on other SNPs. Second, these results may also provide a generalizable explanation for GxE, as, demonstrated in this paper, interaction effects for SNPs (or a PGS) may largely depend on the phenotypic value itself, rather than any specific environment(s) or combination of. Finally, related to our previous response to Reviewer 2, modeling effects of SNPs dependent on phenotype itself would almost certainly result in gains in PGS performance (and locus discovery), which should also be larger than e.g., just GxAge effects as we demonstrated in this manuscript.</p>
