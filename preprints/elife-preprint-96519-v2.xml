<title>Summary</title><p>Somatic genetic heterogeneity resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations is widespread in human tissues and can cause diseases, however few studies have investigated its role in neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Here we report the selective enrichment of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants, that are not present in neuronal, glia/stromal cells, or blood, from patients with AD in comparison to age-matched controls. Notably, microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. These variants activate ERK and drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in patients. Although the natural history of AD-associated microglial clones is difficult to establish in human, microglial expression of a MAPK pathway activating variant was previously shown to cause neurodegeneration in mice, suggesting that AD-associated neuroinflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases are a frequent cause of progressive dementia. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is diagnosed in ∼90% of cases, with an estimated prevalence of ∼10% in the population over 65 years of age <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The role of germline genetic variation in neurodegenerative diseases and AD has been studied intensely. Although autosomal dominant forms of AD due to rare germline variants with high penetrance account only for an estimated ∼1% of cases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, a number of common variants were also shown to contribute to disease risk. Carriers of one germline copy of the epsilon4 (E4) allele of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4), present in ∼15 to 20% of population, have a three-fold higher risk of AD, while two copies (∼2 to 3 % of population) increase the risk by ∼10-fold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified an additional ∼50 common germline variants that more moderately increase the risk of AD, including TREM2, CD33, and MS4A6A variants <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the APOE4 allele is responsible for an increased inflammatory and neurotoxic response of microglia and astrocytes in the brain of carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and it was noted that the majority of the other germline AD-risk variants are located within or near genes expressed in microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and in particular at microglia-specific enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These data, together with transcriptional studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> support the hypothesis that genetic variation in microglia may contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegeneration and AD.</p>
<p>Somatic genetic heterogeneity (mosaicism), resulting from post-zygotic DNA mutations, is widespread in human tissues, and a cause of tumoral, developmental, and immune diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Aditionally, a role of somatic variants in neuropsychiatric disorders is also suspected <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Mosaicism has been documented in the brain tissue of AD patients in several deep-sequencing studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, showing that the enrichment of putative pathogenic somatic mutations in the PI3K-AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway do occur in the brain of patients in comparison to controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However these studies performed in whole brain tissue lacked cellular resolution and mechanistic insights, and the role of somatic mutants in neurodegenerative diseases remains poorly understood <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Somatic variants that activate the PI3K-AKT-mTOR or MAPK pathways in neural progenitors are a cause of cortical dysplasia and epilepsy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and developmental brain malformations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, while somatic variants that activate the MAPK pathway in brain endothelial cells are associated with arteriovenous malformations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we reported that expression of a somatic variant activating the MAPK pathway in microglia causes neurodegeneration in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, but the presence and contribution of microglial somatic clones in neurodegenerative diseases and AD remains unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we investigated the presence and nature of somatic variants in brain cells from control and AD patients. In an attempt to examine all brain cells at the same resolution, nuclei from neurons, glia cells and microglia, which only represent ∼5% of brain cells, were pre-sorted. Human microglia are reported to develop in embryo and renew by local proliferation within the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. However, bone marrow-derived myeloid cells can enter the brain, in particular during pathological processes, and may not be distinguishable from resident microglia by transcriptomics alone <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In order to distinguish somatic variants carried by resident microglia from the one carried by myeloid cells of peripheral origin, we analyzed matched peripheral blood from control and patients, to ‘barcode’ somatic mutants shared between microglia and blood. Finally, in order to achieve high sensitivity in the detection of variants that confer a proliferative or activation advantage (pathogenic mutations) and support the emergence or pathogenicity of mosaic clones <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, and/or that have been previously associated with neurological diseases, we initially performed a targeted deep-sequencing of a panel of 716 genes covering somatic variants reported in clonal proliferative disorders and genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases diseases.</p>
<p>We found that microglia from AD patients were enriched for pathogenic variants in comparison to age-matched controls. Furthemore, we found that these microglia-specific AD-associated variants preferentially target the MAPK pathway, including recurrent CBL ring-domain mutations. In addition, we showed that these variants drive a microglia transcriptional program characterized by a strong neuro-inflammatory response previously associated with neurotoxicity, including the production of IL1 and TNF, both in <italic>in vitro</italic> microglia models and in patients. The natural history of the AD-associated microglia clonal inflammatory disorder we describe here is difficult to establish. Specifically, we do not know whether it contributes to the onset of the neuro-inflammatory process at an early stage of the disease, or if microglia carrying pathogenic mutations preferentially expand later during the course of the disease in response to tissue inflammation. Under both hypotheses however, the presence of neuro-inflammatory microglial clones may contribute to the neurodegenerative process in a subset of AD patients. This report reveals a previously unrecognized presence of AD-associated microglia harboring pathogenic somatic variants in humans and provides mechanistic insight for neurodegenerative diseases by delineating cell-type specific variant recurrence.</p>

<title>Clonal diversity among brain cells and blood from controls and AD patients</title>
<p>We examined post-mortem frozen brain samples and matching blood from 45 patients with intermediate-onset sporadic AD and 44 control individuals who died of other causes, including 27 donors age and sex-matched donors with the AD cohort (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table 1). APOE risk allele frequency for patients and controls was comparable to published series <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. 1A), and analysis of germline mutations did not identify deleterious variants in the 140 genes associated with neurological diseases. Myeloid/microglia, neurons, and glia/stromal cells were purified by flow cytometry using antibody against PU.1 and NeuN <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1B and 1C). Single nuclei (sn)RNAseq was performed on PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei from one control and 3 AD patients to evaluate microglia enrichment following PU.1<sup>+</sup> purification, and a cell-type annotation analysis indicated that ∼94% of PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei correspond to microglia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1D-1H). Cortex samples were obtained from all donors but hippocampus samples were mostly obtained from AD patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; Supplementary Table 1). A total of 744 DNA samples from blood, PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei, NeuN<sup>+</sup> nuclei, and Double Negative nuclei (glia/stromal cells) from patients and controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) were submitted to targeted hybridization/capture and deep-DNA targeted sequencing (TDS, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, see Methods), at mean coverage of ∼1,100x (Supplementary Fig. 1I), for a panel of 716 genes (3.43 Mb, referred to below as BRAIN-PACT) which included genes reported to carry somatic variants in clonal proliferative disorders (n=576 genes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> or that have been reported to be associated with neurodegenerativediseases (n=140) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table 2, see Methods).</p>

<p>After QC and filtering of germline variants, variant calling using ShearwaterML and a curated Mutect1 analysis identified 826 somatic synonymous and non-synonymous single-nucleotide-variations (SNVs), at an allelic frequency &gt; 0.3% (mean 1.3%) in the 744 samples, corresponding to an overall variant burden of 0.3 mut/Mb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Sixty-six/826 SNV were present in more than one sample (Supplementary Table 3). Droplet digital-PCR performed on pre-amplification DNA for ∼10% of the 760 unique SNV was positive in 90% of cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1E</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). After annotation using the OncoKB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> and ClinVar <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> databases for disease-associated or causative variants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D,F</xref>; Supplementary Table 3), 96 unique SNV were classified as Pathogenic (P)-SNV. 40% of these P-SNV were tested by droplet digital-PCR and confirmed in 95% of cases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> and Supplementary Table 3). Positive and negative results in matching brain samples from individual donors were confirmed in 100% of samples at a mean depth of ∼5000x (range 648-23.000x) (Supplementary Table 3). A venn-diagram analysis of SNVs detected in PU.1<sup>+</sup>, NeuN<sup>+</sup> , DN, and blood samples indicated that most (&gt;90%) SNV and P-SNV were cell-type or tissue specific, with ∼ 5% of SNV and ∼ 8% of P-SNV shared between the blood and brain of individual donors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). These data indicate that targeted deep-sequencing of purified nuclei allows to detect clonal mosaic variants with high sensitivity and specificity. In addition, ‘bar-coding’ of clonal variants across tissues suggests that infiltrating myeloid cells of peripheral origin account for ∼5% of microglia somatic diversity, and therefore that blood clones have a detectable but minor contribution to microglia, consistent with its local maintainance and proliferation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Somatic clonal diversity of the different cell types, as evaluated by the SNV/megabase burden was higher in blood (1 mut/Mb) and PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei (0.5 mut/Mb) than for DN and neurons (0.18 mut/Mb) (Supplementary Fig. 2A). The SNV/mb burden of blood and PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei increased as a function of age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and Supplementary Table 3) as previously reported for proliferating cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the SNV/mb burden of blood cells from age-matched controls was higher than for AD patients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). In contrast, there was no difference in SNV/mb burden between PU.1<sup>+</sup>, NEUN<sup>+</sup> and DN samples from AD patients and age-matched controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and between PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei from the cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem/cerebellum samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These data altogether indicate that the clonal diversity of microglia and blood both increase with age, and that the clonal diversity of blood cells is lower in AD than in age-matched controls who died of other causes including cancer and cardiovascular diseases (see Methods). This is consistent with recent studies showing that clonal hematopoiesis is associated with a higher risk of several diseases related to ageing such as cardiovascular diseases, but inversely associated with the risk of AD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants are enriched in AD patients</title>
<p>In contrast to the global SNV burden, increased P-SNV burden was correlated not only with age (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), but also with the disease status (AD) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-H</xref>). Within the control group, the SNV and P-SNV burden was higher in the blood of controls treated for cancer (Supplementary Fig. 2B). The P-SNV burden per Mb was selectively and highly enriched in PU.1<sup>+</sup> samples from AD patients in comparison to age-matched controls (p=0.0003, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Analysis of PU1<sup>+</sup> P-SNV/Mb burden per brain region indicated that the P-SNV/Mb burden was similar between brain regions within each group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2C), and therefore attributable to AD status rather than sampling bias. Analysis of mutational load per donor confirmed that microglial clones carrying P-SNV were enriched in the brain of AD patients in comparison to age-matched controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Despite the relatively modest cohort size, a logistic regression analysis confirmed the association between the presence of P-SNVs in PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei and AD after adjusting for sex and age (<italic>OR= 7; p=0.0035,</italic> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 2D).

<p>In addition, genes targeted by P-SNV were all expressed in microglia (Supplementary Fig. 2F and Supplementary Table 3) and the analysis of P-SNV/Mb mutational load restricted to genes that are not expressed in microglia did not show an enrichment of candidate pathogenic variants in AD patients (Supplementary Fig. 2G and Supplementary Table 3). Altogether, these results show an association between microglia clones carrying P-SNV and AD in this series.</p>

<p>Pathways analysis of genes carrying P-SNV in microglia from AD patients, against the background of the 716 genes sequenced, showed that the most significant pathways enriched were the receptor tyrosine kinase /MAP-Kinase pathways (Reactome, GO, and canonical pathways, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and Supplementary Table 4), corresponding to pathogenic/oncogenic variants in 6 of the 15 genes of the classical MAPK pathway <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup> (CBL, BRAF, RIT1, NF1, PTPN11, KRAS), TEK, and the KEGG Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) pathway, which includes the former plus SMAD5 and TP53 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, 3C and Supplementary Fig. 3). Mutational load for MAPK genes was significantly higher in AD patients in comparison to age-matched control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Other enriched pathways, albeit less significant, included genes involved in DNA repair and chromatin binding/ methyltransferase activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Supplementary Table 4).

<p>In half of the AD patients, no microglia pathogenic variants were identified. Targeted deep sequencing (TDS) cannot identify variants located outside of the BRAIN-PACT panel, such as other potential additional variants that would activate the MAPK pathway.

<title>Heterozygosity for a CBL variant allele activates human microglia-like cells</title>
<p>We used prime editing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref></sup> of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs, see Methods) to generate isogenic hiPSCs clones heterozygous for the patients’ variants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5). We focused our analysis on CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> mutant lines because CBL was mutated in 6 patients and 2 of them carried the same <italic>CBL c.1211G&gt;A</italic> p.C404Y variant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Microglia-like cells were differentiated from two independent hiPSC-derived CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> lines and their isogenic CBL<sup>404C/C</sup> controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5C). CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> and isogenic CBL<sup>404C/C</sup> microglia-like cells expressed similar amount of CBL total mRNA and protein, and CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells expressed wt and mutant mRNA in similar amounts, as expected assuming bi-allelic expression of CBL (Supplementary Fig. 5D-5F). CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells presented with a phenotype comparable to isogenic CBL<sup>404C/C</sup> microglia-like cells for expression of IBA1, CSF1R, NGFR, EGFR, CD11b, MRC1, CD36, CD11c, Tim4, CD45, and MHC Class II (Supplementary Fig. 5G). Their viability was also comparable to control (Supplementary Fig. 5H). However, CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells were larger and presented with more lamellipodia, resulting in an amoeboid morphology less frequently observed in isogenic controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>,<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4E</xref>), and their proliferation rate was slightly increased, as measured by EdU incorporation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Moreover CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells cultured in CSF1-supplemented medium also presented with a higher basal pERK level than control when restimulated with CSF1 (Supplementary Fig. 5I), and ERK phosphorylation after stimulation of starved microglia-like cells with CSF-1 was increased by ∼2 fold in comparison to isogenic WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Altogether, these results showed that heterozygosity for a CBL<sup>C404Y</sup> allele is sufficient to activate human microglia-like cells increasing their proliferation and ERK activation.</p>

<p>Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of RNAseq comparing CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> and isogenic CBL<sup>404C/C</sup> microglia-like cells showed upregulation of Glycolysis, Oxidative Phosphorylation, and mTORC1 signatures, indicating increased metabolism and energy consumption by the mutant cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and Supplementary Table 8).

<title>The MAPK variant neuroinflammatory microglial signature is detectable in patients</title>
<p>Analysis of the snRNAseq data from 5 samples of purified microglia nuclei from 4 donors (control, AD without and with pathogenic variants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1C</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 1D-H and Supplementary Table 9) using unsupervised Louvain clustering and GSEA showed that microglia samples from patients carrying variants were enriched for the signatures observed in the MAC lines and CBL<sup>404C/Y</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 6). In particular microglia cluster 2 and 2B, were most enriched for the inflammatory, TNF, mTOR and oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis signatures in patients carrying variants (AD52, AD53) but not the controls (C11, AD34) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D,E</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 6). Despite the small size of the mutant clones and the low sensitivity of scRNAseq to detect rare allelic variants, KRAS A59G variant reads were detected in cluster 2/2B from patient AD52.</p>
<p>Altogether, the above results support the hypothesis that patients’ microglial clones carrying pathogenic mutations are associated with a metabolic and neuroinflammatory signature that includes the production of neurotoxic cytokines <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We report here that microglia from a cohort of 45 AD patients with intermediate-onset sporadic AD (mean age 65 y.o) is enriched for clones carrying pathogenic/oncogenic variants in genes associated with clonal proliferative disorders (Supplementary Table 2) in comparison to 44 controls. Of note we did not observed microglia P-SNVs within genes reported to be associated with neurological disorders in the patients.</p>
<p>These pathogenic variants are absent from blood, glia or neurons in most cases. They are found predominantly in the MAPK pathway and include reccurent variants (CBL RING domain variants in 6 patients), which promote microglial proliferation, activation, and expression of a neuroinflammatory/neurodegereration-associated transcriptional programme <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the production of neurotoxic cytokines IL1b, TNF, and IFNg <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">115</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">118</xref></sup>. Heterozygous expression of pathogenic CBL variant in human microglia-like cells was sufficient to drive a transcriptional program that associates with increased metabolic activity and a neurotoxic inflammatory response, also observed in microglia from patients with MAPK-activating variants.</p>
<p>The association between AD and MAPK pathway variants is consistent with a previous study where WES performed on unseparated brain tissue from AD patients showed that putative pathogenic somatic variants were enriched for the MAPK pathway, despite the lower sensitivity of the approach and the lack of cellular specificity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The pathogenic role of the somatic pathogenic variants in the MAPK pathway associated with the microglia of AD patients is supported by several lines of evidence. We show here that they promote a neuroinflammatory/neurodegereration-associated transcriptional programme in microglia like cells. In addition, somatic variants that activate the MAPK pathway in tissue macrophages cause a clonal proliferative and inflammatory disease called Histiocytosis, strongly associated with neurodegeneration <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, and introduction in mouse microglia of the variant allele most frequently associated with histiocytosis (BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>) causes neurodegeneration in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. The allelic frequencies of pathogenic variants found in AD patients is lower than values classically observed in solid tumors or leukemia, but within the range of the clonal frequency of pathogenic T cells observed in auto-immune diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">119</xref></sup>, and we found that they were in the range of the allelic frequencies observed for the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> variant in microglia in the brain of Histiocytosis patients. Moreover, the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway is involved in microglia proliferation, activation and inflammatory response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">120</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">122</xref></sup>, neuronal death, neurodegeneration, and AD pathogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">123</xref></sup>, and its activation has been proposed to be an early event in the pathophysiology of AD in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">124</xref></sup>. Neuroinflammation is an early event in AD pathogenesis, increasingly considered as critical in pathogenesis initiation and progression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">126</xref></sup>. This is underscored by the observation that the main known genetic risk factor for sporadic AD is the APOE4 allele, responsible for an increased inflammatory response in the brain of APOE4 carriers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In this regard, the contributing role of MAPK activating variants could be comparable to that of the APOE4 allele, and we noted that the allelic frequency of APOE4 allele is lower in patients with pathogenic variants (16/46 alleles, 34%) than patients without detected variant (23/44 alleles, 53%) although the difference did not reach significance in this series.</p>
<p>Variants targeting the DNA-repair and DNA/histone methylation pathways are also enriched among AD patients, sometimes associated in the same patients, albeit their functional significance was not investigated here. Of note however, germline variants of the DNA-repair transcription factor TP53, and DNA damage sensors ATR and CHEK2 were shown to promote accelerated neurodegeneration in human <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Microglia variants are frequently absent from blood, and our DNA sequencing barcoding approach does not support a model where blood cells massively infiltrate the brain or replace the microglia pool in patients from our series, but instead consistent with the local maintenance and proliferation of microglia <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In addition, our results are consistent with a recent study showing that clonal hematopoiesis was inversely associated with the risk of AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The association of microglia clones carrying pathogenic variants with AD in a subset of patients is not a consequence of an overall increase in microglia mutational load (SNV) in AD. Together with evidence that pathogenic variants drive neuroinflammation, these data suggest that these clones could contribute to AD pathogenesis, together with other genetic and environmental factors. Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, tauopathy, or alpha synucleinopathy, were equally distributed among AD patients with or without microglia clones carrying MAPK activating variants. The natural history of the microglial clones is difficult to study in human. It is possible that microglial clones with proliferative and activation advantage and a neuroinflammatory and neurotoxic profile may be present at the onset and contribute to the early stages of the disease. Alternatively it is also possible that the microglial clones carrying the pathogenic mutations appear or are selected later during the course of the disease in the inflammatory milieu of the AD brain. In the latter case, pathogenic microglial clones may contribute to disease progression, <italic>i.e.</italic> neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.</p>

<title>Tissue samples</title>
<p>The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Human tissues were obtained with patient-informed consent and used under approval by the Institutional Review Boards from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (IRB protocols #X19-027). Snap-frozen human brain and matched blood were provided by the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB), the Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC, NIH), Hospital Sant Joan de Déu and the Rapid Autopsy Program (MSKCC, IRB #15-021). Samples were neuropathologically evaluated and classified by the collaborating institutions as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">5</xref></sup> or non-dementia controls. The mean age of AD patients is 65 years old (55.5% female, 44.5% male). The mean age of all controls is 54 years old (60% female, 40% male), and the mean age of AD age-matched controls was 70 years old (60% female , 40% male). The overall mean of the post-mortem delay interval was 9.8 hours. Patients did not present with germline pathogenic PSEN1/2/3 or APP AD’s associated variants. For additional information on donor’s brain regions, sex, age, cause of death, Apoe status, Braak status see Supplementary Table S1. To avoid possible contamination of sequencing data with mutations associated with donor’s tumoral disease in the group of non-dementia controls, we refrained from selecting cases with blood malignancies or with brain tumors. Samples from histiocytosis patients were collected under GENE HISTIO study (approved by CNIL and CPP Ile-de France) from Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital and Hospital Trousseau and from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.</p>

<title>Nuclei isolation from frozen brain samples, FACS-sorting and DNA extraction</title>
<p>All samples were handled and processed under Air Clean PCR Workstation. An average of 400 mg of frozen brain tissues were homogenized with a sterile Dounce tissue grinder using a sterile non-ionic surfactant-based buffer to isolate cell nuclei (‘homogenization buffer’: 250 mM Sucrose, 25 mM KCL, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 3 μM DAPI, Nuclease Free Water). Homogenate was filtered in a 40-μm cell strainer and centrifuged 800g 8 min 4°C. To clean-up the homogenate, we performed a iodixanol density gradient centrifugation as follow: pellet was gently mixed 1:1 with iodixanol medium at 50% (50% Iodixanol, 250 mM Sucrose, 150 mM KCL, 30 mM MgCl2, 60 mM Tris buffer pH 8.0, Nuclease Free Water) and homogenization buffer. This solution layered to a new tube containing equal volume of iodixanol medium at 29% and centrifuged 13.500g for 20 min at 4°C. Nuclei pellet was gently resuspended in 200 μl of FACS buffer (0.5% BSA, 2mM EDTA) and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation 800g 5 min 4°C, sample was incubated with anti-NeuN (neuronal marker, 1:500, Anti-NeuN-PE, clone A60 Milli-Mark™) for 40 min. After centrifugation 800g 5 min 4°C, sample was washed with 1X Permeabilization buffer (Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set, eBioscience™) and centrifuged 1300g for 5 min, without breaks to improve nuclei recovery. Staining with anti-Pu.1 antibody in 1X Permeabilization buffer (myeloid marker 1:50, Pu.1-AlexaFluor 647, 9G7 Cell Signaling) was performed for 40 min. After a wash with FACS buffer samples were prepared for FACS. Nuclei were FACS-sorted in a BD FACS Aria with a 100-μm nozzle and a sheath pressure 20 psi, operating at ∼1000 events per second. Nuclei were sorted into 1.5 ml certified RNAse, DNAse DNA, ATP and Endotoxins tubes containing 100μl of sterile PBS. For detailes on sorted samples see Supplementary Table S1 . Sorting purity was &gt;95%. Sorting strategy is depicted in Supplementary Fig 1. Of note, the Double-negative gate is restricted to prevent cross-contamination between cell types. Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged 20 min at 6000g and processed immediately for gDNA extraction with QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) following manufacture instructions. DNA from whole-blood samples was extracted with QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen) following manufacture instructions. Flow cytometry data was collected using DiVa 8.0.1 Software. Subsequent analysis was performed with FlowJo_10.6.2. For sorting strategy, see Supplementary Fig 1.</p>

<title>DNA library preparation and sequencing</title>
<p>DNA samples were submitted to the Integrated Genomics Operation (IGO) at MSKCC for quality and quantity analysis, library preparation and sequencing. DNA quality mas measured with Tapestation 2200. All samples had a DNA Integrity Number (DIN) &gt;6. After PicoGreen quantification, ∼200ng of genomic DNA were used for library construction using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Kapa Biosystems KK8504) with 8 cycles of PCR. After sample barcoding, 2.5ng-1µg of each library were pooled and captured by hybridization with baits specific to either the HEME-PACT (Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets related to Hematological Malignancies) assay, designed to capture all protein-coding exons and select introns of 576 (2.88Mb) commonly implicated oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">6</xref></sup> and/or HEME/BRAIN-PACT (716 genes, 3.44 Mb, Supplementary Table S2) an expanded panel that included additional custom targets related to neurological diseases including, Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and others (tableS1) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc15">15</xref></sup>. To simplify, in the manuscript the combined panel is referred to as ‘BRAIN-PACT’. In Supplementary Table S3, ‘Heme-only’ or ‘Brain-only’ is indicated in the cases for which only one or the other panels were used. Capture pools were sequenced on the HiSeq 4000, using the HiSeq 3000/4000 SBS Kit (Illumina) for PE100 reads. Samples were sequenced to a mean depth of coverage of 1106x (Control samples: 1071x, AD samples 1100x).

<title>Mutation data analysis</title>
<p>The data processing pipeline for detecting variants in Illumina HiSeq data is as follows. First the FASTQ files are processed to remove any adapter sequences at the end of the reads using cutadapt (v1.6). The files are then mapped using the BWA mapper (bwa mem v0.7.12). After mapping the SAM files are sorted and read group tags are added using the PICARD tools. After sorting in coordinate order the BAM’s are processed with PICARD MarkDuplicates. The marked BAM files are then processed using the GATK toolkit (v 3.2) according to best practices for tumor normal pairs. They are first realigned using ABRA (v 0.92) and then the base quality values are recalibrated with the BaseQRecalibrator. Somatic variants are then called in the processed BAMs using MuTect (v1.1.7) for SNV and ShearwaterML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc18">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>muTect (v1.1.7)</title>
<p>to identify somatic variants and eliminate germline variants, we run the pipeline as follow: PU.1, DN and Blood samples against matching-NeuN samples, and NeuN samples against matching-PU.1. In addition, we ran all samples against a Frozen-Pool of 10 random genomes. We selected Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) [Missense, Nonsense, Splice Site, Splice Regions] that were supported by at least 4 or more mutant reads and with coverage of 50x or more. Fill-out file for each project (∼27 samples per sequencing pool), were used to exclude by manual curation, variants with high background noise. This resulted in 428 variants (Missense, Nonsense, Splice_site, Splice_Region).</p>

<sec id="s6f">
<title>ShearwaterML</title>
<p>was used to look for low allelic frequency somatic mutations as it has been shown to efficiently call variants present in a small fraction of cells with true positives being ∼90%. Briefly, the basis of this algorithm is that is uses a collection of deep-sequenced samples to learn for each site a base-specific error model, by fitting a beta-binomial distribution to each site combining the error rates across all normal samples both the mean error rate at the site and the variation across samples, and comparing the observed variant rate in the sample of interest against this background model using a likelihood-ratio test. For detailed description of this algorithm please refer to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc17">17</xref></sup>. In our data set, for each cell type (NeuN, DN, PU.1) we used as “normal” a combination of the other cell types, i.e PU.1 vs NeuN+DN, DN vs NeuN+PU.1, NEUN vs PU.1+DN, Blood vs NeuN+DN. Since all samples were processed and sequenced using the same protocol, we expect the background error to be even across samples. More than 400 samples were used as background leading to an average background coverage &gt;400.000x. Resulting variants for each cell type were filtered out as germline if they were present in more than 20% of all reads across samples. Additionally, variants with coverage of less than 50x and more than 35% variant allelic frequency (VAF) were removed from downstream analysis. P-values were corrected for multiple testing using Benjamini &amp; Hochberg’s False Discovery Rate (FDR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc19">19</xref></sup> and a q-value of cutoff of 0.01 was used to call somatic variants. Variants were required to have a least one supporting read in each strand. Somatic variants within 10bp of an indel were filtered out as they typically reflect mapping errors. We selected Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) [Intronic, Intergenic, Missense, Nonsense, Splice Site, Splice Regions] that were supported by at least 4 or more mutant reads and annotated them using VEP. Finally, to reduce the risk of SNP contamination, we excluded variants with a MAF (minor allelic frequency) cutoff of 0.01 using the gnomeAD database. This resulted in 509 SNVs.</p>
<p>We compared the final mutant calls from Muetct1 and ShearwaterML and found that 30% of the events (111 variants) that were called by MuTect1 were also called by ShearwaterML. Overall a total of 826 variants (Supplementary Table S3) were found, with a mean coverage at the mutant site of 668.3X (10% percentile: 276X, 90% percentile: 1181X) and a mean of 29.1 mutant reads (10% percentile: 4, 90% percentile: 52), with 84% of mutated supported by at least 5 mutant reads (Supplementary Table S3). The median allelic frequency was ∼1.34% (Supplementary Table S3). Negative results for matching brain negative samples were confirmed in 100% of samples at a mean depth of ∼5000x (range 648-23.000x) (Supplementary Table S3), confirming nuclei sorting purity of &gt;95% for PU.1<sup>+</sup>, DN, and NEUN<sup>+</sup> populations.</p>

<title>Validation of variants by droplet-digital-PCR (ddPCR)</title>
<p>We performed validation of ∼11% of unique variants (69/760) by droplet-digital PCR (ddPCR) on pre-amplified DNA or on libraries (in the cases where DNA was not sufficient). Around 15% (15/69) of the variants analyzed by ddPCR were called by ShearwaterML, ∼44% (34/69) were called by Mutect1 and 40% (24/69) by both ShearwaterML+ Mutect1. Altogether we confirmed 62/69 of variants tested (∼90%). In addition, 61 assays (from variants detected in PU.1+ nuclei) were tested in paired cell types isolated from the same brain region). Assays were also run in matching blood when available. The mean depth of ddPCR was ∼5000x and mutant counts of 3 or more were considered positive. VAF obtained by ddPCR correlated with original VAF by sequencing (R2 0.93, p&lt;0.0001). For <bold>KRAS_G12D:</bold> Bio-Rad validated assay (Unique Assay ID: dHsaMDV2510596) and <bold>MTOR_Arg1616His_c.4847G&gt;A:</bold> Bio-Rad validated assay (Unique Assay ID: dHsaMDV2510596) were used. The remaining assays were designed and ordered through Bio-Rad. For setting-up the right conditions for newly designed assays, cycling conditions were tested to ensure optimal annealing/extension temperature as well as optimal separation of positive from empty droplets. All reactions were performed on a QX200 ddPCR system (Bio-Rad catalog # 1864001). When possible, each sample was evaluated in technical duplicates or quartets. Reactions contained 10ng gDNA, primers and probes, and digital PCR Supermix for probes (no dUTP). Reactions were partitioned into a median of ∼31,000 droplets per well using the QX200 droplet generator. Emulsified PCRs were run on a 96-well thermal cycler using cycling conditions identified during the optimization step (95°C 10’; 40-50 cycles of 94°C 30’ and 52-56°C 1’; 98°C 10’; 4°C hold). Plates were read and analyzed with the QuantaSoft sotware to assess the number of droplets positive for mutant DNA, wild-type DNA, both, or neither. ddPCR results are listed in Supplementary Table S3.</p>

<title>Classification of variants</title>
<p>To classify somatic variants according to their pathogenicity we did as follow: Variants were classified as ‘pathogenic (P-SNV)’ if reported as ‘pathogenic/likely pathogenic’ by ClinVar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc20">20</xref></sup> and/or ‘oncogenic/predicted oncogenic/likely oncogenic’ by OncoKb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc21">21</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table S3). These two databases report pathogenicity in cancer and other diseases, based on supporting evidence from curated literature (see corresponding citations in Supplementary Table S3). We considered classical-MAPK-pathway genes those reported to be mutated in RASopathies: <italic>BRAF, CBL, KRAS, MAP2K1, NF1, PTPN11, SOS1, RIT1, SHOC2, NRAS, RAF1, RASA1, HRAS, MAP2K2,SPRED1</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc23">23</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table S3).</p>

<title>Quantification of mutational load and statistics</title>
<p>We defined mutational load or mutational burden as the number of synonymous and non-synonymous somatic single-nucleotide-variant (SNV) per megabase of genome examined <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc24">24</xref></sup>. Overall, a total of 826 single-nucleotide-variants (SNV) were detected resulting in 0.3 mutations/Mb sequenced. As detailed in the manuscript, the mutational load varies considerably across cell types and patients. To quantify mutational load we took into consideration the panel used for sequencing each sample: HEME-PACT (2.88 Mb) or the extended panel BRAIN-PACT (3.44 Mb) (see Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, the number of mutations was normalized by the number of Mb sequenced for that specific sample. In the cases where we calculated mutational load per patient, we averaged the mutational load of each sample from that patient for a given cell type [(i.e if for one patient, 2 PU.1 samples were sequenced, one from hippocampus and one from superior parietal cortex (with BRAIN-PACT) then the mutational load for PU.1 for that patient is the mean of the mutational load of the 2 PU.1 samples analyzed). For the quantification of ‘pathogenic’ variants, the same analysis is performed, quantifying only variants that are reported as pathogenic by ClinVar and/or OncoKb. Statistical significance was analyzed with GraphPad Prism (v9) and R (3.6.3). Non-parametric tests were used when data did not follow a normal distribution (Normality test: D’Agostino-Pearson and Shapiro-Wilk test). For normally distributed data, unpaired t-test was used to compare two groups and one-way, nested one-way or two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used for comparing more than two groups, as indicated in the Figure legends. For data that did not have a normal distribution, the tests performed were unpaired two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal–Wallis test and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons. Pearson and Spearman were used for correlation analysis. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>, we used multivariate logistic regression analysis to test if there was an association between Alzheimer’s disease and the presence of pathogenic variants in PU.1<sup>+</sup> nuclei. We used Alzheimer’s disease as a dependent variable, and age, sex, and the presence of pathogenic variant/s (Yes/No) as co-variates. In all the statistical tests, significance was considered at P &lt; 0.05. For Venn Diagram plots, we used <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc25">25</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Mixed-effects modelling of somatic P-SNV burden</title>
<p>To evaluate the correlation between P-SNV burden and disease status (non-dementia controls and AD) after adjusting for other factors such as individual donor and age, we performed linear mixed-effects regression modeling using the nlme package in R. In the subsequent analysis, we also tested another framework implemented in the lme4 package and confirmed similar findings. We estimated the linear mixed model via maximum likelihood method with nlminb optimizer. The model included individual donor as a random effect. We also tested if inclusion of other co-variates (i.e., sex, anatomical location of the brain, and source biobank of brain samples) as random effects inproved the overall model fitting via likelihood ratio test. However, none of these co-variates improved the model fitting (P&gt;0.99). Thus, we used a relatively simple model that incorporated disease status and age as fixed effects and donor as random effect. The total explanatory power of the final model is substantial (conditional R^2=0.48). To assess the significance of age or disease status in predicting P-SNV burden, we constructed another model that does not incorporate the variable as fixed effect, and compared the two models via likelihood ratio test. The variable was considered significantly associated with P-SNV burden when the P value was below 0.05 and the AIC increased after removing the variable.</p>

<p>Seurat v4.0.3 with default parameters was used to perform sctransform (SCT) normalization, integration and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction. The FindClusters function was used for cell clustering. To improve clustering, all samples were analyzed in an integrated analysis, based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Cell types were annotated using the top 500 DEGs of each cell type in a human cortex database. Data can be accessed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://weillcornellmed.shinyapps.io/Human_brain/">https://weillcornellmed.shinyapps.io/Human_brain/</ext-link>. The removal of doublets using DoubletFinder and cells with high mitochondrial content (&gt;10% mitochondrial RNA) yielded between 6,437 and 9,241 nuclei per patient and sample. Microglia represented 94 ± 3% of total cells. Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMIs) per nucleus and gene count per nucleus were comparable between donors. Integrated_snn at resolution 0.2 outlined 16 microglia clusters. Except for cluster 13 consisting at 97% of cells from the healthy control Control 11_AG, all donors and samples were represented in every cluster. One cluster contained few cells (0.84% of total microglia, for an average of 6.20 ± 1.60% for other clusters) and was marked by a low number of cluster-enriched genes and was excluded from further analyses. For pathway enrichment analysis, genes were pre-ranked using differential expression analysis in SCANPY <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc37">37</xref></sup> with Wilcoxon rank-sum method. Statistical analysis were performed using the fgseaMultilevel function in fgsea R package <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc38">38</xref></sup> for HALLMARK and KEGG pathways. Gene sets with p-value &lt; 0.05 and adjusted p-value &lt; 0.25 were selected and visualized using ggpubr and ggplot2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc39">39</xref></sup> R package. For the variant analysis of AD52_HIP harboring a KRAS<sup>A59G</sup> (c.176C&gt;G) clone, Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) software was used to display sequencing reads at KRAS c.176C (exon 3; GRCh38 chr12:25,227,348). Cells within each cluster were identified based on the 16-digit barcodes from SEQC-aligned reads. Barcodes were converted to the 10X Genomics format and used to sample reads from each cluster within the original BAM file. BAM subsets for each cluster were read with IGV and reads with identical UMIs were filtered out to account for amplification bias.</p>

<title>Whole-Exome-Sequencing and analysis</title>
<p>Remaining libraries from a selected group of PU.1 and NEUN samples sequenced with BRAIN-PACT (see above) were sequenced by Whole-Exome-Sequencing (WES). Matching NEUN samples were sequenced to extract the germline variants. Around 100 ng of library were captured by hybridization using the xGen Exome Research Panel v2.0 (IDT) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR amplification of the post-capture libraries was carried out for 12 cycles. Samples were run on a NovaSeq 6000 in a PE100 run, using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit (200 Cycles) (Illumina). Samples were covered to an average of 419X. The data processing pipeline for detecting variants in Novaseq data is as follows. First the FASTQ files are processed to remove any adapter sequences at the end of the reads using cutadapt (v1.6). The files are then mapped using the BWA mapper (bwa mem v0.7.12 ). After mapping the SAM files are sorted and read group tags are added using the PICARD tools. After sorting in coordinate order the BAM’s are processed with PICARD MarkDuplicates. The marked BAM files are then processed using the GATK toolkit (v 3.2) according to the best practices for tumor normal pairs. They are first realigned using ABRA (v 0.92) and then the base quality values are recalibrated with the BaseQRecalibrator. Somatic variants are then called in the processed BAMs using muTect (v1.1.7) for SNV and the Haplotype caller from GATK with a custom post-processing script to call somatic indels. The full pipeline is available here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/soccin/BIC-variants_pipeline">https://github.com/soccin/BIC-variants_pipeline</ext-link> and the post processing code is at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/soccin/Variant-PostProcess">https://github.com/soccin/Variant-PostProcess</ext-link>. We selected Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) [Missense, Nonsense, Splice Site, Splice Regions] that were supported by at least 8 or more mutant reads, variant allelic frequency above 5% and with coverage of 50x. Annotation was performed using VEP. Finally, to reduce the risk of SNP contamination, we excluded variants with a MAF (minor allelic frequency) cutoff of 0.01 using the genomeAD database. Variants were classified as ‘candidate pathogenic’ when SNV is predicted to affect the protein as determined by PolyPhen-2 (possibly and probably damaging) and SIFT (deleterious) and CADD-MSC (high) and FATHMM-XF (Functional Analysis through Hidden Markov Models (pathogenic) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc40">40</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table S5).</p>

<title>Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) culture</title>
<p>Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (hiPSC) lines were derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of a healthy donor. Written informed consent was obtained according to the Helsinki convention. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of St Thomas’ Hospital; Guy’s hospital; the King’s College London University; the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and by the Tri-institutional (MSKCC, Weill-Cornell, Rockefeller University) Embryonic Stem Cell Research Oversight (ESCRO) Committee. hiPSC were derived using Sendai viral vectors (ThermoFisher Scientific; A16517). Newly derived hiPSC clones were maintained in culture for 10 passages (2-3 months) to remove any traces of Sendai viral particles. Over 90% of hiPSCs in the derived lines expressed high levels of the pluripotency markers NANOG and OCT4 by flow cytometry. The C12 hiPSC WT line was engineered to carry a CBL p.C404Y, c.1211G&gt;A heterozygous variant at the endogenous CBL locus. HiPSCs of passage 25-35 were cultured on confluent irradiated CF1 mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs, Gibco) in hiPSC medium consisting of knock-out DMEM (Invitrogen), 10% knock-out-Serum Replacement (Invitrogen), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol (R&amp;D). hiPSC medium was supplement with 10 ng/mL bFGF (PeproTech) and changed every second day.

In view of RNA sequencing, phase separation in cells lysed in 1 mL TRIzol Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) was induced with 200 µL chloroform and RNA was extracted from the aqueous phase using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) on the QIAcube Connect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with 350 µL input, or using the MagMAX mirVana Total RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) on the KingFisher Flex Magnetic Particle Processor (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with 350 µL input. Samples were eluted in 30 µL RNase-free water. After RiboGreen quantification and quality control by Agilent BioAnalyzer, 231-500 ng of total RNA with RIN values of 9.4-10 underwent polyA selection and TruSeq library preparation according to instructions provided by Illumina (TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Kit, Illumina), with 8 cycles of PCR. Samples were barcoded and run on a NovaSeq 6000 in a PE100 run, using the NovaSeq 6000 S4 Reagent Kit (200 Cycles) (Illumina). An average of 90 million paired reads was generated per sample. Ribosomal reads represented 0-1.6% of the total reads generated and the percent of mRNA bases averaged 79%.</p>

<title>Bulk RNAseq analysis</title>
<p>FastQ files of 2x100bp paired-end reads were quality checked using FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/</ext-link> , 2012). Samples with high quality reads (Phred score &gt;= 30) were aligned to the Mus musculus genome (GRCm38.80) for the MAC lines or Homo sapiens (assembly GRCh38.p14) for the IPSCs lines using STAR aligner. For the MAC lines, we computed the expression count matrix from the mapped reads using HTSeq (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq">www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq</ext-link>) and one of several possible gene model databases. The raw count matrix generated by HTSeq are then be processed using the R/Bioconductor package DESeq (www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/DESeq) which is used to both normalize the full dataset and analyze differential expression between sample groups. For the ISPCs line dataset, gene quantification was performed using feature counts from the Subread package in R. Gene expression levels were normalized and log2 transformed using the Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method and differential expression analysis was performed using the edgeR package in R. For hiPSC derived cells, gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Hallmark, KEGG, GO, REACTOME) were performed using the fgsea package in R on a pre-ranked list (formula: sign(ogFC) * -log10(PValue)) on all expressed genes in the dataset. For the MAC cell lines dataset, GSEA was performed using gsea4.3.2 for KEGG and HALLMARK canonical pathways in MSigDB v 7.5.1. Significant genesets were selected based on an FDR &lt;= 0.25. For lists of differentially expressed genes, genes were selected with controlled False Positive Rate (B&amp;H method) at 5% (FDR &lt;= 0.05). Genes were considered upregulated/downregulated for log2 fold change&gt; 1.5 or &lt;-1.5.</p>

<p>In the revised manuscript Vicario et al. provide new insights on a potential contribution of somatic mutations within the microglia population of the CNS that accelerates microglia activation and disease-associated gene signatures in Alzheimer's disease. Here they especially identified an &quot;enrichment&quot; of pathological SNVs in microglia, but not the peripheral blood, that are associated with clonal proliferative disorders and neurological diseases in a subset of patients with AD. They identified P-SNVs in microglia of AD patients located within the ring domain of CBL, a negative regulator of MAPK signaling. They further provide mechanistic insights how these variants result in MAPK over-activation and subsequently in a pro-inflammatory phenotype in human microglia-like cells in vitro.</p>
<p>Overall, this study provides novel evidence from an AD patient cohort pointing to a potential contribution of microglia-specific somatic mutations to disease onset and/or progression in at least a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The work within this study is highly relevant and will open new study lines to explore somatic mutations within the microglia compartment and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As outlined above, the study identified P-SNVs in microglia of AD patients associated with clonal proliferative disorders, but also give an in depth analysis in re-occurring P-SNVs located within the ring domain of CBL, a negative regulator of MAPK signaling. They further provide mechanistic insights how these variants result in MAPK over-activation and subsequently in a pro-inflammatory phenotype in HEK cells, BV2 cells, MAC cells and human microglia-like cells in vitro. The over-activation of the cells in vitro is convincing.</p>
<p>Great care was taken to identify the limitations of the possible conclusions and to make careful conclusions. For example, they highlight that the pathway proposed to be affected may be an explanation for a subset of AD patients, and emphasize that it is yet unclear whether this accumulation of pathological SNVs is a cause or consequence of disease progression</p>
<p>The study supports an enrichment of P-SNVs in several genes associated clonal proliferative disorders in microglia and nicely separates this from SNVs associated with clonal hematopoiesis in the peripheral blood found in AD patients and controls.</p>
<p>The authors further acknowledged that several age matched control patients were diagnosed with cancer or tumor-associated diseases and carefully dissected the occurring SNVs in these patients are not associated with the P-SNVs identified in the microglial compartment of the AD cohort.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The revised study is overall convincing and has improved in the revised version, but some points especially regarding the clear connection of the seen somatic variants in microglia with a potential role in disease progression remain unanswered.</p>
<p>A potential connection between P-SNVs in microglia and disease pathology and symptoms was not further explored by the authors but might be in future work.</p>
<p>Taken this into account, maybe the title is a bit overstated and could be tuned down.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Vicaro et al. aimed to quantify and characterize mosaic mutations in human sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain samples. They focused on three broad classes of brain cells, neurons that express the marker NeuN, microglia that express the marker PU.1, and double-negative cells that presumably comprise all other brain cell types, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, and endothelial cells. The authors find an enrichment of potentially pathogenic somatic mutations in AD microglia compared to controls, with MAPK pathway genes being particularly enriched for somatic mutations in those cells. The authors report a striking enrichment for mutations in the gene CBL and use in vitro functional assays to show that these mutations indeed induce MAPK pathway activation.</p>
<p>The current state of the AD and somatic mutation fields puts this work into context. First, AD is a devastating disease whose prevalence is only increasing as the population of the U.S. is aging, necessitating the investigation of novel features of AD to identify new therapeutic opportunities. Second, microglia have recently come into focus as important players in AD pathogenesis. Many AD risk genes are selectively expressed in microglia, and microglia from AD brain samples show a distinct transcriptional profile indicating an inflammatory phenotype. The authors' previous work shows that a genetic mouse model of mosaic BRAF activation in macrophages (including microglia) displays a neurodegenerative phenotype similar to AD (Mass et al., 2017, doi:10.1038/nature23672). Third, new technological developments have allowed for identifying mosaic mutations present in only a small fraction of or even single cells. Together, these data form a rationale for studying mosaic mutations in microglia in AD. In light of the authors' findings regarding MAPK pathway gene somatic mutations, it is also important to note that MAPK has previously been implicated in AD neuroinflammation in the literature.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study demonstrated several strengths. Firstly, the authors used two methods to identify mosaic mutations: 1) deep (~1,100x) DNA sequencing of a targeted panel of &gt;700 genes they hypothesized might, if mutated somatically, play a role in AD, and 2) deep (400x) whole-exome sequencing (WES) to identify clonal mosaics outside of those genes. A second strength is the agreement between these experiments, where WES found many variants identified in the panel experiment, and both experiments revealed somatic mutations in MAPK pathway genes. Third, the authors demonstrated in several in vitro systems that many mutations they identified in MAPK genes activate MAPK signaling. Finally, the authors showed that in some human brain samples, single-cell gene expression analysis revealed that cells bearing a mosaic MAPK pathway mutation displayed dysregulated inflammatory signaling and dysregulation in other pathways. This single-cell analysis was in agreement with their in vitro analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study also showed some weaknesses. The sample size (45 AD donors and 44 controls) is small, reflected in the relatively modest effect sizes and p-values observed. This weakness is partially ameliorated by the authors' extensive molecular and functional validation of mutation candidates. Secondly, as the authors point out, this study cannot conclude whether microglial mosaic mutations cause AD or are an effect of AD. Future studies may shed more light on this important question.</p>
<p>Conclusions and Impact:</p>
<p>Considering the study's aims, strengths, and weaknesses, I conclude that the authors achieved their goal of characterizing the role of mosaic mutations in human AD. Their data strongly suggest that mosaic MAPK mutations in microglia are associated with AD. The impacts of this study remain to be seen, but they could include attempts to target CBL or other mutated genes in the treatment of AD. This work also suggests a similar approach to identifying potentially causative somatic mutations in other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We edited the manuscript for clarity, added information described in new figure panels (below) and corrected typos.</p>
<p>In figure 1 we corrected a typo.</p>
<p>In figure 2, panel 2H, and Figure S2E, we included a new statistical analysis (mixed effect linear regression) to compare mutational burden in controls and AD patients.</p>
<p>In figure 3, and Figure S4B, we revised the western blots panels in Panel 3E,F, to improve presentation of controls and quantification.</p>
<p>we corrected typos.</p>
<p>In figure 5 we removed a panel (former 5D) which did not add useful information.</p>
<p>In Figure S1A we included information about sex and age from the control and patients analyzed. In Figure S2B, we added an analysis of the mutational burden in controls, distinguishing controls with and without cancer.</p>
<p>We modified Table S1 for completeness of information for all samples analyzed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Even though the study is overall very convincing, several points could help to connect the seen somatic variants in microglia more with a potential role in disease progression. The connection of P-SNVs in the genes chosen from neurological disorders was not further highlighted by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All P-SNVs are reported in Table S3.</p>
<p>We observed only two P-SNVs within genes associated to neurological disorders (brain panel in Table S2). - SQSTM1 (p.P392L) was identified in blood but not in brain from the patient AD48A.</p>
<p>- OPTN was identified (p.Q467P) in PU.1 from control 25.</p>
<p>To highlight this point, we modified the first paragraph of the discussion as follow:</p>
<p>“We report here that microglia from a cohort of 45 AD patients with intermediate-onset sporadic AD (mean age 65 y.o) is enriched for clones carrying pathogenic/oncogenic variants in genes associated with clonal proliferative disorders (Supplementary Table 2) in comparison to 44 controls. Of note we did not observe microglia P-SNVs within genes reported to be associated with neurological disorders (Supplementary Table 2) in patients, and one such variant was identified in a control (Supplementary Table 3) “.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors show in snRNA-seq data that a disease-associated microglia state seems to be enriched in patients with somatic variants in the CBL ring domain, however, this analysis could be deepened. For example, how this knowledge may translate to patient benefits when the relevant cell populations appear concentrated in a single patient sample (Figure 5; AD52) is unclear; increasing the analyzed patient pool for Figure 5 and showcasing the presence of this microglia state of interest in a few more patients with driving mutations for CBL or other MAPK pathway associated mutations would lend their hypotheses further credibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge this limitation, but we respectfully submit that the analysis was performed in 2 patients. AD 53 also show a MAPK-associated inflammatory signature in the microglia clusters associated with mutations.</p>
<p>We performed the analysis on all FACS-purified PU.1+ nuclei samples that passed QC for single nuclei RNAseq. It should be noted that this analysis is extremely difficult with current technologies because microglia nuclei need to be fixed for PU.1 staining and FACS purification and the clones are small (~1% of microglia).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A potential connection between P-SNVs in microglia and disease pathology and symptoms was not further explored by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>At the population level, Braak/CERAD scores, the presence of Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, tauopathy, or alpha synucleinopathy were not different between AD patients with or without pathogenic microglial clones (Figure S3 and Table S1). Of note, we studied here a homogenous population of AD patients.</p>
<p>At the tissue level, the roles of mutant microglia in plaques for example is being investigated, but we do not have results to present at this time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A recent preprint (Huang et al., 2024) connected the occurrence of somatic variants in genes associated with clonal hematopoiesis in microglia in a large cohort of AD patients, this study is not further discussed or compared to the data in this manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This pre-print supports the high frequency of detection of oncogenic variants associated with clonal proliferative disorders, they hypothesize that the mutations may be associated with microglia, but they only check a few mutations in purified microglia. Most of the study is performed in whole brain tissue. It does not really bring new information as compared to other study we cite in the introduction (and to our manuscript).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Suggestions for improved or additional experiments, data, or analyses:</p>
<p>The authors can demonstrate that identified pathological SNVs from their AD cohort also lead to the activation of human microglia-like cells in vitro, but do not provide any data from histological examination of the patient cohort (e.g. accumulation at the plaque site, microglia distribution, and cell number). The study could be further supported by providing a histological examination of patients with and without P-SNVs to identify if microglia response to pathology, microglia accumulation, or phagocytic capacity are altered in these patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed IBA1 staining in brain samples from control and from AD patients, with or without microglial clones and microglia density was not different between patient with and without mutations. In addition, histological reports from the brain bank (Braak/CERAD scores, Lewis bodies, amyloid angiopathy, tauopathy, or alpha synucleinopathy did not suggest differences between patient with and without mutations (Figure S3). These results are preliminary and further investigations are ongoing.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It would have been interesting to see if for example, transgenic AD mice with an introduced somatic mutation in microglia show an altered disease progression with alterations in amyloid pathology or cognition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer. We performed an in vivo study with mice expressing a  5xFAD transgene, an inducible microglia Cx3cr1CreERt2 BrafLSL-V600E transgene, or both, and performed survival, behavioral (Y-Maze and Novel Object Recognition), and histological analyses for β-Amyloid, p-Tau and Iba1 staining.</p>
<p>Microgliosis was increased in the group with the 2 transgenes, however the phenotype associated with the expression of a BrafV600E allele in microglia (Mass et al Nature 2017) was strongly dominant over the phenotype of 5xFAD mice, which did not allow us to conclude on survival and behavioral analyses.</p>
<p>Other studies with different transgenes are in progress but we have no results yet to include in this revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To connect the somatic mutations in microglia better to a potential contribution in neurodegeneration or neurotoxicity, the authors could provide further details on how to demonstrate if human microglia-like cells respond differentially to amyloid or induce neurotoxicity in a co-culture or slice culture model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These studies are undertaken in the laboratory, but unfortunately, we have no results as yet to include in this revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The number of samples analyzed for hippocampi, especially in the age-matched controls might be underpowered.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we were not able to analyze more hippocampus from control individuals. To control for bias in sampling as well as to other potential bias in our analysis, we investigated the statistical analysis of the cohorts for inclusion of age as a criterion (age matched controls), inclusion of a random effect structure, and possible confounding factor such as sex, brain bank site, and samples’ anatomical location (see revised Methods and revised Fig. 2C, F, and H, and S2B).</p>
<p>We first tested whether the inclusion of age is appropriate in a fixed-effects linear regression using a generalized linear model (GLM) with gaussian distribution. Compared to the baseline model, the model with age had significantly low AIC (from -66.6 to -71.9, P = 0.0067 by chi-square test). Therefore, the inclusion of age as a fixed effect is appropriate. We next tested multiple structures of mixed-effects linear modeling. We used donors as random effects, while utilizing age, disease status (neurotypical control vs. AD), or both as fixed effects. Fitting was performed using the lme function implemented in the nlme package with the maximum likelihood (ML) method. The incorporation of age and disease status significantly improved overall model fitting. Both age and AD are associated with a significant increase in SNV burden in this model (P&lt;1x10^-4 and P=1x10^-4, respectively, by likelihood ratio test). The model's total explanatory power is substantial (conditional R^2=0.48). We also asked if the addition of potential confounding factors to the model is justified. Three factors were tested via the two above-mentioned methods: sex, brain bank site, and the anatomical location of the samples. In all cases, the AIC increased, and the P values by likelihood ratio tests were higher than 0.99. Therefore, from a statistical standpoint, the inclusion of these potential confounding factors does not seem to improve overall model fitting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor corrections to the text and figures:</p>
<p>The authors made a great effort to analyze various samples from one individual donor. One can get a bit confused by the sentence that &quot;an average of 2.5 brains samples were analyzed for each donor&quot;. Maybe the authors could highlight more in the first paragraph of the results section and in Figure 1A, that there are multiple samples (&quot;technical replicates&quot;) from one individual patient across different brain regions used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed the ‘2.5’ sentence and rewrote the paragraph for clarity. Samples information’s are now displayed in Table S1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the method section is a part included &quot;Expression of target genes in microglia&quot;, it was very hard to allocate where these data from public data sets were actually used and for which analysis. Maybe the authors could clarify this again.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>AU response: we apologize and corrected the paragraph in the methods (page 6) as follow: “ Expression of target genes in microglia. To evaluate the expression levels of the genes identified in this study as target of somatic variants, we consulted a publicly available database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/">https://www.proteinatlas.org/</ext-link>), and also plotted their expression as determined by RNAseq in 2 studies (Galatro et al. GSE99074 33, and Gosselin et al. 34) (Table S3 and Figure S2). For data from Galatro et al. (GSE99074) 33, normalized gene expression data and associated clinical information of isolated human microglia (N = 39) and whole brain (N = 16) from healthy controls were downloaded from GEO. For data from Gosselin et al. 34, raw gene expression ­data and associated clinical information of isolated microglia (N = 3) and whole brain (N = 1) from healthy controls were extracted from the original dataset. Raw counts were normalized using the DESeq2 package in R 35.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Table S3 is very informative, but also very complex. The reader could maybe benefit a lot from this table if it can be structured a bit easier especially when it comes to identifying P-SNVs and in which tissue sample they were found and if this was the same patient. The sorting function on top of the columns helps, but the color coding is a bit unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite our best efforts we agree that the table, which contain all sequencing data for all samples, is complex. The color coding (red) only highlights the presence of pathogenic mutation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This is a well-done study of an important problem. I present the following minor critiques:</p>
<p>At the bottom of Page 4 and into the top of Page 5, the authors state that 66 of the 826 variants identified in their panel sequencing experiment were found in multiple donors. Then the authors proceed to analyze the remaining 760 variants. It seems that the authors concluded that these multi-donor mosaics were artifacts, which is why they were excluded from further analysis. I think this is a reasonable assumption, but it should be stated explicitly so it is clear to the reader. Complicating this assumption, however, the authors later state that one of their CBL variants was found in two donors, and it is treated as a true mosaic. The authors should make it clear whether recurrent variants were filtered out of any given analysis. It remains possible that all recurrent variants are true mosaics that occurred in multiple donors. The authors should do a bit more to characterize these recurrent variants. Are they observed in the human population using a database like gnomAD, which, together with their recurrence, would strongly suggest they are germline variants? Are they in MAPK genes, or otherwise relevant to the study?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion. Our original intent for the ddPCR validation of variants (Figure 1E) was to count only 1 ‘unique’ variant for variants found for example in 1 brain sample and in the blood from the same patient, or in 2 brain regions from one patient, in order to avoid the criticism of overinflating our validation rate. This was notably the case for TET2 and DNMT3 variants. For example, validation of a TET2 variant found in 2 different brain areas and blood of the same donor is counted as 1 and not 3. We did not eliminate these variants from the analysis as they passed the criteria for somatic variants as presented in Methods.</p>
<p>In contrast, when a specific variant was found and validated in two different donors, we counted it as 2.</p>
<p>The characterization of variants included multiple parameters and databases, including for example AF and gnomAD, as indicated in Methods and reported in Table S3.</p>
<p>All ddPCR results can be found at the end of Table S3.</p>

<p>Figure 2B labels age-matched controls as &quot;C&quot;, but Figure 2C labels age-matched controls as AM-C. Labels should be consistent throughout the manuscript.</p>

<p>We corrected this in the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear if the &quot;p:0.02&quot; label in Figure 2F is referring to AM-C Cx vs. AD-Cx or AM-C vs. AD. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion, and we corrected the legend. The calculated p value is for the comparison between Cortex from Controls (age-matched) and the Cortex from AD.</p>

<p>On Page 7, the authors state, &quot;The allelic frequencies at which MAPK activating variants are detected in brain samples from AD patients range from ~1-6% of microglia (Fig. 3G), which correspond to clones representing 2 to 12% of mutant microglia in these samples, assuming heterozygosity.&quot; I understand what the authors mean here but I think it's a bit confusingly stated. I suggest something like &quot;The allelic frequencies at which MAPK activating variants are detected in brain samples from AD patients range from ~1-6% in microglia (Figure 3G), which correspond to mutant clones representing 2 to 12% of all microglia in these samples, assuming heterozygosity.&quot;</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and re-wrote that sentence.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that the transcriptional regulators mutated in AD microglia (MED12, SETD2, MLL3, DNMT3A, ASXL1, etc.) are involved in regulating MAPK genes? This would tie these mutations into the broader conclusions of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very interesting question, and indeed published studies indicate that some of the transcriptional /epigenetic regulators regulate expression of MAPK genes. However, in the absence of experimental evidence in microglia and patients, the argument may be too speculative to be included.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do the authors have any thoughts as to whether germline variants in CBL are linked to AD? If not, why do they think germline mutations in CBL are not relevant to AD?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is also a very interesting question. As indicated in our manuscript, germline mutations in CBL (and other member of the classical MAPK genes, see Figure 3C) cause early onset (pediatric) and severe developmental diseases known as RASopathies, characterized by multiple developmental defects, and associated with frequent neurological and cognitive deficits.</p>
<p>It is possible that some other (and more frequent?) germline variants may be associated with a late-onset brain restricted phenotype, but we did not find germline pSNV in our patients. GWAS studies may be more appropriate to test this hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Do any donors show multiple variants? I don't think this is addressed in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do find donors with multiple variants (see Figure 3D and Figure S3), however at this stage, we did not perform single nuclei genotyping to investigate whether they are part of the same clone.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure S3 appears to be upside down.</p>

<p>Figure 5C should have some kind of label telling the reader what gene set is being depicted.</p>

<p>We added this information above the panel (it was in the corresponding legend).</p>

<p>Many control donors died of cancer (Table S1). Is there any information on which, if any, chemotherapeutics or radiation these patients received? Might this impact the somatic mutation burden? The authors should compare controls with and without cancer or with and without cancer treatments to rule this out.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested by the reviewer, we analyzed the mutational load of age-matched controls with and without cancer (revised Figure S2B). As expected, we saw an increase in the mutational load in controls with cancer, particularly in their blood. This information was added in the result section.</p>
<p>This is most likely associated with the treatments received as well as possible cancer clones.</p>

<p>The formatting for Table S3 is odd. Multiple different fonts are used (this is also seen in Table S5). Column Q has no column ID. The word &quot;panel&quot; is spelled &quot;pannel.&quot; The word &quot;expressed&quot; is spelled &quot;expressd&quot; in one of the worksheet labels. Columns BG-BN in the ALL-SNV worksheet are blank but seemingly part of the table.</p>

<p>We fixed this error in Table S3.</p>
