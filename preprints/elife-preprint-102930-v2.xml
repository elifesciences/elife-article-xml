<title>Abstract</title><p>The insulator protein CTCF is essential for mediating chromatin loops and regulating gene expression. While it is established that DNA methylation hinders CTCF binding, the impacts of this methylation-sensitive CTCF binding on chromatin architecture and transcription are poorly defined. Here, we used a selective DNMT1 inhibitor (DNMT1i) to investigate the characteristics and functions of ‘DNMT1i-specific’ CTCF peaks resulting from global DNA demethylation. We found that DNMT1i-specific peaks preferentially form chromatin loops on gene bodies and interact with highly-looping partner peaks located in regions of active chromatin. Notably, both DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are enriched near nuclear speckles, condensate bodies implicated in transcription and splicing. Utilizing targeted protein degradation, we specifically depleted CTCF and nuclear speckles to elucidate their functional interplay. By degrading CTCF upon DNMT1 inhibition, we revealed that CTCF is important for DNMT1i-dependent interactions between chromatin and speckle proteins. Moreover, we found that CTCF promotes the activation of genes near speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition. Conversely, acute depletion of nuclear speckles revealed that they influence RNA abundance but do not maintain CTCF binding or looping. Collectively, our study suggests a model wherein DNA methylation prevents spurious CTCF occupancy and interactions with regulatory elements near nuclear speckles, yet CTCF looping is robust towards the loss of speckles.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mammalian genome is organized at multiple length scales into compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs) and chromatin loops<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. This three-dimensional chromatin folding contributes to essential cellular processes such as transcription and DNA replication and is actively maintained by protein cofactors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The architectural protein CTCF establishes the anchors of many DNA loops and TADs likely by blocking loop extrusion by cohesin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Consequently, perturbation of CTCF binding sites at domain boundaries can lead to aberrant cross-domain enhancer-promoter contacts, which have been linked to gene misexpression in cancer and developmental disorders <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, CTCF binding and looping on or near genes can directly enforce enhancer-promoter loops and facilitate differential splicing and polyadenylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although these examples demonstrate that CTCF can modulate transcription in specific contexts, acute depletion of CTCF only leads to moderate transcriptional defects, highlighting the complex and nuanced roles of CTCF in regulating gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>CTCF binding is sensitive to DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> , and consequently global DNA demethylation causes the emergence of hundreds to thousands of previously masked CTCF peaks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, these methylation-sensitive sites comprise only a small subset of all potential methylated CTCF sites, suggesting that DNA methylation serves as a specialized mechanism to regulate specific CTCF binding sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent work has revealed that DNA methylation regulates a subset of CTCF loops and CTCF-dependent genes during mESC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> . While methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks have been linked to gene expression and mRNA processing in some instances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, the functions of most methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks are unknown. Moreover, the broader impacts of emergent CTCF binding upon global DNA demethylation on chromatin looping are just starting to be revealed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we employed a selective inhibitor of DNMT1, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase, to induce genome-wide DNA demethylation and investigated the chromatin looping patterns of the resulting methylation-sensitive DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks. We found that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks within genes form loops to highly-looping partner peaks located in active chromatin regions. Remarkably, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are located close to nuclear speckles, condensate bodies of protein and RNA that have been implicated in transcription and splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Subnuclear localization relative to nuclear landmarks such as nuclear speckles is linked to genome structure and function, so we explored this relationship further by developing acute degron systems for both CTCF and speckles. Through these experiments, we clarify the directionality of the relationship between CTCF and speckles and glean novel insights into how methylation-sensitive CTCF contributes to chromatin structure and gene expression.</p>

<title>DNMT1 inhibition activates CTCF peaks and loops on gene bodies</title>
<p>Loss of DNA methylation leads to increased CTCF occupancy at hundreds to thousands of CTCF sites depending on the cell type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, but a global understanding of their looping patterns and functions is lacking. Recently, selective, noncovalent DNMT1 inhibitors (e.g., GSK3484862) have become available, enabling dynamic control of DNA methylation with fewer undesirable effects such as DNA damage and cytotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Consequently, we employed these new DNMT1 inhibitors to probe the functions and looping patterns of methylation-sensitive CTCF sites.</p>
<p>We treated K562 and HCT116 cells with GSK3484862 (here after referred to as DNMT1i, 10 µM) for three days and performed CTCF ChIP-seq and HiChIP to investigate CTCF-associated changes in chromatin looping (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Under these conditions, DNMT1i treatment led to minimal growth defects in both cell types (Fig S1A). Consistent with prior studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, DNMT1i treatment increased CTCF binding at thousands of sites, which we term “DNMT1i-specific peaks”. These peaks are known to overlap with CTCF peaks in other cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B,C</xref>, 2,079 up- and 2 down-regulated in K562, 6,686 up- and 328 down-regulated in HCT116). As expected, DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites were 80-90% methylated in wild-type cells (Fig S1B), and half of the CTCF binding motifs enriched within these peak regions were methylated at two key CpG sites implicated in CTCF binding (Fig S1C) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Analysis of genome-wide bisulfite information obtained from LIMe-Hi-C in K562 treated with DMSO and DNTM1i (Fig S1D) revealed that these DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites at baseline are more methylated than their constitutive counterparts (Fig S1E). Strikingly, upon treatment with the DNMT1i treatment for 3 days, methylation levels at DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites are reduced 2-fold (Fig S1E).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next evaluated whether these DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks form chromatin loops. CTCF HiChIP revealed that a large subset of DNMT1i-specific peaks (45% K562, 30% HCT116) resides within at least one loop anchor and these are henceforth called “looping” peaks (see Methods) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. An example of DNMT1i-specific looping CTCF peaks is shown at the <italic>PCDHA</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). On average, loops that are anchored by DNMT1i-specific peaks increase moderately in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition (average log<sub>2</sub>FC ∼0.3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). We next sought to evaluate these findings using our published Hi-C dataset following DNMT1 inhibition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Specifically, we analyzed Hi-C interaction strength using standard aggregate pileup analysis over all DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites identified in our ChIP-seq data. Consistent with our Hi-ChIP data, this analysis revealed an increase in Hi-C interaction signal at DNMT1i-specific peaks following 3 days of DNMT1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next characterized the genomic annotations of looping and nonlooping DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks. Consistent with previous findings using azacitidine <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, loss of DNA methylation through DNMT1i treatment led to the preferential reactivation of CTCF peaks on non-intron gene bodies, with half of K562 DNMT1i-specific peaks emerging in exons, promoters, or transcription termination sites (TTS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref><bold>, S1F, S1G</bold>). Notably, this enrichment on gene bodies was particularly pronounced with looping DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>, Fig S1F, S1G, S1H), highlighting an underappreciated propensity for CTCF peaks on gene bodies to engage in chromatin loops. Altogether, selective DNMT1 inhibition leads to the emergence of thousands of DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks on gene bodies that engage in new chromatin interactions.</p>

<title>DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks interact with highly-looping partners near nuclear speckles</title>
<p>We next scrutinized the CTCF partners that loop to DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks. Notably, the CTCF partners of DNMT1i-specific peaks tend to engage in a moderately greater total number of different loops compared to all CTCF peaks (i.e., have more looping partners, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), mostly for K562 cells (average increase ∼1.3 fold). This trend is in part driven by the tendency of non-intronic gene body CTCF peaks to more frequently participate in loops with highly-looping CTCF partners in comparison to intronic or intergenic CTCF peaks (Fig S2A). To characterize these highly-looping partners, we ranked all CTCF peaks by the number of different partners they interact with and called those with the most partners ‘highly-looping’, analogously to how superenhancers or supersilencers were previously characterized (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref><bold>, 2C, S2B</bold>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. HiChIP loops between DNMT1i-specific peaks and highly-looping peaks also increased in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition (average log<sub>2</sub>FC ∼0.3), consistent with increased interactions between these sites (Fig S2C). The propensity for a given CTCF site to engage in many contacts may reflect architectural stripes, a chromatin structural feature identified from Hi-C data that is postulated to result from persistent loop extrusion at a single region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Stripe anchors are enriched for chromatin accessibility and histone modifications associated with active enhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Similarly, regions near highly-looping CTCF peaks are accessible and modestly enriched for active chromatin marks such as H3K9ac and H3K27ac (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). Furthermore, based on previously published Hi-C data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, highly-looping CTCF sites have an approximately 2-fold stronger propensity to engage in chromatin interactions compared to ordinary CTCF sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). In addition, stripe anchors identified from these Hi-C data also reside closer to highly-looping CTCF peaks than all peaks, consistent with the similarities between these features (Fig S2D). Thus, these results show that upon DNA demethylation, DNMT1i-specific CTCF sites form loops to highly-looping partners associated with active regulatory marks and stripe anchors.</p>

<p>To understand the features that distinguish DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners from other CTCF peaks, we next considered their subnuclear localization. To do so, we investigated their distribution across genomic subcompartments, which exhibit variable transcriptional activity and association with nuclear landmarks, such as the nuclear lamina or nuclear speckles. In particular, we found an enrichment of DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and highly-looping CTCF peaks in the A1 subcompartment of the genome, which is differentiated from the A2 subcompartment largely due to its localization near nuclear speckles (Fig S2E) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that nuclear speckles are hubs of DNA-DNA contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Additionally, CTCF can form stress-responsive clusters near nuclear speckles in some cell types, and genomic subcompartments associated with speckles have been correlated with increased CTCF binding and looping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. However, a direct connection between nuclear speckles and CTCF binding and looping has not been extensively explored.</p>
<p>To determine if DNMT1i-specific peaks and highly-looping CTCF peaks are preferentially located near nuclear speckles, we performed Cut&amp;Tag for SON, a core speckle protein, in K562 and HCT116 cells with and without DNMT1 inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Consistent with their localization near speckles, DNMT1i-specific peaks are located in regions of 2-fold higher SON signal compared to all CTCF peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref><bold>, S2F</bold>). Notably, this trend is strongest for looping DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). This enrichment of looping DNMT1i-specific peaks near speckles is further corroborated by publicly available SON TSA-seq data in wild-type cells (Fig S2G) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks reside closer to nuclear speckles than non-DNMT1i-specific peaks.</p>
<p>Strikingly, relative to all CTCF peaks, highly-looping CTCF peaks are enriched at nuclear speckles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref><bold>, S2H,</bold> ∼5-fold enrichment). More broadly, the number of different loops a CTCF peak engages in and their corresponding strength are positively correlated (Pearson R 0.2) with SON Cut&amp;Tag signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref><bold>, S2I</bold>). In addition, we observed that CTCF peaks with strong Cut&amp;Tag SON signal preferentially engage in strong shorter-range interactions in published Hi-C interaction data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Overall, our results reveal that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks interact with highly-looping partners located near nuclear speckles.</p>

<title>DNMT1i-induced gene activation and speckle association depend on CTCF</title>
<p>Our data revealed that CTCF reactivation and looping are highly correlated with nuclear speckle association. As such, we next sought to study the nature of this relationship through degrading either CTCF or nuclear speckles. We first generated a HaloTAG-CTCF homozygous knock-in HCT116 cell line, which enabled the inducible recruitment of CTCF to the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase upon addition of the small molecule HaloPROTAC3, causing subsequent proteolytic degradation within 8 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref><bold>, 3B, S3A</bold>). We then performed SON Cut&amp;Tag after pretreating our CTCF-HaloTag knockin cells with HaloPROTAC3 or vehicle for 8 hours before co-treating with DNMT1i or vehicle for 24 hours (32 hours total for HaloPROTAC3 treatment). This shorter timepoint was used to capture direct effects of CTCF degradation and DNA demethylation as well as avoid toxicity caused by CTCF depletion. We found that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks gain ∼3-fold SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1i treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). This gain in SON signal is blocked when CTCF is degraded by HaloPROTAC3 treatment, suggesting that speckle association at these DNMT1i-specific sites is dependent on CTCF (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Thus, SON associates with DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks in a CTCF-dependent manner.</p>

<p>Because DNMT1i-specific peaks fail to engage with nuclear speckles if CTCF is not present, we hypothesized that gene activation induced upon loss of DNA methylation may be dampened in the absence of CTCF. Prior work has suggested that cell-type specific DNA methylation may protect a “labile” set of CTCF peaks from reactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and that methylation-dependent CTCF occupancy on gene bodies has been linked to changes in gene processing, but a global understanding of the functions of methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks on transcription remains lacking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we tested whether DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks promote gene activation upon DNMT1 inhibition.</p>
<p>To assess the role of CTCF in enabling DNMT1i-dependent gene activation, we pretreated our CTCF-HaloTag knockin cells with HaloPROTAC3 or vehicle for 8 hours and then co-treated the cells with DNMT1i or vehicle for 24 hours before performing RNA-seq (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref><bold>, 3D</bold>). Consistent with prior studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, acute CTCF degradation altered the expression of hundreds of genes with approximately equal numbers up- and downregulated (488 upregulated, 338 downregulated, P-adj &lt;0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 0.5) (Fig S3B), with downregulated genes possessing higher baseline levels of CTCF at their promoters (Fig S3C). As expected, DNMT1i treatment in this cell line for 24 hours primarily resulted in gene upregulation, with 135 genes upregulated and 8 genes downregulated (P-adj &lt;0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 0.5) (Fig S3B).</p>
<p>We focused our analysis on genes that were differentially expressed in DNMT1i versus DMSO treatment in the presence of CTCF (Fig S3B, left). Using K-means clustering, we identified four gene clusters within this group defined by unique z-score normalized expression patterns across the conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Clusters 1, 2, and 4 comprise genes that increase in expression upon DNMT1 inhibition, whereas Cluster 3 contains the few genes that decrease in expression upon DNMT1 inhibition. Moreover, genes in Cluster 1 are upregulated by CTCF depletion, whereas genes within Clusters 2, 3, and 4 are unaffected by CTCF depletion alone.</p>
<p>We focused on Clusters 2 and 4, which contain lowly-expressed genes that are upregulated upon DNMT1 inhibition and unaffected by CTCF depletion in the absence of DNMT1i (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref><bold>, S3D</bold>). Significantly, while genes in Cluster 4 are upregulated upon DNMT1 inhibition with or without CTCF present, genes in Cluster 2 depend on CTCF for DNMT1i-mediated upregulation. To determine how CTCF binding might be related to the observed changes in gene expression, we performed CTCF ChIP-seq in our HaloTag-CTCF HCT116 cells following 24 hours of DNMT1i or vehicle treatment. Notably, genes in Cluster 2 preferentially gained CTCF occupancy upon DNMT1 inhibition compared to genes in other clusters (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref><bold>, right, S3E</bold>). Thus, these data demonstrate that a subset of genes enriched for CTCF reactivation depend on CTCF for expression upon DNMT1i treatment.</p>
<p>We next assessed the correlation between CTCF-dependent genes and speckle association. Intriguingly, genes in Cluster 2 have nearly 3-fold higher SON TSA-seq levels than genes in Cluster 4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>), while genes in cluster 1, which are upregulated by CTCF depletion alone, are closest to nuclear speckles. Moreover, genes in Cluster 2 gain a modest (log<sub>2</sub>fold-change ∼0.1) level of SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1i treatment (Fig S3F). Taken together, these experiments show that CTCF is necessary for both gene activation and speckle protein association upon DNMT1 inhibition.</p>

<title>Acute disruption of nuclear speckles alters RNA abundance without disrupting CTCF</title>
<p>To further explore the observed connection between speckles and CTCF looping, we tested whether nuclear speckles play a causal role in promoting CTCF occupancy and/or looping. To accomplish this, we sought to acutely degrade speckles to evaluate whether speckles actively maintain CTCF loops while mitigating confounding factors associated with mitotic arrest caused by long-term SON depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Consequently, we engineered a K562 knock-in cell line with the core speckle proteins, SON and SRRM2, both endogenously tagged with FKBP12<sup>F36V</sup> for use with the dTAG degradation system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>.

<p>We next assessed if speckle disruption directly alters RNA abundance by performing RNA-seq after 6 hours of dTAG-13 treatment. Upon speckle degradation, 541 genes were down-regulated and 184 genes were up-regulated (P-adj &lt; 0.05, |log<sub>2</sub>fold-change| &gt; 0.25) (Fig S4B). Consistent with a role of nuclear speckles in promoting transcription, over 80% of down-regulated genes were located within the closest decile to nuclear speckles by TSA-seq (Fig S4C), and genes with the highest SON Cut&amp;Tag signal exhibited the strongest decrease in RNA abundance (Fig S4D). These results show that disrupting nuclear speckles has immediate effects on RNA abundance.</p>
<p>To determine whether speckle disruption alters CTCF binding and/or looping, we performed CTCF ChIP-seq and HiChIP in the speckle dTAG cell line after treatment with dTAG-13 or DMSO for 6 hours. In contrast to the immediate RNA effects, CTCF occupancy remained unchanged upon speckle degradation, with only 2 significantly downregulated peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>, S4E). CTCF HiChIP also revealed that loop strength was largely unchanged across speckle Cut&amp;Tag and TSA-seq quantiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>, S4F). Even after 12 hours of dTAG treatment, there was only a very subtle decrease in CTCF looping near speckles (Fig S4F). In addition, changes in gene expression were not associated with changes in loop strength or CTCF binding (Figure S4G, S4H). Conversely, depleting CTCF for 24 hours in our HaloTag-CTCF HCT116 knockin cell line did not noticeably change speckle morphology (Fig S4I). Altogether, acute disruption of nuclear speckles did not appreciably disrupt CTCF binding or looping, suggesting that maintenance of 3D CTCF loop structure is independent of speckle association. This complements our finding that, conversely, speckle association depends upon DNMT1i-specific CTCF.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DNA methylation accounts for much of the variation in CTCF binding across cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, but the functions and features of methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks are incompletely understood. Interestingly, DNA-methylation-sensitive CTCF sites have recently been shown to regulate gene expression during differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells supporting the important role of these highly regulated sites in modulating cell state transitions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Here we leveraged a selective DNMT1 inhibitor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup> to gain new insights into how DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks interface with chromatin looping and transcription. This new inhibitor is a valuable tool for reactivating CTCF at shorter time scales without the confounding effects caused by the covalent nature and toxicity of earlier hypomethylating agents or the compensatory feedback mechanisms that can result from gene knockout.</p>
<p>We found that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks preferentially form loops on gene bodies and interact with promiscuous partner peaks at stripe anchors. Architectural stripes may contribute to transcription by promoting enhancer contacts with gene bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, and may also represent a mechanism to poise transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Thus, we propose that DNMT1i-specific peaks enable transcriptional activation by interacting with regulatory elements through highly-looping CTCF partner peaks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). However, DNA demethylation causes pleiotropic effects ranging from changes in gene expression to transcription factor binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, and we cannot rule out that these other features could contribute to the effects we observe.</p>
<p>Strikingly, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks and their highly-looping partners are located near nuclear speckles, consistent with prior studies showing that subcompartments near nuclear speckles exhibit increased CTCF binding and looping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. We first explored this relationship by degrading CTCF and intriguingly observed that DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks gain SON Cut&amp;Tag signal upon DNMT1 inhibition in a CTCF-dependent manner, indicating a functional tie between DNMT1i-specific CTCF and speckles. This is consistent with a recent preprint reporting that CTCF helps establish basal speckle-gene contacts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Additionally, our CTCF degron experiments demonstrate that a large fraction of genes that are differentially expressed upon DNMT1 inhibition depends on CTCF for upregulation. These genes preferentially gain CTCF binding and are located near nuclear speckles. Consequently, CTCF peaks that are DNMT1i-specific upon DNMT1 inhibition could facilitate the activation of genes near speckles, perhaps by mediating the engagement of genic CTCF sites with speckle-associated stripe anchors and/or splicing factors, although this model requires further study (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). A role of CTCF in facilitating chromatin loops near speckles is synergistic with proposed models suggesting that intragenic looping contributes to gene splicing <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Thus, DNMT1i-specific CTCF peaks may reorganize genes near nuclear speckles as a means of influencing transcription.</p>
<p>We next studied whether speckles impact CTCF binding or looping by achieving the first acute degradation of nuclear speckles. Previous work knocking down SRRM2 support a causative role of speckles in modulating chromatin structure but did not specifically study changes in CTCF binding or looping <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Although acute disruption of speckles supports their direct involvement in RNA abundance, we observed minimal impacts on CTCF binding or looping. This notion is consistent with recent work showing that CTCF clustering and looping is not dependent on phase separation or nuclear bodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and that transcriptional disruption does not immediately impact chromatin looping or CTCF binding <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Our findings also suggest that the genome interactions disrupted upon SRRM2 depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> are not mediated by CTCF or only occur after a longer time. However, it is possible that nuclear speckles contribute to the establishment, but not maintenance, of CTCF loops, which may not be evident in our system due to the short time points employed for speckle degradation. Moreover, other features enriched near speckles, such as open chromatin, high GC-content, and active gene expression, could instead contribute to increased CTCF binding and looping near speckles. Overall, our speckle degradation experiments help clarify the directionality of the relationship between speckles and CTCF.</p>
<p>Taken altogether, our findings highlight one possible mechanism through which DNA methylation may modulate genome architecture — by protecting a subset of genic CTCF sites from engaging with promiscuous CTCF peaks located near nuclear speckles. Genes near nuclear speckles may be particularly susceptible to activation through CTCF-dependent mechanisms, and thus might require this layer of protective regulation. Notably, the effects of DNA demethylation cannot be fully uncoupled from gene activation in our experiments, and thus this mechanism will require further study. Furthermore, the GC-rich composition of non-intron gene bodies might increase the likelihood of CTCF motifs in comparison to other genomic regions, increasing the vulnerability of these sites to ectopic CTCF binding. More broadly, our work nominates new functions for the known antagonism between gene body methylation and CTCF occupancy in regulating transcription through remodeling genome architecture.</p>

For immunoblots of CTCF, cells were lysed on ice using RIPA buffer (Boston BioProducts) supplemented with fresh HALT Protease Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the lysates were cleared through centrifugation. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and immunoblots for CTCF were performed according to standard procedures with a 6% SureCast acrylamide page gel. For immunoblots of SON and SRRM2 and corresponding loading controls, 1 million cells per condition were lysed on ice for 30 minutes in 50uL RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts, BP-115) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM EDTA, and 1X Halt Protease inhibitors (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78429). Subsequently, 50 µL of wash buffer was added (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 2 mM MgCl, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1X Halt Protease inhibitors, 1:500 Benzonase (Millipore-Sigma, E1014-25KU), and the samples were rotated at room temperature for 20 minutes and then clarified by full speed centrifugation at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23225). Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures with the following modifications: a 3-8% tris acetate gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EA03752) was used ,and samples were run for 2 hours 15 min at 80 V at 4 °C in 1X tris-acetate running buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, LA0041) except for the loading control which was run for 90 minutes.

<p>CTCF peaks were annotated with the number of different loops (partners) per peak by using pgltools (v 2.2.0) intersect1D to list each loop-peak interception followed by bedtools (v 2.26.0) merge on the list of peaks to sum the number of different loops in which each peak falls within an anchor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. To annotate peaks with the number of different loops their maximally-looping partner makes, pgltools (v 2.2.0) intersect1D was again used to list each loop-peak interception. Bedtools (v 2.26.0) map was used to annotate the number of different loops the peak in each partner anchor makes from the previous file using the -o max flag. This resulted in one entry per loop that lists the “original” peak and the number of loops its partner anchor makes. The maximally-looping partner per original peak was mapped back onto the original peak list with bedtools (v 2.26.0) map using the -o max flag so that each peak was listed once.</p>

<title>Calling and characterizing highly-looping peaks</title>
<p>Highly-looping peaks were called by adapting code used previously to define methylation rich regions (MRRs) and superenhancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Specifically, peaks were ordered by rank with respect to the number of different loops they make. The tangent line was drawn where the slope becomes 1 and any peaks above this cutoff were considered highly-looping for a given condition. To generate aggregate profile plots of public K562 histone modification bigwig files (see source data) over CTCF peaks, deepTools (v 3.4.3) computeMatrix was used with the following parameters: reference-point --referencePoint center -bs 50 -a 5000 -b 5000 --skipZeros and results were visualized with deepTools (v 3.4.3) plotProfile. Overlap of peaks with subcompartments and TSA-seq was performed as described above for all CTCF peaks. The following published files were used from the ENCODE consortium for the peak characterization pileups: ENCFF239EBH.bigWig, ENCFF469JMR.bigWig, ENCFF600FDO.bigWig.</p>

<title>Calculating looping changes across conditions</title>
<p>To calculate fold-change and mean CPM loop strength between conditions, mango Hichipper output files for individual replicates were input into Diffloop (v 1.16.0) and processed with the loopsmake mango function <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The full loop list was then filtered for loops with FDR &lt;0.01 and with at least 8 PETs across samples for a given cell type and loops that appeared strongly (&gt;5 PETs) in only one replicate but 0 PETS in the other were removed. The quickAssoc function was then used to get loop strength fold-change and CPM values for each loop. Diffloop output files obtained from the summary() function were then intersected with genomic features (such as DNMT1i-specific peak overlap, subcompartment, Cut&amp;Tag signal) for further analyses using pgltools (v 2.2.0) intersect1D and redundant loops were merged using pgltools (v 2.2.0) merge and files were further processed in python (v 3.7.0) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.python.org">www.python.org</ext-link>) with pandas (v1.0.3), matplotlib (v 3.2.1) seaborn (v 0.11.2) and statannot (v 0.2.3) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Cut&amp;Tag data processing</title>
<p>Paired end reads were aligned to hg38, deduplicated and converted to bam and tdf files as described above for ChIP-seq.

Then, deepTools (v 3.4.3) computeMatrix and plotProfile were used to plot SON Cut&amp;Tag signal over categories of CTCF peaks with the following computeMatrix parameters: reference-point --referencePoint center -bs 50 -a 1000 -b 1000 –skipZeros.

Reads were then deduplicated with umi-tools dedup (v 1.1.1) with flags multimapping-detection-method=NH and unpaired-reads=discard. For gene expression analysis, HTseq – count (v 0.11.2) was used to count reads in genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref></sup>. Count files were then processed in DEseq2 (v 1.28) with R (v 4.0.2) using the standard workflow to get fold-change values and using alpha=0.05 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>. Hierarchical clustering was performed on the regularized log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts using Euclidean distance as a metric and the complete clustering method. All genes with both an P-adj &lt; 0.05, calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction, and |log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change)| &gt; 0.5 between wildtype DNMT1i and DMSO were included in the clustered heatmap. The regularized log<sub>2</sub>-transformed counts for the variable genes were grouped by <italic>k</italic>-means clustering (<italic>k</italic> = 4) and the Z-scores for the variable genes, ordered according to their cluster identity, are depicted. For differential exon analysis, Dexseq (v 1.34.1) was used. Files were then imported into R and fold-change values were computed according to the standard Dexseq workflow. BioMart was used to map the genomic ranges for each gene onto RNA-seq differential expression output files. Gene expression changes were compared with Cut&amp;Tag signal and CTCF peak overlap using bedtools (v 2.26.0) map with -o mean.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study tested the impact of DNA methylation on CTCF binding in two cancer cell lines. Increased CTCF binding sites are enriched in gene bodies, and associate with nuclear speckles, indicating a role in increased transcription. In the revised work, the inferred association with nuclear speckles has been supported with more <bold>solid</bold> data. These results will be of interest to the epigenetics field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>CTCF is one of the most well-characterized regulators of chromatin architecture in mammals. Given that CTCF is an essential protein, understanding how its binding is regulated is a very active area of research. It has been known for decades that CTCF is sensitive to 5-cystosine DNA methylation (5meC) in certain contexts. Moreover, at genomic imprints and in certain oncogenes, 5meC-mediated CTCF antagonism has very important gene regulatory implications. A number of labs (eg, Schubeler and Stamatoyannopoulos) have assessed the impact of DNA methylation on CTCF binding, but it is important to also interrogate the effect on chromatin organization (ie, looping). Here, Roseman and colleagues used a DNMT1 inhibitor in two established human cancer lines (HCT116 [colon] and K562 [leukemia]), and performed CTCF ChIPseq and HiChIP. They showed that &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF sites-that is, bound in the absence of 5meC-are enriched in gene bodies, participate in many looping events, and intriguingly, appear associated with nuclear speckles. This last aspect suggests that these reactivated loops might play an important role in increased gene transcription. They showed a number of genes that are upregulated in the DNA hypomethylated state actually require CTCF binding, which is an important result.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, I found the paper to be succinctly written and the data presented clearly. The relationship between CTCF binding in gene bodies and association with nuclear speckles is an interesting result. Another strong point of the paper was combining DNMT1 inhibition with CTCF degradation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The most problematic aspect of the original version was the insufficient evidence for the association of &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF binding sites with nuclear speckles. This has been more diligently assessed in the revised version.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have adequately addressed my points in this revised version.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for the constructive comments, which have improved the manuscript. In response to these comments, we have made the following major changes to the main text and reviewer response:</p>
<p>(1) Added experimental and computational evidence to support the use of Cut&amp;Tag to determine speckle location.</p>
<p>(2) Performed new Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) experiments to visualize interchromatin granule clusters +/- speckle degradation.</p>
<p>(3) Altered the text of the manuscript to remove qualitative statements and clarify effect sizes.</p>
<p>(4) Performed new analyses of published whole genome bisulfite data from LIMe-Hi-C following DNMT1 inhibition to demonstrate that CpG methylation is lost at DNMT1i-specific gained CTCF sites.</p>
<p>(5) Included citations for relevant literature throughout the text.</p>
<p>These revisions in addition to others are described in the point-by-point response below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Roseman et al. use a new inhibitor of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 to probe the role of methylation on binding of the CTCF protein, which is known to be involved chromatin loop formation. As previous reported, and as expected based on our knowledge that CTCF binding is methylation-sensitive, the authors find that loss of methylation leads to additional CTCF binding sites and increased loop formation. By comparing novel loops with the binding of the pre-mRNA splicing factor SON, which localizes to the nuclear speckle compartment, they propose that these reactivated loops localize to near speckles. This behavior is dependent on CTCF whereas degradation of two speckle proteins does not affect CTCF binding or loop formation. The authors propose a model in which DNA methylation controls the association of genome regions with speckles via CTCF-mediated insulation.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The strengths of the study are 1) the use of a new, specific DNMT1 inhibitor and 2) the observation that genes whose expression is sensitive to DNMT1 inhibition and dependent on CTCF (cluster 2) show higher association with SON than genes which are sensitive to DNMT1 inhibition but are CTCF insensitive, is in line with the authors' general model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>There are a number of significant weaknesses that as a whole undermine many of the key conclusions, including the overall mechanistic model of a direct regulatory role of DNA methylation on CTCF-mediated speckle association of chromatin loops.</p>

To give a few examples: &quot;reactivated CTCF sites were largely methylated (p. 4/5), &quot;many CTCF binding motifs enriched...&quot; (p.5), &quot;a large subset of reactivated peaks...&quot;(p.5), &quot;increase in strength upon DNMT1 inhibition&quot; (p.5); &quot;a greater total number.....&quot; (p.7). These statements are all made based on actual numbers and the authors should mention the numbers in the text to give an impression of the extent of these changes (see below) and to clarify what the qualitative terms like &quot;largely&quot;, &quot;many&quot;, &quot;large&quot;, and &quot;increase&quot; mean. This is an issue throughout the manuscript and not limited to the above examples.</p>
<p>Related to this issue, many of the comparisons which the authors interpret to show differences in behavior seem quite minor. For example, visual inspection suggests that the difference in loop strength shown in figure 1E is something like from 0 to 0.1 for K562 cells and a little less for KCT116 cells. What is a positive control here to give a sense of whether these minor changes are relevant. Another example is on p. 7, where the authors claim that CTCF partners of reactivated peaks tend to engage in a &quot;greater number&quot; of looping partners, but inspection of Figure 2A shows a very minor difference from maybe 7 to 7.5 partners. While a Mann-Whitney test may call this difference significant and give a significant P value, likely due to high sample number, it is questionable that this is a biologically relevant difference.</p>

<p>We have amended the text to include actual values, instead of just qualitative statements. We have also moderated our claims in the text to note where effect sizes are more modest.</p>
<p>The following literature examples can serve as positive controls for the effect sizes that we might expect when perturbing CTCF. Our observed effect sizes are largely in line with these expected magnitudes.</p>

<p>(2) The data to support the central claim of localization of reactivated loops to speckles is not overly convincing. The overlap with SON Cut&amp;Tag (figure 2F) is partial at best and although it is better with the publicly available TSA-seq data, the latter is less sensitive than Cut&amp;Tag and more difficult to interpret. It would be helpful to validate these data with FISH experiments to directly demonstrate and measure the association of loops with speckles (see below).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A recent publication we co-authored validated the use of speckle (SON) Cut&amp;Run using FISH (Yu et al, <italic>NSMB</italic> 2025, doi: 10.1038/s41594-024-01465-6). This paper also supports a role of CTCF in positioning DNA near speckles. Unfortunately, the resolution of these FISH probes is in the realm of hundreds of kilobases. This was not an issue for Yu et. al., as they were looking at large-scale effects of CTCF degradation on positioning near speckles. However, FISH does not provide the resolution we need to look at more localized changes over methylation-specific peak sites.</p>
<p>Instead, we use Cut&amp;Tag to look at these high-resolution changes. In Figure 3C, we show that SON localizes to DNMT1i-specific peaks only upon DNMT1 inhibition. We further demonstrate that this interaction is dependent on CTCF. In response to reviewer comments, we have now also performed spike-in normalized Cut&amp;Tag upon acute (6 hr) SON degradation to validate that our signal is also directly dependent on SON and not merely due to a bias toward open chromatin.</p>

<p>We also note that Fig 2F shows all CTCF peaks and loops, not just methylation-sensitive peaks and loops, to give a sense of the data. We apologize for any confusion and have clarified this in the figure legend.</p>

<p>(3) It is not clear that the authors have indeed disrupted speckles from cells by degrading SON and SRRM2. Speckles contain a large number of proteins and considering their phase separated nature stronger evidence for their complete removal is needed. Note that the data published in ref 58 suffers from the same caveat.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based upon the reviewers’ feedback, we generated Tranmission electron microscopy (TEM) data to visualize nuclear speckles +/- degradation of SON and SRRM2 (DMSO and dTAG). We were able to detect Interchromatin Granules Clusters (ICGs) that are representative of nuclear speckles in the DMSO condition. However, even at baseline, we observed a large degree of cell-to-cell variability in these structures. In addition, we also observe potential structural changes in the distribution of heterochromatin upon speckle degradation. Consequently, we hesitate to make quantitative conclusions regarding loss of these nuclear bodies. In the interest of transparency, we have included representative raw images from both conditions for the reviewers’ consideration.</p>
<p>We also note that in Ref 58 (Ilik et. Al., <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60579">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.60579</ext-link>), the authors show diffusion of speckle client proteins RBM25, SRRM1, and PNN upon SON and SRRM2 depletion, further supporting speckle dissociation in these conditions.</p>

<p>(4) The authors ascribe a direct regulatory role to DNA methylation in controlling the association of some CTCF-mediated loops to speckles (p. 20). However, an active regulatory role of speckle association has not been demonstrated and the observed data are equally explainable by a more parsimonious model in which DNA methylation regulates gene expression via looping and that the association with speckles is merely an indirect bystander effect of the activated genes because we know that active genes are generally associated with speckles. The proposed mechanism of a regulatory role of DNA methylation in controlling speckle association is not convincingly demonstrated by the data. As a consequence, the title of the paper is also misleading.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While it is difficult to completely rule out indirect effects, we do not believe that the relationship between methylation-sensitive CTCF sites and speckles relies only on gene activity.</p>
<p>We can partially decouple SON Cut&amp;Tag signal from gene activation if we break down Figure 4D to look only at methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks on genes whose expression is unchanged upon DNMT1 inhibition (using thresholds from manuscript, P-adj &gt; 0.05 and/or |log2(fold-change)| &lt; 0.5). This analysis shows that many methylation-sensitive CTCF peaks on genes with unchanged expression still change speckle association upon DNMT1 inhibition. This result refutes the necessity of transcriptional activation to recruit speckles to CTCF.</p>

<p>We note the comparator upregulated gene set here is small (~20 genes with our stringent threshold for methylation-sensitive CTCF after 1 day DNMT1i treatment).</p>
<p>However, we acknowledge that these effects cannot be completely disentangled. We previously included the statement “other features enriched near speckles, such as open chromatin, high GC content, and active gene expression, could instead contribute to increased CTCF binding and looping near speckles” in the discussion. In response to the reviewer’s comment, we have further tempered our statements on page 20/21 and also added a statement noting that DNA demethylation and gene activation cannot be fully disentangled. While we are also open to a title change, we are unsure which part of the title is problematic.</p>

<p>(5) As a minor point, the authors imply on p. 15 that ablation of speckles leads to misregulation of genes by altering transcription. This is not shown as the authors only measure RNA abundance, which may be affected by depletion of constitutive splicing factors, but not transcription. The authors would need to show direct effects on transcription.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>CTCF is one of the most well-characterized regulators of chromatin architecture in mammals. Given that CTCF is an essential protein, understanding how its binding is regulated is a very active area of research. It has been known for decades that CTCF is sensitive to 5-cystosine DNA methylation (5meC) in certain contexts. Moreover, at genomic imprints and in certain oncogenes, 5meC-mediated CTCF antagonism has very important gene regulatory implications. A number of labs (eg, Schubeler and Stamatoyannopoulos) have assessed the impact of DNA methylation on CTCF binding, but it is important to also interrogate the effect on chromatin organization (ie, looping). Here, Roseman and colleagues used a DNMT1 inhibitor in two established human cancer lines (HCT116 [colon] and K562 [leukemia]), and performed CTCF ChIPseq and HiChIP. They showed that &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF sites-that is, bound in the absence of 5meC-are enriched in gene bodies, participate in many looping events, and intriguingly, appear associated with nuclear speckles. This last aspect suggests that these reactivated loops might play an important role in increased gene transcription. They showed a number of genes that are upregulated in the DNA hypomethylated state actually require CTCF binding, which is an important result.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, I found the paper to be succinctly written and the data presented clearly. The relationship between CTCF binding in gene bodies and association with nuclear speckles is an interesting result. Another strong point of the paper was combining DNMT1 inhibition with CTCF degradation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The most problematic aspect of this paper in my view is the insufficient evidence for the association of &quot;reactivated&quot; CTCF binding sites with nuclear speckles needs to be more diligently demonstrated (see Major Comment). One unfortunate aspect was that this paper neglected to discuss findings from our recent paper, wherein we also performed CTCF HiChIP in a DNA methylation mutant (Monteagudo-Sanchez et al., 2024 PMID: 39180406). It is true, this is a relatively recent publication, although the BioRxiv version has been available since fall 2023. I do not wish to accuse the authors of actively disregarding our study, but I do insist that they refer to it in a revised version. Moreover, there are a number of differences between the studies such that I find them more complementary rather than overlapping. To wit, the species (mouse vs human), the cell type (pluripotent vs human cancer), the use of a CTCF degron, and the conclusions of the paper (we did not make a link with nuclear speckles). Furthermore, we used a constitutive DNMT knockout which is not viable in most cell types (HCT116 cells being an exception), and in the discussion mentioned the advantage of using degron technology:</p>
<p>&quot;With high-resolution techniques, such as HiChIP or Micro-C (119-121), a degron system can be coupled with an assessment of the cis-regulatory interactome (118). Such techniques could be adapted for DNA methylation degrons (eg, DNMT1) in differentiated cell types in order to gauge the impact of 5meC on the 3D genome.&quot;</p>
<p>The authors here used a DNMT1 inhibitor, which for intents and purposes, is akin to a DNMT1 degron, thus I was happy to see a study employ such a technique. A comparison between the findings from the two studies would strengthen the current manuscript, in addition to being more ethically responsible.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful comments, which we address in the point-by-point response below. We sincerely apologize for this oversight in our references. We have included references to your paper in our revised manuscript. It is exciting to see these complementary results! We now include discussion of this work to contextualize the importance of methylation-sensitive CTCF sites and motivate our study.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>To address the above points, the authors should:</p>
<p>(1) Provide quantitative information in the text on all comparisons and justify that the small differences observed, albeit statistically significant, are biologically relevant. Inclusion of positive controls to give an indication of what types of changes can be expected would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added quantitative information to the text, as discussed in the response to public comments above.  We also provide literature evidence of expected effect sizes in that response.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Provide FISH data to a) validate the analysis of comparing looping patterns with SON Cut&amp;Tag data as an indicator of physical association of loops with speckles and b) demonstrate by FISH increased association of some of the CTCF-dependent loops/genes (cluster 2) with speckles upon DNMT1 inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see response to Reviewer 1 comment #2 above. Unfortunately, FISH will not provide the resolution we need for point a). We have confidence in our use of TSA-seq and Cut&amp;Tag to study SON association with CTCF sites on a genome-wide scale, which would not be possible with individual FISH probes. Specifically, since the submission of our manuscript several other researchers (Yu et al, Nat. Struct. and Mol. Biol. 2025, Gholamalamdari et al eLife 2025) have leveraged CUT&amp;RUN/CUT&amp;TAG and TSA-seq to map speckle associated chromatin and have validated these methods with orthogonal imaging based approaches.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Demonstrate loss of speckles upon SON or SRRM2 by probing for other speckle components and ideally analysis by electron microscopy which should show loss of interchromatin granules.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed TEM in K562 cells +/- SON/SRRM2 degradation. Please see response to Reviewer 1 comment #3. Specifically, interchromatin granule clusters are visible in the TEM images of the DMSO sample (see highlighted example above), however, given the heterogeneity of these structures and potential global alterations in heterochromatin that may be occurring following speckle loss, we refrained from making quantitative conclusions from this data. We instead include the raw images above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors should either perform experiments to clearly show whether loop association is transcription dependent or whether association is merely a consequence of gene activation. Alternatively, they should tone down their model ascribing a direct regulatory role of methylation in control of loop association with speckles and also discuss other models. Unless the model is more clearly demonstrated, the title of the paper should be changed to reflect the uncertainty of the central conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see response to Reviewer 1 comment #4 above.</p>

<p>Major:</p>
<p>⁃ There was no DNA methylation analysis after inhibitor treatment. Ideally, genome bisulfite sequencing should be performed to show that the DNMT1i-specific CTCF binding sites are indeed unmethylated. But at the very least, a quantitative method should be employed to show the extent to which 5meC levels decrease in the presence of the DNMT1 inhibitor</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We have now included analysis of genome wide bisulfite information from LIMe-Hi-C (bisulfite Hi-C) in K562 following DNMT1i inhibition. Specifically, we leverage the CpG methylation readout and find that DNTM1i-specific CTCF sites are more methylated than non-responsive CTCF peaks at baseline. In addition, these sites show the greatest decrease in CpG methylation upon 3 days of DNMT1 inhibition. We include a figure detailing these analyses in the supplement (Fig S1E). In addition, we have added CpG methylation genome browser tracks to (Fig S1D). In terms of global change, we have found that 3 days of DNMT1 inhibitor treatment leads to a reduction in methylation to about ~1/4 the level at baseline.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am not convinced that CUT&amp;Tag is the proper technique to assess SON binding. CUT&amp;Tag only works under stringent conditions (high salt), and can be a problematic assay for non-histone proteins, which bind less well to chromatin. In our experience, even strong binders such as CTCF exhibit a depleted binding profile when compared to ChIP seq data. I would need to be strongly convinced that the analysis presented in figures 2F-J and S2 D-I simply do not represent ATAC signal (ie, default Tn5 activity). For example, SON ChIP Seq, CUT&amp;Tag in the SON degron and/or ATAC seq could be performed. What worries me is that increased chromatin accessibility would also be associated with increased looping, so they have generated artifactual results that are consistent with their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, we have now performed spike-in normalized SON Cut&amp;Tag with DNMT1 inhibition and 6 hours of SON/SRRM2 degradation in our speckle dTAG knockin cell line. These experiments confirm that the SON Cut&amp;Tag signal we see is SON-dependent. If the signal was truly due to artifactual binding, gained peaks would be open irrespective of speckle binding, however we see a clear speckle dependence as this signal is much lower if SON is degraded.</p>

<p>Moreover, in our original Cut&amp;Tag experiments, we did not enrich detectable DNA without using the SON antibody (see last 4 samples-IgG controls). This further suggests that our signal is SON-dependent.</p>

<p>Minor points</p>
<p>⁃ Why are HCT116 cells more responsive to treatment than K562 cells? This is something that could be addressed with DNA methylation analysis, for example</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>K562 is a broadly hypomethylated cell line (Siegenfeld et.al, 2022 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31857-5">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-31857-5</ext-link> Fig S2A-C). Thus, there may be less dynamic range to lose methylation compared to HCT116.</p>
<p>Our results are also consistent with previous results comparing DKO HCT116 and aza-treated K562 cells (Maurano 2015, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.07.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.07.024</ext-link>). They state “In K562 cells, 5-aza-CdR treatment resulted in weaker reactivation than in DKO cells…”  In addition, cell-type-specific responsiveness to DNA methyltransferase KO depending upon global CpG methylation levels, has also been observed in ES and EpiLC cells (Monteagudo-Sanchez et al., 2024), which we now comment on in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>⁃ How many significant CTCF loops in DNMTi, compared to DMSO? It was unclear what the difference in raw totals is.</p>

<p>⁃ Here 4-10x more DNMT1i-specific CTCF binding sites were observed than we saw in our study. What are thresholds? Could the thresholds for DNMT1i-specific peaks be defined more clearly? For what it's worth, we defined our DNMT KO-specific peaks as fold-change {greater than or equal to} 2, adjusted P&lt; 0.05. The scatterplots (1B) indicate a lot of &quot;small&quot; peaks being called &quot;reactivated.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We called DNMT1i-specific peaks using HOMER getDifferentialPeaksReplicates function. We used foldchange &gt;2 and padj &lt;0.05. We further restricted these peaks to those that were not called in the DMSO condition.</p>

<p>⁃ On this note, is &quot;reactivated&quot; the proper term? Reactivated with regards to what? A prior cell state? I think DNMT1i-specific is a safer descriptor.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>⁃ It appears there is a relatively small enrichment for CTCF peaks (of any class) in intergenic regions. How were intergenic regions defined? For us, it is virtually half of the genome. We did some enrichment of DNMT KO-specific peaks in gene bodies (our Supplemental Figure 1C), but a substantial proportion were still intergenic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We defined intergenic peaks using HOMER’s annotatepeaks function, with the -gtf option using Ensembl gene annotations (v104). We used the standard annotatepeaks priority order, which is TSS &gt; TTS&gt; CDS Exons &gt; 5’UTR exons &gt;3’ UTR exons &gt; Introns &gt; Intergenic.</p>
