<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Continued methodological advances have enabled numerous statistical approaches for the analysis of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Genetic correlation analysis within specific regions enables a new strategy for identifying pleiotropy. Genomic regions with significant ‘local’ genetic correlations can be investigated further using state-of-the-art methodologies for statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation. We explored the utility of a genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis approach for identifying genetic overlaps between the candidate neuropsychiatric disorders, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. The correlation analysis identified several associations between traits, the majority of which were loci in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. Colocalisation analysis suggested the presence of a shared causal variant between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease in this region. Our study identified candidate loci that might play a role in multiple neuropsychiatric diseases and suggested that disease-implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits. Accordingly, this suggests the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci. The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis protocol designed for this study has been implemented in a flexible analysis pipeline that produces HTML reports and is available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter">https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The genetic spectrum of neuropsychiatric disease is diverse and various overlaps exist between traits. For instance, genetic pleiotropy between amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is increasingly recognised, and ALS is genetically correlated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Improving understanding of the genetic architecture underlying these complex diseases could facilitate future treatment discovery.</p>
<p>Advances in genomic research techniques have accelerated discovery of genetic variation associated with complex traits. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), in particular, have enabled population-scale investigations of the genetic basis of human diseases and anthropometric measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Summary-level results from GWAS are being shared alongside publications with increasing frequency over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and a breadth of approaches now exist for downstream analysis based on summary statistics which can enable their interpretation and provide further biological insight.</p>
<p>Genetic correlation analysis allows estimation of genetic overlap between traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. A ‘global’ genetic correlation approach gives a genome-wide average estimate of this overlap However, genetic relationships between traits can be obscured when correlations in opposing directions cancel out genome-wide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Recent methods allow for a more nuanced analysis, of ‘local’ genetic correlations partitioned across the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This stratified approach to genome-wide analysis could prove effective for identifying pleiotropic regions and designing subsequent analyses aiming to identify genetic variation shared between traits.</p>
<p>A number of methods aim to disentangle causality within associated regions. This is important because the focus on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are markers of genetic variation, in GWAS produces results that can be difficult to interpret, and causal variants are typically unclear. More so, because of linkage disequilibrium (LD), GWAS associations often comprise large sets of highly correlated SNPs spanning large genomic regions. Statistical fine-mapping is a common approach for dissecting complex LD structures and finding variants with implications for a given trait among the tens or hundreds that might be associated in the region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Interpretation of regions associated with multiple traits can also be challenging, since it is often unclear whether these overlaps are driven by the same causal variant. Statistical colocalisation analysis can disentangle association signals across traits to suggest whether the overlaps result from shared or distinct causal genetic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Traditionally this analysis was restricted by the assumption of at most one causal variant for each trait in the region. However, recent extensions to the method now permit analysis based on univariate fine-mapping results for the traits compared and, therefore, analysis of regions with multiple causal variants.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we conducted genome-wide local genetic correlation analysis across 5 neuropsychiatric traits with recognised phenotypic and genetic overlap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>: AD, ALS, FTD, PD, and schizophrenia. Loci highly correlated between trait pairs were further investigated with univariate fine-mapping and bivariate colocalisation techniques to examine variants driving these associations.</p>

<title>Processing of GWAS summary statistics</title>
<p>A standard data cleaning protocol was applied to each set of summary statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We retained only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), excluding any non-SNP or strand-ambiguous variants. SNPs were filtered to those present within the 1000 Genomes phase 3 (1KG) European ancestry population reference dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (N = 503). They were matched to the 1KG reference panel by GRCh37 chromosomal position using <italic>bigsnpr</italic> (version 1.11.6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, harmonising allele order with the reference and assigning SNP IDs.</p>
<p>If not reported, and where possible, effective sample size (N<sub>eff</sub>) was calculated from per-SNP case and control sample sizes. When this could not be determined per-SNP, all variants were assigned a single N<sub>eff</sub>, calculated as a sum of N<sub>eff</sub> values for each cohort within the GWAS meta-analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further processing was performed where possible, excluding SNPs with imputation INFO &lt;0.9, p-values ≤0 or &gt;1, and N<sub>eff</sub> &gt;3 standard deviations from the median N<sub>eff</sub>. We filtered to include only variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) ≥0.005 in both the reference and GWAS samples and excluded SNPs with an absolute MAF difference of &gt;0.2 between the two.</p>

<title>Global heritability and genetic correlations</title>
<p>LDSC (version 1.0.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> was applied to estimate genome-wide univariate heritability (h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) for each trait on the liability scale. The software was also applied to derive ‘global’ (i.e., genome-wide) genetic correlation estimates between trait pairs and estimate sample overlap from the bivariate intercept.</p>
<p>These analyses were performed using the HapMap3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> SNPs and the LD score files provided with the software, calculated in the 1KG European population. No further MAF filter was applied (therefore variants with MAF &gt;0.005 were included) and the other settings were left to their defaults.</p>

<title>Local genetic correlation analysis</title>
<p>LAVA (version 0.1.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> was applied to obtain local genetic correlation estimates across 2495 approximately independent blocks delineating the genome, based on patterns in LD. We used the blocks provided alongside the LAVA software which were derived from the 1KG European cohort. Bivariate intercepts from LDSC were provided to LAVA to estimate sample overlap between trait pairs.</p>
<p>In accordance with prior studies, genetic correlation analysis was performed following an initial filtering step. Univariate heritability was estimated for each genomic block across SNPs in-common between a pair of traits, and only loci with local h<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> p-values below a threshold of 2.004×10<sup>−5</sup> (0.05/2495) in both traits continued to the bivariate analysis. This step ensures that univariate heritability is sufficient in both traits for a robust correlation estimate.</p>

<title>Fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis</title>
<p>Statistical fine-mapping and colocalisation techniques were applied to further analyse associations between trait pairs in regions where the false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value of local genetic correlation analysis was below 0.05 (after adjusting for all bivariate comparisons performed). Additional analysis was conducted at loci where significant correlations occurred between two trait pairs but not between the final pairwise comparison across the three implicated traits.</p>
<p>Fine-mapping was performed with <italic>susieR</italic> (v0.12.27)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, which implements the ‘sum of single effects’ (SuSiE) model to represent statistical evidence of causal genetic variation within ‘credible sets’ and per-SNP posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs). A 95% credible set indicates 95% certainty that at least one SNP included within the set has a causal association with the phenotype and higher PIPs indicate a greater posterior probability of being a causal variant within a credible set. Multiple credible sets are identified when the data suggest more than one independent causal signal.</p>
<p>Colocalisation analysis was implemented with <italic>coloc</italic> (v5.1.0.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, which calculates posterior probabilities that a causal variant exists for neither, one, or both of two compared traits, testing also whether evidence for a causal variant in both traits suggests a shared variant (i.e., hypothesis 4 (H4); colocalisation) or independent signals (Hypothesis 3 (H3)). Colocalisation analyses can be performed across all variants sampled in a region, under an assumption of at most one variant implicated per trait. It can also be performed using variants attributed to pairs of credible sets from SuSiE, relaxing the single variant assumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. When evidence of a shared variant is found, the individual SNPs with the highest posterior probability of being that variant can be assessed. With a 95% confidence threshold, these are termed 95% credible SNPs.</p>
<sec id="s2b3a1">
<title>Analysis pipeline</title>
<p>We conducted colocalisation and fine-mapping analysis within an open-access pipeline developed for this study using R (v4.2.2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter">https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter</ext-link>.</p>
<p>Briefly, in this workflow (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), GWAS summary statistics are harmonised across analysed traits for a specified genomic region, including only variants in common between them and available within a reference population. An LD correlation matrix across sampled variants is derived from a reference population using PLINK (v1.90)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Quality control is performed per-dataset prior to univariate fine-mapping analysis. Diagnostic tools provided with <italic>susieR</italic> are applied to test for consistency between the LD matrix and Z-scores from the GWAS and identify variants with a potential ‘allele flip’ (reversed effect estimate encoding) that can impact fine-mapping.</p>
<p>Fine-mapping is performed for each dataset with the <italic>coloc</italic> package <italic>runsusie</italic> function, which wraps around <italic>susie</italic>_<italic>rss</italic> from <italic>susieR</italic> and is configured to facilitate subsequent colocalisation analysis. Sample size (N<sub>eff</sub> for binary traits) is specified as the median for SNPs analysed. Colocalisation analysis can be performed with the coloc functions <italic>coloc.abf</italic> and <italic>coloc.susie</italic> when fine-mapping yields at least one credible set for both traits and otherwise using <italic>coloc.abf</italic> only. Genes located near credible sets from fine-mapping and credible SNPs from colocalisation analyses are identified via Ensembl and <italic>biomaRt</italic> (v2.54.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Analysis parameters can be adjusted by the user in accordance with their needs. Various utilities are included to help interpretation of fine-mapping and colocalisation results, including identification of genes nearby to putatively causal signals, HTML reports to summarise completed analyses, and figures to visualise the results and compare the examined traits.</p>

<sec id="s2b3a2">
<title>Current implementation</title>
<p>In this study, LD correlation matrices were derived from the 1KG European cohort. SNPs flagged for potential allele flip issues in either of the compared traits were removed from the analysis. Fine-mapping was performed with the <italic>susie</italic>_<italic>rss</italic> refine=TRUE option to avoid local maxima during convergence of the algorithm, leaving the other settings to the <italic>runsusie</italic> defaults. Colocalisation analysis was performed using the default priors for <italic>coloc.susie</italic> (P<sub>1</sub>=1×10<sup>−4</sup>, P<sub>2</sub>=1×10<sup>−4</sup>, P<sub>12</sub>=5×10<sup>−6</sup>).</p>
<p>Colocalisation and fine-mapping analyses were performed initially using the genomic blocks defined by LAVA, since these aim to define relatively independent LD partitions across the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. If a 95% credible set could not be identified in one or both traits, we inspected local Manhattan plots for the region to determine whether potentially relevant signals occurred around the region boundaries. The analysis was repeated with a ±10Kb window around the LAVA-defined genomic region if p-values for SNPs at the edge of the block were p&lt;1×10<sup>−4</sup> for both traits and the Manhattan plots were suggestive of a ‘peak’ not represented within the original boundaries.</p>

<p>A total of 605 local genetic correlation analyses were performed across all trait pairs in genomic regions where both traits passed the univariate heritability filtering step after restricting to SNPs sampled in both GWAS (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>; Table S1). The number of loci passing to bivariate analysis varied greatly across trait pairs and was congruent with the genome-wide heritability estimates (and their uncertainty) for each trait, reflecting differences in phenotypic variance explained by measured genetic variants and statistical power for each GWAS (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Univariate fine-mapping and bivariate colocalisation analyses were subsequently performed to test for variants jointly implicated between trait pairs in regions with local genetic correlation P<sub>fdr</sub> &lt;0.05. The ALS and schizophrenia trait pair was additionally examined at Chr6:32.22-32.45Mb because significant genetic correlations were found between ALS and FTD and between schizophrenia and FTD at this locus. The correlation between ALS and schizophrenia at this locus had not been analysed owing to insufficient univariate heritability for ALS after restricting to SNPs in common with the schizophrenia GWAS.</p>
<p>Fine-mapping identified at least one 95% credible set for each of the compared traits for 7 of the 27 comparisons performed (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), and for one trait only in a further 5 (see Table S2; Table S3). This analysis suggested two credible sets for schizophrenia in the Chr12:56.99-58.75Mb locus, for AD in Chr6:32.45-32.54Mb, and (only when harmonised to SNPs in common with the ALS GWAS) for FTD in Chr6:32.22-32.45Mb (see Table S3).</p>

<p>Colocalisation analyses performed across fine-mapping credible sets and across all SNPs in a region generally gave support to the equivalent hypothesis (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; Table S2). Moreover, comparisons suggesting a signal was present in one trait only were largely concordant with the identification of fine-mapping credible sets in only that trait (Table S2). Figure S2 compares per-SNP p-values across trait pairs for comparisons with evidence of a relevant signal in both traits. Figure S3 shows patterns of LD across SNPs assigned to credible sets for these analyses.</p>
<p>Strong evidence was found for a shared variant between ALS and AD within the <italic>HLA</italic> region (Posterior probability of shared variant = 0.9; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The 95% credible SNPs for this association were distributed around the <italic>MTCO3P1</italic> pseudogene and rs9275477, the lead genome-wide significant SNP from the ALS GWAS in this region, had the highest posterior probability of being implicated in both traits.

<p>The other comparisons that found fine-mapping credible sets in both traits suggested that overlaps from the correlation analysis were driven by distinct causal variants (see <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>,Table S2).</p>
<p>Univariate fine-mapping of PD and schizophrenia at Chr17:43.46-44.87Mb found large credible sets spanning many genes, including <italic>MAPT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> and <italic>CRHR1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> which have been previously implicated in the traits we have analysed. These expansive credible sets reflect the strong LD in the region and indicate a signal that is difficult to localise (see Figure S3(F); Table S3). The colocalisation analysis suggested independent variants for each trait despite many SNPs overlapping across their respective credible sets (see Figure S3). Sensitivity analysis showed robust support for the two independent variants hypothesis across shared-variant hypothesis priors (Figure S4).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We examined genetic overlaps between the neuropsychiatric conditions Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia. Associated genomic regions between pairs of traits were identified with local genetic correlation analysis and further analysed with statistical fine-mapping and colocalisation techniques.</p>
<p>Significant correlations were most frequent across genomic blocks within the <italic>HLA</italic> region, implicating each of the studied traits in at least one comparison. Several associated regions contained genes with known relevance for the traits studied, such as <italic>KIF5A, MAPT</italic>, and <italic>CRHR1</italic>. Colocalisation analysis found strong evidence for a shared genetic variant between ALS and AD in the Chr6:32.62-32.68Mb locus within HLA, while the other colocalisation analyses suggested causal signals distinct across traits, for one trait only, or for neither trait.</p>
<p>The tendency for association between traits around the <italic>HLA</italic> region is reasonable, since this is a known hotspot for pleiotropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. HLA is particularly known for its role in immune response and it is implicated in various types of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Mounting evidence has linked HLA and associated genetic variation to the traits we have analysed, and mechanisms underlying these associations are beginning to be understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. For instance, AD is associated with variants around the <italic>HLA-DQA1</italic> and <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic> genes and several SNPs in the non-coding region between them have been shown to modulate their expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Notably, one of the SNPs with a demonstrated regulatory role, rs9271247, had the highest probability of being causal for AD across the 95% credible set identified in the fine-mapping of the region.</p>
<p>Variants showing evidence for colocalisation between AD and ALS were distributed around the <italic>MTCO3P1</italic> pseudogene in the HLA class II non-coding region between <italic>HLA</italic>-<italic>DQB1</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQB2. MTCO3P1</italic> has been previously identified as one of the most pleiotropic genes in the GWAS catalog<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Previous studies have suggested the relevance of this region in both traits. <italic>HLA</italic>-<italic>DQB1</italic> and <italic>HLA-DQB2</italic> are both upregulated in the spinal cord of people with ALS, alongside other genes implicated in various immunological processes for antigen processing and inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. <italic>HLA</italic> class II complexes, and their subcomponents, have been identified as upregulated in multiple brain regions of people with AD, using both gene and protein expression techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our analysis of this region gave stronger support for colocalisation between the ALS and AD GWAS than a previous study. The previous study defined a 100Kb window around the lead genome-wide significant SNP from the ALS GWAS, rs9275477, and found ∼0.50 posterior probability for each of the shared and two independent variant(s) hypotheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The difference between these studies reflects differences in the processing of GWAS data; in this study all summary statistics underwent quality control to ensure only high-quality variants were retained.</p>
<p>More broadly, our analyses suggest that regions with a strong genetic correlation between the five traits studied often result from adjacent but trait-specific signals, likely reflecting overlaps between LD blocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Correlations also occurred in regions with weaker overall GWAS associations (see <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), where fine-mapping and colocalisation analyses did not suggest causal associations in one or either trait. Such patterns likely reflect a shared polygenic trend across the region, rather than associations attributable to discrete variants. Accordingly, other approaches may be better suited for identifying regions containing genetic variation jointly causal across diseases, including the traditional approach of testing regions around overlapping genome-wide significant variants.</p>
<p>This study has used gold-standard statistical tools to examine genetic relationships between traits. The local genetic correlation analysis approach enabled targeted investigation of genomic regions which appear to overlap between traits. The application of colocalisation analysis alongside a prior univariate fine-mapping step allowed for associations to be tested without conflating independent but nearby signals under the single-variant assumption of colocalisation analysis across all variants sampled in a region.</p>
<p>The study is not without limitation. We necessarily used the 1KG European reference population to estimate LD between SNPs. Fine-mapping is ideally performed with an LD matrix from the GWAS sample and is sensitive to misspecification when inconsistencies in LD occur between the reference and GWAS cohorts. Use of a reference population is not uncommon, and diagnostic tools available within the <italic>susieR</italic> package allow testing for inconsistencies between the reference and GWAS samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. We accordingly implemented these tools centrally into our workflow and determined that the LD matrices from the 1KG reference were suitable for the data (estimates of Z-score and LD consistency are available in Table S3). Nevertheless, repeating this study in under-represented populations would be an important future step to validate our findings.</p>
<p>We employed statistical methods to identify and analyse genomic regions containing variants which might be jointly implicated across traits. These approaches provide useful associations between traits identified from large-scale genomic datasets. However, they alone are not sufficient for translation into clinical practice. Future studies should aim to extend any associations found by integrating functional and multi-omics datasets to gain mechanistic insights into observed trends and facilitate treatment discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The fine-mapping and colocalisation analysis pipeline we have used is available as an open-access resource on GitHub to facilitate the application of these methods in future studies: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter">https://github.com/ThomasPSpargo/COLOC-reporter</ext-link>. Specified genomic regions can be readily analysed by providing GWAS summary statistics for binary or quantitative traits of interest and a population-appropriate reference dataset for estimation of LD. The pipeline returns resources including detailed reports that overview the analyses performed.</p>

<p>This paper presents a <bold>valuable</bold> pipeline based on state-of-the-art analytical software that was used to study genetic pleiotropy between neuropsychiatric disorders. The presented evidence supporting the claims is <bold>solid</bold>, although the paper is lacking an appropriate comparison to previously published methods as well as a more detailed exploration of some of the findings. The created pipeline is made publicly available and can thus be used by researchers from diverse fields to study different combinations of diseases and traits.</p>

<p>The authors investigate pleiotropy in the genetic loci previously associated to a range of neuropsychiatric disorders: Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia. The local statistical fine-mapping and variant colocalisation approaches they use have the potential to uncover not only shared loci but also shared causal variants between these disorders. There is existing literature describing the pleiotropy between ALS and these other disorders but here the authors apply state of the art, local genetic correlation approaches to further refine any relationships.</p>
<p>Complex disease and GWAS is not my area of expertise but the authors managed to present their methods and results in a clear, easy to follow manner. Their results statistically support several correlations between the disorders and, for ALS and AD, a shared variant in the vicinity of the lead SNP from the original ALS GWAS. Such findings could have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of such disorders and eventually the possibility of managing and treating them.</p>
<p>The authors have built a useful pipeline that plugs together all the gold-standard, existing software to perform this analysis and made it openly available which is commendable. However, there is little discussion of what software is available to perform global and local correlation analysis and, if there are multiple tools available, why they consider the ones they selected to be the gold-standard.</p>
<p>There is some mention of previous findings of genetic pleiotropy between ALS and these other disorders in the introduction, and discussion of their improved ALS-AD evidence relative to previous work. However, detailed comparisons of their other correlations to what was described before for the same pairs of disorders (if any) is missing. Adding this would strengthen the impact of this paper.</p>
<p>Finally, being new to this approach I found the abstract a little confusing. Initially, the shared causal variant between ALS and AD is mentioned but immediately in the following sentence they describe how their study &quot;suggested that disease- implicated variants in these loci often differ between traits&quot;. After reading the whole paper I understood that the ALS-AD shared variant was the exception but it may be best to restructure this part of the abstract. Additionally, in the abstract the authors state that different variants &quot;suggests the role of distinct mechanisms across diseases despite shared loci&quot;. Is it not possible that different variants in the same regulatory region or protein-coding parts of a gene could be having the same effect and mechanism? Or does the methodology to establish that different variants are involved automatically mean that the variants are too distant for this to be possible?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Spargo and colleagues present an analysis of the shared genetic architectures of Schizoprehnia and several late-onset neurological disorders. In contrast to many polygenic traits for which global genetic correlation estimates are substantial, global genetic correlation estimates for neurological conditions are relatively small, likely for several reasons. One is that assortative mating, which will spuriously inflate genetic correlation estimates, is likely to be less salient for late-onset conditions. Another, which the authors explore in the current manuscript, is that some loci affecting two or more conditions (i.e., pleiotropic loci) may have effects in opposite directions, or shared loci are sparse, such that the global genetic correlation signal washes out.</p>
<p>The authors apply a local genetic correlation approach that assesses the presence and direction of pleiotropy in much smaller spatial windows across the genome. Then, within regions evidencing local genetic correlations for a given trait pair, they apply fine-mapping and colocalization methods to attempt to differentiate between two scenarios: that the two traits share the same causal variant in the region or that distinct loci within the region influence the traits. Interestingly, the authors only discover one instance of the former: an SNP in the HLA region appearing to confer risk for both AD and ALS. This is in contrast to six regions with distinct causal loci, and twenty regions with no clear shared loci.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors have published their analysis pipeline such that other researchers might easily apply the same techniques to other collections of traits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- All such analysis pipelines involve many decision points where there is often no clear correct option. Nonetheless, the authors clearly present their reasoning behind each such decision.</p>
<p>
- The authors have published their analytic pipeline such that future researchers might easily replicate and extend their findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- The majority of regions display no clear candidate causal variants for the traits, whether shared or distinct. Further, despite the potential of local genetic correlation analysis to identify regions with effects in opposing directions, all of the regions for causal variants were identified for both traits evidenced positive correlations. The reasons for this aren't clear and the authors would do well to explore this in greater detail.</p>
<p>
- The authors very briefly discuss how their findings differ from previous analyses because of their strict inclusion for &quot;high-quality&quot; variants. This might be the case, but the authors do not attempt to demonstrate this via simulation or otherwise, making it difficult to evaluate their explanation.</p>
