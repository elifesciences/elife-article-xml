<title>Abstract</title><p>Sex-biased genes offer insights into the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Sex-biased genes, especially those with male bias, show elevated evolutionary rates of protein sequences driving by positive selection and relaxed purifying selection in animals. Although rapid sequence evolution of sex-biased genes and evolutionary forces have been investigated in animals and brown algas, less is known about them in dioecious angiosperms. In this study, we separately compared the expression of sex-biased gene between female and male flower buds and between female and male mature flowers in dioecious <italic>Trichosanthes pilosa</italic> (Cucurbitaceae). In floral buds, sex-biased gene expression was pervasive, and had significantly different roles on sexual dimorphism such as physiology. We observed higher rates of sequence evolution for male-biased genes in floral buds compared to female-biased and unbiased genes. Male-biased genes under positive selection were mainly related to abiotic and biotic stress, suggesting that high evolutionary rates are driven by adaptive evolution. Additionally, relaxed purifying selection may contribute to accelerated evolution in male-biased genes generated by gene duplication. Our findings, for the first time in dioecious angiosperms, suggest evident rapid evolution of male-biased genes, advance our understanding of the patterns and forces driving the evolution of sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sexual dimorphism presents different morphological, ecological and physiological traits in gonochoristic animals and dioecious plants, despite male and female individuals sharing the same genome except for sex chromosomes (or sex-determining loci) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>). Such sexual dimorphisms usually arise from differential expression of genes in both sexes, i.e., sex-biased genes (including sex-specific genes exclusively in one sex) that are located on autosomal chromosomes and sex chromosomes/or sex-determining regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Charlesworth, 2018</xref>). Recently, some studies have begun to explore the strength and impact of evolutionary forces that shape different sexually dimorphic traits through sex-biased gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Rowe et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies revealed that sex-biased gene expressions have facilitated the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in many animals. However, the extent to which this occurs varies greatly among taxa, tissues, and developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Khodursky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hsu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lichilin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Toubiana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Djordjevic et al., 2022</xref>). Unlike most animals, the vast majority (~90%) of angiosperms are hermaphroditic plants, while only a small fraction (~5%) are dioecious plants in which individuals have exclusively male or female reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Renner, 2014</xref>). Most dioecious plants do not possess heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Furthermore, sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants is less common and less conspicuous than that in almost animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Barrett and Hough, 2013</xref>). Hence, the study of sex-biased gene expression is of great interest to plant evolutionary biologists, as it is essential to understand the evolution of sexual dimorphism in dioecious plants.</p>
<p>A common pattern that has emerged from previous studies is that sex-biased genes, particularly male-biased genes, tend to evolve rapidly in protein sequence (the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, <italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) compared to unbiased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>). The rapid evolution of male-biased genes was first observed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang and Parsch, 2005</xref>) and has been supported by recent investigations in a wider range of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Pro-schel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mank et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Papa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Catalan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Toubiana et al., 2021</xref>). In recent years, there have been growing studies on the expression dynamics and molecular evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes in flowering plants, including <italic>Silene latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>Salix viminalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darolti et al., 2018</xref>), <italic>Mercurialis annua</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cossard et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Populus balsamifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>), and <italic>Leucadendron</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>). However, despite such advances, the molecular evolution pattern of sex-biased genes in plants remains inconsistent among the studied plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Muyle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Veltsos, 2019</xref>). In dioecious plants such as <italic>Mercurialis annua</italic> and <italic>Leucadendron</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cossard et al., (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Scharmann et al., (2021)</xref> found no significant differences in evolutionary rates of proteins among female-biased, male-biased and unbiased genes, although the expression of sex-biased genes was highly different from unbiased genes in leaves. Similar patterns have also been reported in dioecious <italic>Populus balsamifera</italic>, where evolutionary rates of male-biased, female-biased and unbiased genes did not differ in reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>). However, in the dioecious plant <italic>Salix viminalis</italic>, male-biased genes have significantly lower evolutionary rates of proteins than female-biased and unbiased genes in catkin tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darolti et al., 2018</xref>). To our knowledge, only five studies have investigated the expression differences and protein evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes in dioecious angiosperms. Moreover, these studies only compared gene expression in vegetative vs. vegetative tissues and vegetative vs. reproductive tissues. Therefore, more studies and taxa are needed to explore the common patterns of sequence evolution in sex-biased genes, with more focus on comparing sex-biased gene expression in reproductive vs. reproductive tissues, e.g., different floral development stages in dioecious angiosperms.</p>
<p>Evolutionary dynamic analyses indicate that different evolutionary forces impact the rate of sequence evolution of sex-biased genes. These forces include positive selection, which promotes the spread and adaptive fixation of beneficial alleles; sexual selection, which results from male-male competition or female choice; and relaxed purifying selection, which reduces the removal of deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dapper and Wade, 2020</xref>). For example, in animal systems, particularly in <italic>Drosophia</italic>, the elevated sequence divergence rates of male-biased genes have often been interpreted as the signature of positive selection due to adaptive evolution, suggesting that sexual selection is the primary evolutionary forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Pro-schel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Assis et al., 2012</xref>). However, studies in plants have rarely reported elevated rates of sex-biased genes, except for brown alga, in which female-biased and/or male-biased genes exhibiting higher evolutionary rates than unbiased genes suggests that rapid evolution is partly driven by adaptive evolution or sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lipinska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cossard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hatchett et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>An alternative explanation for the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes is a relaxation of purifying selection due to reduced constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lahti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dapper and Wade, 2020</xref>). In the model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, pollen genes were found to be evolving faster than sporophyte-specific genes due to relaxed purifying selection associated with the transition from outcrossing to selfing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>). These trends were recently confirmed in <italic>Arabis alpina</italic>, which exhibits mating system variation across its distribution, suggesting that the efficacy of purifying selection on male gametophyte-expressed genes was significantly weaker in inbred populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Gutierrez-Valencia et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these findings in plants reinforce the idea that both adaptive (e.g., positive selection, sexual selection) and non-adaptive (e.g., relaxed selection) evolutionary processes differentially impact the sequence evolution of sex-biased genes. Hence, investigating the potential contribution of selection forces to the emergence of specific evolutionary patterns of sex-biased genes within a focal species is of great interest.</p>
<p>In the family Cucurbitaceae, there are about 96 genera and 1,000 species, about 50% of species are dioecious, and 50% are monoecious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Schaefer and Renner, 2011</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of Cucurbitaceae suggest that dioecy is the ancestral state of the family, but transitions frequently to monoecy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Trichosanthes pilosa</italic> (2n = 22, Cucurbitaceae) is mainly distributed from Southwest, Southeast China to Japan, New Guinea and Western Australia. It was suggested to have originated in the late Miocene (c.13 Ma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2015</xref>). <italic>Trichosanthes pilosa</italic> (synonym: <italic>T. ovigera</italic>) is a perennial dioecious vine that reproduces sexually and possesses a pair of heteromorphic sex chromosomes XX/XY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ming et al., 2011</xref>). The species exhibits strong sexual dimorphism in the floral morphological structures and the life-history traits, such as racemose male flower and solitary female flower (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), early-flowering, caducous male flower and late-flowering, long-lived female flower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand the evolution of sex-biased genes in dioecious <italic>Trichosanthes pilosa</italic>, we collected floral buds and mature flowers tissues from male and female individuals and characterized their expression profiles using Illumina RNA sequencing. Our primary objectives are to 1) compare expression divergences between males and females at two floral developmental stages; 2) explore whether there are differences in the evolutionary rates of proteins among female-biased, male-biased and unbiased genes; and if so, 3) determine the main selective forces that contribute to the differentiation of sequence evolution rates among gene categories.</p>

<title>Transcriptome sequencing, <italic>de novo</italic> assembly and annotation</title>
<p>Using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing, we sequenced 12 floral buds and mature flower tissues from females and males of dioecious <italic>T. pilosa</italic> and generated a total of nearly 276 million clean reads (Table S1). We then performed <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of transcripts from all the clean reads, followed by clustering and filtering analysis, resulting in 59,051 unigenes (Fig. S1A). To evaluate the quality of the assembled unigenes, we compared them against protein databases such as NR, KEGG, Swissport, PFAM, and GO using BLASTP and nucleotide database NT using BLASTN (Table S2). The e-value distribution of the best hits in NR database suggested that 47,241 unigenes (80%) had strong homology, with an e-value smaller than 1.0e-15 (Fig. S1B). The majority of unigenes were annotated by homologs in other species of Cucurbitaceae, such as <italic>Momordica charantia</italic>, <italic>Cucumis melo</italic>, <italic>Cucurbita pepo</italic>, <italic>Cucurbita moschata</italic> and <italic>Cucurbita maxima</italic> (Fig. S1C). Furthermore, we used BUSCO assessments based on embryophyta_odb9 database, which showed the completeness of the reference transcriptome at 78.8% (Table S2). Overall, our analyses suggested that we have generated high-quality reference transcriptomes.</p>

<title>Expression characteristics of sex-biased genes</title>
<p>We mapped the RNA-Seq reads of floral buds and mature flowers onto the reference transcriptome in dioecious <italic>T. pilosa</italic>, which resulted in approximately 75% read mappings per sample (Table S3). In floral buds, we identified 5,096 (9.50%) female-biased genes and 4,214 (7.86%) male-biased genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In contrast, only 380 (0.70%) female-biased genes and 233 (0.43%) male-biased genes were detected in mature flowers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Using hierarchical clustering analysis, we evaluated different levels of gene expression across sexes and tissues, revealing strong sexual dimorphism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the number of sex-biased genes in floral buds was approximately 15 times higher than in mature flowers, indicating that sex-biased genes associated with sex differentiation and sexually dimorphic traits are predominantly expressed in floral buds. We also analyzed sex-specific genes that were exclusively expressed in floral buds and mature flowers of one sex. In floral buds, we found 253 out of 5,096 (4.96%) female-specific genes and 465 out of 4,214 (11.03%) male-specific genes. However, in mature flowers, we only identified 26 out of 380 (6.84%) female-specific genes and 52 out 233 (22.32%) male-specific genes.</p>

<title>Tissue-biased gene expression</title>
<p>We compared the expression levels of transcripts in floral bud tissues and mature flower tissues within each sex to identify genes with tissue-biased expression. In male plant, the number of tissue-biased genes in mature flowers was 1,040 higher than that in floral buds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). However, in female plant, the number of tissue-biased genes in mature flowers was only 536 more than that in floral buds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Our results indicated that males had a higher tissue-bias relative to females. We also identified sex-biased genes that were expressed in both types of tissues by comparing tissue-biased genes with male-biased and female-biased genes, respectively. Few of female-biased genes overlapped with tissue-biased genes, accounting for only 85 out of 5,096 (1.67%) in floral buds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>) and 5 out of 380 (1.32%) in mature flowers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, a significant proportion of male-biased genes overlapped with tissue-biased genes, with 1,010 out of 4,214 (23.97%) in floral buds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) and 145 out of 233 (62.23%) in mature flowers (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>In the results of ‘two-ratio’ branch model, the median of ω values in female-biased, male-biased and unbiased genes were 0.227, 0.257 and 0.230 in floral buds, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref> and Table S4). We observed that male-biased genes had a 13.22% and 11.74% higher median than female-biased and unbiased genes in floral buds, respectively. The difference in the distribution of ω values between female-biased versus male-biased genes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0021) and male-biased versus unbiased genes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0051) was statistically significant in Wilcoxon rank sum tests. However, we did not find a significant difference in ω values between female-biased and unbiased genes in floral buds (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.4618). In mature flowers, the median of ω values for female-biased, male-biased, and unbiased genes were 0.269, 0.177 and 0.231, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and Table S4). However, we found that there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of ω values using Wilcoxon rank sum tests for female-biased versus male-biased genes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0556), female-biased versus unbiased genes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0796), and male-biased versus unbiased genes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.3296).</p>
<p>The ‘free-ratio’ branch model yielded interesting results. In floral buds, the median ω values for female-biased, male-biased, and unbiased genes were 0.222, 0.265 and 0.226, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and Table S5). Male-biased genes had a significantly higher median relative to female-biased genes (19.37% higher, Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009) and unbiased genes (17.26% higher, Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0004) in floral buds. However, there was no significant difference in ω values between female-biased and unbiased genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.9862). In mature flowers, the median ω values for female-biased, male-biased, and unbiased genes were 0.300, 0.148 and 0.227, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Table S5). Female-biased and unbiased genes had significantly higher ω values than male-biased (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0101, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0146, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in ω values between female-biased and unbiased genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.2887). Since the number and evolutionary rates of male-biased genes in mature flowers are lower than those in flora buds, we decided to focus on the latter in subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>Evidences and contributions of positive selection and relaxed selection for male-biased genes in floral buds</title>
<p>After comparing the A model and null model, we discovered that 39 out of 343 OGs (11.34%) exhibited strong evidence of having certain sites that evolved under positive selection based on foreground 2b ω value, likelihood ratio tests (LRTs, P &lt; 0.05) and Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) value (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Table S6). As an additional approach, we utilized the aBSREL and BUSTED methods that were implemented in HyPhy v.2.5 software, and detected significant evidence of positive selection. According to our findings, 84 out of 343 OGs (24.49%) were identified to be under episodic positive selection in male-biased genes of floral buds with a site proportion of 0.17%–26.44% based on aBSREL (Table S7). In addition, 69 out of 343 OGs (20.01%) exhibited significant signs of positive selection with the site proportion of 0.28%–32.65% in male-biased genes of floral buds according to BUSTED (Table S8). Among these, a total of 32 OGs (9.30%) were identified through our tests using CodeML, aBSREL and BUSTED (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Relaxed selection may occur when the efficiency of natural selection is dramatically reduced or eliminated at both gene-wide and genome-wide levels. This has been proposed as an explaination for the rapid evolution of sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lahti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mank, 2017</xref>). Using the RELAX model, we conducted an analysis and found that 18 out of 343 OGs (5.23%) showed significant evidence of relaxed selection (K = 0.0184–0.6497) (Table S9). Interestingly, we also observed that 61 out of 343 OGs (17.73%) exhibited significant evidence of intensified positive selection (K = 2.3363–50, ω<sub>2</sub> ≥ 1) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and Table S10), which is consistent with the results obtained from CodeML, aBSREL and BUSTED.</p>
<p>According to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ellegren and Parsch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Catalan et al., 2018</xref>), genes that exhibit sex-biased expression with rapid evolutionary rates tend to display a lower codon bias usage compared to unbiased genes. In our results, we found that male-biased genes in floral buds had a significantly lower median effective number of codons (ENCs) than both female-biased and unbiased genes (Wilcoxon rank sum test, female-biased vs male-biased genes, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001 and male-biased vs unbiased genes, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0123). This suggested that male-biased genes in floral buds exhibit a stronger codon bias usage than both female-biased and unbiased genes (Fig. S3). In summary, our analyses indicated that rapid evolutionary rates of male-biased genes in floral buds were not associated with a reduction in codon usage bias.</p>
<p>To confirm the contributions of positive selection and relaxed selection to rapid rates of male-biased genes in floral buds, we generated three datasets of OGs by excluding different sets of genes. Specifically, we excluded 18 relaxed selective male-biased genes (5.23%), 98 positively selected male-biased genes (28.57%), and 112 male-biased genes (32.65%) under positive and relaxed selection from 343 OGs (Fig. S4). We observed that after excluding relaxed selective male-biased genes, the median (0.264) decreased by 0.34% compared to the median (0.265) of all OGs (Fig. S4A-B). However, after excluding positively selected male-biased genes, the median (0.236) reduced by 11% (Fig. S4A, C) in the results of ‘free-ratio’ branch model. This pattern was consistene in the results of ‘two-ratio’ branch model as well (Fig. S4E-G). Additionally, we analyzed female-biased and unbiased genes that underwent positive and relaxed selection in floral buds (Tables S6-S10). We identified 216 (18.86%) positively selected (Fig. S5A), and 69 (6.03%) relaxed selective female-biased genes from 1,145 OGs (Fig. S5B), respectively. Similarly, we found 436 (18.33%) positively selected (Fig. S6A), and 43 (1.81%) unbiased genes under relaxed selection from 2,378 OGs (Fig. S6B), respectively. Notably, male-biased genes have a higher proportion (10%) of positively selected genes compared to female-biased and unbiased genes. However, relaxed selective male-biased genes have a higher proportion (3.24%) than unbiased genes, but about 0.8% lower than that of female-biased genes. In summary, our analyses suggested that positive selection and relaxed selection likely drove the rapid evolutionary rates of male-biased genes compared to female-biased and unbiased genes in floral buds, but positive selection had an even greater impact.</p>

<title>Functional analysis of sex-biased genes in floral buds</title>
<p>We conducted KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on sex-biased genes in floral buds. Our results showed that 699 genes were female-biased and 358 genes were male-biased, with significant enrichment (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) in 26 and 24 KEGG pathways, respectively (Table S11). In the floral bud stage, we observed that female-biased genes were mainly enriched in metabolic and signaling pathways, such as ribosome, Fatty acid elongation, photosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction (Fig. S7A and Table S11). On the other hand, male-biased genes were significantly enriched in metabolic and signaling pathways, including Inositol phosphate metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, regulation of autophagy, plant hormone signal transduction, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (Fig. S7B and Table S11).</p>
<p>We have also found that certain male-biased genes, which are evolving under positive selection and relaxed selection (Table S12 and S13), were related to abiotic and biotic stress. For instance, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 18 (MAPKKK18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Zhang and Zhang 2022</xref>,), zinc finger CCCH domain-containing protein 20 (C3H20/TZF2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bogamuwa and Jang, 2014</xref>), and heat stress transcription factor B-3 (HSFB3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Scharf et al., 2012</xref>) have been linked to stress. Interestingly, ten male-biased genes with rapid evolutionary rates were associated with anther and pollen development. These genes include LRR receptor-like serine/threonine protein kinase (LRR-RLK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cui et al., 2022</xref>), pollen receptor-like kinase 3 (<italic>PRK3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Muschietti and Wengier, 2018</xref>), autophagy-related protein 18f (<italic>ATG18f</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; Li et al., 2020a), and plant homeodomain (PHD) finger protein 3 (<italic>MALE STERILITY 3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hou et al., 2022</xref>) in floral buds of male plants.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Cucurbitaceae family is an excellent model for studying the evolution of sexual systems of angiosperms, including sex-determination mechanism and sexual dimorphism. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether sex-biased genes exhibited the evidence of rapid evolutionary rates of protein sequences and identify the evolutionary forces responsible for the observed patterns in the dioecious <italic>T. pilosa</italic>. We compared the expression profiles of sex-biased gene between sexes and two tissue types and examined the signatures of rapid sequence evolution for sex-biased genes, as well as the contributions of potential evolutionary forces.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Sex-biased expression in floral buds</title>
<p>Numerous studies have shown that in dioecious plants, male-biased genes tend to outnumber female-biased genes. For instance, insect-pollinated dioecious plants such as <italic>Asparagus officinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Harkess et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Silene latifolia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>), exhibit a higher proportion of male-biased genes, whereas wind-pollinated dioecious plants like <italic>Populus balsamifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>) has twice as many female-biased genes than male-biased genes. These differences in these studies could be partly attributed to the impact of sexual selection on secondary sexual traits in insect-pollinated dioecious plants, as opposed to wind-pollinated ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Delph and Herlihy, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Muyle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to the above studies, our findings revealed that the number of female-biased genes in floral buds of the night-flowering, insect-pollinated dioecious plant <italic>Trichosanthes pilosa</italic> exceeded that of male-biased genes by 882. This excess of female-biased expression could be due to lower energy consumption needs and reduced chemical defense capability against herbivores in short-lived male flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, functional enrichment analysis in chemical defense pathways such as terpenoid backbone and diterpenoid biosynthesis, indicated that female floral buds had more expressed genes and were better equipped to defend against herbivores compared to male floral buds (Fig. S7A and Table S11). Additionally, our enrichment analysis showed that the photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism pathways were more active in female floral buds compared to male floral buds (Fig. S7A and Table S11), enabling them to acquire more resources such as carbon for fruit and seed production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Delph,1999</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified functional enrichments in Toll-like receptor signaling, NF-kappa B signaling, and Inositol phosphate metabolism pathways in male floral buds (Fig. S7B, Tables S11 and S12). These findings suggest that male floral buds are better adaptated to biotic and abiotic environments. Moreover, the enrichment in regulation of autophagy pathways could be associated with the senescence for male floral buds (Table S14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Liu and Bassham, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Li et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed that homologous genes of two male-biased genes (Table S14) that control the raceme inflorescence development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Teo et al., 2014</xref>) were highly expressed in floral buds. This suggests that sex-biased genes, rather than sex-specific genes, are responsible for dimorphic traits of inflorescence. In short, these results indicate that changes in sex-biased genes expression play different roles on sexual dimorphism in physiological and morphological traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dawson and Geber, 1999</xref>).</p>

<title>Rapid Evolution of male-biased genes in floral buds</title>
<p>It has been observed that, in most animals, sex-biased genes, particularly those biased towards males, often exhibit more rapid evolutionary rates than unbiased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Parsch and Ellegren, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grath and Parsch, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Toubiana et al., 2021</xref>). However, in dioecious angiosperms, no evidence of rapid evolution in sex-biased genes relative to unbiased genes has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Zemp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Darolti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cossard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Scharmann et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, our findings indicated that male-biased genes exhibited rapid evolutionary rates than both female-biased and unbiased genes in floral buds of dioecious <italic>T. pilosa.</italic> We proposed that positive selection and relaxed purifying selection may be responsible for the rapid sequence evolution of male-biased genes.</p>
<p>After analyzing the data, we found that around 28.57% (98 genes) of male-biased genes have undergone positive selection. Additionally, we observed that the proportion of male-biased genes under positive selection was about 10% higher than that of female-biased and unbiased genes. Furthermore, we discovered that some male-biased genes under positive selection were linked to abiotic and biotic stress responses (Table S12). Our findings are consistent with studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Ectocarpus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zhang and Parsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lipinska et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that adaptive evolution is one of the primary evolutionary forces for rapid evolutionary rates. Notably, we identified several male-biased genes under positive selection that are functionally related to early flowering (<italic>phyB</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Stephenson and Bertin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Forrest, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hajdu et al., 2015</xref>) and pollen development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Skogsmyr and Lankinen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Williams and Reese, 2019</xref>) (Tables S12-S14). These findings indicate that a small fraction of male-biased genes may experience adaptive evolution due to sexual selection, driven by male-male competition.</p>
<p>Alternatively, relaxed constraints could contribute to the rapid evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes through three key characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dapper and Wade, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>). First, sex-biased genes are often expressed solely in reproductive tissues of one sex (e.g., sex-specific genes), particularly in the haploid phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Immler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beaudry et al., 2020</xref>). Sex-specific selection (e.g., relaxed purifying selection) acting on sex-specific genes could decrease the elimination of deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mank, 2017</xref>), such as pollen-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>) or testes-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gershoni and Pietrokovski, 2014</xref>). However, our results did not reveal male-specific genes that underwent relaxed purifying selection. Second, sex-biased genes are often expressed in few tissues (tissue-specific genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Meisel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>). These genes could evolve under positive selection or relaxed purifying selection due to low pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Congrains et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Whittle et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>). In our results, 343 male-biased genes with faster evolutionary rates relative to female-biased and unbiased genes overlapped with tissue-biased genes in floral buds (27 out of 343, 7.87%) (Fig. S8A). Furthermore, 27 out of 343 male-biased genes (that is, tissue-biased genes) in floral buds overlapped with nine out of 98 (9.18%) male-biased genes under positive selection (Fig. S8B), and one out of 18 (5.56%) male-biased genes under relaxed purifying selection (Fig. S8C). Consistent with male-biased genes in <italic>Fucus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hatchett et al., 2023</xref>), our analyses suggested that elevated evolutionary rates may partly be linked to low pleiotropy. Finally, gene duplication has long been thought to promote functional divergences and phenotypic novelties by relaxing the constraints of purifying selection on the duplicated gene copy early in its history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lynch and Conery, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lynch and Katju, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lahti et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, the progesterone receptor gene family in the human lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Marinić and Lynch, 2020</xref>) and the CYP98A9 clade in Brassicales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) have demonstrated rapid evolution and divergent function due to relaxed purifying selection. In our results, we identified 18 out of 343 (5.25%) male-biased genes that underwent relaxed purifying selection using RELAX model (Table S13). Interestingly, the vast majority of genes under relaxed selection were members of different gene families generated by gene duplication (including whole-genome duplication), such as LOB domain-containing protein 18 (<italic>LBD18</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), WRKY transcription factor 72 (<italic>WRKY72</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and pollen receptor-like kinase 3 (<italic>PRK3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Muschietti and Wengier, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, although reducing codon usage bias could theoretically accelerate evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes by decreasing synonymous substitution rates, our results did not support this idea. In fact, we found that male-biased genes had significantly higher median <italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub> values than female-biased and unbiased genes, both in the ‘free-ratio’ analysis (Fig. S9A, female-biased vs male-biased genes, <italic>P</italic> = 6.444e-12 and male-biased vs unbiased genes, <italic>P</italic> = 4.564e-13) and ‘two-ratio’ branch model (Fig. S9B, female-biased vs. male-biased genes, <italic>P</italic> = 2.2e-16 and male-biased vs. unbiased genes, <italic>P</italic> = 9.421e-08, respectively), indicating higher synonymous substitution rates.</p>
<p>Several species have been observed to exhibit rapid evolutionary rates of sequences on sex chromosome compared to autosomes, which has been related to the evolutionary theories of fast-X or fast-Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Meisel and Connallon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Wright et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Charlesworth et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the quantification of gene expression by bulk RNA-seq technology, relative to single-cell transcriptome analysis, has been shown to potentially obfuscating true signals in the evolution of sex-biased gene expression in complex aggregations of diverse cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Darolti and Mank, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tosto et al., 2023</xref>). However, investigation of these interesting issues related to sex-biased gene evolution in <italic>T. pilosa</italic> can only be conducted when whole genome sequences become available in the near future.</p>

<title>Evolutionary rate analyses</title>
<p>To quantify the evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes, we download published genome datasets for monoecious <italic>Trichosanthes anguina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) and monoecious <italic>Luffa cylindrica</italic> which has a closer phylogenetic relationship with <italic>Trichosanthes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) from CuGenDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, we also download published RNA sequencing reads of floral buds and flowers from CNCB (Accession CRA002313) and NCBI databases (Accession SRR5259239) for dioecious plant <italic>Trichosanthes kirilowii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hu et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>de novo</italic> assembled by previously described methods.</p>
<p>We identified one-to-one OGs using OrthoFinder v.2.3.3 with default parameters from <italic>T. anguina</italic>, <italic>T. pilosa</italic>, <italic>T. kirilowii</italic>, and <italic>Luffa cylindrica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Emms and Kelly, 2019</xref>). Then, we employed TranslatorX with -c 1 -p M -g -b5 n parameters (i.e., the multiple alignment and the trimming using Muscle and GBlocks, respectively), translated nucleotide sequences and back-translated amino acid alignments into nucleotide alignments to ensure codon-to-codon alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abascal et al., 2010</xref>). The remaining gapless alignments (≥100 bp in length) were retained.</p>
<p>To investigate the evolutionary rates of code sequences, we estimated nonsynonymous substitution (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>), synonymous substitution (<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) rates, as well as protein substitution rates (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>/<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>, ω), using two branch models from CodeML package in PAML v.4.9h with the F3x4 codon frequencies (CodonFreq = 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Yang, 2007</xref>). According to the phylogenetic relationships of <italic>Trichosanthes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">de Boer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), we set up tree structure ((<italic>T. anguina</italic>, <italic>T. pilosa</italic>), <italic>T. kirilowii</italic>, <italic>L. cylindrica</italic>) in the control file of CodeML. First, we employed a ‘two-ratio’ branch model (model = 2, Nssites = 0) that assumes the foreground (two dioecious species) has a different ω value from the background (two monoecious species) to estimate and compare the divergences of the foreground. Second, to reduce the potential bias of ω value due to the conflation of two dioecious species, we also implemented a ‘free-ratio’ branch model (model = 1, Nssites = 0), which assumes an independent ω ratio for each branch. Finally, we excluded all OGs with ω &gt; 2, plotted the distribution of ω values and compared the median of ω values in female-biased, male-biased and unbiased orthologous genes of floral buds and mature flowers. All comparisons between sex-biased and unbiased genes were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum test in R software.</p>

<title>Estimation of the strength of natural selection</title>
<p>The rapid evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes may be attributed by positive selection, relaxed selection and lower codon usage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Catalan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dapper and Wade, 2020</xref>). Therefore, we conducted separate analyses using classical branch-site models, the adaptive branch-site random effects likelihood (aBSREL) model, the branch-site unrestricted statistical test for episodic diversification (BUSTED) model, the RELAX model, and the effective number of codons (ENC) in PAML v.4.9h, HyPhy v.2.5 and CodonW v.1.4.2 to distinguish which evolutionary forces are driving the rapid evolutionary rates of sex-biased genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Pond et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if amino acid sites in the foreground, including the <italic>T. pilosa</italic> lineage have undergone positive selection (foreground 2b ω &gt;1) compared with the background for each OGs, we used branch-site model A (model = 2, Nssite = 2, fix_omega = 0, omega = 1.5) and branch-site model null (model = 2, Nssite = 2, fix_omega = 1, omega = 1). We examined the significance of likelihood ratio tests (LRTs, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) to identify positively selected sites between model A and model null by comparing LRTs to the Chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom. We adjusted the LRTs <italic>P</italic> value for multiple comparisons using Benjamini and Hochberg’s (FDR) algorithm. When the <italic>P</italic> value was significant, we used Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) estimates to identify sites with a high posterior probability (pp ≥ 0.95) of being under positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>To detect episodic positive selection at a proportion of sites on the foreground branch, we employed the aBSREL method in the HyPhy v.2.5 packages to compare the fully adaptive model (ω &gt; 1) to the null model that allows no positive selection rate classes by LRTs, which is an improved algorithm of branch-site models in PAML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). For relatively small datasets, such as those with fewer than 10 taxa, the aBSREL method may not have enough power to detect positive selection. Therefore, we also ran the BUSTED method to identify gene-wide evidence of episodic positive selection at least one site on at least one branch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). We set <italic>T. pilosa</italic> as the foreground and assessed the statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) using LRTs with the Holm-Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p>To test the relaxation of selective strength, we utilized the RELAX model in the HyPhy v.2.5 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wertheim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Schrader et al., 2021</xref>). The RELAX model estimates three ω parameters (ω<sub>0</sub> ≤ ω<sub>1</sub> ≤ 1 ≤ ω<sub>2</sub>), and determines the proportion of sites in the test (foreground) and reference (background) branches using a branch-site model. The first two ω classifications indicate that sites have undergone purifying selection, and the third classification indicates that sites have been under positive selection. Additionally, the model introduces a selection intensity parameter (K value) to compare a null model (K = 1) with an alternative model, thereby assessing the the strength of natural selection. When K &gt; 1, it suggests intensified natural selection, when K &lt; 1, indicates relaxed natural selection in the test branch relative to the reference branch. We quantified the statistical confidence of K value (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) using LRTs and the Holm-Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p>To investigate codon usage bias, which refers to the differences in the frequency of occurrence of synonymous codons in coding DNA, we employed CodonW v.1.4.2. This program considers the ENC values from 20 to 61 as a measure of the departure of the genetic codes for a given gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Wright, 1990</xref>), with lower ENC values represent stronger codon usage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Hambuch and Parsch, 2005</xref>). We performed a Wilcoxon rank sum test to determine if there were deviations in ENC values among female-biased, male-biased, and unbiased genes in floral buds.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> paper examines gene expression differences between male and female individuals over the course of flower development in the dioecious angiosperm Trichosantes pilosa. The authors show that male-biased genes evolve faster than female-biased and unbiased genes, which is frequently observed in animals but this is the first report of such a pattern in plants. In spite of the limited sample size, the reviewers found the evidence to be mostly <bold>solid</bold> and the methods appropriate for a non-model organism. The resources produced will be used by researchers working in the Cucurbitaceae, and the results obtained advance our understanding of the mechanisms of plant sexual reproduction and its evolutionary implications: as such they will broadly appeal to evolutionary biologists and plant biologists.</p>

<p>The evolution of dioecy in angiosperms has significant implications for plant reproductive efficiency, adaptation, evolutionary potential, and resilience to environmental changes. Dioecy allows for the specialization and division of labor between male and female plants, where each sex can focus on specific aspects of reproduction and allocate resources accordingly. This division of labor creates an opportunity for sexual selection to act and can drive the evolution of sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors investigate sex-biased gene expression patterns in juvenile and mature dioecious flowers to gain insights into the molecular basis of sexual dimorphism. They find that a large proportion of the plant transcriptome is differentially regulated between males and females with the number of sex-biased genes in floral buds being approximately 15 times higher than in mature flowers. The functional analysis of sex-biased genes reveals that chemical defense pathways against herbivores are up-regulated in the female buds along with genes involved in the acquisition of resources such as carbon for fruit and seed production, whereas male buds are enriched in genes related to signaling, inflorescence development and senescence of male flowers. Furthermore, the authors implement sophisticated maximum likelihood methods to understand the forces driving the evolution of sex-biased genes. They highlight the influence of positive and relaxed purifying selection on the evolution of male-biased genes, which show significantly higher rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions than female or unbiased genes. This is the first report (to my knowledge) highlighting the occurrence of this pattern in plants. Overall, this study provides important insights into the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism and the evolution of reproductive genes in Cucurbitaceae.</p>
<p>There are, however, parts of the manuscript that are not clearly described or could be otherwise improved.</p>
<p>- The number of denovo-assembled unigenes seems large and I would like to know how it compares to the number of genes in other Cucurbitaceae species. The presence of alternatively assembled isoforms or assembly artifacts may be still high in the final assembly and inflate the numbers of identified sex-biased genes.</p>
<p>- It is interesting that the majority of sex-biased genes are present in the floral buds but not in the mature flowers. I think this pattern could be explored in more detail, by investigating the expression of male and female sex-biased genes throughout the flower development in the opposite sex. It is also not clear how the expression of the sex-biased genes found in the buds changes when buds and mature flowers are compared within each sex.</p>
<p>- The statistical analysis of evolutionary rates between male-biased, female-biased, and unbiased genes is performed on samples with very different numbers of observations, therefore, a permutation test seems more appropriate here.</p>
<p>- The impact of pleiotropy on the evolutionary rates of male-biased genes is speculative since only two tissue samples (buds and mature flowers) are used. More tissue types need to be included to draw any meaningful conclusions here.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study uses transcriptome sequence from a dioecious plant to compare evolutionary rates between genes with male- and female-biased expression and distinguish between relaxed selection and positive selection as causes for more rapid evolution. These questions have been explored in animals and algae, but few studies have investigated this in dioecious angiosperms, and none have so far identified faster rates of evolution in male-biased genes (though see Hough et al. 2014 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319227111">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1319227111</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The methods are appropriate to the questions asked. Both the sample size and the depth of sequencing are sufficient, and the methods used to estimate evolutionary rates and the strength of selection are appropriate. The data presented are consistent with faster evolution of genes with male-biased expression, due to both positive and relaxed selection.</p>
<p>This is a useful contribution to understanding the effect of sex-biased expression in genetic evolution in plants. It demonstrates the range of variation in evolutionary rates and selective mechanisms, and provides further context to connect these patterns to potential explanatory factors in plant diversity such as the age of sex chromosomes and the developmental trajectories of male and female flowers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The presence of sex chromosomes is a potential confounding factor, since there are different evolutionary expectations for X-linked, Y-linked, and autosomal genes. Attempting to distinguish transcripts on the sex chromosomes from autosomal transcripts could provide additional insight into the relative contributions of positive and relaxed selection.</p>

<p>The potential for sexual selection and the extent of sexual dimorphism in gene expression have been studied in great detail in animals, but hardly examined in plants so far. In this context, the study by Zhao, Zhou et al. al represents a welcome addition to the literature.</p>
<p>Relative to the previous studies in Angiosperms, the dataset is interesting in that it focuses on reproductive rather than somatic tissues (which makes sense to investigate sexual selection), and includes more than a single developmental stage (buds + mature flowers).</p>
<p>The main limitation of the study is the very low number of samples analyzed, with only three replicate individuals per sex (i.e. the whole study is built on six individuals only). This provides low power to detect differential expression. Along the same line, only three species were used to evaluate the rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions, which also represents a very limited dataset, in particular when trying to fit parameter-rich models such as those implemented here.</p>
<p>A third limitation relates to the absence of a reference genome for the species, making the use of a de novo transcriptome assembly necessary, which is likely to lead to a large number of incorrectly assembled transcripts. Of course, the production of a reference transcriptome in this non-model species is already a useful resource, but this point should at least be acknowledged somewhere in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Each of these shortcomings is relatively important, and together they strongly limit the scope of the conclusions that can be made, and they should at least be acknowledged more prominently. The study is valuable in spite of these limitations and the topic remains grossly understudied, so I think the study will be of interest to researchers in the field, and hopefully inspire further, more comprehensive analyses.</p>
