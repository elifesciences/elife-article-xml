<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Human-specific cognitive abilities depend on information processing in the cerebral cortex, where the neurons are significantly larger and their processes longer and sparser compared to rodents. We found that, in synaptically connected layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (L2/3 PCs), the delay in signal propagation from soma to soma is similar in humans and rodents. To compensate for the longer processes of neurons, membrane potential changes in human axons and/or dendrites must propagate faster. Dual somato-dendritic and somato-axonal patch recordings show that the propagation speed of action potentials (APs) is similar in human and rat axons, but the forward propagation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and the backward propagation of APs are 26 and 47% faster in human dendrites, respectively. Accurate biophysical models of human and rat L2/3 PCs, combined with pharmacological manipulations of membrane properties, have shown that various factors enhance EPSP propagation in humans; the key factor is the large conductance load imposed by the large basal dendritic tree in humans, the key factor responsible for the accelerated signal propagation in human cortical dendrites. Larger dendritic diameter in humans as well as differences in cable and ion channel properties, also contribute to the enhancement of signal propagation in human L2/3 dendrites.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The human neocortex is thought to be one of the most complex biological structures yet most of our knowledge regarding the properties of individual cortical neurons and their synapses is based on experiments performed in model organisms. Recent findings in human specimens indicated the emergence of new cell types in the human neocortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Ballesteros Yáñez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boldog et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Oberheim et al., 2009</xref>) and species related differences in transmitter release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Molnár et al., 2016</xref>), regenerative dendritic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>), ion channel composition of the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>), temporal dynamics of synaptic potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>) and activity patterns of the microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Komlósi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Szegedi et al., 2016</xref>). Pioneering experiments indicate that human dendrites could evolve in ways favoring mechanisms not yet found in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>) and might contribute to the apparent efficacy of human cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Goriounova et al., 2018</xref>). Functional differences are accompanied by a divergence in morphological features, ranging from general alterations in the thickness of cortical layers to increasing complexity in anatomical properties of classical cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>). Human pyramidal cells with larger and more extensively branching dendritic trees have an opportunity to receive a higher number of synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Benavides-Piccione et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Loomba et al., 2022</xref>). This, when combined with the increased morphological complexity, endows human cortical neurons with enhanced computational and encoding capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the increase in size of dendrites and axons might come with a cost of longer signal propagation times of both synaptic potentials in dendrites (larger dendritic delay) as well as action potentials in axons (axonal delay). This will slow down information processing, both within individual cortical neurons as well as in respective cortical circuits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vetter et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, transferring large amounts of information within and between brain regions in a short amount of time, and the capability of the neuronal circuit to respond sufficiently fast to its environment, is an important evolutionary function of neuronal networks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin &amp; Sejnowski, 2003</xref>). Increased cell-to-cell delay will also affect plasticity/learning processes that depend on the timing between the pre- and the post-synaptic action potentials, e.g., the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mechanism. It was therefore suggested that certain scaling morphological rules must be applied so that animals with larger brains can still function adequately in their environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">West et al., 1997</xref>). Is that the case for cortical neurons in human?</p>
<p>We set out in this study to directly measure the speed of signal propagation in both dendrites and axons of individual human and rat L2/3 pyramidal cells and applied experiments-based models to identify cellular and subcellular properties involved in controlling neuron-to-neuron propagation delays. Our integrative experimental and modeling study provides insights into the scaling rules that enable to preserve information processing speed albeit the much larger neurons in the human cortex.</p>

<title>Signal propagation paths and delays in human and rat pyramid to pyramid connections</title>
<p>We followed recent results indicating differences in the density and size of human and mouse supragranular pyramidal cells (PCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg et al., 2021</xref>) in a human-rat setting. As expected, measurements on 3D reconstructions based on randomly selected, electrophysiologically recorded and biocytin filled human (n = 30) and rat (n = 30) L2/3 cortical pyramidal cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>) show significant differences in the horizontal (463.17 ± 119.48 vs. 324.79 ± 80.58 µm, <italic>t</italic> test: P = 1.687 × 10<sup>-6</sup>) and vertical extensions (542.58 ± 146.89 vs. 409.99 ± 102.69 µm, <italic>t</italic> test: P = 0.00013), and in the total dendritic (9054.94 ± 3699.71 vs. 5162.68 ± 1237.71 µm, <italic>t</italic> test: P = 7.203 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and apical dendritic length (4349.76 ± 1638.39 vs. 2592.15 ± 818.26 µm, <italic>t</italic> test: P = 1.638 × 10<sup>-6</sup>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B,C</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the temporal aspects of information propagation in excitatory microcircuits, we performed simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings in synaptically connected L2/3 PCs from acute neocortical slices from rat and human tissues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were measured in response to single action potentials (AP) in presynaptic cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Synaptic latency was calculated as the time difference between the peak of the presynaptic AP and the onset point of the postsynaptic EPSP (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and Methods). We did not find significant differences in synaptic latencies between human and rat PC-to-PC connections (rat: 1.126 ± 0.378 ms, rat: n = 19, human: 1.111 ± 0.306 ms, n = 17, Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.949). Both pre- and postsynaptic PCs were filled with biocytin during recordings allowing for post hoc identification of close appositions between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Frick et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We measured the shortest axonal path lengths linking the presynaptic soma to close appositions on the postsynaptic dendrite (rat: 168.267 ± 49.59 µm, human: 272.22 ± 73.14 µm) and the shortest dendritic path lengths from close appositions found exclusively on dendritic spine heads to the postsynaptic soma (rat: 84.9 ± 18.301 µm, human: 129.48 ± 40.005 µm) in a subset of recordings (rat: n = 6, human: n = 5). Consequently, we found that the minimal intersomatic distance (the sum of the shortest axonal and dendritic paths) in each synaptically connected PC-to- PC pair was significantly smaller in rats compared to humans (rat: 259.7 ± 58.8 µm, human: 402.12 ± 74.757 µm, Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.009, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We did not find significant difference in these paired recordings in synaptic latency (rat: 1.09 ± 0.375 ms, n = 6 from n = 6 rats; human: 1.102 ± 0.408 ms, n = 5 from n = 5 patients; Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.931, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, darker dots). Given that similar synaptic latencies accompany different lengths for signal propagation in the two species, membrane potentials (APs and/or EPSPs) are likely to propagate faster in human PC-to- PC connections.</p>

<title>Direct measurements of signal propagation in PC dendrites and axons</title>
<p>Compensation of longer axonal and dendritic paths must be explained by higher velocity of signal propagation along axons and/or dendrites. We therefore asked whether interspecies differences can be found in axonal and/or dendritic signal propagation in L2/3 PCs.</p>
<p>First, we investigated whether we could find dissimilarities between the two species in the speed of signal propagation along axons of PCs. We whole cell recorded the soma and a distal axon simultaneously, positioning the axonal recording electrode on one of the blebs formed at the cut ends of axons during slice preparation. Somatic current injections were used to trigger APs and the time between somatic and the axonal AP was measured (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref>). We captured two- photon images during electrophysiological recording and measured the length of the axonal path from the somatic to the axonal electrode on image z-stacks. The dataset was restricted to recordings that matched the distances from the soma to axo-dendritic close appositions determined above along the axon of synaptically coupled PC-to-PC connections (rat: n = 8, 268.203 ± 76.149 µm vs. human: n = 9, 281.507 ± 125.681 µm, two sample <italic>t</italic> test: P = 0.799, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The latency between the soma and the axon bleb of the propagating AP peaks was not significantly different between the species (rat: n = 8, 0.333 ± 0.211 ms vs. human: n = 9, 0.327 ± 0.123 ms, two sample <italic>t</italic> test: P = 0.945). The axonal speed of AP propagation was calculated for each cell from the time required from soma to recording site. We found no significant difference in the propagation speed of APs in the axons of rats and humans (rat: n = 8, 0.848 ± 0.291 m/s vs. human: n = 9, 0.851 ± 0.387 m/s, two sample <italic>t</italic>- test: P = 0.282, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Our axonal recordings suggest that there is no significant difference between the two species over the range of distances we investigated, so the lower latencies in the paired recordings may be due to dendritic differences.</p>

<p>We next sought to test rat and human dendritic signal propagation velocity using simultaneous whole cell patch clamp recordings with electrodes placed on the somata and dendritic shafts of PCs. Distances of somatic and dendritic recording locations (rat: 143.078 ± 72.422 µm, n = 46; vs. human: 153.446 ± 57.698 µm, n = 62, Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.175, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) were chosen to be similar in the two species and in range of soma-to-dendrite distances of axo-dendritic close appositions determined above for synaptically coupled PC-to-PC connections. In the first set of experiments, we injected suprathreshold current through the somatic electrode and measured the time difference between the evoked AP peak at the soma and the respective backpropagating AP peak in the dendritic electrode (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E and F</xref>). We found significant difference in the signal propagation time between rat and human PCs (rat: 0.672 ± 0.334 ms, n = 46; vs. human: 0.495 ± 0.229 ms, n = 62, Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.005, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The AP propagation speed was calculated for each cell from the time difference between the somatic and dendritic APs divided by the distance between the two points. We found that the propagation speed was, on average, ∼1.47-fold faster in human (rat: 0.233 ± 0.095 m/s vs. human: 0.344 ± 0.139 m/s, Mann-Whitney test: P = 6.369 × 10<sup>-</sup> <sup>6</sup>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). In a second set of experiments, using the same dual recording configuration, we tested orthodromic or forward propagating signal propagation velocity by injecting short- duration current ramps to simulate EPSP (sEPSP) signals in the dendrites and recorded the resultant subthreshold voltage response in the soma (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These experiments were performed in the same PCs where backpropagating AP velocities were also measured (rat: n = 24, human: n = 24). We found that sEPSP propagation speed was, on average, ∼1.26-fold faster in human (rat: 0.074 ± 0.018 m/s vs. human: 0.093 ± 0.025 m/s, two sample <italic>t</italic> test: P = 0.004; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D</xref>).

<title>Contribution of ion channels of the dendritic membrane to signal propagation velocity</title>
<p>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channel densities were shown to be higher in human compared to rat layer 2/3 PCs and were shown to be instrumental in more depolarized resting membrane potentials and in larger sag potentials in response to hyperpolarization in the human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, modeling predicted that signal delay in dendrites reduces with increased h-conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>). In line with previous studies, human PCs in our dataset had more depolarized resting membrane potential (rat: -70.49 ± 5.78 mV, human: -64.30 ± 7.28 mV, Mann-Whitney U test: P = 7.37× 10<sup>-6</sup>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>) but the average somatic input resistance were not significantly different in the two species (rat: 59.56 ± 21.86 MΩ, n = 46, human: 71.375 ± 65.485 MΩ, n = 62, Mann-Whitney test: P = 0.347, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the correlation found between forward-propagating sEPSP speed and back-propagating AP speed, we performed pharmacological experiments on bAPs (since it is technically less challenging to evoke) to uncover potential contributors to increased dendritic speeds in humans. To test the contribution of h-channels to the elevated signal propagation speed in human dendrites, we performed pharmacological experiments with 20 µM ZD7288, a specific blocker of h-channels. Significant hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential was observed in the human cells but not in the rat neurons (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>) and significantly increased input resistance accompanied drug application in both human and rat neurons (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3C</xref>). Drug administration did not significantly decrease bAP propagation speed in rat PCs (control: 0.163 ± 0.054 m/s, ZD7288: 0.149 ± 0.057 m/s, n = 9, two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and and Tukey HSD (Honestly Significant Difference) post-hoc comparison: P = 0.9, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>) and in human PCs (control: 0.322 ± 0.073 m/s, ZD7288: 0.268 ± 0.066 m/s, n = 8, two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison: P = 0.329, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>). The human dendrites maintained a higher bAP propagation speed in response to h-channel blockage (two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison: P = 0.003). We could not find significant interaction of species and ZD7288 treatment (two-way ANOVA with repeated measures: interaction P=0.358). These results suggest that the species-dependent density difference of HCN channels of pyramidal apical dendrites do not by themselves explain the propagation speed differences between the two species.</p>

<p>Back-propagation of APs is an active process supported by voltage gated ion channels that can initiate regenerative events in the dendrites(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stuart &amp; Sakmann, 1994</xref>). To further investigate the influence of voltage gated ion channels we pharmacologically blocked voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels with tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1µM), voltage gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels with cadmium chloride (CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 µM), and NMDA receptors with (2<italic>R</italic>)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (AP5, 20 µM) simultaneously. Since the blockage of voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels prevent the initiation of APs, we kept the soma of the recorded cells in voltage clamp mode and used a prerecorded template as voltage command through a somatically placed electrode (the so called “simulated spike”) and measured the back propagation of the response to the somatic voltage command at a dendritic recording site in current clamp mode. As expected, the amplitude of the bAPs at the dendritic recording site dropped significantly in human and rat cells respectively (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3D</xref>). The speed of back propagation of membrane potential signals in dendrites with blocked regenerative events by the pharmacological cocktail was significantly reduced in rat samples compared to the drug-free control (rat control: 0.199 ± 0.053 m/s, rat TTX/CdCl<sub>2</sub>/AP5: 0.076 ± 0.03 m/s, two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison: P = 0.024, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2F</xref>), and was significantly lower in human samples as well (human control: 0.395 ± 0.14 m/s, human TTX/CdCl<sub>2</sub>/AP5: 0.184 ± 0.061 m/s, two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison: P = 0.001, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2F</xref>). The human dendrites with blocked action potential generation on average had a higher bAP propagation speed however it was not statistically significant (rat: 0.076 ± 0.03 m/s n = 8, human: 0.184 ± 0.061 m/s n = 8, two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey HSD post-hoc comparison: P = 0.066). We could not find significant interaction of species and drug treatment (two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, interaction: P=0.142). In summary, in the search for factors contributing to higher signal propagation speeds in human pyramidal dendrites compared to rat pyramidal dendrites, ion channels such as voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NMDA channels and the HCN seem to play a minor role in distinguishing the two species.</p>

<title>Specific membrane capacitance</title>
<p>The specific membrane capacitance (C<sub>m</sub>) can influence the time constant of the biological membrane, and it is a key determinant of the propagation of electrical signals. Recent experiments indicated that the C<sub>m</sub> of human L2/3 PCs might be significantly lower compared to rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>) and modeling studies suggested that the decrease in C<sub>m</sub> could lead to increased conduction speed and fewer synapses being able to evoke suprathreshold events in human PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>). However, a separate line of experiments could not detect differences in the C<sub>m</sub> of L5 PCs between humans and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>), or L2/3 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Gooch et al., 2022</xref>) thus, to test whether C<sub>m</sub> is a component in producing elevated signal propagation velocity in human dendrites, we directly measured the C<sub>m</sub> values of human and rat PCs by pulling nucleated patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B</xref>).

<p>Detailed compartmental models were utilized to disassemble the effect of various morphological and cable parameters on the latency and velocity of synaptic potential in human and rat L2/3 dendrites.

The dendritic-to-soma latency ranged between 0.1 - 13 ms in rats (red circles) and 0.01 – 25 ms in human (blue circles). The larger maximal latency in human is expected due to the ∼2-folds longer apical dendrite in humans L2/3 neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>).

<p>We next compared signal propagation in rat and human dendrites, focusing on identical range of dendrite-to-soma distances in which the experiments were performed (27 µm – 289 µm, insets in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Towards this end, we computed the mean EPSP latency and velocity as a function of distance from the soma, averaged across different branches at a given distance from the soma (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>, 6B, lower right and upper right insets). For this experimental range of recordings, EPSP velocity ranged between 0.04 - 0.08 m/s in humans versus 0.03 - 0.05 m/s in rats. EPSP latency ranged between 0.1 - 4.7 ms in humans versus 0.4 - 6.5 ms in rats. These findings demonstrate significantly faster EPSP propagation in humans compared to rats (average latency in humans: 2.45 ± 0.2 ms, n = 5; in rats: 3.3 ± 0.3 ms, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.03. Average velocity in humans: 0.08 ± 0.005 m/s, n = 5; in rats: 0.05 ± 0.006 m/s, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.02. See <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref> and <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>A possible reason for the smaller latency and larger velocity of EPSPs in human apical dendrites is that they have larger diameter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> see also refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agmon-Snir &amp; Segev, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jack et al., 1975</xref>). Theory shows that, for an infinitely long passive cylindrical cable, the velocity of passive signals is not constant. It is fast near their site of origin, converging to a value of 2λ/τ away from their initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agmon-Snir &amp; Segev, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jack et al., 1975</xref>) (λ is the cables’ space constant and τ is its membrane time constant). This means that the latency and velocity of passive signals, when normalized in units of λ/τ, are identical for cylindrical cables with different diameters. This is due to the fact that differences in cable diameter are taken into account when normalizing the physical distance, x, by λ (which is ∝ √𝑑, where <italic>d</italic> is the cable diameter). Hence, if the larger diameter in human dendrites is a key contributor to the enhanced signal velocity in these cells, we expect that the EPSP latency and velocity will converge on similar curves for all cells (rat and human alike) after normalizing the distance in units of λ, and time in units of τ. However, albeit such normalization, the velocity is still larger and the latency is shorter in human (compare insets in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D,E</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>, respectively. In this case, the average latency in humans: 0.16 ± 0.01 τ, n = 5; in rats: 0.22 ± 0.02 τ, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.02. The average velocity in humans: 2.55 ± 0.11 λ/τ, n=5; in rats: 1.73 ± 0.29 λ/τ, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.02).</p>
<p>To summarize: Scaling dendritic distance in units of λ and time in units of τ did not eliminate the statistically significant differences in EPSP latency and velocity between humans and rats. This raises the question: what factor enhances EPSP propagation speed in human dendrites?</p>
<p>One possibility is that differences in boundary conditions for EPSPs travelling from the dendrites towards the soma might explain the enhanced signal propagation in human. Boundary conditions are known to affect the steepness of voltage attenuation along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rall &amp; Rinzel, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Rinzel &amp; Rall, 1974</xref>). But do differences in the boundary condition (“the impedance load”) at the soma affect the speed of EPSPs propagating when travelling from the apical tree towards the soma? Notably, the basal tree in human L2/3 PCs is substantially larger than that of rat (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Quantifying the total membrane area confirms that the basal tree in human is significantly larger than in rats (in humans: 23,621 ± 7,735 µm<sup>2</sup>, n = 5; in rats: 9,127 ± 2,759 µm<sup>2</sup>, n = 4; Mann- Whitney U test: P = 0.02, see <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). Consequently, a larger impedance load (larger “sink”) is expected at the soma in human L2/3 neurons.</p>
<p>To examine the impact of impedance load, we computationally substituted the basal tree of human neurons with the basal tree of rat and <italic>vice versa</italic> (creating “hybrid cells”). This substitution diminished the inter-species differences in latency and velocity (both in the original units and after normalizing the distance and time in units of λ and τ, respectively). Examples of these “hybrid cells” are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G,H</xref>. In these cases, the basal trees of the 5 modeled human neurons (blue dots) and the basal tree of “Rat1”, “Rat2” and “Rat3” (red dots) were all replaced with the basal tree of “Rat4” neuron. This resulted in a significant reduction in EPSP velocity in the human neurons, diminishing the differences in signal latency/velocity between humans and rats (average latency in humans: 3.42 ± 0.5 ms or 0.23 ± 0.03 in units of τ, n = 5; in rats: 3.2 ± 0.2 ms, 0.21 ± 0.01 in units of τ, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.7 for both ms and τ units. Average velocity in humans: 0.06 ± 0.005 m/s or 1.86 ± 0.1 λ/τ, n = 5; in rats: 0.05 ± 0.005 m/s or 1.8 ± 0.1 λ/τ, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.73 for m/s units and P = 0.66 for λ/τ units. See <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 3</xref>). Repeating this procedure for all modeled PCs, but now the basal of any given cell (of both human and rat) was replaced, one-by-one, by the basal tree of all other cells. Again, this confirmed that the significant difference in EPSPs latency between humans and rats consistently diminished and became insignificant in the “hybrid cell” manipulations. More specifically, human basal trees on rat cells accelerate the EPSPs, whereas rat basal trees on human neurons decelerate the EPSPs (Fig S6).</p>
<p>To further demonstrate the effect of switching the basal tree between human and rat neurons (“hybrid cells”) on the EPSPs’ velocity and latency, we depict in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref> the case where the basal tree of “Human1” PC was replaced with the basal tree of “Rat4” (top left) and <italic>vice versa</italic> (lower right). The result (the “latency-gram” of the EPSPs) is depicted in color-code, showing deceleration in the apical tree of the human cell (top left) and acceleration in the rat’s apical tree (lower right) due to these manipulations. Exemplar somatic EPSPs originated at ∼282 µm from the soma in the original cells (black line) and in the respective “hybrid case” (dashed lines) are shown at top right. The deceleration in the case of a human cell with a rat basal tree is shown on the left and the acceleration in the case of a rat cell with a human basal tree is shown on the right. The explanation for the surprising large impact of the impedance load of the basal tree on signal propagation in the apical tree is elaborated in the Discussion.</p>
<p>In addition to morphological features influencing EPSP latency and velocity, the three key passive parameters - specific membrane resistivity (<italic>R<sub>m</sub></italic>), capacitance (<italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic>) and axial resistivity (<italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic>) - affect signal propagation properties in dendrites by altering the cables’ space constant (λ) and membrane time constant (τ). These changes can either enhance or compensate for the increased velocity of signal propagation of human cells, depending on the specific values of these parameters. Thus, we next examined to what extent the cable parameters of the individual PCs studied here influence signal propagation in their respective dendrites. To address this, we fitted the cable parameters for each of the 9 reconstructed PCs individually, based on double-electrodes recordings (soma and dendrite) for each cell. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> shows an exemplar reconstructed human L2/3 PC (Human5) with the locations of the two recording/stimulating electrodes used for this cell. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> top (D-S: dendrite-to-soma direction) shows the case where the step current was injected at the dendrite (cyan). The resultant voltage response is depicted in cyan in the trace below; the model fit is superimposed in dark blue. The opposite (S-to-D) direction is depicted by the next three traces below. This fit enabled a direct estimate of the cable parameters per cell (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We found that R<sub>m</sub> is larger in humans and C<sub>m</sub> is smaller in humans (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C-F</xref> extends the simulations using the fitted (rather than uniform) cable parameters for each cell (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Compared to the uniform case, the differences in EPSP latency and propagation velocity between and within the two species are slightly enhanced (compare <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C,D</xref> to <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A,B</xref>). For the per-cell fit, the latency ranges between 0.1 - 11 ms for rats (red) and 0.1 – 28 ms for humans (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>); the velocity ranges between 0.02 - 0.085 m/s for rats (red) and 0.02 – 0.75 m/s for humans (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). After normalizing the distance by the space and time constants calculated per cell, the differences in both latency (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>) and velocity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>) among individual cells is larger compared with the uniform case (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Importantly, despite this increased variance within species, the differences between humans and rats remain statistically significant, both with and without normalization (average latency in humans: 2.3 ± 0.4 ms, or 0.19 ± 0.03 τ, n = 5; in rats: 3.2 ± 0.6 ms or 0.27 ± 0.05 τ, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.03 for both ms and τ units.

<p>Next, we applied our “hybrid cells” method (as in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> G-I). As a result, the inter-species differences were diminished (average latency in humans: 2.3 ± 0.4 ms, 0.19 ± 0.03 τ, n = 5; in rats: 3.2 ± 0.6 ms, 0.27 ± 0.05 τ, n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.9 for ms units and P = 1.0 τ units. Average velocity for human: 0.08 ± 0.02 m/s, 2.39 ± 0.2 λ/τ, n = 5; rat: 0.05 ± 0.005 m/s, 1.7 ± 0.4 λ/τ n = 4; Mann-Whitney U test: P = 0.2 for m/s and P = 0.8 for λ/τ units.

<p>To rank the impact of the various factors affecting EPSP propagation latency in human and rat neurons, we conducted a comprehensive statistical analysis using two complementary approaches: the generalized linear model (GLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kiebel &amp; Holmes, 2007</xref>) as well as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017</xref>) based on fitting Gradient Tree Boosting model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Friedman, 2002</xref>). We began by fitting a GLM without interaction terms among the factors affecting EPSP latency (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 5</xref>). This enables us to quantify the primary individual factors affecting EPSP propagation. Our analysis revealed the following ranking order: 1) physical distance of synapses from soma had the strongest effect; 2) species differences; 3) conductance load, as demonstrated by our “hybrid cells” manipulation; 4) radii of the apical dendrite, affecting the cables’ space constant, λ; and 5) the specific cable parameters, as revealed when using per-cell fitted parameters versus uniform cable parameters, was minimal. We next performed GLM analysis with interaction terms showing that, as expected, there are significant interactions between the factors affecting EPSP latency (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 6</xref>). To further validate the above ranking while incorporating the interactions between the various factors affecting EPSP latency, we performed a SHAP analysis. Notably, even with interactions included, the ranking of the factors affecting signal propagation are aligned with the results from the analysis based on the GLM without interaction terms (see Fig S13).</p>
<p>We summarize this section by noting that our theoretical efforts enabled the dissection of morphological and electrical parameters that affect differences in EPSPs velocity and latency in human versus rat L2/3 PCs’ dendrites. We first assumed uniform cable properties for all cells modeled (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), showing that the key parameter affecting the enhanced velocity in human neurons is the large increase in conductance load (sink) imposed by the extended basal tree in human PCs. The larger diameter of the apical dendrite in human also contributes, but to a lesser degree, to this effect. Finally, differences in passive cable properties also slightly favor faster signal propagation in humans. Indeed, when the basal tree of human PCs modeled (now with cable parameters fitted per cell) was replaced by the basal tree of rat PCs (and <italic>vice versa</italic>), the interspecies differences diminished – emphasizing again the key impact on signal propagation velocity of the large conductance load at the soma of human L2/3 PCs resulting from the larger basal tree in human PCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Emergence of data concerning conserved and divergent features of different mammalian species in the structure and function of the cerebral cortex suggest fundamental similarity across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">DeFelipe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Galakhova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Herculano-Houzel, 2011</xref>) with a subset of specialized features documented in the human cortex. A number of these specialized properties, like the increase in the size of individual neurons detected early by Ramón y Cajal(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cajal, 1899</xref>), have far reaching functional consequences and here we identified some compensatory mechanisms which, in turn, are based on additional specialized features. In particular, we studied propagation velocity of both forward (axonal) and backward (dendritic) action potential, as well as of EPSPs in human and rat dendrites. Our experimentally-based models showed that the average membrane time constant of the two species is similar (∼11 ms). Yet, EPSPs arising in the apical dendrite at similar distances from the soma have significantly shorter latency in humans. This results primarily from the larger diameter of the apical trunk in humans, but also from the difference in cable properties between the two species.</p>
<p>Detailed compartmental models of 3D reconstructed and biophysically measured L2/3 PCs of human and rat L2/3 PCs enabled us to systematically explore factors affecting EPSPs propagation velocity and latency in apical dendrites of these two species. Since the diameter of the apical dendrite is larger in human, and assuming that all specific cable parameters were identical, a synapse located in the apical tree at a given physical distance from the soma is electrotonically closer (in units λ) to the soma in human cells. Consequently, the latency of the dendritic-to-soma EPSP latency is expected to be shorter in human apical dendrites. This shorter cable distance of the human synapse (at a given physical distance) has an additional consequence. The velocity of the EPSP peak in dendritic cables is not constant; it is faster near the synapse, converging to a constant value of 2λ/τ away from the synapse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agmon-Snir &amp; Segev, 1993</xref>). Therefore, EPSPs that originated at electrotonically closer synapses to the soma fall on the steeper (faster) phase of their velocity curve, implying a shorter latency to the soma. But we found that the key factor affecting the propagation velocity of EPSPs toward the soma is the degree of conductance load (the boundary condition) at the soma. We show that the significantly larger basal tree in human L2/3 cells implies a larger conductance load there and as shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, this enhances EPSP propagation velocity and reduces synaptic latency to the soma (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agmon-Snir &amp; Segev, 1993</xref>). It is important to note that this increased conductance load (increased sink) in human L2/3 neurons (and probably also in other cortical neurons and other neuron types which are larger in human compared to rat) will enhance EPSPs originated also in the basal and not specifically in the apical tree. The intuitive reason for this enhancement is that the large conductance load (the ‘leaky end’ boundary conditions) more effectively ‘steals’ the synaptic (axial) current (like water pouring faster into a large pool). The more mathematical intuition is that the large soma (sink) adds fast time constants to the system (see also the related explanation in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eyal et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional factors that favor accelerated signal propagation in human L2/3 dendrites are differences in respective specific cable parameters between human and rat (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Additional factors that were not fully explored in the present study, such impedance mismatch due to local morphological irregularities at branch points (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>) and due to dendritic spines might also play a role in affecting signal propagation speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Manor et al., 1991</xref>) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>Noteworthy here is that we found that the membrane time constant, τ, is similar in L2/3 PCs of rodents and human implying the preservation of coincidence detection capabilities of dendrites in both species. This is important because coincidence detection in dendrites is a fundamental mechanism for a variety of plasticity mechanisms and computational functions such as directional selectivity, sound localization and expansion of the dynamic range of sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agmon-Snir et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rall, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Roome &amp; Kuhn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wang et al., 2000</xref>) and see review in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hay et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Multifaceted upscaling of properties found in the human microcircuit is usually considered instrumental in functional enrichment. For example, increase in the number of human supragranular pyramidal cell types compared to the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>) might help in separating multiple tasks of parallel processing in cortical circuits in and the increased range of synaptic strength in pyramidal output contributes to increased saliency of individual excitatory cells followed by efficient network pattern generation in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Molnár et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Szegedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>). However, increase in the size and in morphological complexity of individual neurons might not follow a simple bigger is better logic, but instead it is rather a double-edged sword when considering cellular and microcircuit level function(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dalügge &amp; Remy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fişek &amp; Häusser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">London &amp; Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Spruston et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Vetter et al., 2001</xref>). On one hand, additional dendritic length can receive a higher number and a more diverse set of inputs contributing to circuit complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Loomba et al., 2022</xref>) and sophistication of dendritic architecture has been reviewed as the site for elaborate subcellular processing(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deitcher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Galakhova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, signals need to propagate along a longer route through dendritic or axonal trees of increased size. Without compensatory mechanisms, textbook knowledge dictates that longer propagation times and altered waveforms of signals associate with elongated neural processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agmon-Snir &amp; Segev, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Jack et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Laughlin &amp; Sejnowski, 2003</xref>). Our observation that soma-to-soma pyramidal cell synaptic latencies are similar in human and rodent strongly suggest that compensatory mechanisms evolved together with alterations in dendritic structure such as increased thickness of dendritic segments in the human compared to segments equidistant from the soma in the rat. This finding is backed up by earlier experiments showing similar soma-to-soma latencies between presynaptic pyramidal cells and postsynaptic fast spiking interneurons in human and rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Molnár et al., 2016</xref>) and between human and mouse pre-and postsynaptic cells overall in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Campagnola et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it appears that signals connecting pyramid-to-pyramid and pyramid-to-interneuron cell pairs have an evolutionally conserved latency and compensation provided by dendritic structure seems precise. Importantly, based on the datasets available, there is no indication of significant over/under-compensation and acceleration/deceleration of soma-to-soma propagation times.</p>
<p>Precision in monosynaptic latencies across species is instrumental in keeping the timeframe relatively stable for circuit plasticity. Research in animal models laid experimental and theoretical foundations and uncovered bewildering multiplicity of mechanisms explaining the induction and maintenance of plasticity in cortical microcircuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bliss &amp; Collingridge, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Dan &amp; Poo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Debanne et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kullmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Malenka &amp; Bear, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Markram et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, plasticity is understudied in human samples both at the cellular and microcircuit level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chittajallu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mansvelder et al., 2019</xref>). Spike time dependent plasticity (STDP) is based on the relative timing of pre-and postsynaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Caporale &amp; Dan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Feldman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Markram et al., 1997</xref>) and the paramount feature of STDP experiments to date is that minute jitter between pre- and postsynaptic activity results in major changes in synapse strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bi &amp; Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>). Pioneering STDP studies in human neurons showed a wide temporal STDP window with a reversed STDP curve compared to classic results detected in rodent brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bi &amp; Poo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, dendritic L-type voltage-gated calcium channels were found important in human STDP rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>), yet our results indicate that dendritic bAP speed is equally influenced by calcium channels in human and rat. However, the faster bAP propagation found here in human PCs is compatible with the shifted STDP rule switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>) by allowing postsynaptic somatic action potentials to be generated later yet arriving to dendrites at the same time relative to presynaptic spikes. It remains to be established how altered cable properties reported here interact through a dynamic interplay between potentially human specific dendritic ion channel distribution and local dendritic regenerative processes in order to achieve the reversed STDP curve in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beaulieu-Laroche et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dalügge &amp; Remy, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Fişek &amp; Häusser, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to associative plasticity, precision of synaptic delays is crucial in the generation of circuit oscillations and network synchronization. Although all known patterns of local field potentials and behavioral correlates present in the human cortex can be detected in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Buzsáki et al., 2013</xref>), fast oscillations are thought to be especially important in cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Klinzing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Ward, 2003</xref>). Fast population rhythms in the cerebral cortex in the gamma and high gamma range are based on alternating activation of monosynaptically coupled and reciprocally connected pyramidal cells and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Averkin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Buzsáki &amp; Wang, 2012</xref>) and similar mechanisms were proposed for some forms of ripple oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Averkin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Komlósi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>). The relatively small axonal distances and accordingly short axonal AP propagation latencies linking locally connected human PCs and or interneurons found here and earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Campagnola et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Goriounova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Komlósi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>) are compatible with the frequency range of fast oscillations. Brief loop times during sequential reactivation of a subset of closely located neurons participating in fast human rhythms are helped by subcellular placement of PC-to-PC (and PC-to-fast spiking interneuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">2016</xref>) synapses on midrange dendritic segments instead of distal branches and by extremely effective glutamatergic synapses on interneurons triggering postsynaptic spikes in response to unitary input from a PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">2016</xref>) in addition to accelerated human dendritic signal propagation. Indeed, latencies of monosynaptic spike-to-spike coupling in single cell triggered Hebbian assemblies characteristic to the human cortical circuit are compatible with up to ∼200 Hz frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Komlósi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Molnár et al., 2008</xref>). Phasic and sequential firing of interneurons and PCs was reported in vivo during fast oscillations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Van Quyen et al., 2016</xref>) and single cell spiking sequences emerging during human memory formation are replayed during successful memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vaz et al., 2020</xref>) similar to results pioneered in the hippocampus of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nádasdy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Skaggs &amp; McNaughton, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wilson &amp; McNaughton, 1994</xref>). Our results suggest that changes in human dendritic properties contribute to cross species preservation of fast oscillation related cortical function at the local microcircuit level.</p>

<p>Experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of University of Szeged Animal Care and Use Committee (ref. no. XX/897/2018) and of the University of Szeged Ethical Committee and Regional Human Investigation Review Board (ref. 75/2014). For all human tissue material written consent was given by the patients prior to surgery. Human neocortical slices were sectioned from material that had to be removed to gain access for the surgical treatment of deep-brain target (n = 33 female and n = 29 male, aged 49 ± 19.2 years, from the frontal (n = 21), temporal (n = 20), parietal (n = 20) and occipital (n = 1) cortices). Anesthesia was induced with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl (0.03 mg/kg, 1–2 µg/kg, respectively). A bolus dose of propofol (1–2 mg/kg) was administered intravenously. The patients received 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium to facilitate endotracheal intubation. The trachea was intubated, and the patient was ventilated with O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O mixture at a ratio of 1:2. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane at care volume of 1.2–1.5. Following surgical removal, the resected tissue blocks were immediately immersed into a glass container filled with ice-cold solution in the operating theater and transported to the electrophysiology lab. For animal experiments we used the somatosensory cortex of young adults (19–46 days of age, (P) 23.9 ± 4.9) male Wistar rats. Before decapitation animals were anesthetized by inhalation of halothane. 320 µm thick coronal slices were prepared with a vibration blade microtome (Microm HM 650 V; Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). Slices were cut in ice-cold (4°C) cutting solution (in mM) 75 sucrose, 84 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 25 D(+)-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The slices were incubated in 36°C for 30 min, subsequently the solution was changed to (in mM) 130 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 24 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 D(+)-glucose, saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and the slices were kept in it until experimental use. The solution used for recordings had the same composition except that the concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgSO<sub>4</sub> were 3 and 1.5 mM unless it is indicated otherwise. The micropipettes (3–5 MΩ) were filled (in mM) 126 K-gluconate, 4 KCl, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 10 phosphocreatine, and 8 biocytin (pH 7.25; 300 mOsm).</p>

<title>In vitro electrophysiology</title>
<p>Somatic whole-cell recordings were obtained at ∼37°C from simultaneously recorded PC-PC cell pairs visualized by infrared differential interference contrast (DIC) video microscopy at depths 60– 160 µm from the surface of the slice (Zeiss Axio Examiner LSM7; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), 40× water-immersion objective (1.0 NA; Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with Luigs and Neumann Junior micromanipulator system (Luigs and Neumann, Ratingen, Germany) and HEKA EPC 10 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik GmbH, Lambrecht, Germany). Signals were digitalized at 15 kHz and analyzed with custom written scripts in Python. Presynaptic cells were stimulated with a brief suprathreshold current paired pulse (800 pA, 2–3 ms, 50-60 ms separation of the two pulses), derived in 10s interval. The postsynaptic cells were recorded in current-clamp recording, holding current was set to keep the cell’s membrane potential around −50 mV. The experiments were stopped if the series resistance (Rs) exceeded 25 MΩ or changed more than 20%. For the dendritic recordings 20 μM Alexa 594 was added to the internal solution of the somatic pipette and 20 μM Alexa 488 to the internal solution of the dendritic pipette. The PCs were kept in whole cell configuration at least 10 minutes before the axon bleb or dendritic targeted recording started. Then the microscope switched to 2p mode. The fluorescent dyes of the pipette solution were excited at 850 nm wavelength with a femtosecond pulsing Ti:sapphire laser (Mai Tai DeepSee, Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA). The axon blebs and the dendrites were targeted in 2p mode. After the successful seal formation, the imaging was switched off to reduce the phototoxicity in the sample. All the recordings were carried out in current clamp mode. 800ms long square pulses with elevating amplitude (from -110 to 300 pA) were used to evoke APs. In some experiments the same long square injection protocol was repeated at the dendritic/axonal recording site. For measuring the forward propagation of electrical signals in dendrites, we applied either short artificial EPSC-shaped currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Connelly et al., 2016</xref>) or mostly ramp currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Markram &amp; Sakmann, 1994</xref>) through the dendritic pipette. 10 minutes of recording we applied different drugs or finished the recordings. At the end of the recording, we acquired a 2p Z series from the recorded dendrite. Then the pipettes were carefully withdrawn from the cells. The slices went under chemical fixation for further anatomical investigation. Due to the small diameter of the dendrites of L2/3 neurons, the dendritic pipette access resistance was 92.43 ± 34.29 MΩ with 24.8-196.2 MΩ range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Gidon et al., 2020</xref>). We ran a set of computer simulations on our reconstructed neurons (both of human and rat), adding a simulated electrode with variable serial resistance values. We found that, for series resistances ranging from 40-200 MΩ, the effect of the presence of the electrode on the EPSP latencies is negligible (Fig S9.)</p>
<p>The specific membrane capacitance recordings were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gentet et al., 2000</xref>). Briefly, the L2/3 PCs were whole cell patch clamped, and a gentle suction made during slow withdrawal of the pipette. The nucleus of the cells were pulled out and the voltage clamped at -70 mV. -5mV voltage steps (repeated 100 times) were applied and the capacitive transients were measured. A DIC image of the nucleus were made for calculation of the membrane surface with the following equation:

<graphic xlink:href="510270v4_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
Where a is the shorter diameter of the ellipse and b is the longer one. After the recording the nucleus was blown away and the pipette tip was pushed into a sylgard ball until the GΩ seal formed. The - 5 mV voltage steps were applied again to record the residual capacitance of the system. Before the analysis we subtracted the residual capacitance from the transients.</p>
<p>Pharmacological experiments were carried out on PCs during simultaneous somatic and dendritic recordings after 10 minutes of control recording using ACSF with the following drugs: 20 µM 4- (<italic>N</italic>-ethyl-<italic>N</italic>-phenylamino)-1,2 dimethyl-6-(methylamino)pyrimidinium chloride (ZD7288) (Sigma-Aldrich), or 1 µM TTX, 200 µM CdCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 µM AP5.</p>

<title>Post hoc anatomical analysis of recorded cell pairs</title>
<p>After electrophysiological recordings, slices were fixed in a fixative containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 15% picric acid, and 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; pH = 7.4) at 4°C for at least 12 hr. After several washes in 0.1 M PB, slices were cryoprotected in 10% then 20% sucrose solution in 0.1 M PB. Slices were frozen in liquid nitrogen then thawed in PB, embedded in 10% gelatin, and further sectioned into slices of 60 µm in thickness. Sections were incubated in a solution of conjugated avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase (ABC; 1:100; Vector Labs) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH = 7.4) at 4°C overnight. The enzyme reaction was revealed by 3’3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (0.05%) as chromogen and 0.01% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant. Sections were post-fixed with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.1 M PB. After several washes in distilled water, sections were stained in 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated in an ascending series of ethanol. Sections were infiltrated with epoxy resin (Durcupan, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight and embedded on glass slices. 3D light microscopic reconstructions were carried out using the Neurolucida system with a 100× objective. The number of putative synaptic contacts were determined by searching for close appositions of presynaptic axon terminals and postsynaptic dendrites under light microscopy. The distance of the contact sites alongside the branches were measured with Neurolucida. The intersomatic distance was calculated from the branch length from the presynaptic soma to the putative synaptic contact alongside the axon, and the length of the dendrite from the contact site to the postsynaptic soma. If there were more than one putative synapse between the cells, we took the shortest intersomatic path distance for that given cell pair.</p>

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>Sample preparations for the electron microscopy were performed as described previously <sup>2,6</sup>. Briefly, digital images of serial EM sections (20 nm thickness) were taken at 64000x magnification with a FEI/Philips CM10 electron microscope equipped with a MegaView G2 camera. The membrane thickness measurements were carried out on digital images with a custom software. Briefly, postsynaptic dendritic structures were identified with the presence of postsynaptic densities (PSD) faced in front of axon terminals filled with vesicles. At least 20 nm away from the PSD, perpendicular lines were used as region interests (ROI). The intensity line profile of each ROI was calculated, and edge detection was carried out on them. The thickness was determined as the distance between the first and last point along the line profile where the gradient magnitude was larger than 50.</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The electrophysiological recordings were analysed by custom written python scripts. First the recorded sweeps were exported with HEKA FitMaster to ascii files. The mean synaptic delay in the paired recordings was determined by the averages of the delays between the peak of single presynaptic action potentials and the onsets of the corresponding EPSPs. The onset was determined by the projection of the intersection of two linear fits on the postsynaptic signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fedchyshyn &amp; Wang, 2007</xref>). The first line was fitted to the baseline 1 ms window from -0.5 to +0.5 ms of the presynaptic AP peak. The second line was fitted on the rising phase of the EPSP (5-30% of the amplitude). The time point of the crossing lines was projected back to the signal and it was used as the onset (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). For the forward propagation dendritic experiments the latency was calculated on an average signal. The onset of the EPSP-like waveform was determined as the onset of EPSPs in the paired recordings.</p>
<p>The bAP latency was measured at the peak of the average signal for each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stuart &amp; Sakmann, 1994</xref>). Only the first APs of the sweeps were averaged to avoid activity dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channel inactivation that can cause a putative modulatory effect on the signal propagation speed. For the axon bleb recordings we assumed that the axon initial segment (AIS) of the cells are 35 µm from the axon hillock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Palmer &amp; Stuart, 2006</xref>), and the APs propagate forward (to the bleb) and backward (to the soma) at the same speed. For the correction of the AIS we used the following formula:

<title>Estimating passive parameters of L2/3 pyramidal cells</title>
<p>We constructed detailed passive compartmental and cable models for five L2/3 human neurons and the four rat L2/3 neurons that were both 3D morphologically reconstructed and biophysically characterized. For each modeled neuron, we optimized the values of three key passive parameters: the specific membrane resistivity and capacitance (<italic>R<sub>m</sub>, C<sub>m</sub></italic>) and the specific axial resistivity, <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic>, using Neuron 8.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hines et al., 2009</xref>) principal axis optimization algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brent, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Segev et al., 1989</xref>). Optimization was achieved by minimizing the difference between experimental voltage response following hyperpolarizing current steps either to the soma or to the apical dendrite (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A,B</xref>) and the model response. When possible, experimental data was averaged over repetitions of the same stimulus.</p>
<p>To account for the surface area of spines, we used the spine correction factor (F) of 1.9 and 1.5 for human and rat PCs, respectively, by multiplying <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> and dividing <italic>R<sub>m</sub></italic> by F in segments which are at a distance of at least 60 μm from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Hunt et al., 2022</xref>). In this study we did not attempt to fit the nonlinear effect of I<sub>h</sub> of the voltage response of the cells.</p>
<p>As our experimental data contains simultaneous soma-dendritic pair recordings/stimulation, we decided to fit the voltage response in one location (e.g., the soma) for the current injection in the other location (e.g., dendrites). This is a cleaner way compared to the typical case when only one recording/stimulating electrode is available, as the problem of bridge balance at the current input site does not exist in this case. As we have two recording and simulation sites, we also examined how well the model predicts the local voltage response at the injection site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Analysis and simulation were conducted using Python 3.8 and visualization using matplotlib 3.15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hunter, 2007</xref>) and seaborn 0.11 (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Waskom, 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>Modeling EPSP propagation delay and velocity</title>
<p>We used the NEURON simulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hines et al., 2009</xref>) to model the nine 3D reconstructed neurons (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). To compute EPSP’s propagation latency and velocity, we simulated EPSPs by injecting a brief transient alpha-shaped current, 𝐼<sub>𝛼</sub>, delivered either to the soma or in various dendritic loci along the modeled apical tree.
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="510270v4_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

where 𝐴 = 1.5, 𝜏<sub>0</sub> = 0.25 and 𝜏<sub>1</sub> = 1𝑚𝑠, resulting in EPSP peak time, 𝑡<sub>𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘</sub> = 0.5𝑚𝑠 and peak current of 𝐼<sub>𝑝𝑒𝑎𝑘</sub> = 1.4𝑛𝐴.</p>
<p>Latency of the resultant EPSP was calculated as the difference between the EPSP peak at all dendritic branches and its resulting EPSP at the soma; using a sampling time bin of 0.01ms. Velocity was calculated as the distance of the input site from soma divided by latency between these two points. Each dot in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> is the respective value for a specific dendritic segment in a specific branch of a neuron’s apical tree. For each measured feature (radius, and velocity), an inset (zoom-in) matching the experimental distance range was added. It shows the average value across dendritic branches with a given distance from the soma, as a function of distance from soma, smoothed with a rolling 10 μm window. For normalizing the path distance of a given dendritic site to the soma in cable units, we calculated the space constant
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="510270v4_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
for each dendritic segment (where d is the segment’s diameter). We then summed up the cable lengths of all segments along the path from the dendritic location to the soma. Time was normalized by the membrane time constant τ = <italic>R<sub>m</sub></italic>*<italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic>. Note that, for segments far enough from cable boundary conditions and stimulus location, velocity approximately equals the theoretical value of 2λ/τ, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agmon-Snir &amp; Segev, 1993</xref>) see <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). Hence, in the uniform case where all specific parameters are equal for all cell modeled (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), normalizing the distance in cable should equalize latency/velocity differences resulting from diameter differences.</p>
<p>To account for brain tissue shrinkage due to fixation, for every segment, diameter and length were scaled based on an estimation of specific neuron shrinkage (see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Suppl. Table 1</xref>). To account for unequal dye spread, for a few manually picked segments, diameter value was fixed to be equal to its nearby segment (to avoid sudden diameter jump).</p>

Thick branches diameter is 4<italic>µ</italic>m, while thin branches’ diameter is 1<italic>µ</italic>m. Latency and velocity were calculated as explained in the text and in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; synaptic inputs were activated at different sites along the structure. The recording site (“soma”) is at left (dark blue rectangle), with diameter of 13<italic>µ</italic>m. <bold>B</bold> As in A, with normalized space and time constants. For symmetrical branches, both latency and velocity overlap for the two branches (left column in both <bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>), while in asymmetrical case, the latency from the thick branch is smaller as it is electrotonically closer to the soma and, therefore, for the same physical distance the initial velocity of the EPSP at its site of origin is larger (right column in <bold>B</bold>, red branch compared with green). However, there is a small increase in latency (decrease in velocity at these daughter branches) due to local impedance mismatch. <bold>C</bold>. Cable with diameters replicating the apical main-branch of ‘Human2’ (left column) and ‘Rat1’ (right column) PCs. Note the local irregularities shifts the velocity above (left column) or below (right column) 2λ/𝜏 despite having identical lengths across all sections. Moreover, velocity pattern changes due to the proximity of the synapse to the soma, as a function of the cable diameters. Cable parameters are identical for all morphologies (<italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> = 1.5 <italic>µF/cm</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>R<sub>m</sub></italic> = 10,000 Ω<italic>cm</italic><sup>2</sup>, <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> = 150 Ω<italic>cm</italic>).</p></caption>

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> observations indicating that human pyramidal neurons propagate information as fast as rat pyramidal neurons despite their larger size. <bold>Convincing</bold> evidence demonstrates that this property is due to several biophysical properties of human neurons. This study will be of interest to neurophysiologists.</p>

<p>The propagation of electrical signals within neuronal circuits is tightly regulated by the physical and molecular properties of neurons. Since neurons vary in size across species, the question arises whether propagation speed also varies to compensate for it. The present article compares numerous speed-related properties in human and rat neurons. They found that the larger size of human neurons seems to be compensated by a faster propagation within dendrites but not axons of these neurons. The faster dendritic signal propagation was found to arise from wider dendritic diameters and greater conductance load in human neurons. In addition, the article provides a careful characterization of human dendrites and axons, as the field has only recently begun to characterize post-operative human cells. There are only a few studies reporting dendritic properties and these are not all consistent, hence there is added value of reporting these findings, particularly given that the characterization is condensed in a compartmental model.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The study was performed with great care using standard techniques in slice electrophysiology (pharmacological manipulation with somatic patch-clamp) as well as some challenging ones (axonal and dendritic patch-clamp). Modeling was used to parse out the role of different features in regulating dendritic propagation speed. The finding that propagation speed varies across species is novel as previous studies did not find a large change in membrane time constant nor axonal diameters (a significant parameter affecting speed). A number of possible, yet less likely factors were carefully tested (Ih, membrane capacitance). The main features outlined here are well known to regulate speed in neuronal processes. The modeling was also carefully done to verify that the magnitude of the effects is consistent with the difference in biophysical properties. Hence, the findings appear very solid to me.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The role of diameter in regulating propagation speed is well known in the axon literature.</p>
<p>Comment on the revised version: the authors have now made clearer that the role of diameter was well known in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Oláh and colleagues introduce new research data on the cellular and biophysical elements involved in transmission within the pyramidal circuits of the human neocortex. They gathered a comprehensive set of patch-clamp recordings from human and rat pyramidal neurons to compare how the temporal aspect of neuronal processing is maintained in the larger human neocortex. A range of experimental techniques have been used, including two-photon guided dual whole-cell recordings, electron microscopy, complemented by theoretical and computational methods.</p>
<p>The authors find that synaptically connected pyramidal neurons within the human neocortex have longer intercellular path lengths. They go on to show that the short soma to soma latencies is not due to propagation velocity along the axon but instead reflects a higher propagation speed of synaptic potentials from dendrite to soma. Next, in a series of extensive computational modeling studies focusing on the synaptic potentials, the authors show that the shorter latency may be explained by larger diameters, affecting the cable properties and resulting is relatively faster propagation of EPSPs in the human neuron. The manuscript is well-written, and the physiological experiments and in-depth theoretical steps for the simulations are clear. Whether passive cable properties of the dendrites alone are responsible for higher velocities remains to be further investigated. Based on the present data the contribution of active membrane properties cannot be excluded.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used complex 2P-guided dual whole-cell recordings in human neurons. In combination with detailed reconstructions, these approaches represent the next steps in unravelling the information processing in human circuits.</p>
<p>The computational modelling and cable theory application to the experimentally constrained simulations provides an integrated view of the passive membrane properties of human neurons.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whether the cable properties alone are the main explanation for speeding the electrical signaling in human pyramidal neurons deserves further studies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study indicates that connections across human cortical pyramidal cells have identical latencies despite a larger mean dendritic and axonal length between somas in human cortex. A precise demonstration combining detailed electrophysiology and modeling, indicates that this property is due to faster propagation of signals in proximal human dendrites. This faster propagation is itself due to a slightly thicker dendrite, to a larger capacitive load, and to stronger hyperpolarizing currents. Hence, the biophysical properties of human pyramidal cells are adapted such that they do not compromise information transfer speed.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and very detailed. The authors have experimentally verified a large number of aspects that could affect propagation speed and have pinpointed the most important one. This paper provides an excellent comparision of biophysical properties between rat and human pyramidal cells. Thanks to this approach a comprehensive description of the mechanisms underlying the acceleration of propagation in human dendrite is provided.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The weaknesses I had identified have been addressed by the authors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<p>We are grateful for the positive evaluation of the work and the critical points raised by the reviewers. We thank all reviewers for their excellent comments. We believe that these revisions have significantly improved the quality of our study.</p>
<p>In response to the 2nd reviewer, we apologise for the missing data, we failed to provide a P-value of the RM ANOVA post-hoc test, we are very grateful that this was brought to our attention. We have revised the RM ANOVA by using the Tukey HSD post-hoc test, which is generally recommended for pairwise comparisons as it is more robust to unequal sample sizes. The controversial statistical analysis of the overall comparison of speed differences was deleted, as were three supplementary figures (Fig. S4, Fig. S9 and S10), which are less informative in support of the manuscript.</p>
