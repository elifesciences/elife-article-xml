<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Career athletes, active military, and head trauma victims are at increased risk for mild repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI), a condition that contributes to the development of epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Standard clinical imaging fails to identify rTBI-induced lesions, and novel non-invasive methods are needed. Here, we evaluated if hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI) could detect long-lasting changes in brain metabolism 3.5 months post-injury in a rTBI mouse model. Our results show that this metabolic imaging approach can detect changes in cortical metabolism at that timepoint, whereas multimodal MR imaging did not detect any structural or contrast alterations. Using Machine Learning, we further show that HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI parameters can help classify rTBI vs. Sham and predict long-term rTBI-induced behavioral outcomes. Altogether, our study demonstrates the potential of metabolic imaging to improve detection, classification and outcome prediction of previously undetected rTBI.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Individuals subject to frequent concussions such as career athletes (e.g. football players, boxers), accidental head trauma victims, domestic abuse victims, or active military are some of the population at risk for mild repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI). Indeed, rTBI is being steadily recognized as a risk factor for the development of epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. However, to date, non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers of rTBI are lacking. In particular, clinical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the standard imaging methods for trauma patients, are unable to detect rTBI-induced pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. This lack of imaging techniques hampers proper diagnosis and appropriate clinical care, as a result new approaches are critically needed.</p>
<p>To further our understanding of rTBI, several models were developed over the past years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. The closed-head impact model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) device was designed to deliver multiple subconcussive mild TBI in a controlled and reproducible manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. CHIMERA-induced rTBI has been shown to lead to reproducible pathological and behavioral changes up to several months following impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, mirroring the long-term effects of rTBI seen in the clinic (review by McNamara <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>). Only a few studies have investigated the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect CHIMERA-induced rTBI. Diffusion MRI, which is sensitive to water diffusion in tissue and changes in tissue microstructure, detected subtle differences in rTBI animals at 7 days following injury and in the optic tract, brachium of the superior colliculus, corpus callosum and hippocampus regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>; however, long-lasting changes were not studied. T2-weighted MRI, which is sensitive to changes in tissue microstructure, edema, and myelination, did not detect signs of brain injury at 7 days and 40 days post-injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. All these studies are in line with clinical findings, and further highlight the need for more sensitive approaches to detect and monitor long-term brain changes after rTBI.</p>
<p>Metabolic impairment following TBI has been well documented in patients and animal models in the hours following TBI using <sup>13</sup>C-labelled substrates infusion and metabolomics approaches (reviews by Jalloh, Dermers-Marcil, and Carpenter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>). Notably, cerebral microdialysis studies have identified that the lactate / pyruvate ratio (Lac/Pyr) parameter is associated with poor outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, as cerebral microdialysis is an invasive method, its use at chronic timepoints following TBI, or in closed head injury and concussion is not feasible. Hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI) is a unique technology that allows to measure metabolic fluxes <italic>in vivo,</italic> and to compute lactate / pyruvate ratio values as well. HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI applications have been extensively described in the oncology field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and its use is emerging to probe brain metabolism in health and diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate enables to monitor the conversion of this key metabolite into its product(s) [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate and/or [<sup>13</sup>C]bicarbonate in the brain, which provides unprecedented metabolic information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Prior studies of moderate TBI have shown changes in the HP <sup>13</sup>C lactate / pyruvate ratio (HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr), and HP <sup>13</sup>C bicarbonate / lactate ratio at early timepoints (4 hours up to 7 days) following injury in preclinical models and in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, demonstrating the potential value of this technique. Furthermore, recent studies have combined injection of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate with HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea, a metabolically inactive probe, to simultaneously evaluate the pyruvate to lactate flux and tissue perfusion, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, it remains to be determined whether HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of HP [1- <sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate might be useful to the detection of rTBI at chronic timepoints, and inform on potential mechanism of metabolic injury. Furthermore, co-injection of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea has never been tested in any TBI model or patient.</p>
<p>Here, we questioned if advanced imaging approaches that have never been applied to the study of rTBI could detect long-lasting alterations following rTBI in the CHIMERA model. In addition to the above described HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea, we also evaluated Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and T<sub>1</sub> mapping. SWI is an MRI method particularly sensitive to iron that can inform on venous deoxygenated blood and iron deposition in tissue, and which has proven very valuable to identify microbleeds in TBI, but has not yet been investigated in the CHIMERA model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Recent reports have highlighted the potential of T<sub>1</sub> mapping to detect oxidative stress in the rodent brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and thus this technique holds great potential to detect the production of reactive oxygen species that may occur following diffuse axonal injury and inflammatory processes observed in the CHIMERA model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, we induced rTBI in two-month old male mice using the CHIMERA apparatus, tested risk-taking behavior 3 months post rTBI, and performed four MRI-based scans. We investigated the potential of <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and [<sup>13</sup>C]urea to detect metabolic and tissue perfusion impairment, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI to assess structural changes (as clinical standard of MR imaging), T<sub>1</sub>-mapping to evaluate tissue microstructure alterations and oxidative stress, and SWI MRI to detect changes in tissue microstructure, microbleed and tissue oxygenation following rTBI. Last, brain tissue was collected to evaluate changes in enzymes activity and transporter protein expression. Given the multidimensional nature of the data, we used a Machine Learning (ML) approach to identify how measured parameters could best predict changes in risk-taking behavior and HP 13C MRSI.</p>

<title>HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI detects long-lasting metabolic alterations following rTBI</title>
<p>We investigated whether HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI could be used as a non-invasive tool to detect rTBI-induced long-lasting changes, and specifically to question whether metabolic alterations are present at chronic time points following injury.</p>
<p>Following intravenous co-injection of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea, we observed signals from both substrates, as well as from the metabolic product HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2.<bold>a</bold></xref>) and subcortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2.<bold>b</bold></xref>) of Sham and rTBI mice at 3.5 months post-injury. Upon quantification, we observed significant metabolic differences between the cortex of rTBI compared to Sham mice: HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate levels were 1.09 fold lower in rTBI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.<bold>a</bold></xref>, p = 0.0073), HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate levels were 1.05 fold higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.<bold>b</bold></xref>, p = 0.0073), and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr was 1.15 fold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.<bold>c</bold></xref>, p = 0.0071). No significant differences in HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea levels were observed in the cortical area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.<bold>c</bold></xref>), although a trend towards lower HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea levels in rTBI was observed (p = 0.0794). In subcortical areas, we did not detect any differences in HP [1- <sup>13</sup>C]lactate, HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate, HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr and HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea between rTBI and Sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.<bold>e-h</bold></xref>). In agreement with the metabolic quantifications, HP <sup>13</sup>C heatmaps clearly show lower HP [1- <sup>13</sup>C]lactate, higher HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and lower HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr in the cortex of rTBI mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3.<bold>i</bold></xref>). Altogether, our results indicate that HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI can detect region-specific long-lasting metabolic changes following mild rTBI.</p>

<title>Multimodal MRI does not detect long-lasting effect of injury in rTBI</title>
<p>We evaluated whether a comprehensive multimodal MRI approach could detect changes between rTBI and Sham mice at 3.5 months post-injury, when metabolic alterations where detected by HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI.</p>
<p>We first used T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI, the clinical standard of MRI approach, that is sensitive to inflammation and/or changes in myelin content. We found that T<sub>2</sub> signal intensities were not different between rTBI and Sham mice in any of the regions studied (prefrontal cortex, cortex, hippocampus and thalamus (subcortex)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4.<bold>a-b</bold></xref>). In addition, we did not detect any differences in brain region volumes between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Next, we used a T<sub>1</sub> mapping sequence that was shown to be sensitive to changes in microstructure or alterations related to oxidative stress. Similar to the T<sub>2</sub> intensities, we did not observed any differences in the T<sub>1</sub> values in any of the region studied between rTBI and Sham mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4.<bold>c-d</bold></xref>). Lastly, a SWI sequence was used, as it is capable of detecting microbleeds as well as potential changes in oxygenation following injury. Once again, no differences in SWI values were observed between rTBI and Sham mice in any region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4.<bold>e-f</bold></xref>). We did not detect any microbleed lesions in any of the studied animals.</p>

<p>Altogether, our results indicate that a comprehensive multimodal MRI approach combining T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI, T<sub>1</sub> mapping and SWI was not able to detect any signs of injury in rTBI mice at 3.5 months postinjury, unlike HP<sup>13</sup>C MRSI.</p>

<title>Disrupted enzymatic activity, but not transporter expression, is observed at chronic time points after rTBI</title>
<p>To further investigate potential underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI readouts, we evaluated the activity of enzymes responsible for pyruvate conversion into its downstream metabolites and the expression of transporters that control the entry of pyruvate into cells and the efflux of metabolites outside of the cells.</p>
<p>In the brain, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) converts pyruvate into lactate, and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) controls pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic cycle and its conversion into acetyl-coA. We observed that PDH was 1.6 fold lower in the prefrontal cortex and 1.7 fold lower in the cortex of rTBI compared to Sham mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, p = 0.0044 and p = 0.0375, respectively). No differences in PDH were observed in subcortical areas that include the hippocampus and thalamus. The activity of LDH was not significantly different between rTBI and Sham mice for cortical and subcortical areas.</p>

<p>As levels of HP metabolites and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr also depend on HP [1-13C]pyruvate intake by cells and on the efflux of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate, we evaluated the expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). MCT1 is primarily responsible for pyruvate entry into the cell, and MCT4 is principaly involved in the efflux of lactate outside of the cell. Protein quantification of MCT1 and MCT4 performed for the prefrontal cortex, cortex, hippocampus and thalamus did not show any differences between rTBI and Sham mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the differences observed with HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI are likely not due to MCT1 and MCT4 expression.</p>

<title>Machine learning identifies rTBI/Sham classifiers, and predictors of behavior and HP <sup>13</sup>C readouts</title>

First, we wanted to identify the best classifying variables allowing for separation of the two groups (rTBI vs Sham). Second, we aimed to find the best predictors of changes in risk-taking behavior, as it recapitulates a key behavioral component observed in rTBI patients, and of cortical HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr, due to its potential to serve as a novel biomarker for long-lasting consequences of rTBI.</p>

<p>Various classification and feature extraction methods were implemented to identify the best classifying variables between Sham and rTBI mice. Consequently, we identified five triplets of variables that could accurately distinguish between either group and ranked them based on their feature importance scores computed using various feature extraction algorithms (see methods). The top two triplets with high feature scores are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5.<bold>a</bold></xref> and the others are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>. The top two triplets are: 1) PDH Pfc, LDH Thal, and LDH Hp, and 2) PDH Ctx, LDH Thal, and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx. These findings suggest that although one single feature is not sufficient to identify the difference between rTBI and Sham, the combined PDH and LDH activity, as well as HP <sup>13</sup>C imaging readouts can help distinguish differences between the two conditions. The three lower-tier triplets consisted of the subsequent variables: 3) PDH Pfc, EPM duration openandcenter, and LDH Thal, 4) PDH Pfc, EPM duration openandcenter, and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx, and 5) PDH Pfc, MCT1 Pfc, and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx. These three last triplets further idenfy the risk-taking behavior and MCT1 expression in the prefrontal cortex as important variables to classify Sham and rTBI.</p>

<p>Next, we identified the best predictors of the changes in risk-taking behavior and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5.<bold>b and 5.c</bold></xref>, respectively. Interestingly, four variables, namely EPM frequency openandcenter, MCT1 Pfc, nT<sub>2</sub> Pfc, and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx, were sufficient to predict risk-taking behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5.<bold>b bottom panel</bold></xref>) with similar accuracy than when all variables were used for prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5.<bold>b top panel</bold></xref>). This result shows that a systems approach comprising behavioral, transporter expression, structural and HP <sup>13</sup>C imaging measures yields a tangible prediction for changes in risk-taking behavior. Similarly, four variables, namely EPM duration openandcenter, HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Subctx, PDH Hp, and SWI Hp, were enough to predict the HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5.<bold>c bottom panel</bold></xref>) with similar accuracy than when all the variables were used for prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5.<bold>c top panel</bold></xref>). This result demonstrates that using a systemic combination of behavioral, enzyme activity, and advanced MRI measures best predicts the HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr Ctx.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate can detect metabolic changes 3.5 months following rTBI when structural T<sub>2</sub> MRI, T<sub>1</sub> mapping, SWI MRI and HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of [<sup>13</sup>C]urea did not. Specifically, we measured a significantly lower HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr in the mouse cortex 3.5 months postinjury, which was associated with lower PDH activity. Using a ML approach, we further validated that the HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr is among the best classifiers of rTBI and Sham groups, and is a predictor of the risktaking behavior observed in this rTBI model. Our findings demonstrate the ability of HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI of [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate to detect rTBI-induced damages and highlight promising potential to improve diagnosis and monitoring of rTBI patients at chronic time points when other imaging techniques are insufficient.</p>
<p>Cerebral metabolism has been probed using HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate both in preclinical and clinical settings in healthy and diseased brain (see Le Page &amp; al. for recent literature review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>). Prior studies performed in moderate TBI preclinical models of contusion injury have reported increased HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr at early timepoints following injury (4 hours up to 7 days following injury), but no significant changes at chronic timepoints (28 days post-injury)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In contrast, in this study we observed a decreased HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr at chronic timepoints, suggesting different underlying pathological changes between contusion injury and rTBI. Studies performed using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the glucose analogue <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG) have detected long-term brain hypometabolism following TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, which is in line with the lower HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr measured here at chronic timepoints. To the best of our knowledge, <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET imaging has never been applied to CHIMERA rTBI model. Furthermore, the use of this method for TBI is limited by ionizing radiations, and the high background of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET signal in the brain tissue, hampering the detection of small changes in glucose uptake.</p>
<p>Decreased HP <sup>13</sup>C bicarbonate / lactate ratio was found in moderate TBI models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, and decreased HP <sup>13</sup>C bicarbonate levels were found in TBI patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, highlighting possible changes in mitochondrial function and aerobic versus anaerobic respiration following trauma. In agreement with these findings, a decreased of PDH activity after injury has been previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, including in our current findings in rTBI. In this study, we were not able to detect 13C bicarbonate, likely due to the low signal to noise and the fast T<sub>1</sub> relaxation rate of this metabolite at ultra-high field (14.1 Tesla). HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr can be influenced by the activity of LDH and/or PDH, the availability of their cofactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, as well as by MCTs expression, where increased MCT1 expression leads to increased HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr in selected cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In this study, we did not find any significant differences in MCT1 and MCT4 between rTBI and Sham mice, suggesting that they do not play a prominent role in the changes observed in the HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr at this late time post injury.</p>
<p>It has previously been shown that the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) limits the entry of HP probes, which could in turn influence the measured HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. To evaluate potential changes in perfusion and delivery, we co-injected [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate with HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea, a metabolically inactive probe. Although decreased cerebral blood flow alteration has been reported following rTBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, we did not observe any differences in HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea levels between Sham and rTBI, indicating that perfusion was likely unaltered at 3.5 months post-injury. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the use of HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea in a rTBI model. Additional studies at earlier timepoints following injury, and in other TBI models, are needed to evaluate the full potential of HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea in detecting BBB alterations and/or vasculature changes following brain injury.</p>
<p>Conventional and advanced anatomical MRI did not detect any differences between Sham and rTBI at 3.5 months post-injury. In agreement with these findings, Haber <italic>et al.</italic> and our group previously reported no differences using T<sub>2</sub> MRI at 7 days and 40 days post-injury, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. These results suggest that conventional T<sub>2</sub> MRI may not be able to detect rTBI patholology-induced using the CHIMERA device, either at early or late timepoints following injury. Using T<sub>1</sub> mapping we investigated whether we could detect changes in tissue microstructure and reactive oxygen species production, but found no differences between Sham and rTBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species have been shown to play an important role in TBI pathogenesis and in mediating axonal degeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. However it remains unclear if these events may predominantly occur at early timepoints following injury and would have resolved by the time we performed our imaging study (3.5 months injury), or whether T<sub>1</sub> mapping was not able to detect these events in this rTBI model. HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) and HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) have been shown to be sensitive probes to investigate redox changes <italic>in vivc/</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, and therefore represent attractive probes to further interrogate the involvement of oxidative stress using HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI. We also included SWI MRI exams as this method has been shown to improve the detection of microbleeds and hemorrhagic diffusive axonal injury after TBI, which was associated with neurologic deficits and long-term outcome in human TBI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. However, we did not detect any differences in SWI MRI between Sham and rTBI. As for T<sub>1</sub> mapping, it remains to be determined whether no microbleeds or oxygenation changes occurs in this model at early timepoints, or whether potential changes have resolved by the time we conducted our imaging exams.</p>
<p>We took a systems approach to measure behavior outcomes using ML analyses. We found that sets of variables were able to classify rTBI and Sham mice. These variables are linked to cognitive abilities (risktaking behavior), metabolism and molecule transport (PDH and LDH activity, HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr, and MCT1), highlighting the importance of long-term metabolic impairment in rTBI and suggesting their potential as injury biomarkers. Interestingly, ML was able to identify that enzymatic changes in the thalamus and hippocampus regions, which were not statistically significant using conventional unpaired t-test in isolation, became important variables to classify rTBI and Sham when considered together. This is in agreement with changes in hippocampal function that have been previously reported in rTBI up to 6 months post-injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Future HP <sup>13</sup>C imaging studies will aim to also include the thalamus and hippocampus to determine whether <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolic changes can be detected in these regions. ML was also used to determine which variables are best predictors of the risk-taking behavior. We found that the changes in risk-taking behavior were best predicted by variables from the cortical areas, including HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr, MCT1 expression, structural MRI, and behavioral parameters. Similarly, cerebral microdialysis studies have shown that the Lac/Pyr is an important variable associated to clinical outcome. High Lac/Pyr within the first days after injury was associated to poor clinical outcome 6 months later<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, while here we show that a lower HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr is associated to higher risk-taking behavior 3.5 months after injury. This discrepancy might be explained by different timing of the Lac/Pyr measurement (days versus months after injury), and the injury severity (severe TBI versus mild rTBI). Nonetheless, our study provides further evidence that the Lac/Pyr is a useful marker to predict behavioral outcome, which can now be measured in a non-invasive manner using HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI, thus opening new avenues to evaluate metabolic alterations months after trauma. Last, ML was used to determine the best predictors of the HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr in the cortex, and identified subcortical variables, including PDH activity, SWI MRI and metabolic MRSI, as well as risk-taking behavior. Altogether, these results demonstrate the importance of multimodal approaches to detect rTBI pathology and associated long-lasting changes.</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent efforts of the community to enable easy data sharing though data repository<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, future studies with higher sample size will become possible, which in turn can lead to improvement of our understanding of biological and functional pathway involved in rTBI, and help identify novel biomarkers.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings demonstrate the potential of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate to detect long-lasting metabolic alterations in a mouse model of rTBI. In addition, ML identified HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI as a key parameter to predict long-term rTBI-induced behavioral outcomes. Over the past few years, the use of HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI in clinical trials worldwide has been rapidly expanding, and the injection of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate has proven feasible and safe, with no reported side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. In this study, we were able to measure changes in HP <sup>13</sup>C MRS parameters from two regions, the cortex which is closest to the impact, and the subcortex, which is more remote. We were not able to differentiate between smaller brain regions (e.g. prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, thalamus) due to the large voxel size used in this study relative to the size of the mouse brain. Current sequences available on clinical scanners can achieve up to 1 cm<sup>3</sup> spatial resolution and cover the entire human brain, thus providing metabolic information from brain areas close and remote to the site of injury. With the growing availability of the HP <sup>13</sup>C MRS technology, our findings provide a strong rationale to translate its use in patients suffering from rTBI, with the aim to improve the detection of rTBI-induced damages, help in understanding metabolic pathways involved in rTBI pathogenesis, and eventually aid the development of treatment strategies.</p>

<title>Animals and rTBI model induction</title>
<p>All animal research was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, San Francisco. Mice were given one week of acclimation and housed with a reversed 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and provided food and water ad libitum. At 8 weeks of age, mice were randomly assigned to the rTBI or sham control group. Animals were anesthetized using isoflurane (2-3%) in oxygen 1 L/min during the procedure. rTBI animals were subjected to multiple, mild, closed-head injuries using the CHIMERA device as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Briefly, rTBI animals were placed supinely into an angled holding platform without any shaving of the head or incision into the skin so that the head was level with the piston target hole while aligning the eyes, ears, and nose such that the impact was centered on the dorsal convexity of the skull, targeting a 5-mm area surrounding bregma. A nose cone delivering isoflurane was removed just prior to the impact. Impact was initiated using RealTerm software, which was connected to a system including air tank, pressure regulator, digital pressure gauge, two-way solenoid valve, and piston. The impact was administered with a velocity range of 3.9-4.5 m/sec, resulting in an impact energy of 0.5 J from the 5 mm, 50 g piston<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Animals were moved to an incubator immediately after the impact and monitored until fully recovered. rTBI animals received an injury once per day for 5 days with a 24 h interval in between impacts. Five repeated hits were chosen to specifically focus on the effects of repeated exposure to TBI, as athletes, veterans and sometimes trauma victims are exposed to constant and repeated blows, even without experiencing concussive symptoms. Sham mice were exposed to the same isoflurane anesthesia paradigm without sustaining an impact. Skull fractures, seizures, apnea, or mortality were not observed in any animals, and no animals were excluded from the study due to injury parameters.</p>

<title>Risk-taking behavioral test</title>
<p>For all behavioral assays, the experimenters were blinded to surgery. Before behavioral analysis, animals were inspected for gross motor impairments. Animals were inspected for whisker loss, limb immobility (including grip strength), and eye occlusions. If animals displayed any of these impairments, they were eliminated from the study. Behavioral tests were recorded and scored using a video tracking and analysis setup (Ethovision XT 8.5, Noldus Information Technology). If tracking was unsuccessful, videos were scored by two individuals blinded to surgery. Risk-taking behavioral phenotype was evaluated using the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) at ~ 100 days (3 months) post-injury (counted from the day of the first injury) as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The EPM consists of two exposed, open arms (35 cm) opposite each other and two enclosed arms (30.5 cm) also across from each other. The four arms are attached to a center platform (4.5 cm square), and the entire maze is elevated 40 cm off the floor. Bright white lights illuminated both ends of the open arm. Mice were placed individually onto the center of the maze and allowed to explore the maze for 5 min, and their activity was recorded. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals. Risk-taking behavior was measured by changes in time spent in the open arms + center of the EPM. We also measured the number of entries into the extremes zones on the EPM, the time spent in the extreme zons on the EPM, the number of entries in the open arms + center on the EPM, the total distance traveled on EPM measured by centerpoint, and the average animal velocity on the EPM. These behavioral data were previously reported in Krukowski <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (1.5-2% in O<sub>2</sub>) and a 27-gauge catheter was placed in the tail vein to allow for intravenous (i.v.) injection. Next, animals were placed in a dedicated cylindrical cradle allowing for reproducible positioning of the mouse head; which was subsequently inserted inside a dual tune <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C volume coil (ÃI = 40 mm) or a single tuned <sup>1</sup>H proton coil (ÃI = 40 mm) in a 14.1 T vertical MR system (Agilent Technologies). Respiration rate was continuously monitored through the PC-sam software interface (SA Instrument, NY, USA).</p>
<p>First, T<sub>2</sub>-weighted images from the entire brain were acquired for adequate positioning of the grid used for hyperpolarized <sup>13</sup>C acquisitions using the following parameters: repetition time (TR) = 1200 ms, echo time (TE) = 20 ms, slice thickness 1.8 mm, 2 averages, matrix 256 Ã 256, field of view (FOV) 30 Ã 30 mm<sup>2</sup>. For HP <sup>13</sup>C MRSI acquisitions, 24 Î¼L of [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and 55 Î¼L [<sup>13</sup>C]urea preparation were co-polarized using a Hypersense DNP polarizer (Oxford Instruments) for one hour. After dissolution, the HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and [1-<sup>13</sup>C]urea preparation was rapidly dissolved in isotonic buffer (pH ~ 7) to a final concentration of 80 mM and 78 mM, respectively. A final volume of 300 ÃL of the HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and [<sup>13</sup>C]urea solution was then injected i.v. through the tail vein catheter. 2D dynamic chemical shift imaging <sup>13</sup>C data were acquired 16 seconds post i.v. injection of the HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and [<sup>13</sup>C]urea solution using the following parameters: TR = 67 ms, TE = 0.58 ms, spectral width 5000 Hz, 256 points, flip angle 10Â°; matrix = 16 Ã 16, field of view (FOV) = 32 Ã 32 mm<sup>2</sup>; slice thickness 4 mm.</p>
<p>Next, for T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI, T<sub>1</sub> MRI and SWI acquistions, the dual tune <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>13</sup>C volume coil (ÃI = 40 mm) was removed and replaced by a <sup>1</sup>H volume only coil (ÃI = 40 mm). T<sub>2</sub>-weighted MRI was acquired using a 2D fast spin-echo, with effective echo time (TE<sub>eff</sub>)/TR = 11.80/2006 ms, FOV = 25 Ã 25 mm<sup>2</sup>, in 256 Ã 256 array and 0.5 mm slice thickness. T<sub>1</sub>-mapping data were acquired using fast spin-echo with inversion recovery: TE<sub>eff</sub>/ TR = 7.44/10000 ms, 8 inversion times (TI): 100, 170, 310, 530, 940, 1640, 2900, 5000 ms, FOV = 30 Ã 30 mm<sup>2</sup>, in 128 Ã 128 array and 1 mm slice thickness.

The area under the curve (AUC) of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate, AUC of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate and AUC of HP [<sup>13</sup>C]urea were measured for each voxel and normalized to the noise level. To account for variations in polarization levels and delivery, HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate signal and HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate signal were calculated by dividing each value by the sum of HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate and HP [1-<sup>13</sup>C]lactate for each voxel.

<p>LDH and PDH activities were evaluated using spectrophotometric activity assay kits according to manufacturerâs guidelines (ab102526 and ab109902; Abcam, respectively), and normalized to protein concentration determined by the Bradford protein assay method.</p>
<p>For western blot analyses, frozen brain samples were then homogenized with RIPA buffer (Pierce, 89900) and protease inhibitor Haltâ¢ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, 1862209) using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Lysate were incubated on ice for 15 minutes and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4Â°C. Protein concentration in supernatants was determined using the Bradford protein assay method. Equal amount of proteins was loaded on Mini-ProteanÂ® TGX TM Precast gels 12% (BioRad, 456-1043) for 34 minutes at 200 V and 400 mA in Tris/Glycine/SDS Buffer, (BioRad, 1610732).

<title>Machine Learning analyses</title>
<p>The ML pipeline is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>. Preprocessing of the raw experimental data was performed before ML analyses to (i) scale the measurements for fair comparison and (ii) predict the</p>

The raw measurements were rescaled using Scikit-learn python libraryâs standard scaler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref> for an example of original versus scaled data distributions). For a few mice, we were not able to measure some of the variables due to tissue isolation (n = 2 rTBI and n = 2 Sham missing for PDH activity, n = 3-4 rTBI and n = 3 Sham missing for LDH activity, MCT1 and MCT4 expression) and low signal to noise of the HP [<sup>13</sup>C] imaging data (n = 1 rTBI mouse excluded). To impute the missing measurements we separated the data into rTBI and Sham groups, and within each group the data was split as training and testing. Mice with all measured variables were used to train a Random Forrest Regressor (RFR). The trained regressor was then used to predict missing measurements associated with the testing data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> To identify the variables that are the best classifiers of Sham and rTBI groups, and to eliminate sensitivity of the results to different methods, we used multiple Scikit-learn classifiers and feature selection algorithims that are neural network, logistic regression, recursive feature elimination (RFE), SelectKBest, feature importance with ExtraTreesClassifier, and LASSO. Using each method, all the variables were scored based on their importance in the classification of Sham versus rTBI and a pool of variables with high importance scores was created. From this pool, we created groups of best classifiers with the minimum number of variables, that is three in this case, and ranked those triplets of variables based on their individual importance scores across different methods. Similarly, to identify the best predictors of the risk-taking behavior and HP <sup>13</sup>C Lac/Pyr in the cortex, we trained multiple regression algorithms of Scikit-learn library that are LASSO, RFR, Ridge Regression, Support Vector Regressor, using the measurements of variable to be predicted as the y-values and all the remaining variables as the x-values (predictors). Then, the variables with high absolute coefficients were identified as the most important features that contribute to the prediction of the regressor. After pooling and grouping the variables with high feature scores across different algorithms, we observed the best predictor group with the minimum number of variables.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present a metabolic imaging study of pyruvate metabolism in a mouse model of repetitive traumatic brain injury in the chronic recovery stage. They measure pyruvate metabolism with hyperpolarised 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. This is acquired alongside semi-quantitative MR imaging metrics, a behavioural measure, and postmortem measures of relevant enzyme activity and expression of metabolic transporter proteins. They find that the MRSI-measured cortical lactate/pyruvate ratio (and signal from pyruvate and lactate independently) can differentiate the rTBI group from the sham group. They additionally find that postmortem, cortical pyruvate dehydrogenase activity is a statistically significant discriminator. All other metrics (MRI and enzyme/transporter measures) are not significantly different between groups. Finally, using a machine learning approach, the authors investigate the predictive power of combinations of all measures.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The primary strength of this work is the likely robustness of the primary finding - that hyperpolarised 13C lactate/pyruvate metabolite ratios are perturbed in this chronic rTBI model compared to the sham control.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Focal alterations in blood-brain-barrier permeability may affect the primary lactate/pyruvate measures. Whilst 13C urea measures perfusion, urea remains purely extracellular; whilst in the metabolism of the healthy brain, pyruvate must be transported through two levels of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) - in the endothelium surrounding the capillary bed and then into the parenchyma. By mechanically disrupting the brain, tight junctions in the BBB may be disrupted, therefore increasing the flux of pyruvate across the BBB and increasing pyruvate availability. In this case, lac/pyr would be a poor measure of metabolism as &quot;delivery&quot; has changed. While the authors assess perfusion using HP urea, it is unclear whether or how this metric would change in the presence of BBB disruption in relatively large and well-vascularised voxels.</p>
<p>The finding that &quot;HP [1-13C]pyruvate levels were 1.05 fold higher&quot; indicates that delivery of pyruvate might be increased. It is unclear if normalisation to the combined amplitude of lactate and pyruvate is fair in the case that the volume fraction in the voxel might have increased. Ideally, the authors would estimate polarisation separately as a normalisation.</p>
<p>No estimate of uncertainty is provided for the primary metabolic measures. Note that the lactate-pyruvate ratio is not normally distributed (see doi: 10.1002/mrm.26615), and this should be accounted for when carrying out statistical tests.</p>
<p>All metabolic maps are shown masked to the brain and interpolated to the structural MRI resolution (around 20 times). Nor is there any characterisation of the spectroscopic imaging's voxel volume, including the effect of the point spread function. It is, therefore, hard to have confidence in any spatial effects or potential partial volume effects from the tissue surrounding the brain.</p>
<p>The t2-weighted and SWI MRI measures used in this work are not quantitative. Normalisation in each case is carried out without regard to any spatially variable transmit and receive coil sensitivities (B1{plus minus}), which vary per subject. This adds intersubject variance, which could mask any effect between groups. No quality metrics (SNR or uncertainty estimates) are given for the MRI metrics.</p>
<p>Spectroscopic imaging was conducted 16 s after injection. Given the high heart rate of a mouse, measures of perfusion (using urea) could , therefore, be considered in a steady state, lowering sensitivity to any changes in perfusion or metabolite delivery. Furthermore, it is unclear how any changes in BBB permeability would manifest with the relatively low spatial resolution of MRSI. Would signal always be dominated by vascular compartments?</p>
<p>There is no apparent attempt to understand if an immune response occurs at this chronic time point. Macrophages are glycolytic and could affect the pyruvate measurement. Furthermore, is there any evidence for cellular changes in this model, namely density, cell type fraction, or microstructure? Are there any expected changes in glucose uptake?</p>
<p>There is no information or references provided for the accuracy or precision of the postmortem assays or their correlation with in vivo processes. What is the effect of cell density changes after injury on the assay kits?</p>
<p>The proposed interpretation of T1 as a measure of oxidative stress would seem to ignore the many confounding interpretations of T1.</p>
<p>Aims and impact:</p>
<p>In summary, the authors broadly achieve one aim, which is to find that HP 13C measured lac/pyruvate is a biomarker for the chronic effects of rTBI in a mouse model. As the authors themselves highlight in the discussion, the interpretation of this finding is tricky alongside their post-mortem assay results. The MR imaging in this work seems inconclusive, given the potential for inter-subject variance in the normalisation method.</p>
<p>The work, therefore, continues to highlight that HP 13C MRSI is a highly promising avenue of investigation to identify, characterise, and understand traumatic brain injury. It suggests that HP 13C MRSI is more promising in this sense than some standard MRI contrasts. The work currently fails to convincingly interpret the HP 13C MR results in conjunction with the other metrics.</p>
