<title>Abstract</title><p>Administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is associated with a reduced cancer risk and shows significant anti-tumor effects across multiple tumor types, suggesting the potential for repurposing SSRIs in cancer therapy. Nonetheless, the specific molecular target and mechanism of action of SSRIs remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we reveal that citalopram exerts an immune-dependent anti-tumor effects in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, the anti-HCC effects of citalopram are not reliant on its conventional target, the serotonin transporter. Through various drug repurposing approaches, including global reverse gene expression profiling, drug affinity responsive target stability assay, and molecular docking, the complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) is identified as a new target of citalopram. C5aR1 is predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and citalopram treatment enhances local macrophage phagocytosis and elicits CD8<sup>+</sup> T anti- tumor immunity. At a systemic level, citalopram treatment results in decreased serum 5-HT levels, which correlates with increased activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Additionally, citalopram promotes αCD3/αCD28-stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. Depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells partially hinders the anti-HCC effects of citalopram. Collectively, our study reveals multiple immunomodulatory roles of citalopram in inducing anti-tumor immunity, and provides a basis for considering the repurposing of SSRIs as promising anticancer agents for HCC treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The development of anti-tumor drugs encounters numerous challenges, such as a high failure rate, substantial costs, limited bioavailability, safety concerns, and lengthy design and testing procedures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. As different diseases may share common pathological mechanisms, there is a growing focus on repurposing existing drugs for new applications, referred to as “new uses for old drugs” <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Additionally, exploring new disease-relevant targets for established drugs and broadening their indications offers significant translational value <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; i.e., citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) are frequently prescribed to treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, and chronic pain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. SSRIs target the serotonin transporter (SERT, encoded by the <italic>SLC6A4</italic> gene), blocking the reuptake of serotonin (5- hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) into the presynaptic neuron, ultimately increasing 5-HT levels in the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Recent population-based epidemiological studies suggest that SSRIs have the potential to reduce the risk of many cancers, including kidney, breast, colorectal, and liver cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The anxiety and depression symptoms among cancer patients is increasingly recognized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Considering the established safety profile and known side effects of SSRIs, repurposing these drugs as potential anti-tumor agents, particularly for cancer patients with comorbid depression, could offer dual benefits. This approach may not only help improve neurological function but also potentially impede tumor progression. Hence, repurposing SSRIs in this context could present a cost-effective option. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of actions responsible for the anti-tumor effects of SSRIs are still largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, using hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as a model, we revealed that citalopram, an SSRI, exhibits anti-tumor properties not through its traditional target SERT, but instead via partially immune-dependent mechanisms. Through a comprehensive approach involving global reverse gene expression profiling, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and molecular docking analyses, we identified the complement component 5a receptor 1 (C5aR1), predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as a target of citalopram. C5aR1 play critical roles in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and boosting the metastatic potential of cancer cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Given its significant impact on cancer progression, C5aR1 has surfaced as a promising therapeutic target for potential cancer interventions. Here, we further elucidated the mechanism underlying the connection between C5aR1<sup>+</sup> TAMs and citalopram-related phenotypes. Additionally, after citalopram treatment, a decline in serum 5-HT levels was observed, which is linked to the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. More importantly, citalopram directly stimulates CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Collectively, the anti-tumor effects of citalopram in HCC involve multiple immune-dependent mechanisms.</p>

<title>The immune-dependent anti-tumor effects of citalopram in HCC</title>
<p>To evaluate the therapeutic effects of citalopram, we engrafted mouse Hepa1-6 and Hep53.4 cells into different strains of recipient mice, including the immune-competent C57BL/6 mice and immune-compromised Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Citalopram was given by i.p. administration daily for 30 days after bearing palpable tumors (∼50 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>). Tumor growth was significantly retarded in both two mouse models. Of note, this impairment was more pronounced in immune- competent C57BL/6 mice, indicating an immune-dependent effect of citalopram (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref>- B). This finding was further validated at molecular levels, as evidenced by reduced staining of the proliferation index Ki67 and increased expression of cleaved caspase 3 (CCS3) (Figure S1).</p>

<p>As SERT is the known target of SSRIs, we tested the therapeutic effect of citalopram in the absence of SERT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C-D</xref>). In mouse HCC cells, SERT knockdown failed to affect cell proliferation or cell apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E-F</xref> and S2A-B). However, citalopram delayed the growth of SERT-silenced HCC tumors, and its suppressive effect was more proficient in immune-competent hosts compared with Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> ones (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E-F</xref> and S2C-F). Together, these data suggest that citalopram might target other molecules instead of SERT to exhibit an immune-dependent anti-tumor effects in HCC.</p>

<title>C5aR1 is a direct target of citalopram</title>
<p>Previously, using drug-induced gene signature networks and target prediction method, we identified a repertoire of targets related to citalopram treatment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The top two hits are glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and C5aR1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-B</xref>). Citalopram can reverse the Warburg effect to inhibit HCC by targeting GLUT1 directly <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Considering the significant role of C5aR1 in immune modulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, we investigated whether the immune-dependent anti- tumor effects of citalopram are mediated through C5aR1. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the positive staining of C5aR1 was predominantly found in scattered immune cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Single-cell sequencing data indicated that C5aR1 was expressed at higher levels in monocytes/macrophages within the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with other cell types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Co-immunofluorescence analysi corroborated that CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages presented significant C5aR1 immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<p>The DARTS assay is widely recognized technique used to identify potential protein targets for small molecules. This approach involves conferring proteolytic protection of target proteins by their interaction with small molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Combined DARTS assay with immunoblotting analysis, we investigated the stability of C5aR1 against pronase in the presence or absence of citalopram treatment. Because C5aR1 is expressed by macrophages, THP-1 cells were employed for the DARTS assay. Citalopram did not affect the basal protein level of C5aR1 in macrophages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). However, citalopram could enhance the stability of C5aR1 against pronase treatment. Of note, this effect was specific to C5aR1, as citalopram did not impact the proteolytic susceptibility of β-actin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>). Moreover, the stability of C5aR1 against pronase was enhanced in a dose-dependent manner following treatment with citalopram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2G</xref>). Besides citalopram, other 5 SSRIs (escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline) also played protective roles of C5aR1 against pronase (Figure S3A).</p>
<p>To address citalopram/C5aR1 interaction, <italic>in silico</italic> docking analysis was conducted. Previous studies revealed two different inhibitor-binding sites in C5aR1, namely, the orthosteric site on the extracellular side and the allosteric site outside the transmembrane bundle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, we docked the structure of citalopram into both orthosteric and allosteric sites of human C5aR1 (PDB id: 6C1Q), respectively. <italic>In silico</italic> docking of citalopram into the orthosteric site predicted two binding conformations without overlap (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2H</xref> and S3B). In pose-1, the fluorophenyl and the cyanophtalane group of citalopram stacked with the side chains of Y258 and R206, and the amino group of citalopram interacted with the negatively charged residue E199 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, left). In pose-2, two negatively charged residues, D282 and D37, surrounded the amino group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, middle). Considering the accessibility, D282 orienting towards the binding cavity of C5aR1 might play a more pivotal role in the citalopram binding event proposed by pose-2. Additionally, the cyanophtalane group of citalopram interacted with hydrophobic residues L92 and P113 of C5aR1. The fluorine was inserted into a narrow space lying over the side chain of W102 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, right). For the allosteric site, residue W213 played a critical role in inhibitor binding via hydrogen-bond interactions established by the amino group in the indole ring <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. According to the best pose from cluster 2, the citalopram formed a hydrogen-bond via the oxygen atom in the cyanophtalane group with W213 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, right). Inspired by these molecular docking results, we generated six C5aR1 mutants to figure out the real binding site of citalopram in HEK293T cells (Figure S3C). Indeed, citalopram had no protective effects on C5aR1 stability with the transfection of HA- C5aR1 E199 and D282 mutant against pronase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Consistently, mutations on E199 and D282 reduce C5a binding affinity to C5aR1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Furthermore, docking analysis and DARTS assay revealed that other four SSRIs could bind to the D282 site of C5aR1 (Figures S3D-E). These findings demonstrate that SSRIs adopt the orthosteric site to bind to C5aR1 and electrostatic interactions between C5aR1 D282 and the amino groups of SSRIs play an instrumental role in the binding mechanisms.</p>

<title>Citalopram targets C5aR1 in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs)</title>
<p>C5aR1, the receptor for anaphylatoxin C5a, is profoundly implicated in tumor progression via inducing an immunosuppressive microenvironment in which TAMs are involved <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. As C5aR1 is localized in TAMs within the TME of HCC, we explored whether citalopram exerted anti- tumor functions by targeting C5aR1 on TAMs. Given that citalopram also targets GLUT1 in HCC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, we generated a Hepa1-6 clone with complete knockdown of GLUT1 (GLUT1<sup>KD</sup>) to dissect C5aR1-dependent roles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, citalopram displayed an inhibitory effect on GLUT1<sup>KD</sup> tumors in immune-component C57BL/6 mice but not Rag1<sup>-/-</sup> ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), underscoring the contribution of C5aR1. To delineate the involvement of macrophages, we first depleted mouse macrophages with clodro-Liposomes and found that citalopram was ineffective in controlling GLUT1<sup>KD</sup> tumors (Figure S4), implying the influences of citalopram on macrophages. As the second line of evidence, we engrafted GLUT1<sup>KD</sup> Hepa1-6 cells into the syngeneic <italic>C5ar</italic>1<sup>+/-</sup> and <italic>C5ar</italic>1<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Compared with <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> recipients, tumor growth was attenuated in <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> recipients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), whereas C5a deposition remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).

<p>To answer how C5aR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages mediate citalopram-induced anti-tumor effects, we probed macrophage functions. Phagocytosis assay showed that isolated TAMs from <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> recipients had higher phagocytic capacity of HCC cells than that of <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> recipients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), and citalopram increased the phagocytosis of TAMs from r<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; d<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, C5a-mediated macrophage phagocytic impairment was reversed by C5aR1 knockdown or treatment with citalopram or different SSRIs (Figures S5A-C). C5a was able to suppress, while citalopram was effective in bolstering phagocytosis in macrophages expressing C5aR1<sup>WT</sup> but not C5aR1<sup>D282A</sup> (Figures S5D-E). Despite several residues of mouse C5aR1 protein being different from that of human C5aR1, citalopram shared a similar binding model with them (Figure S6). In orthotopic GLUT1<sup>KD</sup> Hepa1-6 models, flow cytometry revealed a significant reduction of TAMs in the citalopram group compared with the control group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). Moreover, TAM polarization was shifted to a proinflammatory state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). Further phenotyping of tumor immune subsets in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice showed that citalopram increased the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T and dendritic cells while decreasing the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T and B220<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). No significant changes were observed in splenic immune subsets upon citalopram treatment (Figure S7).</p>
<p>Next, we sought to understand whether C5aR1<sup>+</sup> TAMs impact on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

<p>Likewise, the frequency and cytotoxicity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell from r<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; d<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> mice were reduced compared with r<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; d<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, and this effect was partially reversed by citalopram treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M</xref>). Furthermore, depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells abrogated the effect of macrophage C5aR1 deficiency on tumor growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3N</xref>), suggesting that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are needed for the pro-tumor phenotype of C5aR1<sup>+</sup> TAMs. Clinically, data from TCGA cohort reinforced the link between C5aR1 expression and an immunosuppressive TME as demonstrated by the associations with TAMs, exhausted T cells, immune checkpoint molecules, and effector Tregs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O</xref>).</p>

<title>Citalopram-induced activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells involves a serotonergic-dependent mechanism</title>

<p>Given the wide range of peripheral 5-HT actions, we hypothesized that citalopram modulates the immune system through the serotonergic mechanisms. Indeed, citalopram administered for 2 weeks in tumor-bearing mice led to reduced serum 5-HT levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), which were accompanied with a reduction of low-grade systemic inflammatory responses in the MASH mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Compared to the control C57BL/6 mice, tumor-bearing <italic>Tph1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>mice, which lack peripheral 5-HT, exhibited slowed tumor growth and increased effector function of intratumoral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G-I</xref>). Interestingly, citalopram reduced serum 5-HT to a level as observed in <italic>Tph1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, and displayed a superior inhibitory effect on tumor growth and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function compared with that induced by <italic>Tph1</italic> deficiency (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4G</xref>- I). This finding suggests a dual immunostimulatory roles of citalopram on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, particularly the serotonergic-dependent mechanism. Next, we investigated the direct effects of citalopram on T cell activation, expansion, and cytotoxicity. Citalopram enhanced αCD3/αCD28-stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation as indicated by CFSE staining (Figure S9A). Moreover, citalopram promoted the TCR-instigated activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the generation of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as evidenced by the cell surface expression of CD44 and CD62L (Figure S9B). Likewise, the cytotoxic activity of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T was enhanced by citalopram, as reflected by GZMB, IFNγ, and TNF-α staining (Figures S9C-E).</p>
<p>Finally, to examine the immune-dependent anti-tumor effects of citalopram, we depleted either CD8<sup>+</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from GLUT1<sup>KD</sup> Hepa1-6 tumor-bearing mice and found that depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, rather than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, increased tumor growth in citalopram- treated mice but had marginal effects in control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>), showing that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are needed in the effector mechanisms of citalopram.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Repurposing approved non-oncology drugs for cancer therapy offers cost-effectiveness, an accelerated development timeline, and a known safety profile as key advantages. Accumulating studies have deciphered the inverse link between SSRIs use and cancer risk. However, there is a scarcity of studies investigating the potential repurposing SSRIs for cancer treatment and their mechanisms of action. Non-oncology drugs may have mechanisms of action that are different from traditional cancer treatments. Previously, we and others have uncovered several new targets of SSRIs, including GLUT1 in HCC, SMPD1 in glioblastoma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and VDAC1 in autophagy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Here, we further broaden the knowledge of how SSRIs impact the immune system to exert anti-tumor effects. By targeting C5aR1 on TAMs, citalopram enhances the phagocytic activity of TAMs and boosts local anti-tumor immune responses. Furthermore, treatment with citalopram results in a reduction in circulating 5-HT levels and this phenomenon is akin to the deficiency of <italic>Tph1</italic> and enhances the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, these insights shed light on the immunomodulatory role of SSRIs in the context of cancer treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<p>C5aR1 is expressed on TAMs within the TME, which helps to explain why citalopram has better anti-tumor effects in immune-competent mice. In addition to TAMs, C5aR1 is also expressed by neutrophils, mast cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in cancers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Although the functional impacts of citalopram on these C5aR1-expressing immune cells have not been formally determined, macrophage depletion assay and C5aR1<sup>-/-</sup> BMDM co-injection experiment suggested that citalopram exerted anti-tumor functions <italic>in vivo</italic> through C5aR1- expressing TAMs. C5aR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages are profoundly implicated in squamous carcinogenesis and targeting C5aR1 reprograms macrophages to recruit cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In alignment with this, citalopram treatment increased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell filtration and their cytotoxic activities in HCC, and this effect was largely dependent on C5aR1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. One possible explanation is that citalopram targets C5aR1 to enhance macrophage phagocytosis and subsequent antigen presentation and/or cytokine production, which promotes T cell recruitment and activity as well as modulate other aspects of tumor immunity. Moreover, citalopram induces TAM phenotypic polarization towards to a proinflammatory state, which supports anti-tumor immune response within the TME. Therefore, we provide a mechanistic insight regarding how citalopram target C5aR1 activity in TAMs, the central findings are important to our understanding of citalopram-induced anti-tumor activities and may lay a basis for upcoming mechanistic studies aimed to decipher specific tumor-promoting roles of this defined TAM population.</p>
<p>While we highlight the anti-HCC effects of SSRIs through targeting C5aR1, it is possible that SSRIs impact tumor progression by modulating the systemic environment via serotonergic mechanisms, especially concerning the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Apart from its role in regulating hemostasis, 5-HT exerts immunoregulatory functions on circulating immune cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In this study, it was observed that both citalopram treatment and <italic>Tph1</italic> deficiency enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxic activity. Consistently, peripheral 5-HT has been shown to dampen the effector functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells within tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Similarly, treatment with SSRIs such as fluoxetine increased the influx of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and reduced the growth of syngeneic pancreatic and colorectal tumors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. In addition to the traditional receptor-dependent signaling transduction, 5-HT can modulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T activity through post-translational modification known as serotonylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. It remains to be explored whether serotonylation contributes to the immunomodulatory effects of citalopram, as citalopram directly stimulates CD8+ T cell proliferation, activation, and cytotoxicity <italic>in vitro</italic>. The observed reduction in serum 5-HT levels and activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following SSRI treatment further highlight the complex interplay between neurotransmitters, the immune system, and cancer progression. Immunotherapy, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized the management of HCC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. The immune microenvironments play crucial roles in the response or resistance of HCC to immunotherapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, limited molecular biomarkers are available to guide clinical decision-making for ICI therapy of HCC. Given SSRIs can increase CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration as well as cytotoxic activities by targeting C5aR1<sup>+</sup> TAMs, one can suppose that C5aR1<sup>+</sup> TAMs within the HCC microenvironment might be used as a molecular marker for SSRIs use in combination with ICI therapy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study suggests the potential repurposing of SSRIs for the treatment of HCC and highlights C5aR1 as a direct target of citalopram. We elucidate the immune- dependent mechanisms of action of citalopram, involving the regulation of both TAMs and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Combining SSRIs with ICIs or other first-line therapies could enhance the treatment efficacy of current standard therapies.</p>

<p>For the C5aR1 knockdown study, C57BL/6J-<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>em1Cya</sup> mice were purchased from Cyagen Biosciences (S-KO-01274, Suzhou, China). 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> sh<italic>Slc2a1</italic> Hepa1-6 cells were injected into the lower back of 6-8-week-old male <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 mice. Tumor volume was measured every week using a digital caliper. Four weeks later, mice were sacrificed and xenograft tumors were analyzed.</p>
<p>To determine the association between citalopram and C5aR1, 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> GLUT1<sup>KO</sup> Hepa1-6 cells were mixed 1:1 with BMDMs (<italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) in growth factor-reduced Matrigel (#354230, Corning, Shanghai, China) and injected into the lower back of 6-8-week-old male <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> C57BL/6 mice. To acquire BMDMs, bone marrow was harvested from the femurs and tibias of <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> or <italic>C5ar1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Differentiation of BMDMs was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of F4/80 (28463-1-AP, Proteintech) and CD45 (20103-1-AP, Proteintech) expression. One week after cancer cell implantation, mice were subjected to treatment with citalopram (5 mg/kg body weight) or DMSO. At indicated time point, mice were sacrificed and xenograft tumors were analyzed.</p>
<p>In all animal studies, tumor volume was assessed using caliper measurements and calculated using the formula: tumor = 1/2(length × width<sup>^2</sup>), where length represents the largest diameter and width indicates the smallest diameter. At the experimental endpoint, mice were humanely euthanized, tumors were excised, and tumor weight was recorded. All animals received proper care in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” established by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication 86-23 revised 1985).

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides <bold>solid</bold> evidence to support the anti-tumor potential of citalopram, originally an anti-depression drug, in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In addition to their previous report on directly targeting tumor cells via glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), they tried to uncover additional working mechanisms of citalopram in HCC treatment in the current study. The data here suggested that citalopram may regulate the phagocytotic function of TAM via C5aR1 or CD8+T cell function to suppress HCC growth in vivo.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their previous publication (Dong et al. Cell Reports 2024), the authors showed that citalopram treatment resulted in reduced tumor size by binding to the E380 site of GLUT1 and inhibiting the glycolytic metabolism of HCC cells, instead of the classical citalopram receptor. Given that C5aR1 was also identified as the potential receptor of citalopram in the previous report, the authors focused on exploring the potential of the immune-dependent anti-tumor effect of citalopram via C5aR1. C5aR1 was found to be expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and citalopram administration showed potential to improve the stability of C5aR1 in vitro. Through macrophage depletion and adoptive transfer approaches in HCC mouse models, the data demonstrated the potential importance of C5aR1-expressing macrophage in the anti-tumor effect of citalopram in vivo. Mechanistically, their in vitro data suggested that citalopram may regulate the phagocytosis potential and polarization of macrophages through C5aR1. Next, they tried to investigate the direct link between citalopram and CD8+T cells by including an additional MASH-associated HCC mouse model. Their data suggest that citalopram may upregulate the glycolytic metabolism of CD8+T cells, probability via GLUT3 but not GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. Lastly, as the systemic 5-HT level is down-regulated by citalopram, the authors analyzed the association between a low 5-HT and a superior CD8+T cell function against a tumor. Although the data is informative, the rationale for working on additional mechanisms and logical links among different parts is not clear. In addition, some of the conclusion is also not fully supported by the current data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The idea of repurposing clinical-in-used drugs showed great potential for immediate clinical translation. The data here suggested that the anti-depression drug, citalopram displayed an immune regulatory role on TAM via a new target C5aR1 in HCC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors concluded that citalopram had a 'potential immune-dependent effect' based on the tumor weight difference between Rag-/- and C57 mice in Figure 1. However, tumor weight differences may also be attributed to a non-immune regulatory pathway. In addition, how do the authors calculate relative tumor weight? What is the rationale for using relative one but not absolute tumor weight to reflect the anti-tumor effect?</p>
<p>(2) The authors used shSlc6a4 tumor cell lines to demonstrate that citalopram's effects are independent of the conventional SERT receptor (Figure 1C-F). However, this does not entirely exclude the possibility that SERT may still play a role in this context, as it can be expressed in other cells within the tumor microenvironment. What is the expression profiling of Slc6a4 in the HCC tumor microenvironment? In addition, in Figure 1F, the tumor growth of shSlc6a4 in C57 mice displayed a decreased trend, suggesting a possible role of Slc6a4.</p>
<p>(3) Why did the authors choose to study phagocytosis in Figures 3G-H? As an important player, TAM regulates tumor growth via various mechanisms.</p>
<p>(4) The information on unchanged deposition of C5a has been mentioned in this manuscript (Figures 3D and 3F), the authors should explain further in the manuscript, for example, C5a could bind to receptors other than C5aR1 and/or C5a bind to C5aR1 by different docking anchors compared with citalopram.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 3I-M - the flow cytometry data suggested that citalopram treatment altered the proportions of total TAM, M1 and M2 subsets, CD4+ and CD8+T cells, DCs, and B cells. Why does the author conclude that the enhanced phagocytosis of TAM was one of the major mechanisms of citalopram? As the overall TAM number was regulated, the contribution of phagocytosis to tumor growth may be limited.</p>
<p>(6) Figure 4 - what is the rationale for using the MASH-associated HCC mouse model to study metabolic regulation in CD8+T cells? The tumor microenvironment and tumor growth would be quite different. In addition, how does this part link up with the mechanisms related to C5aR1 and TAM? The authors also brought GLUT1 back in the last part and focused on CD8+T cell metabolism, which was totally separated from previous data.</p>
<p>(7) Figure 5, the authors illustrated their mechanism that citalopram regulates CD8+T cell anti-tumor immunity through proinflammatory TAM with no experimental evidence. Using only CD206 and MHCII to represent TAM subsets obviously is not sufficient.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Dong et al. present a thorough investigation into the potential of repurposing citalopram, an SSRI, for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. The study highlights the dual mechanisms by which citalopram exerts anti-tumor effects: reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti-tumor phenotype via C5aR1 modulation and suppressing cancer cell metabolism through GLUT1 inhibition while enhancing CD8+ T cell activation. The findings emphasize the potential of drug repurposing strategies and position C5aR1 as a promising immunotherapeutic target. However, certain aspects of experimental design and clinical relevance could be further developed to strengthen the study's impact.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>It provides detailed evidence of citalopram's non-canonical action on C5aR1, demonstrating its ability to modulate macrophage behavior and enhance CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. The use of DARTS assays, in silico docking, and gene signature network analyses offers robust validation of drug-target interactions. Additionally, the dual focus on immune cell reprogramming and metabolic suppression presents a thorough strategy for HCC therapy. By emphasizing the potential for existing drugs like citalopram to be repurposed, the study also underscores the feasibility of translational applications.</p>
<p>Major weaknesses/suggestions:</p>
<p>The dataset and signature database used for GSEA analyses are not clearly specified, limiting reproducibility. The manuscript does not fully explore the potential promiscuity of citalopram's interactions across GLUT1, C5aR1, and SERT1, which could provide a deeper understanding of binding selectivity. The absence of GLUT1 knockdown or knockout experiments in macrophages prevents a complete assessment of GLUT1's role in macrophage versus tumor cell metabolism. Furthermore, there is minimal discussion of clinical data on SSRI use in HCC patients. Incorporating survival outcomes based on SSRI treatment could strengthen the study's translational relevance.</p>
<p>By addressing these limitations, the manuscript could make an even stronger contribution to the fields of cancer immunotherapy and drug repurposing.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their previous publication (Dong et al. Cell Reports 2024), the authors showed that citalopram treatment resulted in reduced tumor size by binding to the E380 site of GLUT1 and inhibiting the glycolytic metabolism of HCC cells, instead of the classical citalopram receptor. Given that C5aR1 was also identified as the potential receptor of citalopram in the previous report, the authors focused on exploring the potential of the immune-dependent anti-tumor effect of citalopram via C5aR1. C5aR1 was found to be expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and citalopram administration showed potential to improve the stability of C5aR1 in vitro. Through macrophage depletion and adoptive transfer approaches in HCC mouse models, the data demonstrated the potential importance of C5aR1-expressing macrophage in the anti-tumor effect of citalopram in vivo. Mechanistically, their in vitro data suggested that citalopram may regulate the phagocytosis potential and polarization of macrophages through C5aR1. Next, they tried to investigate the direct link between citalopram and CD8+T cells by including an additional MASH-associated HCC mouse model. Their data suggest that citalopram may upregulate the glycolytic metabolism of CD8+T cells, probability via GLUT3 but not GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake. Lastly, as the systemic 5-HT level is down-regulated by citalopram, the authors analyzed the association between a low 5-HT and a superior CD8+T cell function against a tumor. Although the data is informative, the rationale for working on additional mechanisms and logical links among different parts is not clear. In addition, some of the conclusion is also not fully supported by the current data.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for your insightful evaluation and the constructive suggestions. We have thoroughly studied the comments and a provisional point-to-point response is shown as follows.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The idea of repurposing clinical-in-used drugs showed great potential for immediate clinical translation. The data here suggested that the anti-depression drug, citalopram displayed an immune regulatory role on TAM via a new target C5aR1 in HCC.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive comments. We believe that further investigation into the mechanisms by which citalopram modulates TAM function could provide valuable insights into its potential role in HCC therapy.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors concluded that citalopram had a 'potential immune-dependent effect' based on the tumor weight difference between Rag-/- and C57 mice in Figure 1. However, tumor weight differences may also be attributed to a non-immune regulatory pathway. In addition, how do the authors calculate relative tumor weight? What is the rationale for using relative one but not absolute tumor weight to reflect the anti-tumor effect?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insights into the potential contributions of non-immune regulatory pathways to the observed tumor weight differences between Rag-/- and C57 mice, and we will further address this issue in our discussion. The relative tumor weight was calculated by assigning an arbitrary value of 1 to the <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in the DMSO treatment group, with all other tumor weights expressed relative to this baseline. As suggested, we will include absolute tumor weight data in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors used shSlc6a4 tumor cell lines to demonstrate that citalopram's effects are independent of the conventional SERT receptor (Figure 1C-F). However, this does not entirely exclude the possibility that SERT may still play a role in this context, as it can be expressed in other cells within the tumor microenvironment. What is the expression profiling of Slc6a4 in the HCC tumor microenvironment? In addition, in Figure 1F, the tumor growth of shSlc6a4 in C57 mice displayed a decreased trend, suggesting a possible role of Slc6a4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To identify the expression patterns of Slc6a4 in different cellular contexts within the HCC tumor microenvironment, we will conduct a thorough screening of HCC datasets that include single-cell sequencing analysis. The possible role of Slc6a4 on tumor growth will be verified with in vitro loss-of-function experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Why did the authors choose to study phagocytosis in Figures 3G-H? As an important player, TAM regulates tumor growth via various mechanisms.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your question. We focused on this aspect because citalopram targets C5aR1-expressing TAM. C5aR1 is a receptor for complement component C5a, and complement components play a significant role in mediating the phagocytosis process in macrophages. In the revised manuscript, we will emphasize this rationale clearly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The information on unchanged deposition of C5a has been mentioned in this manuscript (Figures 3D and 3F), the authors should explain further in the manuscript, for example, C5a could bind to receptors other than C5aR1 and/or C5a bind to C5aR1 by different docking anchors compared with citalopram.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comment. First, we will investigate the docking anchors involved in the binding of C5a to C5aR1 and compare these interactions with those of C5aR1 and citalopram. Additionally, we will discuss the potential binding of C5a to other receptors, providing a broader perspective on the signaling mechanisms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 3I-M - the flow cytometry data suggested that citalopram treatment altered the proportions of total TAM, M1 and M2 subsets, CD4+ and CD8+T cells, DCs, and B cells. Why does the author conclude that the enhanced phagocytosis of TAM was one of the major mechanisms of citalopram? As the overall TAM number was regulated, the contribution of phagocytosis to tumor growth may be limited.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we will restate the conclusion to enhance clarity and better articulate the relationship between citalopram treatment, TAM populations, and their phagocytic activity. Thank you for your valuable input.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Figure 4 - what is the rationale for using the MASH-associated HCC mouse model to study metabolic regulation in CD8+T cells? The tumor microenvironment and tumor growth would be quite different. In addition, how does this part link up with the mechanisms related to C5aR1 and TAM? The authors also brought GLUT1 back in the last part and focused on CD8+T cell metabolism, which was totally separated from previous data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose the MASH-associated HCC mouse model because it closely mimics the etiology of metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), which is a significant contributor to the development of cirrhosis and HCC. The inclusion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in our study is based on the understanding that citalopram targets GLUT1, which plays a crucial role in glucose uptake. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function is heavily reliant on glycolytic metabolism, making it essential to investigate how citalopram’s effects on GLUT1 influence the metabolic pathways and functionality of these immune cells. The data presented in this section primarily aim to demonstrate how citalopram influences peripheral 5-HT levels, which subsequently affects CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell functionality. By linking these findings, we will clarify how citalopram impacts both TAM and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In the revised manuscript, we will enhance the background information and provide relevant data support to avoid any gaps.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 5, the authors illustrated their mechanism that citalopram regulates CD8+T cell anti-tumor immunity through proinflammatory TAM with no experimental evidence. Using only CD206 and MHCII to represent TAM subsets obviously is not sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, more relevant experimental data will be included in the revised manuscript to better characterize the TAM populations and their roles in mediating the effects of citalopram on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Dong et al. present a thorough investigation into the potential of repurposing citalopram, an SSRI, for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. The study highlights the dual mechanisms by which citalopram exerts anti-tumor effects: reprogramming tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward an anti-tumor phenotype via C5aR1 modulation and suppressing cancer cell metabolism through GLUT1 inhibition while enhancing CD8+ T cell activation. The findings emphasize the potential of drug repurposing strategies and position C5aR1 as a promising immunotherapeutic target. However, certain aspects of experimental design and clinical relevance could be further developed to strengthen the study's impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful review and constructive feedback, and we look forward to improving our manuscript accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>It provides detailed evidence of citalopram's non-canonical action on C5aR1, demonstrating its ability to modulate macrophage behavior and enhance CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity. The use of DARTS assays, in silico docking, and gene signature network analyses offers robust validation of drug-target interactions. Additionally, the dual focus on immune cell reprogramming and metabolic suppression presents a thorough strategy for HCC therapy. By emphasizing the potential for existing drugs like citalopram to be repurposed, the study also underscores the feasibility of translational applications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your insights reinforce the significance of our findings, and we will ensure that these points are clearly articulated in the revised manuscript to enhance its impact.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major weaknesses/suggestions:</p>
<p>The dataset and signature database used for GSEA analyses are not clearly specified, limiting reproducibility. The manuscript does not fully explore the potential promiscuity of citalopram's interactions across GLUT1, C5aR1, and SERT1, which could provide a deeper understanding of binding selectivity. The absence of GLUT1 knockdown or knockout experiments in macrophages prevents a complete assessment of GLUT1's role in macrophage versus tumor cell metabolism. Furthermore, there is minimal discussion of clinical data on SSRI use in HCC patients. Incorporating survival outcomes based on SSRI treatment could strengthen the study's translational relevance.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>By addressing these limitations, the manuscript could make an even stronger contribution to the fields of cancer immunotherapy and drug repurposing.</p>
<p>We appreciate your valuable suggestions. As suggested, we will take the following actions:</p>
<p>(1) GSEA analysis: we will clearly specify the datasets and signature databases used for the GSEA in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) Exploration of binding selectivity: we recognize the importance of exploring the potential promiscuity of citalopram’s interactions across GLUT1, C5aR1, and SERT1. As suggested, we will include a more detailed analysis of these interactions, which will help elucidate binding selectivity and its implications for therapeutic outcomes.</p>
<p>(3) GLUT1 knockdown in macrophages: to address the gap in our assessment of GLUT1’s role in macrophages, we will incorporate GLUT1 knockdown or knockout experiments in macrophages upon citalopram treatment. Moreover, a DARTS assay for GLUT1 in THP-1 cells will be conducted.</p>
<p>(4) Clinical data on SSRI use in HCC patients: Related data have been reported previously in PMID: 39388353 (Cell Rep. 2024 Oct 22;43(10):114818.). As detailed below:</p>
<p>“SSRIs use is associated with reduced disease progression in HCC patients</p>
<p>We determined whether SSRIs for alleviating HCC are supported by real-world data. A total of 3061 patients with liver cancer were extracted from the Swedish Cancer Register. Among them, 695 patients had been administrated with post-diagnostic SSRIs. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis suggested that patients who utilized SSRIs exhibited a significantly improved metastasis-free survival compared to those who did not use SSRIs, with a P value of log-rank test at 0.0002. Cox regression analysis showed that SSRI use was associated with a lower risk of metastasis (HR = 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99).”</p>
