<title>Abstract</title><p>During oogenesis, self-renewal and differentiation of germline stem cells (GSCs) must be tightly regulated. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline serves as an excellent model for studying these regulatory mechanisms. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized gene <italic>CG14545</italic>, which we named <italic>sakura</italic>, is essential for oogenesis and female fertility in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. <italic>sakura</italic> null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of <italic>sakura</italic> impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. Additionally, <italic>sakura</italic> is necessary for normal piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for proper localization of Oo18 RNA-binding protein (Orb) in developing oocytes. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as protein binding partner of Sakura, and we found that loss of <italic>otu</italic> phenocopies loss of <italic>sakura</italic> in ovaries. Thus, we identified Sakura as a crucial factor for GSC renewal and differentiation and oogenesis, and propose that Sakura and Otu function together in these processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oogenesis is a complex process in which germline stem cells (GSCs) develop into mature female gametes or oocytes. This process involves multiple layers of regulations and numerous genes, some of which remain to be discovered and characterized. <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a genetically tractable model organism, has long been at the forefront of oogenesis research.</p>
<p>Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> females possess a pair of ovaries, each composed of 12-16 ovarioles. At the anterior tip of each ovariole is a structure called the germarium, which houses two to three GSCs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). GSCs reside in the most anterior region of the germarium, where they directly contact cap cells and escort cells, forming a niche crucial for GSC self-renewal <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. GSCs undergo asymmetric mitotic division, producing two distinct cells: one GSC and one cystoblast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. The cystoblast, destined to differentiate, undergoes four mitotic divisions with incomplete cytokinesis, resulting in interconnected cysts of 2, 4, 8, and 16 cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Of the 16 cells, one will differentiate into an oocyte, while the remaining 15 develop into polyploid nurse cells, which synthesize proteins and RNAs for deposition into the oocyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>GSC proliferation is essential for proper oogenesis. GSCs must be tightly regulated to maintain their undifferentiated state while continuing to divide and differentiate. Failure in GSC self-renewal or inappropriate differentiation leads to stem cell loss, disrupting oocyte production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Conversely, uncontrolled GSC division or defective differentiation results in an overabundance of GSC-like cells (a tumorous phenotype) and fewer differentiated cells, ultimately inhibiting oocyte production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, a precise balance between GSC self-renewal and cyst differentiation within the germarium is essential for proper oogenesis and is tightly regulated.</p>
<p>Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling plays a critical role in regulating GSC self-renewal and differentiation during <italic>Drosophila</italic> oogenesis. In the stem cell niche, GSCs are physically anchored to cap cells via adherens and gap junctions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Cap cells secrete BMP ligands, such as Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Glass bottom boat (Gbb), which are recognized by transducing receptors like Thickvein (Tkv) and Saxophone (Sax) on the GSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). Upon activation, these receptors phosphorylate a transcription factor Mad. The phosphorylated Mad (pMad) translocates into the nucleus, where it represses the transcription of <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>), a key differentiation factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Bam, a ubiquitin-associated protein, is essential for cystoblast differentiation. Dpp/BMP signaling in the niche represses <italic>bam</italic> expression, preventing GSCs from differentiating and enabling self-renew. However, as the daughter cells (cytoblasts) exit the niche, they derepress <italic>bam</italic> and initiate the differentiation program (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Tight regulation of Dpp/BMP signaling and <italic>bam</italic> expression ensures that only cells within the niche adopt GSC fate, while adjacent daughter cells differentiate into cystoblasts. Loss of <italic>bam</italic> leads to blocked differentiation and the accumulation of GSC-like cells, whereas ectopic <italic>bam</italic> expression forces GSCs differentiation, depleting the stem cell pool <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the proteins that interacts with Bam is Ovarian Tumor (Otu). Otu forms a deubiquitinase complex with Bam, which deubiquitinates Cyclin A (CycA), stabilizing CycA and promoting GSC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Otu is crucial for oogenesis and female fertility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Mutations in the <italic>otu</italic> gene cause various ovarian defects, including tumorous growths, germ cell loss, and abnormalities in oocyte determination and nurse cell dumping, indicating Otu’s importance in multiple stages of oogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which Otu functions in these processes remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to identify a novel gene required for oogenesis. Through a search for uncharacterized genes expressed exclusively in <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovaries, we discovered <italic>CG14545</italic>, a gene encoding a 114 amino acids (aa) long protein without any known functional domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). CG14545 is expressed specifically in female germline cells, including GSCs. Our genetic analysis revealed that <italic>CG14545</italic> is required for oogenesis and female fertility and plays an important intrinsic role in regulating GSCs renewal and differentiation. Additionally, CG14545 is important for the piRNA pathway. We identified Otu as a binding partner of the CG14545 protein, suggesting that both proteins may participate in the same molecular pathways to regulate GSC fate and differentiation. We named the <italic>CG14545</italic> gene <italic>sakura</italic>, meaning “cherry blossom” in Japanese, symbolizing birth and renewal.</p>

<title>Sakura is exclusively expressed in the ovaries</title>
<p>Based on high-throughput expression data in Flybase, <italic>sakura</italic> mRNA is highly and exclusively expressed in adult ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To investigate Sakura protein expression, we generated a polyclonal anti-Sakura antibody against a recombinant full-length Sakura protein. Using this antibody, we examine Sakura protein expression at different stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> development and across tissues. We found that Sakura protein is specifically expressed in the ovary, particularly in stage 1-11 oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>sakura</italic> mutant flies</title>
<p>To explore the biological and molecular functions of Sakura <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated a <italic>sakura</italic> mutant allele (<italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic>) with a one nucleotide (nt) insertion replacing 33 nts within the Sakura coding region using the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This mutation causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon, resulting in a 33-amino acid (aa) N-terminal fragment of Sakura followed by a 22-aa segment produced by frameshifted translation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). This truncated fragment is unlikely to be functional, and we were unable to detect stable protein expression, as shown below. Thus, we consider this allele a null mutation. <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> flies were viable, revealing that Sakura is not essential for survival.</p>
<p>To validate the <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> strain, we performed Western blots using ovary lysates from <italic>sakura</italic> mutant flies using the anti-Sakura antibody. As expected, full-length Sakura protein was detected in the ovaries of wild-type (<italic>sakura<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) and heterozygous controls (<italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic>), but not in those of homozygous mutants (<italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). No smaller protein corresponding to the truncated Sakura fragment was detected in either <italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic> or <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovaries thus, suggesting that the fragment is unstable or not expressed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Sakura is cytoplasmic and expressed specifically in germ cells</title>
<p>To determine the localization of Sakura protein within the ovaries, we generated transgenic flies carrying a <italic>sakura</italic> coding sequence fused with EGFP at the C-terminus (<italic>sakura-</italic>EGFP) under the control of the <italic>sakura</italic> promoter. Western blot analysis of ovary lysates showed that Sakura-EGFP is expressed at levels comparable to endogenous Sakura (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Confocal imaging revealed that Sakura<italic>-</italic>EGFP is specifically expressed in the cytoplasm of germ cells, including GSCs, cyst cells, nurse cells, and developing oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). Sakura-EGFP was not expressed in somatic cells such as terminal filament, cap cells, escort cells, or follicle cells. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). In the egg chamber, Sakura-EGFP was detected in the cytoplasm of nurse cells and was enriched in developing oocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title><italic>sakura</italic> is essential for female fertility</title>
<p>Given its ovary-specific expression at both mRNA and protein levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), we hypothesized that Sakura plays a critical role in ovarian function. Fertility assays revealed that <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> females laid no eggs when mated with wild-type males, while control female flies (<italic>sakura</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic>) laid numerous eggs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Dissection of <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic>ovaries revealed that they were rudimentary compared to normal ovaries in controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). This suggests that the inability of <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> female to lay eggs is due to their underdeveloped ovaries. In contrast, <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> males were fertile and showed no significant differences compared to controls (<italic>sakura<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To confirm that the observed female sterility was caused by the loss of <italic>sakura</italic>, we generated <italic>sakura</italic> rescue flies expressing Sakura-EGFP in the <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> background (<italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic>; <italic>sakura-EGFP</italic>). Western blotting confirmed that these flies expressed Sakura-EGFP, but not endogenous Sakura (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). The <italic>sakura-EGFP</italic> transgene fully rescued both female fertility and ovary morphology in the <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> background (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). <italic>sakura-EGFP</italic> rescue females showed no significant fertility differences compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>), and their ovaries were normal in shape and size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). We concluded that Sakura is essential for female fertility and normal ovary morphology but dispensable for male fertility, consistent with the observation that Sakura is predominantly expressed in ovarian germline cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovaries are germless and tumorous</title>
<p>Given the rudimentary appearance of <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovaries, we questioned whether they contained germ cells. We used flies carrying <italic>vasa-EGFP</italic> knocked-in reporter in the <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> background, as Vasa is a known germ cell marker<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We observed that some <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovarioles were devoid of germ cells (&quot;germless&quot;), while others retained germ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), suggesting that loss of <italic>sakura</italic> leads to germ cell depletion. Additionally, <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovaries exhibited significantly higher levels of cleaved Caspase-3 staining, indicative of apoptosis, compared to controls (<italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Oogenesis begins in the germarium, which contains 2-3 GSCs identified by round, unbranched spectrosomes that contact cap cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). In contrast, cysts have branched fusomes. Immunostaining with hu-li tai shao (HTS) antibody, which marks spectrosomes and fusomes, revealed an excess number of GSC-like cells with round spectrosomes in <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovarioles containing germ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, red stars), indicative of a &quot;tumorous&quot; phenotype as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Additionally, we observed an excess number of cyst cells with branched fusomes that persisted throughout the ovarioles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting abnormal cyst cell differentiation and division.</p>
<p>Within the same ovary, some <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovarioles exhibited the tumorous phenotype, while others were germless, without any spectrosome or fusome staining (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, green stars). Quantification revealed that 35% of <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovarioles were tumorous while the remaining 65% were germless (n=74) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). In contrast, no tumorous or germless phenotypes were observed in control (<italic>sakura<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic>) or <italic>sakura-EGFP</italic> rescue flies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Furthermore, ∼95% of <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> ovarioles with germ cells contained excess GSC-like cells (&gt;5) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig S3</xref>). The mean number of GSCs or GSC-like cells for <italic>sakura<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>sakura<sup>null/+</sup></italic>, and <italic>sakura-EGFP</italic> rescue was 2.2 ± 0.6, 2.2 ± 0.6, and 2.1 ± 0.7, respectively while that for <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> was 26.5 ± 17.5 (p-value &lt;0.05). These results suggest that Sakura is essential for regulating GSC division and differentiation. Overall, we conclude that Sakura is required for germ cell survival, division, and differentiation.</p>

<title>Loss of <italic>sakura</italic> results in reduced germline piRNA</title>
<p>Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are produced in germline cells and somatic follicle cells and transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally silence transposon expression through sequence-complementarity. Disruption of the piRNA pathway can result in oogenesis arrest, germ cell loss, rudimentary ovaries, and sterility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Loss of piRNAs in germ cells leads to the upregulation (desilencing) of transposons, increased DNA damage, and apoptotic cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We investigated whether the loss of <italic>sakura</italic> would result in loss of piRNA and transposon upregulation.

<p>To explore this possibility, we used <italic>TOsk-Gal4</italic> (a combination of <italic>osk-Gal4</italic> and <italic>αTub67C-Gal4</italic>) to drive <italic>sakura</italic> RNAi knockdown in germline cells after the germline cyst stage (from germarium region 2b onward. <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>), sparing GSCs and germline cysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Unlike <italic>NGT-Gal4</italic>, <italic>TOsk-Gal4</italic>-driven <italic>sakura</italic> RNAi knockdown did not drastically affect ovary morphology (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>), allowing us to study the effects of <italic>sakura</italic> loss in egg chambers.

<p>Interestingly, <italic>TOsk-Gal4</italic>-driven <italic>sakura</italic> RNAi knockdown severely reduced the numbers of eggs laid (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>) and stage 14 oocytes in ovaries compared to control RNAi (<italic>y<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>), suggesting that <italic>sakura</italic> is important for oogenesis beyond the germline cyst stage.

<title>Sakura is required intrinsically for GSC establishment, maintenance, and differentiation</title>
<p>To explore whether <italic>sakura</italic> functions autonomously in the germline, we conducted mosaic analysis using the FLP-FRT system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. First, we assessed its role in GSC establishment by marking <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> clones in primordial germ cells (PGCs)) before the early third instar larval stage and tracking their development into adult GSCs, as described in a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.

<p>Next, we assessed GSC maintenance by generating marked <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic>GSCs in adult flies using the FLP-FRT system and measuring their loss rate over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.

<p>To further confirm this finding, we used the FLP-FRT technique to induce <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> clones in the germaria and stained them with anti-Bam antibody<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. All <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> clones expressed Bam throughout the germarium, whereas in control clones, Bam was not expressed in the GSCs and was restricted to cyst cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). In GSCs, pMad translocates into the nucleus to repress Bam expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>).

This indicates that the dysregulated Bam expression observed in <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic>was due to reduced pMad levels in GSCs.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of a stable form of CyA leads to germ cell loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. This germ cell loss phenotype is also observed upon ectopic <italic>bam</italic> expression in GSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. It was reported that Bam associates with Ovarian tumor (Otu) to promote deubiquitination and stabilization of CycA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Since we observed derepressed <italic>bam</italic> expression in <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> cells, we investigated whether CycA levels were affected. Staining ovaries with anti-CycA antibodies revealed higher CycA intensity in <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> clones compared to neighboring wild-type cells in the same germarium and control clones in control germarium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> clones exhibited significantly higher mean CycA intensity compared to control clones (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). The elevated CycA levels in <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic>clones likely results from Bam misexpression and Bam-mediated stabilization.</p>
<p>Finally, we tested whether we could rescue the germless phenotype caused by <italic>sakura</italic> loss-of-function by knocking down either <italic>bam</italic> or <italic>cycA</italic> in the germline. Double RNAi knockdown of <italic>sakura</italic> and <italic>bam</italic> in the germline using <italic>UAS-Dcr-2</italic> and <italic>NGT-Gal4</italic> partially rescued the germless phenotype (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).

The 98kDa isoform lacks Tudor domain encoded in an alternatively spliced 126-bp exon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.

The major Otu isoform observed in the inputs and immunoprecipitates from ovaries in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref> corresponds to the 98 kDa isoform.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to identify which regions of Sakura and Otu are important for their interaction. We predicted the structure of the Sakura-Otu protein complex using AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. AlphaFold suggests that the N-terminal region of Sakura (1-49aa) and the N-terminal region of Otu (1-405aa) are highly likely to form interactions, while the C-terminal region of Sakura (100-144aa) does not interact with Otu (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A-C</xref>). The Tudor domain of Otu is not directly involved in this interaction. To experimentally validate the predictions made by AlphaFold, we generated a series of truncated Otu fragments, including Otu(ΔTudor) (1-336, 389-853aa, corresponding to the endogenous 98 kDa isoform), Otu(N1) (1-405aa), Otu(N2) (1-339aa), and Otu(C) (405-853aa) (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10B</xref>). We then performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to test which fragments could interact with full-length Sakura. All fragments except Otu(C) were associated with full-length Sakura protein in S2 cells (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10D</xref>), demonstrating that the C-terminal low-complexity region of Otu is dispensable for the interaction. This assay also showed that the Tudor domain is not critical and the N-terminal fragment (1-339aa) of Otu is sufficient for interaction with Sakura. These findings align well with the predictions made by AlphaFold.</p>

We found that Sakura(NM), Sakura(NC), Sakura(N), and Sakura(M) were associated with Otu (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E</xref>). Compared to Sakura(NM) and Sakura(N), the interaction of Sakura(M) with Otu is relatively weaker, as indicated by a fainter band in the Western blot (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E</xref>). Sakura-NC exhibited a weak interaction with Otu, while Sakura(MC) and Sakura(C) showed no interaction (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10E</xref>). These assays demonstrated that the N-terminal region (1-49aa) of Sakura is sufficient for interaction with Otu. Moreover, the results suggest that the C-terminal region of Sakura (100-144aa) does not interact with Otu and that adjoining it with the N-terminal (1-49aa) or the middle (M) region (49-100aa) weakens the interaction with Otu. These findings support the AlphaFold predictions.</p>
<p>Finally, to test whether the interaction between Sakura and Otu can be achieved solely through their N-terminal regions, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assay with Sakura(N) and Otu(N2). We discovered that they interact each other (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10F</xref>). A reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assay also confirmed their interaction (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig S5</xref>), revealing that the interaction between Sakura and Otu can be established with just the 1-49aa of Sakura and the 1-339aa of Otu. Therefore, we conclude that Sakura interacts with Otu <italic>in vivo,</italic> and the N-terminal regions of both proteins are sufficient for their interaction.</p>

<p>Having established the interaction between Sakura and Otu, we were interested in whether they function together during oogenesis. We speculated that for them to interact and function together, Sakura and Otu must exhibit similar expression and localization patterns in ovaries. We generated two transgenic flies carrying full-length <italic>otu-EGFP</italic> or <italic>otu(ΔTudor)-EGFP</italic> transgenes; both constructs are C-terminally fused with EGFP and under the control of the <italic>otu</italic> promoter.

Like Sakura-EGFP, Otu-EGFP and Otu(ΔTudor)-EGFP are specifically expressed in germ cells, but not in follicle cells, and are localized to the cytoplasm, being enriched in the developing oocytes (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11A</xref>). We did not observe any difference in localization patterns between Otu-EGFP and Otu(ΔTudor)-EGFP; suggesting that the Tudor domain is not crucial for Otu protein localization. Notably, the localization pattern exhibited by the transgenic Otu-EGFP generated in this study is consistent with a previous report <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that mutations in <italic>otu</italic> lead to severe defects in germ cell division and differentiation, resulting in a tumorous phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. To study the role of <italic>otu</italic> specifically in the germline, we performed RNAi knockdown of <italic>otu</italic> in the germline driven by <italic>nos-Gal4-VP16</italic>. Interestingly, we found that germline depletion of <italic>otu</italic> results in rudimentary ovaries, similar to the loss of <italic>sakura</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>, and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>). Furthermore, similar to <italic>sakura</italic> RNAi (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>)<italic>, TOsk-Gal4</italic>-driven <italic>otu</italic> RNAi knockdown did not affect ovary morphology (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11B</xref>), but it did result in a reduced number of eggs laid and stage 14 oocytes compared with control RNAi (<italic>w<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11C</xref> and <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11D</xref>).</p>
<p>When <italic>sakura</italic> and <italic>otu</italic> were independently RNAi-knockdowned in the germline driven by <italic>UAS-Dcr2</italic> and <italic>NGT-Gal4</italic>, the percentages of germless ovaries for <italic>otu-RNAi</italic> and <italic>sakura-RNAi</italic> were similar (∼70%) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). However, when <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>sakura</italic> were knocked down together, the percentage of germless ovaries increased significantly to 79% (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>), suggesting that the double knockdown of <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>sakura</italic> enhances the germless phenotype in the ovaries.</p>
<p>Next, we used the <italic>Burdock</italic> sensor to test if loss of <italic>otu</italic> leads to loss of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing in the germline. Similar to <italic>sakura</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), germline depletion of <italic>otu</italic> resulted in elevated GFP and β-Gal produced by the <italic>Burdock</italic> sensor (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11E</xref>), indicating loss of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing. To determine if germ cell loss caused by <italic>otu</italic>-<italic>RNAi</italic> is a result of apoptosis, we stained the rudimentary ovaries of <italic>otu-RNAi</italic> for cleaved Caspase-3. Similar to <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), cleaved Caspase-3 signals were higher in <italic>otu-RNAi</italic> ovaries than in controls, suggesting that the observed germ cell loss is due to apoptosis (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig 11F</xref>).</p>
<p>Loss of <italic>sakura</italic> leads to misexpression of <italic>bam,</italic> likely due to low levels of pMad in the germ cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A-C</xref>).

In the <italic>otu</italic> germline RNAi knockdown ovaries, we found that Bam-GFP expression is not restricted to the germarium but persists throughout the ovariole, resulting in an excess number of Bam-GFP-positive cells (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig 12A</xref>). We also observed lower pMad levels in <italic>otu<sup>14/14</sup></italic> mutant GSCs (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig 12B</xref>). These data suggest that, similar to <italic>sakura</italic>, loss of <italic>otu</italic> results in <italic>bam</italic> derepression, likely due to low levels of pMad in the germ cells.</p>

<p>A previous study has shown that Otu possesses deubiquitinase activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We asked whether Sakura regulates the Otu’s deubiquitinase activity. To test this, we performed an in vitro deubiquitination assay using Ub-Rhodamine 110 as a model substrate. Consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, we detected a deubiquitinase activity in Otu that was ectopically expressed and purified from S2 cells (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6</xref>). The presence of Sakura, purified from <italic>E.coli,</italic> did not affect Otu’s deubiquitinase activity under these assay conditions. Additionally, Sakura itself did not exhibit deubiquitinase activity.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings show that <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>sakura</italic> phenocopy each other in ovaries, specifically in regulating germ cell maintenance and differentiation, raising the possibility that they function together.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified Sakura, encoded by a previously uncharacterized gene <italic>CG14545</italic>, as an essential factor for oogenesis and female fertility. We demonstrated that Sakura is specifically expressed in germline cells in the ovary, including GSCs, is localized to the cytoplasm, and is enriched in the developing oocytes. <italic>sakura</italic> homozygous null mutant flies are viable but completely female-sterile and male-fertile. Loss of <italic>sakura</italic>, either through null mutation or germline RNAi including in GSCs, results in rudimentary ovaries exhibiting germless and tumorous phenotypes.</p>
<p>The tumorous phenotype associated with the loss of <italic>sakura</italic> is characterized by an excess of GSC-like cells, which feature round spectrosomes, as well as cyst cells with branched fusomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). The increased number of GSC-like cells in loss of <italic>sakura</italic> suggests dysregulation of GSC self-renewal and differentiation. Meanwhile, the presence of excess cyst cells with branched fusomes indicates abnormal differentiation and division of cysts. Differentiation of cystoblasts typically involves four mitotic divisions with incomplete cytokinesis, leading to 16 cyst cells interconnected by branched fusomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. The degree of fusome branching serves as a marker for the stages of cyst cell division, with increased branching from 2-cell to 16-cell cysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, fusomes begin to degenerate and disappear after 16-cell cysts as the germline cyst enters the meiotic zone or region 2 of the germarium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. The persistence of cyst cells with branched fusomes in <italic>sakura<sup>null/null</sup></italic> suggests that <italic>sakura</italic> is crucial for the proper division and differentiation of cysts, and we speculate that it is required for germline cysts to enter meiotic division.</p>
<p>Mosaic analysis of <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> indicates that <italic>sakura</italic> is intrinsically required for establishing GSCs in the ovaries. A significantly reduced number of <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> marked GSCs were observed at the adult stage when mutant clones were induced in PGC stages, suggesting that many <italic>sakura</italic> mutant PGCs die before developing into GSCs. Furthermore, after inducing <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> clones in adult ovaries, the number of marked <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> GSCs decreased at a higher rate than controls, indicating a rapid loss of <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> GSCs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Thus, <italic>sakura</italic> is also intrinsically necessary for maintaining GSCs. Additionally, germaria containing <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> GSCs became increasingly tumorous over time, with a growing number of <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> GSC-like cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). This suggests that <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> GSCs undergo uncontrolled division, becoming more tumorous over time, which eventually triggers an intrinsic cell death mechanism, as evidenced by elevated levels of cleaved Caspase-3 in <italic>sakura<sup>null</sup></italic> ovaries (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>Dpp/BMP signaling governs GSC self-renewal and cystoblast differentiation by repressing <italic>bam</italic> in GSCs and de-repressing it in daughter cystoblasts (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1</xref>). This process is mediated by the transcription factor Mad, which, when phosphorylated (pMad), translocates into the nucleus to repress <italic>bam</italic> transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Our findings indicate that Bam expression is not limited to 8-cell cysts but continues throughout the germarium in ovaries lacking <italic>sakura</italic> function (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>). The persistent expression of Bam is likely due to low levels of pMad in GSCs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>, and 7D). Given the low pMad levels observed upon loss of <italic>sakura</italic>, we believe that the misregulation of Bam expression occurs primarily at the transcriptional level, although it has also been reported that Bam expression can be regulated post-transcriptionally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Transposons are mobile genetic elements that, if not silenced, can generate DNA damage and genomic instability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. piRNAs derived from transposons and other repeats can target and silence transposon RNAs to preserve genome integrity in germ cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Loss of piRNAs leads to transposon derepression, resulting in increased DNA damage, which subsequently triggers cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Genetic damage in germ cells can cause developmental defects and diseases that may be inherited by the next generation. Thus, elimination of defective germ cells is crucial for maintaining germline integrity of a species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. We found that loss of <italic>sakura</italic> results in reduced piRNA levels and loss of piRNA-mediated transposon silencing in the germline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). The observed apoptosis, indicated by elevated cleaved Caspase-3 levels in <italic>sakura</italic> mutant ovaries (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), suggest that desilencing of transposon due to reduced piRNA levels likely results in increased DNA damage, triggering cell death. We speculate that the germless phenotype in <italic>sakura</italic> mutants may partly arise from an apoptotic germline elimination program activated to maintain germline integrity. Loss of <italic>piwi</italic>, a key component of the piRNA pathway, similarly causes GSC-like tumors, as well as reduced <italic>bam</italic> expression and elevated pMad expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. While downregulation of <italic>bam</italic> and upregulation of pMad in <italic>piwi</italic> mutant is opposite to upregulation of <italic>bam</italic> and downregulation of pMad in <italic>sakura</italic> mutant, defects in the piRNA pathway might be a shared underlying cause for the dysregulation of <italic>bam</italic> and pMad levels in both cases, leading to tumorous phenotype.</p>
<p>In addition to its expression in GSCs and cysts in the germarium, Sakura is also expressed in germline cells in later-stage egg chambers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E-F</xref>) and is required at this stage for proper oogenesis. When Sakura is depleted from region 2b of the germarium onward, while leaving GSCs and early cyst cells intact, female flies lay significantly fewer eggs and have fewer stage 14 oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). The failure to produce stage 14 oocytes likely results from the Orb mislocalization in developing oocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Orb is an RNA-binding protein crucial for egg chamber formation, oocyte specification, and polarity establishment during oogenesis by regulating mRNA localization and translation, such as that of <italic>oskar</italic>, which is vital for establishing oocyte anterior-posterior polarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Interestingly, piRNA pathway mutants exhibit Orb mislocalization in developing oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Therefore, reduced piRNA levels observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) may underlie the Orb mislocalization in loss of <italic>sakura</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Sakura does not possess any known protein domains, complicating investigations into its molecular function. To infer its function, we identified interacting proteins through immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. We identified Otu, a protein known to be crucial for oogenesis, as a protein partner of Sakura. Mutations in <italic>otu</italic> gene lead to a range of ovarian phenotypes, including germ cell loss, tumorous egg chambers filled with undifferentiated germ cells, abnormalities in nurse cell chromosome structure, and defects in oocyte determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. We showed that germline depletion of Otu via RNAi phenocopies loss of <italic>sakura</italic>. Similar to Sakura, loss of <italic>otu</italic> inhibits Dpp/BMP signaling, resulting in low pMad levels in GSCs and Bam de-repression (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig 12A-B</xref>). Additionally, loss of <italic>otu</italic> also results in the loss of piRNA-mediated silencing, paralleling the effects of <italic>sakura</italic> loss. Furthermore, germline knockdown of <italic>otu</italic> yielded a similar ratio of germless ovaries as seen in <italic>sakura-RNAi,</italic> and simultaneous knockdown of both <italic>otu</italic> and <italic>sakura</italic> exacerbated the germless ovary phenotype (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that Sakura and Otu function together to regulate germ cell maintenance in the ovaries and are involved in Dpp/BMP signaling to balance stem cell renewal and differentiation.</p>
<p>Otu possesses deubiquitinase activity, catalyzed by its N-terminal Otu domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In germ cells, Otu interacts with Bam, forming a deubiquitinase complex that deubiquitinates and thereby stabilizes CycA, promoting GSC differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The predicted structure of Sakura and Otu complex suggests that the Mid domain of Sakura directly contacts the Otu domain of Otu (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig 10A</xref>). We found that Sakura lacks a deubiquitinase activity and it does not directly affect Otu’s deubiquitinase rate in our in vitro assays using Ub-Rhodamine 110 as a substrate (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig S6</xref>). This does not preclude the possibility that Sakura may still influence Otu’s deubiquitinase activity, potentially guiding Otu to its substrate and determining substrate specificity. Our in vitro assays may not have detected such specificity changes. Otu is also an RNA-binding protein, and its deubiquitinase activity can be enhanced by bound RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Future studies should explore whether Sakura regulates Otu’s RNA-binding or other RNA-related functions. Notably, while Otu is expressed in various tissues, including testes and gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, Sakura is exclusively expressed in ovaries, particularly in germline cells such as GSCs, Therefore, Sakura may enhance Otu’s functions specific to female germline cells. We believe that identifying Otu’s deubiquitinase substrates and its RNA partners, along with investigating Sakura’s role in these processes, will deepen our understanding of Sakura’s and Otu’s molecular functions in oogenesis. One speculative hypothesis is that Sakura may regulate Otu’s deubiquitinase activity concerning piRNA pathway proteins crucial for proper piRNA production and function.</p>
<p>In summary, this study identifies and characterizes the previously unknown gene <italic>sakura</italic>, which is specifically expressed in female germ cells and is essential for oogenesis and female fertility. Together with its protein partner Otu, Sakura likely regulates germline cell fate, maintenance, and differentiation</p>

<p>We expressed a recombinant full-length Sakura protein as an N-terminal 6xHis-tagged protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> using a modified pET vector and purified it using Ni-sepharose (GE Healthcare) and HiTrapQ HP (GE Healthcare) columns, as we previously performed for other proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Recombinant Otu fragments (145-405aa and 406-853aa) were similarly expressed as N-terminally 6xHis-MBP-fusion proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified using Ni-sepharose. These purified proteins were used as antigens to generate polyclonal anti-Sakura and anti-Otu sera in rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farm &amp; Laboratory, Inc.). The rabbit polyclonal anti-Sakura antibodies were affinity purified using His-MBP-Sakura recombinant protein and Affigel-15 (Bio-rad), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Rabbit anti-Otu sera were first pre-cleared with purified His-MBP protein bound to Affigel-15, and the unbound fraction was affinity purified using purified His-MBP-Otu fragments (145-405aa and 406-853aa) and Affigel-15.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Stereomicroscope images of dissected ovaries were taken using Leica M125 stereomicrocsope<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Ovaries from 2- to 5-day-old, yeast-fed females were hand-dissected in 1X PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) at room temperature. The dissected ovaries were fixed in a fixative buffer (4% formaldehyde, 15 mM PIPES (pH 7.0), 80 mM KCl, 20 mM NaCl2, 2 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mM EGTA), incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with gentle rocking. After fixation, the ovaries were rinsed three times with PBX (0.1% Triton X-100 in 1X PBS) and then incubated in a blocking buffer (2% donkey serum in 3% BSA [w/v], 0.02% NAN3 [w/v] in PBX) for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, the ovaries were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The following day, the ovaries were rinsed three times with PBX and incubated with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 hours. The ovaries were rinsed three times with PBX and then mounted in VECTASHIELD® PLUS antifade mounting medium with DAPI (H-2000, Vector lab). Confocal images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Microscope Facility.</p>

After homogenization, the tubes were placed on ice for 30 minutes, and the homogenates were extensively pipetted every 10 minutes. The lysates were then centrifuged at 17,000x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were transferred to pre-chilled tubes, and 300 µL dilution buffer (10 mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA) supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail were added. The diluted lysates were then added to the GFP-trap magnetic beads in 1.5 mL tubes and rotated for 1 hour at 4°C. After separating the beads with a magnetic tube rack, the beads were washed three times with 500 µL wash buffer (10 mM Tris/Cl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05 % [v/v] IGEPAL CA-630). Proteins were eluted with 40 µL acidic elution buffer (200 mM glycine pH 2.5) followed by immediate neutralization with 5 uL neutralization buffer (1 M Tris pH 10.4).</p>
<p>As a quality control before mass spectrometry, ∼5 µL of the samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% [w/v] SDS, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 0.0006% [w/v] bromophenol blue, 2% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol), heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and run on 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN® TGX™ Precast Protein Gels (Biorad, #4561094). Silver staining was then performed by using Pierce™ Silver Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, 24612) to assess the quality of the immunoprecipitated protein samples.

<title>Co-immunoprecipitation</title>
<p>For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Sakura protein, wild-type ovaries (<italic>w1118</italic>) were homogenized in RIPA buffer, centrifuged at 21,000g at 4°C for 10 min, and the clear supernatant protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitation. Four µg of rabbit anti-Sakura and normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling, #2729) were incubated with 50 µL of Dynabeads Protein G (ThermoFisher, 10004D) for 20 min at room temperature. The beads were washed once with PBST (1x PBS with 0.1% Tween-20). The ovary lysate supernatant was then incubated with the washed beads at room temperature for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBST. The proteins were eluted with 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer (80 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2% [w/v] SDS, 10% [v/v] glycerol, 0.0006% [w/v] bromophenol blue, 2% [v/v] 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 70°C for 10 min. After bead separation using a magnetic tube rack, the eluted proteins in 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer were heated again at 95°C for 3 min.</p>
<p>Transient protein expression in S2 cells was performed using the pAc5.1/V5-HisB plasmid vector (Invitrogen). A total of 1 µg plasmids were transfected using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, 301425). Three days after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer supplemented with 1× protease inhibitor cocktail. The cell lysates were then centrifuged at 17,000x g for 10 min at 4°C, and the clear supernatants were collected for immunoprecipitation. For anti-HA immunoprecipitation, supernatants were incubated with 25 µL (0.25 mg) of Pierce™ Anti-HA Magnetic Beads (ThermoFisher, 88837) at room temperature for 30 min. The beads were then washed three times with TBST (1x TBS [0.05 M Tris/HCl and 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.6] with 0.05% Tween-20). For anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation, 2 µg of mouse anti-FLAG (1/10000, Sigma, F1804) was incubated with 50 µL of Dynabeads Protein G (ThermoFisher, 10004D) for 10 min at room temperature. The beads were washed once with PBST. The S2 cell lysate supernatant was incubated with the washed beads at room temperature for 15 min. The beads were washed three times with PBST. In both anti-HA and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations, proteins were eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For anti-HA, the beads in 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer were heated at 95°C for 7 min. For anti-FLAG, the beads were heated at 70°C for 10 min, then were separated using a magnetic tube rack. The eluted proteins in 2x SDS-PAGE loading buffer were heated again at 95°C for 3 min.</p>

<title>In vitro deubiquitination assay</title>
<p>C-terminally 6xHis-tagged recombinant Sakura protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> using a modified pET vector and was purified using Ni-sepharose. N-terminally 3xHA-HRV3Csite-3xFLAG-tagged Otu protein and a negative control, N-terminally 3xHA-HRV3Csite-3xFLAG-tagged firefly luciferase protein, were expressed in S2 cells using pAc5.1/V5-HisB vector. The proteins were immunoprecipitated using Pierce™ Anti-HA Magnetic Beads (ThermoFisher, 88837) as described previously, with a more stringent washing step to effectively remove interacting proteins. The beads were washed six times with a high salt wash buffer (TBST with 800 mM NaCl). The proteins were eluted by cleaving off 3xHA tag with 25 nM GST-HRV3C protease in a cleavage buffer (25mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 2mM EDTA), incubated at 4°C with rotation for 6 hours. An equal volume of 100% glycerol was added to the eluted protein.</p>
<p>Purified proteins, including Otu, luciferase, and Sakura, were mixed with Ub-Rhodamine 110 (Ubiquitin-Proteasome Biotechnologies, M3020) in a total volume of 30 µL in reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM DTT). The mixture was added to a black 384-well low-volume plate. Fluorescence measurements were taken using SpectraMax i3x Multi-Mode Microplate Reader at 37°C, with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 485/20 and 530/20 nm respectively. The fluorescence intensity for each condition was averaged from triplicates and plotted as a function of time.</p>

<caption><title>Schematic illustration of Drosophila ovary and germarium</title><p>(A) Drosophila female has a pair of ovaries, each composed of 12-16 ovarioles. The germarium is located at the anterior tip of the ovarioles and consists of germ cells and somatic cells. Germline stem cells (GSCs), cystoblasts, cysts, and more differentiate oocytes are germ cells, while terminal filament cells, cap cells, escort cells, and follicle cells are somatic cells. GSCs and cystoblasts have round-shaped and unbranched spectrosomes, while cysts have branched fusomes. (B) Cap cells secrete diffusible Decapentaplegic (Dpp), which is received by its receptor, a heterodimer of Thick vein (Tkv) and Punt (Put), in GSCs. The activated Dpp signaling eventually phosphorylates Mother-against-dpp (Mad). The phosphorylated Mad (pMad) represses the transcription of <italic>bag-of-marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>). The repression of <italic>bam</italic> in GSCs is crucial for maintaining their stemness. Cystoblasts do not receive Dpp, and Bam expression is crucial for promoting cystoblast differentiation from GSCs.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Azlan et al. identified a novel maternal factor called Sakura that is required for proper oogenesis in Drosophila. They showed that Sakura is specifically expressed in the female germline cells. Consistent with its expression pattern, Sakura functioned autonomously in germline cells to ensure proper oogenesis. In Sakura KO flies, germline cells were lost during early oogenesis and often became tumorous before degenerating by apoptosis. In these tumorous germ cells, piRNA production was defective and many transposons were derepressed. Interestingly, Smad signaling, a critical signaling pathway for GSC maintenance, was abolished in sakura KO germline stem cells, resulting in ectopic expression of Bam in whole germline cells in the tumorous germline. A recent study reported that Bam acts together with the deubiquitinase Otu to stabilize Cyc A. In the absence of sakura, Cyc A was upregulated in tumorous germline cells in the germarium. Furthermore, the authors showed that Sakura co-immunoprecipitated Otu in ovarian extracts. A series of in vitro assays suggested that the Otu (1-339 aa) and Sakura (1-49 aa) are sufficient for their direct interaction. Finally, the authors demonstrated that the loss of otu phenocopies the loss of sakura, supporting their idea that Sakura plays a role in germ cell maintenance and differentiation through interaction with Otu during oogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To my knowledge, this is the first characterization of the role of CG14545 genes. Each experiment seems to be well-designed and adequately controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the conclusions from each experiment are somewhat separate, and the functional relationships between Sakura's functions are not well established. In other words, although the loss of Sakura in the germline causes pleiotropic effects, the cause-and-effect relationships between the individual defects remain unclear.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors identified CG14545 (and named it Sakura), as a key gene essential for Drosophila oogenesis. Genetic analyses revealed that Sakura is vital for both oogenesis progression and ultimate female fertility, playing a central role in the renewal and differentiation of germ stem cells (GSC).</p>
<p>The absence of Sakura disrupts the Dpp/BMP signaling pathway, resulting in abnormal bam gene expression, which impairs GSC differentiation and leads to GSC loss. Additionally, Sakura is critical for maintaining normal levels of piRNAs. Also, the authors convincingly demonstrate that Sakura physically interacts with Otu, identifying the specific domains necessary for this interaction, suggesting a cooperative role in germline regulation. Importantly, the loss of otu produces similar defects to those observed in Sakura mutants, highlighting their functional collaboration.</p>
<p>The authors provide compelling evidence that Sakura is a critical regulator of germ cell fate, maintenance, and differentiation in Drosophila. This regulatory role is mediated through the modulation of pMad and Bam expression. However, the phenotypes observed in the germarium appear to stem from reduced pMad levels, which subsequently trigger premature and ectopic expression of Bam. This aberrant Bam expression could lead to increased CycA levels and altered transcriptional regulation, impacting piRNA expression. Given Sakura's role in pMad expression, it would be insightful to investigate whether overexpression of Mad or pMad could mitigate these phenotypic defects (UAS-Mad line is available at Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center).</p>
<p>A major concern is the overstated role of Sakura in regulating Orb. The data does not reveal mislocalized Orb; rather, a mislocalized oocyte and cytoskeletal breakdown, which may be secondary consequences of defects in oocyte polarity and structure rather than direct misregulation of Orb. The conclusion that Sakura is necessary for Orb localization is not supported by the data. Orb still localizes to the oocyte until about stage 6. In the later stage, it looks like the cytoskeleton is broken down and the oocyte is not positioned properly, however, there is still Orb localization in the ~8-stage egg chamber in the oocyte. This phenotype points towards a defect in the transport of Orb and possibly all other factors that need to localize to the oocyte due to cytoskeletal breakdown, not Orb regulation directly. While this result is very interesting it needs further evaluation on the underlying mechanism. For example, the decrease in E-cadherin levels leads to a similar phenotype and Bam is known to regulate E-cadherin expression. Is Bam expressed in these later knockdowns?</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit from a more balanced interpretation of the data concerning Sakura's role in Orb regulation. Furthermore, a more expanded discussion on Sakura's potential role in pMad regulation is needed. For example, since Otu and Bam are involved in translational regulation, do the authors think that Mad is not translated and therefore it is the reason for less pMad? Currently the discussion presents just a summary of the results and not an extension of possible interpretation discussed in context of present literature.</p>

<p>In this very thorough study, the authors characterize the function of a novel Drosophila gene, which they name Sakura. They start with the observation that sakura expression is predicted to be highly enriched in the ovary and they generate an anti-sakura antibody, a line with a GFP-tagged sakura transgene, and a sakura null allele to investigate sakura localization and function directly. They confirm the prediction that it is primarily expressed in the ovary and, specifically, that it is expressed in germ cells, and find that about 2/3 of the mutants lack germ cells completely and the remaining have tumorous ovaries. Further investigation reveals that Sakura is required for piRNA-mediated repression of transposons in germ cells. They also find evidence that sakura is important for germ cell specification during development and germline stem cell maintenance during adulthood. However, despite the role of sakura in maintaining germline stem cells, they find that sakura mutant germ cells also fail to differentiate properly such that mutant germline stem cell clones have an increased number of &quot;GSC-like&quot; cells. They attribute this phenotype to a failure in the repression of Bam by dpp signaling. Lastly, they demonstrate that sakura physically interacts with otu and that sakura and otu mutants have similar germ cell phenotypes. Overall, this study helps to advance the field by providing a characterization of a novel gene that is required for oogenesis. The data are generally high-quality and the new lines and reagents they generated will be useful for the field. However, there are some weaknesses and I would recommend that they address the comments in the Recommendations for the authors section below.</p>
