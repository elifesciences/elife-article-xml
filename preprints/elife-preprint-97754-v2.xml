<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Synthetic genetic oscillators can serve as internal clocks within engineered cells to program periodic expression. However, cell-to-cell variability introduces a dispersion in the characteristics of these clocks that drives the population to complete desynchronization. Here we introduce the optorepressilator, an optically controllable genetic clock that combines the repressilator, a three-node synthetic network in <italic>E. coli</italic>, with an optogenetic module enabling to reset, delay, or advance its phase using optical inputs. We demonstrate that a population of optorepressilators can be synchronized by transient green light exposure or entrained to oscillate indefinitely by a train of short pulses, through a mechanism reminiscent of natural circadian clocks. Furthermore, we investigate the system’s response to detuned external stimuli observing multiple regimes of global synchronization. Integrating experiments and mathematical modeling, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively from single cell to population level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic clocks keep time within living organisms in order to program periodic behaviors like circadian rhythms. An intensive genetic analysis of the complex landscape of these biological oscillations has revealed that, from bacteria and fungi to plants and animals, these clocks share similar motifs in the underlying gene regulatory net-works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. From a reverse perspective, synthetic biologists have tackled the problem of designing from scratch minimal gene networks that can produce periodic patterns of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Very early numerical simulations had shown that networks with an odd number of cyclically connected genes exhibit robust oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. The repressilator was the first experimental realization of a synthetic genetic clock based on this principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. As shown schematically in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the repressilator is a minimal network consisting of three transcription factors mutually repressing on a loop. The original design, using the repressors LacI, TetR and cI in <italic>E. coli</italic>, displayed marked oscillations in single cells, although with large fluctuations in both amplitude and period. This noise has been recently significantly reduced by genetic optimization, resulting in much more robust albeit slower oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. This refactored repressilator is usually referred to as repressilator 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In this system, the decrease in protein concentration is driven only by growth-related dilution, not by active protein degradation. As discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], a symmetric, protein only model already predicts limit cycle oscillations provided repression is steep enough:</p>

where <italic>x, y, z</italic> are the three repressors concentrations in units of the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic>, the concentration of proteins required to repress a promoter to half maximum, <italic>α</italic> is a common decay rate set by dilution and <italic>β</italic> is the normalized maximum production rate. In the digital approximation (<italic>n</italic> → ∞), when <italic>β/α</italic> ≫ 1 the resulting dynamics look like relaxation oscillations with amplitude <italic>β/α</italic> and a full cycle period given by <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> = 3 log(<italic>β/α</italic>)<italic>/α</italic> (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Materials Section 1). As a result, although individual cells oscillate indefinitely, the natural dispersion of growth rates <italic>α</italic> results in a dispersion of periods leading to progressive dephasing of individual oscillators as shown by the simulations in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. In the same figure we report an experimental observation of this damping that we obtained using <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria carrying the repressilator 2.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. This system contains three fluorescent reporters whose expression is regulated by the same three transcription factors of the repressilator, so that the reporters’ concentration follows that of the repressor transcribed by the same promoter (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The cultures were initially synchronized chemically with IPTG, which deactivates the LacI repressor eliminating the edge between <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> from the network in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. This new topology admits a stable fixed point where the concentrations of <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> are maximal while <italic>z</italic> goes to zero. Next, the cultures were maintained in exponential growth phase by periodic dilutions in a multiwell plate while the population-averaged fluorescence signal was monitored using a plate reader (see Materials and Methods). For clarity reasons, we will often report only the fluorescence signal from the CFP reporter that indirectly quantifies the concentration of the TetR repressor or <italic>y</italic> in our simple model. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows that when starting from the synchronized state, the population signal from the CFP reporter displays high contrast oscillations with a period of 16 hours and an amplitude that is reduced to a half after about 2.5 periods. Phase drifts are very common in natural biological oscillators. Small couplings within a population of oscillators can give rise to a globally synchronized state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], as in the case of cardiac pacemaker cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] or quorum sensing coupled genetic oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Other genetic oscillators, like circadian clocks, rely instead on a periodic external cue, known as zeitgeber (time-giver), to constantly adjust their phase to that of a common environmental cycle. Sunlight is the predominant zeitgeber of natural circadian clocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. In the context of synthetic biology, light is a particularly versatile input for controlling the state of genetic circuits and programming gene expression in space and time with much greater precision than chemical signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Optical signals can also be multiplexed through spectral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] or amplitude modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. A growing number of optogenetics tools have been recently applied in prokaryotes to control different aspects of bacterial physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>], such as growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. A widely used optogenetic system is the light-switchable two-component system, CcaS-CcaR from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. CcaS senses green light and phosphorilates the response regulator CcaR. Phosphorylated CcaR binds to the promoter <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>cpcG</italic>2−172</sub>, activating gene expression. Red light reverts CcaS to the inactive state and shuts down transcription from <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>cpcG</italic>2−172</sub>. This system was optimized for controllable gene expression with a high dynamic range in <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we show that integrating an optogenetic module in the repressilator circuit enables the use of light to synchronize, entrain, and detune oscillations in gene expression within single cells or entire populations. We employ the CcaS-CcaR light-inducible system to express one of the repressilator proteins, resulting in a novel 4-node optogenetic network named the ‘optorepressilator’. With this modification, light induces precise phase adjustments among synthetic genetic clocks within individual cells, leading to persistent population-wide oscillations. These oscillations mantain a constant phase relation to the external light cue that can act as a zeitgeber.</p>
<p>We show that a population of these synthetic oscillators can be synchronized through transient green light exposure or be entrained via a sequence of short pulses, sustaining indefinite oscillations. Additionally, we explore the system’s response to detuned external stimuli, revealing multiple synchronization regimes.</p>

<title>Fine-tuning optogenetic expression</title>
<p>Estimates for the LacI dissociation constant <italic>K</italic> vary between 0.01− 0.1 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Even taking into account the fact that the repressor plasmid is present in more than one copy (∼5 copies), this suggests that a small number of LacI proteins may already disrupt the limit cycle. Therefore, controlling the leakage of the promoter under the red light is crucial. The optogenetic module consists of two components, named as sensor and actuator in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>. In order to fine-tune the expression of LacI, we created four different ranges of gene expression in which both transcription and translation were modulated on two levels. Translation was controlled by substituting the ribosome binding site (RBS) (BBa B0034) in the original plasmid with a weaker RBS (BBa B0033) from the same IGEM Community collection. Transcription was modulated through gene copy number by moving the light-driven gene expression cassettes from the plasmids to the genome. Combined with the sensor and actuator plasmids, these constructs resulted in four versions of the optogenetic module (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) with different expression ranges. We characterized these expression ranges as a function of incident light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) using sfGFP as fluorescent reporter and a custom-made light-addressable multiwell plate (see Supplementary Figure 3). By comparing expression at maximum green level, we can estimate that RBS substitution leads to a 27-fold decrease in reporter production (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), while relocation of the light-driven cassette to the genome reduces expression by 57-fold. The combination of weak RBS and genome insertion results in a gene expression range below the autofluorescence background (estimated combined fold reduction of 1500). We then replaced the sfGFP gene with LacI in all four versions of the optogenetic module and transformed the repressilator plasmid (pLPT234) in each of the four strains. As a first step, we verified that the oscillations of the limit cycle were preserved under red light. To this end, we first chemically synchronized the oscillations with IPTG and then monitored the concentration of TetR (<italic>y</italic>) reported by CFP. Cultures were maintained in exponential phase by periodic dilutions in multiwells under constant red light. We found that only the strain with the lowest expression level (represented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<bold>c</bold></xref>) oscillates with the same amplitude as the control strain containing only the repressilator plasmids (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). The slight difference in period can be explained by the presence of additional plasmids in the optorepressilator strain, which results in a lower growth rate. As found in the digital approximation, the repressilator period is mainly controlled by the inverse growth rate (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Figure 9) meaning a lower growth rate results in a longer oscillation period. When we normalize the time with the growth rate the two oscillations overlap nicely (Supplementary Figure 4). In contrast, no clear oscillations were observed in the other three strains, where LacI leaking from the red-repressed promoter destroys the limit cycle and collapses all cells in a fixed point where the repressilator protein cI is high and TetR is low (see Supplementary Materials Section 5).</p>

<title>Optogenetic synchronization</title>
<p>Having verified that the system oscillates under red light, we then checked whether green light can synchronize a population of optorepressilators. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<bold>a</bold></xref> shows the population signal of CFP fluorescence reporting the concentration of TetR (<italic>y</italic>) in multiwell cultures. The cultures were constantly kept under red light for the first 40 hours. Although individual cells oscillate, their phases are randomly distributed so that the average population signal is constant. At <italic>t</italic> = 40 h we switch from red to green for 12 hours, and CFP fluorescence decays to zero. This is expected when extra LacI is produced by the optogenetic module, repressing both TetR and CFP. When the population signal decays completely, all the cells are stuck in the same fixed point (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0, <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>β/α</italic> in the model), so that when switching back to red, they start oscillating in synchrony. This was also confirmed by single-cell data from a mother-machine microfluidic chip (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<bold>b</bold></xref>). Under the same light protocol as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<bold>a</bold></xref>, most of the channels blink in unison after exposure and removal of synchronizing green light (Supplementary Video 1).</p>

<title>Optogenetic entrainment</title>
<p>Both plate reader and mother-machine experiments showed that cells carrying the optorepressilator system could be synchronized by transient light exposure. However, oscillations in the population signal were progressively dampened again by the dispersion of growth rates and thus of individual clocks’ periods. This was particularly evident in the mother-machine experiment, where the growth rate variability is larger. Natural genetic clocks are able to counteract period dispersion by exploiting an external periodic stimulus to advance or delay their phases. For example, it was shown that a one-hour exposure to light at bedtime can delay the human circadian rhythm by about two hours, while exposure to the same intensity of white light after waking up can advance our schedule by a little less than half an hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, the optorepressilator model in equation (2), despite its simplicity, displays a very similar behavior. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> we report the phase shift Δ<italic>ϕ</italic> produced by a single pulse (with a duration of 2 h and intensity <italic>β</italic><sub><italic>′</italic></sub> = 80 h<sup>−1</sup> fixed for all the simulations) as a function of the pulse arrival phase <italic>ϕ</italic>. This type of curve is often referred to as a phase response curve (PRC) and is obtained here by numerical integration of (2) for a single optorepressilator. The first thing we notice is that positive pulse arrival phase <italic>ϕ &gt;</italic> 0 results in a negative phase shift Δ<italic>ϕ &lt;</italic> 0 that delays subsequent oscillations, while a negative <italic>ϕ</italic> results in a phase advance (Δ<italic>ϕ &gt;</italic> 0). This behavior can be understood at least qualitatively by simple considerations. When a pulse arrives before <italic>y</italic> reaches the maximum (<italic>ϕ &lt;</italic> 0), a burst of <italic>x</italic>′ is produced (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) that may trigger an earlier decay of <italic>y</italic> if <italic>β</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup><italic>/α &gt;</italic> 1 and the pulse duration <italic>τ</italic> is long enough. This results in an advanced peak, or equivalently a positive phase shift, which is greater the earlier the light pulse arrives. Conversely, when the pulse arrives while <italic>y</italic> is decaying the <italic>x</italic>′ burst will prolong the <italic>y</italic> decay until the moment when <italic>x</italic>′ falls below 1. This results in a delayed peak, or a negative phase shift that increases in magnitude as <italic>ϕ</italic> increases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). The exact shape of the PRC will depend on light intensity through <italic>β</italic>′ and pulse duration <italic>τ</italic> as shown in Supplementary Figure 7.</p>

<p>The phase response curve turns out to be a very useful concept to predict the system’s response to a periodic external input. For example, if the system is exposed to a periodic train of light pulses, the phase response curve can be used to predict the sequence of phases <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> at which subsequent pulses will arrive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="563722v3_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where phases go from 0 at the expression peak of the <italic>y</italic> protein, to 1 when a full cycle is completed at the next peak. The fixed points <italic>ϕ</italic><sup>∗</sup> of this mapping are those for which <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>n</italic>+1</sub> = <italic>ϕ</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and hence:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="563722v3_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The fixed points where the phase response curve has a negative slope satisfying the condition −2 <italic>&lt; d</italic>Δ<italic>ϕ/dϕ &lt;</italic> 0, represent stable entrained states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] for which the system oscillates at the same frequency of the external light signal. So when the system is exposed to a train of external pulses of period <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> we should look for the phase <italic>ϕ</italic><sup>∗</sup> for which <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq.4</xref> is satisfied, and if the phase response curve has a negative slope larger than −2, we can predict that the system will be entrained with a stable phase difference <italic>ϕ</italic><sup>∗</sup> between light pulses and the peaks of CFP (<italic>y</italic>) protein.</p>
<p>Let us now consider an ensemble of optorepressilators with distributed natural periods <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> and subjected to a train of light pulses with period <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub>. Based on the previous discussion, each optorepressilator will be entrained by the external periodic signal but with a specific phase difference satisfying <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq.4.</xref> The population signal will then show entrained oscillations representing the average over individual oscillators having the same period but maintaining different phase differences with the external signal.</p>
<p>From this simplified theoretical discussion, we deduce that if real optorepressilators had the predicted phase response curve, then it should be possible to use a train of light pulses as a zeitgeber capable of producing long-term oscillations in gene expression at the population level. We first demonstrate this by monitoring the population signal from CFP (reporting TetR or <italic>y</italic> in the model) in multiwell cultures under constant red illumination (6.82 W/m<sup>2</sup>) interrupted by green light pulses (5.64 W/m<sup>2</sup>) of duration 2 h with period <italic>T</italic> = 18 h. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> shows high contrast and undamped oscillations to be contrasted to the damped ones in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. The bottom panel in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> shows the result of a numerical simulation with the same parameters as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> and the addition of a periodic light stimulation, with period <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>/T</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1. Simulation panel also displays in gray the signals from individual optorepressilators before performing the average (in blue). These results are also confirmed by mother machine observations reported in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref> (Supplementary Video 2). For the simulations in the lower panel of <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, all parameters remained the same as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref> with the exception of the period of the light pulses (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>/T</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.97) and the standard deviation of the growth rate distribution, which was increased from 0.034 h <sup>−1</sup> to 0.071 h<sup>−1</sup> to better reproduce the experimental observations in the mother machine. A narrower distribution of growth rates in multiwell cultures could be due to the fact that faster-growing bacteria outperform slower-growing cells in a competing environment, unlike in the mother machine where there is no competition between cells in different channels. The theoretical discussion above predicts that the individual oscillators will each find their own stable phase with respect to external pulses. The slower ones will arrange themselves to receive the pulse on the rising edge of the peak to reduce their period, while the faster ones will have the pulse arriving after the peak to increase their period. We confirm this in both experiments and simulations in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, where the individual traces of a slow (higher amplitude) and a fast (lower amplitude) oscillator have been highlighted with dotted and dashed lines respectively.</p>

<title>Detuning</title>
<p>In an entrained population, most oscillators are detuned from their natural frequency to that of the external signal. In this section we will explore detuning by starting with numerical simulations of our simple model in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref> and then comparing them with long-term observations of detuned optorepressilators in a plate reader experiment. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> shows a 3D surface representing the ratio of the actual optorepressilator frequency <italic>ν</italic> = 1<italic>/T</italic><sub>0</sub> over external frequency <italic>f</italic> = 1<italic>/T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub> as a function of frequency and amplitude of the external signal <italic>β</italic><sup><italic>′</italic></sup>. The <italic>ν</italic> value is obtained as the frequency of the main peak in the power spectrum of the simulated data. The plateaus in this graph are related to the so-called Arnold’s tongues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. regions of synchronization in the frequency/amplitude plane. On the cyan plateau, the system oscillates with the same frequency as the external signal, while there are also higher-order plateaus with a fractional value of the ratio <italic>f/ν</italic><sub>0</sub> (see Supplementary Figure 8). On the cyan tongue, when the system is detuned to higher frequencies, its phase will be such that it receives the light pulse on the rising edge of the <italic>y</italic> protein. When detuned to lower frequencies, however, it shifts to receive pulses on the falling edge of <italic>y</italic>. When detuning to lower frequencies, the system goes to an higher order synchronization tongue where it oscillates at twice the frequency of the external signal. Similarly, forcing to higher frequencies moves the system to fractional order tongues, such as the green plateau in the plot, in which the system oscillates at half the external frequency. All these regimes are found in experiments in which we maintain cultures of optorepressilators in exponential phase within multiwell plates that are independently addressed with light signals of different frequencies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). It is also remarkable to observe how the relative phase between the system and the external signal evolves within the cyan tongue, as predicted by the model. More quantitatively, we have extracted the phase difference <italic>ϕ</italic><sup>∗</sup> between light pulses and CFP oscillations from the data shown in the three central panels of <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> (<italic>f</italic> = 0.8, 1, 1.2). We found that, in accordance with the discussion in the previous section (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref>), the red points with coordinates (<italic>ϕ</italic><sup>∗</sup>, 1−<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub><italic>/T</italic><sub>0</sub>) fall on the theoretical phase response curve when we choose <italic>β</italic>′ = 80 h<sup>−1</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5a</xref>).</p>

<p>A discrepancy is apparently found in the green tongue, where we experimentally observe oscillations at the same frequency as the external signal. This is not unexpected, however, when one realizes that although the individual optorepressilators may oscillate at half the external frequency <italic>f</italic>, they can peak at either the even or odd peaks of the external signal. When we average these alternating peaks over the population we get a small amplitude oscillation at the frequency of the external signal. This is also confirmed by a mother machine experiment where we tried to detune to about twice the natural frequency and observed different channels oscillating at half the signal frequency and with alternating peaks (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Inspired by the light entrainment of natural circadian rhythms, we designed the optorepressilator, a four-node synthetic oscillatory network that can lock its phase to an external periodic light signal. By integrating an optogenetic module into a repressilator circuit, we demonstrate, theoretically and with experiments, that light can synchronize, entrain, and detune oscillations within single cells or an entire population. We find that this four-node network shows a phase-sensitive response to light pulses. Depending on the arrival time, a pulse can either delay or advance the clock as in many natural circadian clocks. As a result, our system can be entrained by periodic light pulses, even when the forcing period deviates from the natural frequency. Using a combination of optogenetic experiments ranging from the macroscopic population scale to the microscopic scale of single cells, we show that the entrainment mechanism is robust and can be understood quantitatively by a simple protein-only model. The entrainment of biological clocks can provide new insights into oscillation mechanisms and, at the same time, practical means to control biological rhythms. Through periodic modulation of chemical signals within microfluidic environments, entrainment of natural biological clocks ranging from the embryonic segmentation clock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] to the NF-kB system regulating immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] has been previously achieved. However, the complexity of the underlying genetic networks often precludes a deeper mathematical understanding of the fundamental nature of the entrainment phenomenon. Synthetic oscillators provide an ideal platform for studying entrainment in engineered minimal systems where a close comparison with relatively simple models is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Our minimal optorepressilator model can provide many theoretical predictions, often in analytical form within the digital approximation (<italic>n</italic> → ∞). It explains correlations between amplitude and period of oscillations (Supplementary Figure 9), or how robust oscillations are against leakage (Supplementary Materials Section 5). Moreover an approximate form for the phase response curve is derived (Supplementary Materials Section 7), providing a quantitative physical insight into the mechanisms that produce delayed or advanced oscillations and on how pulse characteristics affect the system’s response.</p>
<p>From a more applied perspective, the optorepressilator enriches the toolbox of genetic modules by adding a light-synchronizable clock that could be used to program precise oscillatory patterns of gene expression. When compared to chemical signaling, the use of light to control and coordinate the functioning of synthetic networks offers clear advantages in terms of spatial and temporal modulation. Light cues can be applied and removed on the spot, without waiting for media substitution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. In addition, using spatial light modulators it could be possible to address spatially separated subpopulations within a common environment to oscillate with distinct periods and phases. Optical synchronization of genetic oscillators can be easily implemented in a wide range of experimental settings like liquid cultures, agar plates or microfluidics. Light, for example, can penetrate bioreactors and orchestrate gene expression in a population of uncoupled oscillators. Moving to infrared inducible optogenetic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], optical signals could also penetrate biological tissues for <italic>in vivo</italic> applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>].</p>

<title>Mother machine fabrication</title>
<p>Master molds with mother machine features were fabricated using a hybrid technique involving standard soft-lithography and twophoton polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Firstly, the feeding channel (50 <italic>μ</italic>m-width, 15 <italic>μ</italic>m-height) was fabricated using standard protocols of soft-lithography. Precisely, a SU-8 layer of 15 <italic>μ</italic>m was fabricated by spinning SU-8 2015 onto a soda-lime coverglass (3000 rpm - 30 s, Laurell WS-650Mz-23NPPB). Strong adhesion of the SU8 to the carrier coverglass was ensured by three layers of OmniCoat adhesion promoter (MicroChem Corp). The coverglass was soft-baked, and a microfluidic mask with a pattern of 50 <italic>μ</italic>m-wide channels was projected onto the photoresist (UV KUB 2, 400 mJ - 40 s at 25% of maximum power). The coverglass was soft-baked, post-baked, and developed according to the protocol provided by MicroChem Corp. In addition, the sample was hard-baked for 30 min at 170 <sup><italic>o</italic></sup>C. A second layer of 20 <italic>μ</italic>m was fabricated on top of the feeding channel by spinning SU-8 2015 at 2000 rpm, followed by a soft-baking of 2 hours at 95 <sup><italic>o</italic></sup>C. Then, the microfabrication of the micron-size channels was carried out by a custom-built two-photon polymerization setup [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>].

PDMS was prepared from a Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer kit: polymer base and curing agent were mixed in a 10:1 ratio, and air bubbles were removed from the mixture by centrifugation.

Green and red light stimuli were provided by two LEDs (Thorlabs M530L4, Thorlabs M660L4, respectively) coupled through a dichroic mirror (Thorlabs DMLP567R) and passing through a long-pass filter at 550 nm (Thorlabs FELH0550). Epi-fluorescence imaging was conducted using a blue LED (Thorlabs M455L4) and a filter set for the CFP (Chroma 49001-ET-ECFP). To enable imaging in both phase contrast and epi-fluorescence, a motorized filter wheel (Thorlabs FW102C) was used to switch between the fluorescence filter set and a long-pass filter at 700 nm (Thorlabs FWLH0700). To maintain sample focus throughout the entire acquisition process, a custom script was developed. This script scans the sample in height and finally moves to the z-plane where the image of a specific fixed structure in the chip has maximum edge enhancement (calculated with the Sobel function). To avoid drift on the x-y plane, we correlate the acquired image of the fixed structure with one acquired at the beginning of the experiment and compute the shift on the x-y plane. The scanning process was performed using a motorized vertical lift stage (Zaber X-VSR-E) and a motorized microscope stage (Zaber X-ASR100B120B-SE03D12).</p>

<title>Mother machine experiments</title>
<p>Cells were grown from a glycerol stock for 16 hours in LB with appropriate antibiotics, in a 50 mL centrifuge tube exposed to saturating 660 nm red light. Bacteria were refreshed 1:100 in imaging medium under red light until they reached an OD of 0.1 (around 4 hours). 1 mL of culture was centrifuged in an Eppendorf miniSpin Plus centrifuge at 1000 rcf for 5 minutes and concentrated 50x. 20 <italic>μ</italic>L of concentrated bacteria were loaded in the mothermachine’s flow channel with a pipette. Bacteria were loaded in the growth channels, by centrifugation of the mothermachine chip for 7 minutes at 1300 rcf (with soft ramp acceleration) in an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5430R using the Combislide adapter. The flow channel of the mothermachine was then washed for approximately 5 minutes with LB with antibiotics and 0.1% BSA at a constant flow of 50 <italic>μ</italic>L/min, to carry away excess bacteria. For the whole duration of the experiments, the mothermachine was perfused with LB with antibiotics and 0.1% BSA at a constant rate of 5.5 <italic>μ</italic>L/min. Green and red light stimuli were provided by the two LEDs (Thorlabs M530L4, Thorlabs M660L4) with respective intensities 6 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 26 W/m<sup>2</sup> for the synchronization experiments, and 1.1 W/m<sup>2</sup> and 4.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> for the entrainment experiments.</p>

<title>Data analysis: segmentation in the mother machine</title>
<p>Phase contrast images were taken every 3 min and fluorescence images every 9 min. Phase contrast images were analyzed, to identify the single feeding channels of the microfluidic chip. Single cells were segmented using the pretrained neural network model Cellpose 2.0. We further trained the model with our own data to increase the accuracy of segmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. The masks obtained after segmentation were used to measure the total fluorescence of the mother cell in all feeding channels of the mother machine as a function of time. <bold>Simulations</bold>. All simulations were performed by direct Euler integration of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Eq. 2</xref> using custom Python program. The selection of model parameters was motivated as follows: the mean value of the growth rate was directly estimated from experiments <italic>α</italic> = 0.75h<sup>−1</sup> (Supplementary Figure 2); for all promoters we choose a cooperativity index <italic>n</italic> = 3 to both match experimental oscillation profiles and in agreement with [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]; for the production rates we chose the value <italic>β</italic> = 300 h<sup>−1</sup> to match the experimental period <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> ≃ 17.5 h; the maximum light induced production rate <italic>β</italic>′ = 80 h<sup>−1</sup> was estimated to maximize agreement with experimental data in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>.</p>

<title>Analytical solution of repressilator dynamics in the digital approximation</title>
<p>In the digital approximation, Hill functions in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Eq. 1</xref> in the main text are replaced by Θ functions and equations become piecewise linear first order. Oscillations are therefore built by joining together rising (to steady value <italic>β/α</italic>) or decaying (to 0) exponentials with rate <italic>α</italic>, calling with <italic>M</italic> and <italic>m</italic> respectively the maximum and minimum values in the oscillations. <italic>t</italic> is the interval between two maxima of two different proteins and <italic>δ</italic> is the time interval to rise from the minimum <italic>m</italic> to 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). All concentrations are measured in units of <italic>K</italic> so 1 represents the activation threshold. We can write the following four equations in the unknowns <italic>m, M, t, δ</italic>:</p>

<title>Custom-made light-addressable multiwell plate</title>
<p>The custom-made light-addressable multiwell plate was made using an Adafruit NeoPixel NeoMatrix 8×8, a matrix of 64 RGB LEDs, attached to the bottom of a Greiner 96 well plate with black wells and removed bottoms (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The matrix was placed so that each LED was directly under an individual well. An opaque foam layer was cut in order to accommodate LEDs, adjusting the matrix to the plate and reducing well-to-well light contamination. An additional plate was fixed on top of this structure to decrease light intensity on samples by increasing the distance between LEDs and samples. Opaque foam layers were cut in correspondence with the wells and attached above and below this plate, again to avoid well-to-well light contamination. The construct was fixed to a shaking incubator (Supplementary Fig. 3b). A 96 well plate could be placed on top of it and removed for data acquisition. A darkened lid was placed on the samples’ plate to block environment light.</p>
<p>The LEDs matrix was controlled with an Arduino microcontroller. To ensure correct timing of inputs, we employed an AZDelivery Real Time Clock module.</p>
<p>LEDs intensity on samples was measured with Thorlabs Standard Photodiode Power Sensor S121C.</p>

<title>Effect of leakage on the period and stability of the oscillations</title>
<p>Leakage from the optogenetic <italic>x</italic>′ promoter can destroy limit cycle oscillations and collapse the system into a stable fixed point. To study how leakage affects oscillations we employ linear stability analysis. In the absence of leakage (<italic>β</italic>′ = 0), the system of equations is symmetric and the fixed point is (<italic>ξ</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>ξ</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>ξ</italic><sub>0</sub>), where <italic>ξ</italic><sub>0</sub> satisfies the following condition:

<p>Leakage <italic>β</italic>′ makes the system asymmetric and the new fixed point coordinates (<italic>x</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>z</italic><sub>0</sub>) satisfy the following conditions:

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The &quot;optorepressilator&quot;, an optically controllable genetic oscillator based on the famous E. coli 3-repressor (LacI, TetR, CI) oscillator &quot;repressilator&quot;, was developed. An individual repressilator shows a stable oscillation of the protein levels with a relatively long period that extends a few doubling times of E. coli, but when many cells oscillate, their phases tend to desynchronize. The authors introduced an additional optically controllable promoter through a conformal change of CcaS protein and let it control how much additional CI is produced. By tightly controlling the leak from the added promoter, the authors successfully kept the original repressilator oscillation when the added promoter was not activated. In contrast, the oscillation was stopped by expressing the additional CI. Using this system, the authors showed that it is possible to synchronise the phase of the oscillation, especially when the activation happens as a short pulse at the right phase of the repressilator oscillation. The authors further show that, by changing the frequency of the short pulses, the repressilator was entrained to various ratios to the pulse period, and the author could reconstruct the so-called &quot;Arnold tongues&quot;, the signature of entrainment of the nonlinear oscillator to externally added periodic perturbation. The behaviour is consistent with the simplified mathematical model that simulates the protein concentration using ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Optical control of the oscillation of the protein clock is a powerful and clean tool for studying the synthetic oscillator's response to perturbation in a well-controlled and tunable manner. The article utilizes the plate reader setup for population average measurements and the mother machine setup for single-cell measurements, and they complement nicely to acquire necessary information.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Cannarsa et. al., the authors describe the engineering of a light-entrainable synthetic biological oscillator in bacteria. It is based on an upgraded version of one of the first synthetic circuits to be constructed, the repressilator. The authors sought to make this oscillator entrainable by an external forcing signal, analogous to the way natural biological oscillators (like the circadian clock) are synchronized. They reasoned that an optogenetic system would provide a convenient and flexible means of manipulation. To this end, the authors exploited the CcaS-CcaA light-switchable system, which allows activation and deactivation of transcription by green and red light, respectively. They used this system to make the expression of one of the repressilator's transcription factors (lacI) light-controlled, from a construct separated from the main repressilator plasmid. This way, under red light the oscillator runs freely, but exposure to green light causes overexpression of the lacI, pushing the system into a specific state. Consequently, returning to red light will restore the oscillations from the same phase in all cells, effectively synchronizing the cell population.</p>
<p>After demonstrating the functionality of the basic concept, the authors combined modeling and experiments to show how periodic exposure to green light enables efficient entrainment, and how the frequency of the forcing signal affects the oscillatory behavior (detuning).</p>
<p>This work provides an important demonstration of engineering tunability into a foundational genetic circuit, expands the synthetic biology toolbox, and provides a platform to address critical questions about synchronization in biological oscillators. Due to the flexibility of the experimental system, it is also expected to provide a fertile ground for future testing of theoretical predictions regarding non-linear oscillators.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>* The study provides a simple and elegant mechanism for the entertainment of a synthetic oscillator. The design relies on optogenetic proteins, which enable efficient experimentation compared to alternative approaches (like using chemical inducers). This way, a static culture (without microfluidics or change of growth media) can be easily exposed to flexible temporal sequences of the zeitgeber, and continuously measured through time.</p>
<p>* The study makes use of both plate-reader-based population-level readout and mother-machine single-cell measurements. Synchronization through entrainment is a single cell level phenomenon, but with a clear population-level manifestation. Thus, this experimental approach combination provides a strong validation to their system. At the same time, differences between the readout from the two systems have emerged, and provided a further opportunity for model refinement and testing.</p>
<p>* The authors correctly identified the main optimization goal, namely the effective leakiness of their construct even under red light. Then, they successfully overcame this issue using synthetic biology approaches.</p>
<p>* The work is supported by a simplified model of the repressilator, which provides a convenient analytical and numerical means to draw testable predictions. The model predictions are well aligned with the experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>* Even after optimizing the expression level of the light-sensitive gene, the system is very sensitive, i.e., a very short exposure is sufficient to elicit the strongest entertainment. This limited dynamic range might hamper some model testing and future usage.</p>
<p>* As a result of the previous point, the system is entrained by transiently &quot;breaking&quot; the oscillator: each pulse of green light represents a Hopf bifurcation into a single attractor. it means that the system cannot oscillate in constant green light. In comparison, this is generally not the case for natural zeitgebers like light and temperature for the circadian rhythms. Extreme values might prevent oscillations (not necessarily due to breaking the core oscillator), but usually, free running is possible in a wide range of constant conditions. In some cases, the free-running period length will vary as a function of the constant value.</p>
<p>While the approach presented in this manuscript is valid, a comprehensive analysis of more subtle modes of repressilator entrainment could also be of value.</p>
<p>* The entire work makes use of a single intensity and single duration of the green pulse to force entrainment. While the model has clear predictions for how different modalities should affect entrainment, more experiments are needed to validate those predictions.</p>

<p>The &quot;optorepressilator&quot;, an optically controllable genetic oscillator based on the famous E. coli 3-repressor (LacI, TetR, CI) oscillator &quot;repressilator&quot;, was developed. An individual repressilator shows a stable oscillation of the protein levels with a relatively long period that extends a few doubling times of E. coli, but when many cells oscillate, their phases tend to desynchronize. The authors introduced an additional optically controllable promoter through a conformal change of CcaS protein and let it control how much additional CI is produced. By tightly controlling the leak from the added promoter, the authors successfully kept the original repressilator oscillation when the added promoter was not activated. In contrast, the oscillation was stopped by expressing the additional CI. Using this system, the authors showed that it is possible to synchronise the phase of the oscillation, especially when the activation happens as a short pulse at the right phase of the repressilator oscillation. The authors further show that, by changing the frequency of the short pulses, the repressilator was entrained to various ratios to the pulse period, and the author could reconstruct the so-called &quot;Arnold tongues&quot;, the signature of entrainment of the nonlinear oscillator to externally added periodic perturbation. The behaviour is consistent with the simplified mathematical model that simulates the protein concentration using ordinary differential equations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Optical control of the oscillation of the protein clock is a powerful and clean tool for studying the synthetic oscillator's response to perturbation in a well-controlled and tunable manner. The article utilizes the plate reader setup for population average measurements and the mother machine setup for single-cell measurements, and they compensate nicely to acquire necessary information.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>The current paper added the optogenetically controlled perturbation to control the phase of oscillation and entrainment, but there are a few other works that add external perturbation to a collection of cells that individually oscillate to study phase shift and/or entrainment. The current paper lacks discussion about the pros and cons of the current system compared to previously analyzed systems.</p>
<p>Recommendations</p>
<p>Even if the main purpose of the current paper is to develop a toolbox, it is beneficial to emphasize the pros and cons of the current system compared to the existing work. In addition to the ref [36] that authors cite but do not discuss concretely, example literature about entrainment includes:</p>

<p>We thank the Reviewer for their positive comments on our manuscript. Their main recommendation is to expand literature and discuss how our method compares to previously reported entrainment of genetic oscillators. In summary, we believe that the main advantages of the optorepressilator are the simplicity of the transcriptional network combined with the flexibility of optical control. In the “Discussion” section of the revised manuscript, we now try to highlight this also in connection to the suggested literature.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Reviews):</bold></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Cannarsa et. al., the authors describe the engineering of a light-entrainable synthetic biological oscillator in bacteria. It is based on an upgraded version of one of the first synthetic circuits to be constructed, the repressilator. The authors sought to make this oscillator entrainable by an external forcing signal, analogous to the way natural biological oscillators (like the circadian clock) are synchronized. They reasoned that an optogenetic system would provide a convenient and flexible means of manipulation. To this end, the authors exploited the CcaS-CcaA light-switchable system, which allows activation and deactivation of transcription by green and red light, respectively. They used this system to make the expression of one of the repressilator's transcription factors (lacI) light-controlled, from a construct separated from the main repressilator plasmid. This way, under red light the oscillator runs freely, but exposure to green light causes overexpression of the lacI, pushing the system into a specific state. Consequently, returning to red light will restore the oscillations from the same phase in all cells, effectively synchronizing the cell population.</p>
<p>After demonstrating the functionality of the basic concept, the authors combined modeling and experiments to show how periodic exposure to green light enables efficient entrainment, and how the frequency of the forcing signal affects the oscillatory behavior (detuning).</p>
<p>This work provides an important demonstration of engineering tunability into a foundational genetic circuit, expands the synthetic biology toolbox, and provides a platform to address critical questions about synchronization in biological oscillators. Due to the flexibility of the experimental system, it is also expected to provide a fertile ground for future testing of theoretical predictions regarding non-linear oscillators.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study provides a simple and elegant mechanism for the entertainment of a synthetic oscillator. The design relies on optogenetic proteins, which enable efficient experimentation compared to alternative approaches (like using chemical inducers). This way, a static culture (without microfluidics or change of growth media) can be easily exposed to flexible temporal sequences of the zeitgeber, and continuously measured through time.</p>
<p>The study makes use of both plate-reader-based population-level readout and mother-machine single-cell measurements. Synchronization through entrainment is a single cell level phenomenon, but with a clear population-level manifestation. Thus, this experimental approach combination provides a strong validation to their system. At the same time, differences between the readout from the two systems have emerged, and provided a further opportunity for model refinement and testing.</p>
<p>The authors correctly identified the main optimization goal, namely the effective leakiness of their construct even under red light. Then, they successfully overcame this issue using synthetic biology approaches.</p>
<p>The work is supported by a simplified model of the repressilator, which provides a convenient analytical and numerical means to draw testable predictions. The model predictions are well aligned with the experimental evidence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Even after optimizing the expression level of the light-sensitive gene, the system is very sensitive, i.e., a very short exposure is sufficient to elicit the strongest entertainment. This limited dynamic range might hamper some model testing and future usage.</p>
<p>As a result of the previous point, the system is entrained by transiently &quot;breaking&quot; the oscillator: each pulse of green light represents a Hopf bifurcation into a single attractor. it means that the system cannot oscillate in constant green light. In comparison, this is generally not the case for natural zeitgebers like light and temperature for the circadian rhythms. Extreme values might prevent oscillations (not necessarily due to breaking the core oscillator), but usually, free running is possible in a wide range of constant conditions. In some cases, the free-running period length will vary as a function of the constant value. While the approach presented in this manuscript is valid, a comprehensive analysis of more subtle modes of repressilator entrainment could also be of value.</p>
<p>The entire work makes use of a single intensity and single duration of the green pulse to force entrainment. While the model has clear predictions for how those modalities should affect entrainment, none of the experiments attempted to validate those predictions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While we agree with the Reviewer that all reported experiments were performed with pulses of constant amplitude and duration, we do not see this as a necessary limitation for future studies on the optorepressilator. Using pulse-width modulation, green light intensity could be easily and continuously modulated from zero to a maximum value (as in Fig. 4), exploring a wide range of intermediate intensity levels and therefore of mean LacI production rates from the optogenetic promoter. We do not include additional experiments in the revised manuscript but we have greatly expanded the theoretical discussion on the low amplitude regime, both for a constant illumination (new Supplementary Materials Section 5) and the pulsed case (new Supplementary Fig. 8).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The introduction emphasized the utility of entrainment as a means to achieve population-wide synchrony. It is worth mentioning also that it enables synchronization of the internal oscillator with an external zeitgeber, to achieve a specific phase-locking between them. Often, this is the main utility attributed to entrainment, e.g., in circadian clocks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following Reviewer’s suggestion we now say in the introduction:</p>
<p>These oscillations maintain a constant phase relation to the external light cue that can act as a zeitgeber.</p>

<p>(2) It is sometimes unclear at first glance which of the figure panels show simulation data and which show experimental data (e.g., Figure 5a,b; Figure 6a,b). More explicitly labeling the panels could help.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out, we now explicitly label all the panels.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 3b - please add a color bar to indicate the meaning of the red-green scale, and enlarge the markers so their color is more visible. Also, can add additional controls of (i) sfGFP expression without the ccaR, and (ii) the autofluorescent signal from wild type. Please also provide the raw data (not the time derivatives) in a supplementary figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A colorbar has been added and markers enlarged.</p>
<p>(i) Unfortunately we do not have a control for GFP expression without ccaR.</p>
<p>(ii) autofluorescence signal from “a negative control consisting of DHL708 with plasmids pNO286-3 and pSR58-0 (optogenetic plasmids without sfGFP cassette)” has been added for comparison to Fig.3b. This modification was actually very helpful in understanding that the sensitivity threshold in our experiments is mainly determined by autofluorescence. OD600 and fluorescence raw data are now provided in Supplementary Fig. 6.</p>

<p>(4) Figure 3d - the claim in the text is that the purple optorepressilator and the wildtype repressilator have identical periods and amplitude. However, it seems from the figure that there is a small difference in the period length. This deviation is not problematic in any way, but I wondered whether it might actually be explained by the model, assuming that there is still a very weak leak from the new construct. In other words, would the model predict a bifurcation diagram in which an increasing x' concentration causes a gradual decrease in amplitude and increase in period, before the loss of rhythmicity? If so, Figure 3d can serve not only as a technical optimization demonstration but also as a nice validation of the model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. We now report, in Supplementary Materials Section 5, a theoretical prediction of the period with respect to a constant concentration of x'. For our choice of parameters (adjusted to reproduce the main experimental quantitative features) we find a period that decreases with x'. Leakage would therefore lead to a shorter period, contrary to what is observed experimentally. To explain the longer period observed in the optorepressilator we went back to extract the average growth rates of bacteria in the purple optorepressilator and repressilator curves in Fig.3d. As we now discuss in the main text:</p>
<p>“The slight difference in period can be explained by the presence of additional plasmids in the optorepressilator strain, which results in a lower growth rate (Supplementary Figures 4 and 5). As found in the digital approximation, the repressilator period is mainly controlled by the inverse growth rate (see Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure 9) meaning a lower growth rate results in a longer oscillation period. When we normalize the time with the growth rate the two oscillations overlap nicely (Supplementary Figure 4).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Supplementary Figure 10 has no reference from the main text. it is unclear what's the difference from Figure 3. In general, many items in the supplementary materials are not referenced from the text. In addition, on many occasions, there is a reference to &quot;supplementary information&quot; without a specific address, which is not so useful to the reader. In any case possible, please be more specific. Also, note that there's inconsistency in referring to the supplemental section as &quot;supplementary materials&quot; vs &quot;supplemental information&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now explicitly reference all Supplementary Figures in the main text and use consistent reference to Supplementary Materials.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The discussion at the bottom of p.7 (&quot;Optogenetic entrainment&quot;) is missing a reference to the duration and intensity of the zeitgeber: In the example from human circadian rhythms it doesn't indicate light intensity; In the modeling of the PRC, both modalities are absent. it is important at least to indicate the parameters used for the simulation and experiments. It would be even better to explore in the model how these modalities affect the PRC and entrainment. And it would be incredible if the authors could show this also experimentally.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now report the light intensity values for:</p>
<p>- our experiments:</p>
<p>“We first demonstrate this by monitoring the population signal from CFP (reporting TetR or 𝑦 in the model) in multiwell cultures under constant red illumination (9.82 W/m^2) interrupted by green light pulses (5.64 W/m^2) with a duration of 2 h and period 𝑇 = 18 h.”</p>
<p>For mother machine experiments “Green and red light stimuli were provided by the two LEDs (Thorlabs M530L4, Thorlabs M660L4) with respective intensities 6 W/m^2 and 26 W/m^2 for the synchronization experiments, and 1.1 W/m^2 and 4.5 W/m^2 for the entrainment experiments.”</p>
<p>- and simulations:</p>
<p>“In Fig. 5a we report the phase shift produced by a single pulse (with duration tau=2 h and intensity beta’=80 h-1 fixed for all the simulations) as a function of the pulse arrival phase ϕ.”</p>
<p>We also added an additional supplementary figure (Supplementary Fig. 7) that explores how the duration and intensity of the light pulses affect the PRC in the model. An approximate analytic result is also derived for the PRC in the digital approximation that compares very well with simulation, providing physical insight into PRC shape (Supplementary Materials Section 7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The experimental validation of the PRC can be much more thorough. Notably, an entrainment experiment with repeated pulses does not provide the same level of validation as a proper PRC experiment. This is because many differently shaped PRCs can give rise to the same entrainment pattern, as long as their fixed-point phases are the same.</p>
<p>Luckily, there might already be a decent amount of data from the mother machine experiments to fit with the PRC prediction, given the authors have pulsed a non-synchronized population that spans the entire x-axis of the PRC. It is possible that a proper PRC experiment wouldn't be too difficult with the plate reader either, given the throughput of the author's system.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very interesting suggestion but unfortunately, in our mother machine data, the first pulse arrives before the cells have completed a full cycle, so although different cells receive the first pulse at a sufficiently randomized phase, we can’t extract their individual phases at the pulse arrival time.</p>
<p>Indeed it would be possible to design a plate reader experiment for the specific purpose of directly measuring the PRC. However, our current protocol involves continuous manual dilutions, which makes it rather laborious. We are currently working on an automated procedure that will allow us to systematically address this and other interesting suggestions in the future.</p>
<p>An indirect experimental validation of the PRC is however still possible using available data. See added red points in Fig.5a and reply to point 10 below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The discrepancy between the mother machine and plate reader experiments in Figure 5 is explained by a difference in growth rate variability in the two systems. It is not readily obvious how a difference in variability rather than the mean value of the period length can cause a shifted mean phase. It is only hinted in the text that growth rate has two different effects - on the period as well as the amplitude. I hypothesize that because of this period and amplitude correlation, there is a bias contribution to the sum of trajectories that have resulted in a shifted mean phase. Maybe there is another contribution from the asymmetric waveform of the signal? or from the distribution the alpha is sampled from? A direct discussion on that point will make the results much clearer. If the period-amplitude speculation above is right, please add also a panel that shows it. It will also be helpful to show the predicted PRC for the two parameter regimens.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. In the previous version of the manuscript we omitted the fact that in order to better match experimental signals we chose slightly different values for T_L/T_0 for simulations in Fig. 5d and 5e. We now report the values of all simulation parameters in the revised manuscript. This difference could also contribute to the shift in the mean phase for the two cases. We added this information in the main text.</p>
<p>“The bottom panel in Fig. 5d shows the result of a numerical simulation with the same parameters as in Fig. 1b and the addition of a periodic light stimulation, with period $T_L/T_0 = 1$} [...] For the simulations in the lower panel of Fig.5e, all parameters remained the same as in Fig.5d with the exception of the period of the light pulses (T_L/T_0 = 0.97) and the standard deviation of the growth rate distribution, which was increased from 0.034 h^-1 to 0.071 h^-1 to better reproduce the experimental observations in the mother machine.”</p>
<p>Additionally, we added a supplementary figure (Supplementary Fig. 9) demonstrating the correlation between period and amplitude of the oscillations, for simulations with varying growth rate.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) The results from the detuning experiments are really nice, especially the decomposition in high frequency shown in Figure 6c. However, the experiments explore only the very high forcing amplitude conditions. Is there any way to test the weaker forcing regimens, as these are expected to uncover the interesting areas in between the Arnold's tongues? If this is experimentally difficult, it would be interesting to include at least the model prediction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for stimulating us to go in this direction. We have performed simulations to explore model predictions for areas between the Arnold’s tongues. We find onset of entrainment as the amplitude increases and also the existence of intermediate plateaus at fractional frequency ratios. These results are now included in the Supplementary Fig. 8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Another prediction from the Arnold's tongue would be the relative phase of entrainment in different f/v0 conditions. The text refers to it very briefly, but this is a quantitative prediction that can be demonstrated clearly in a figure - how well do they match? It can be shown, for example, by a plot with f/v0 on the x-axis, the phase difference between the pulse and peak expression on the y-axis, a curve representing the model prediction for that function, and dots (with error bars) representing the calculated values from the experimental data.</p>
<p>Generally, when suitable, this kind of direct comparison is more useful to the reader than the way the authors chose to compare simulation and experiments throughout the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this very interesting suggestion. We have completely rewritten the discussion on entrainment commenting on how the same PRC (phase shift vs pulse arrival phase) can be interpreted as a T_L/T_0-1 vs phase difference plot. Indeed in the new Fig.5a we plot over the theoretical PRC curve, the values of the relative phase of entrainment for three values of the period of the light pulses (from the data in Fig. 6b). The agreement is remarkably good, providing a further experimental validation of the predicted PRC.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) The raw data can be valuable for the community for reanalysis and further hypothesis testing. Hence, it will be very useful to make all of the data (e.g., the fluorescence signal quantification tables from all the experiments) publicly available.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We prepared files with all raw data, to be made available to the community.</p>
