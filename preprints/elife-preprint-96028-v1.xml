<title>Abstract</title><p>Some transcription factors (TFs) can form liquid-liquid phase separated (LLPS) condensates. However, the functions of these TF condensates in 3D genome organization and gene regulation remain elusive. In response to methionine (met) starvation, budding yeast TF Met4 and a few co-activators, including Met32, induce a set of genes involved in met biosynthesis. Here, we show that the endogenous Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Recombinant Met4 and Met32 form mixed droplets with LLPS properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. In relation to chromatin, Met4 puncta co-localize with target genes, and at least a subset of these target genes are clustered in 3D in a Met4-dependent manner. A <italic>MET3pr</italic>-GFP reporter inserted near several native Met4 binding sites becomes co-localized with Met4 puncta and displays enhanced transcriptional activity. A Met4 variant with a partial truncation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) shows less puncta formation, and this mutant selectively reduces the reporter activity near Met4 binding sites to the basal level. Overall, these results support a model where Met4 and co-activators form condensates to bring multiple target genes into a vicinity with higher local TF concentrations, which facilitates a strong response to methionine depletion.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromosomes form extensive 3D contacts that can occur over long linear genomic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Marenduzzo et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fazary et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Misteli 2020</xref>). A subset of these interactions, such as promoter-promoter or promoter-enhancer looping, are thought to play a central role in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mifsud et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Schoenfelder and Fraser 2019</xref>). In some cases, multiple genes come together in 3D space to form “multi-gene clusters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mir et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lim and Levine 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhu et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uyehara and Apostolou 2023</xref>). These clusters often involve co-regulated genes responding to stress or other types of environmental cues, such as heat shock, starvation, virus infection, or developmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ferrier and Minguillón 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Sawado et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McCord et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Du and Bai 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Faryabi 2023</xref>). Evidence from imaging and genomic studies suggests that these gene clusters may be related to a phenomenon called “transcription factories”, where RNA polymerase II (Pol lI), mediator, and nascent transcripts coalesce into distinct foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bartlett et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Faro-Trindade and Cook 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carter et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xu and Cook 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sutherland and Bickmore 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Papantonis and Cook 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Rieder et al. 2012</xref>). Proteomic analysis of transcription factories showed that they are also enriched with other components in the transcription pathway, including transcription factors (TFs), histone modification enzymes, and chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lyons et al. 2023</xref>). Overall, these observations suggest that some co-regulated genes can physically cluster into sub-nuclear compartments with elevated local concentrations of transcription-related factors.</p>
<p>How multi-gene clusters are formed is not well understood. Since co-regulated genes are often activated by a common set of TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kiran and Nagarajaram 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mir et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Tsai et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Uyehara and Apostolou 2023</xref>), such clustering may be mediated by the DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions of the TFs. Recent studies showed that TFs like Gcn4, OCT4, and TAZ, as well as some co-factors such as the mediator and histone-acetylation reader Brd4, tend to form biomolecular condensates through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Whyte et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boija et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sabari et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gibson et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. 2021</xref>). In LLPS, multivalent interactions among proteins, often through their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), allow them to condensate into liquid-like droplets that are separated from the aqueous phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banani et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dignon et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Peng et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mitrea et al. 2022</xref>). The existence of TF / co-factor condensates is supportive of the “transcription factory” model mentioned above where transcription-related factors are locally concentrated through LLPS. So far, LLPS of TFs and co-factors are often studied <italic>in vitro</italic> using purified systems or <italic>in vivo</italic> with artificial induction. How these proteins behave in a chromatin context at the endogenous concentration, and more specifically, if they contribute to multi-gene cluster formation, is not very clear.</p>
<p>Another unresolved issue related to multi-gene clusters is their functional role in gene regulation. Earlier studies of gene clusters found a positive correlation between clustering and gene expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Li et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Whyte et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Zhang and Bai 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mir et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhu et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Faryabi 2023</xref>), but the mechanism of the phenomenon was not clear. This again may be related to TF / co-factor condensates: if a gene cluster is situated within a condensate, higher local concentrations of these factors can potentially enhance expression. This is proposed to be the case at super-enhancers, where the condensates of co-factors like Med1 and Brd4 are thought to drive the high transcriptional activities of the target genes. However, some reports studying TF condensates reveal a complex, sometimes contradictory, relation to gene expression, where the condensates are observed to have positive, negative, or neutral effects on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al. 2021</xref>). In a recent study of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes, for example, it is proposed that Gal4 condensation facilitates their recruitment to target genes but does not contribute to gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Meeussen et al. 2023</xref>). In general, the relation between TF condensates, multi-gene cluster, and gene regulation needs to be further studied.</p>
<p>Upon met depletion (-met) in budding yeast, Met4 is recruited by several sequence-specific DNA-binding co-activators, including Cbf1, Met31, and Met32, to bind and rapidly activated a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Thomas et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ouni et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carrillo et al. 2012</xref>). This activator complex is further stabilized with Met28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kuras et al. 1997</xref>). In a previous study, we carried out a screen to probe long-distance gene regulation that affected <italic>MET3</italic> promoter (<italic>MET3pr</italic>) activity by inserting an insulated <italic>MET3pr-</italic>GFP reporter into many genomic loci and measuring GFP intensity in -met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Du et al. 2017</xref>). At most locations, the reporter has comparable induction level; however, it shows enhanced activity at a small subset of loci, which were defined as “transcriptional hotspots” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Du et al. 2017</xref>). These hotspots tend to be located near endogenous Met4 target genes, and 3C assay detects physical proximity among the hotspots. These results lead to a hypothesis that hotspots occur at loci where <italic>MET</italic> genes cluster, and such clustering and transcriptional elevation may be both mediated by the condensates of related TFs.</p>
<p>In this study, we test the hypothesis above using a combination of biochemistry, genetics, genomics, and imaging approaches. We demonstrate that Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta in the yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Purified Met32 forms condensate with LLPS properties <italic>in vitro</italic>, with which Met4 can merge. In relation to chromatin, we show that the loci that are associated with the Met TFs co-localize with the Met4 puncta, and at least a subset of Met4 target genes cluster in 3D nuclear space in a Met4-dependent manner. Functionally, the <italic>MET3pr-GFP</italic> reporter inserted near the endogenous Met4 target sites shows higher enrichment of Met TFs / Pol II and enhanced transcriptional activity (hotspots). A Met4 IDR truncation that reduces Met4 puncta formation selectively affects the reporter activity at hotspots. Collectively, our results support a model where TFs in the met response pathway form LLPS condensates, organize multiple target genes in their vicinity, and enhance gene expression by creating a local environment with elevated concentrations of transcription-related factors. This may represent a common strategy for cells to concentrate limited resources to mount a strong response to stress.</p>

<title>The trans-activator Met4 and its co-factor Met32 form puncta in the nucleus</title>
<p>Our previous study presented evidence that the “hotspots” for <italic>MET3pr</italic> transcription may form 3D clusters, but the mechanisms of clustering and transcriptional elevation are unknown. Given the recent reports on TF condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sabari et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Zhang et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Okada et al. 2023</xref>), we hypothesize that these phenomena may be related to condensates formed by TFs in the <italic>MET</italic> pathway. To test this possibility, we labeled the endogenous Met4 protein with GFP and visualized Met4 in live cells under Airyscan confocal microscopy (<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>; see <bold>Table S1</bold> for strain list). We observed nuclear-localized Met4-GFP under both the repressed (+met) and activated (-met) conditions, with the latter showing higher intensity. Importantly, the Met4-GFP displays puncta-like structures, especially under -met (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> &amp; S1A</bold>). As controls, we constructed strains expressing a nuclear-localized free GFP or GFP fused to various chromatin-associated factors, including TFs Cbf1 and Reb1, and Sth1, a subunit of RSC nucleosome remodeler, which also bind chromatin with sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cai and Davis 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ju et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Donovan et al. 2023</xref>). The GFP signals appear more evenly distributed in these control strains (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold>). To evaluate the distribution more quantitatively, we calculated the coefficient of variance (CV) of the fluorescent intensities among the pixels inside each nuclei (<bold>Materials and Methods, Table S2</bold>). Uneven distribution of the GFP molecules would result in large variations in the pixel intensities and higher CVs. The CVs of Met4-GFP in both ±met conditions are significantly higher than free GFP and other nuclear proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold>). Since the strains in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold> express GFP at different levels, which directly affect CV, we also calculated the Fano number (variance divided by the mean) to control for this variable. Met4-GFP in the -met condition has the largest Fano number (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> &amp; S1B</bold>), which indicates that in the activated state it forms the most punctate structures. These data support the notion that Met4 forms condensates in the nuclei upon activation.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next carried out the same experiment with Met32, the DNA binding co-factor of Met4. We imaged cells containing endogenous Met32 labeled with mCherry and compared its distribution to free mCherry. Unlike Met4, Met32-mCherry is barely visible in +met, and it is significantly upregulated in -met (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> &amp; S1C</bold>). In the latter condition, Met32-mCherry also shows uneven distribution with high CV and Fano number (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E, F</xref> &amp; S1D</bold>). We also imaged Met31-mCherry, but its concentration is too low to be detected. When Met4-GFP and Met32-mCherry are tagged in the same strain, their fluorescent signals largely overlap (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> &amp; S1E</bold>). To quantify the overlap, we extracted the GFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities for all the pixels inside each nucleus and calculated their correlation coefficient. As a control, we carried out the same analysis with co-expressed Sth1-GFP and Met32-mCherry, which appear to be less co-localized (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). Indeed, the Pearson correlation between Met4 and Met32 fluorescence on average was 0.75, much higher than that between Sth1 and Met32 (<italic>R</italic> = 0.19) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref></bold>). Overall, the puncta-like structures of Met4 and Met32 and their co-localization support the possibility that these two factors co-condensate under the -met condition.</p>

<title>Met32 forms condensates with LLPS properties <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>LLPS is proposed to be a mechanism that leads to TF condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banani et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boeynaems et al. 2018</xref>). To test if this mechanism applies to Met4 and Met32, we first evaluated their propensity to phase separate using the FuzDrop algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hatos et al. 2022</xref>). All the Met activators, including Met4, Met31, Met32, and Met28, are predicted to have higher LLPS probabilities than GFP and mCherry (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>). Among these TFs, Met4 and Met32 have particularly high scores, which suggests they function as droplet drivers that can spontaneously phase separate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vendruscolo and Fuxreiter 2022</xref>). In addition, both factors are predicted to have large unstructured domains, a feature known to promote LLPS (<bold>Fig. S2A &amp; B</bold>).</p>

<p>We next purified Met4 and Met32 to study their condensation properties <italic>in vitro</italic>. Like many other recombinant TFs, Met4 is prone to degradation. We managed to extract full length Met4 tagged with 6xHis and MBP on the N- and C-terminal, respectively, although some degradation products could not be avoided (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>) (<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). We imaged the purified Met4 labeled with Alexa488 in various buffers. Met4 remains diffusive up to 5 μM at physiological salt concentrations and forms aggregates at higher density or lower salt concentrations (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). Although these results suggest that Met4 may not inherently undergo LLPS, we cannot rule out the potential effects from impurities (degradation products) and tags on our observations. In contrast, we managed to purify high-quality Met32 fused with mCherry (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). At the physiological salt concentration with no crowding agents, Met32-mCherry forms condensates at various concentrations from 1 to 20 µM (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> &amp; S2C</bold>). These condensates show properties consistent with LLPS such as droplet fusion (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold>) and fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>). The Met32-mCherry condensates have a 64 ± 9.7s half recovery time, comparable to well-established LLPS proteins such as FUS (5-120 seconds), DDX4 (3-200 seconds), and hnRNPA1 (5-120 seconds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nott et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Shin et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">McSwiggen et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>To further test potential Met4 / Met32 co-condensation, we added purified Met4 and Met32 together in 150 mM NaCl buffer and imaged in both Alexa488 and mCherry channels. The two proteins are mixed into droplets in solution (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). In these co-localized droplets, Met32-mCherry still undergoes FRAP recovery with a slightly slower rate (83 ± 11s half recovery time) (<bold>Fig. S2D</bold>). These results are consistent with the idea that Met4 and Met32 can co-condense through a LLPS mechanism <italic>in vitro</italic>, which may contribute to the Met4 / Met32 puncta formation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Met4-activated genes co-localize with Met4 puncta</title>
<p>Since Met32 is a sequence-specific DNA binder, the Met4 / Met32 condensates can potentially contact multiple target genes. This leads to our model in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>, which predicts that 1) at least some Met4 activated genes should be co-localized with Met4 condensates, and 2) multiple target genes should cluster in 3D. To test these predictions, we first performed chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) of related TFs (Met4, Met32, Met28, Cbf1), as well as RNA-seq, to identify genes directly targeted by Met4. As expected, the bindings of Met4, Met32, and Met28 are strongly induced by met depletion, while Cbf1, an abundant pioneer factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kuras et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Blaiseau and Thomas 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ouni et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carrillo et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Yan et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Donovan et al. 2019</xref>), shows constitutive binding (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B &amp; C</xref>, S3A &amp; B</bold>).

<p>To determine if the Met4 target genes are co-localized with the Met4 puncta, we inserted 196X tetO repeats near two of these genes, <italic>MET13</italic> and <italic>MET6</italic>, which allow us to visualize these loci through their association with tetR-mCherry. We also created control strains with the same array inserted near <italic>PUT1</italic> and the mating locus <italic>MAT,</italic> two loci with no Met4 association.

To test this more quantitatively, we aligned these images with the chromatin dots at the center and averaged the surrounding GFP signals (<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). For all four loci, the averaged GFP intensities are higher near the center because the distant pixels are more likely to be outside nuclei boundaries, where Met4 signals are absent (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F &amp; G</xref></bold>).

<p>We next tested the second prediction of the model in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>, i.e., Met4 condensates mediate the 3D clustering of target genes. We first carried out a Hi-C measurement under -met condition, which did not show any significant interactions among Met4 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Given the limitations of Hi-C in detecting fine-scale interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Oluwadare et al. 2019</xref>), we used an assay recently developed in our lab, Methyltransferase Targeting-based chromosome Architecture Capture (MTAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al. 2023</xref>), to identify potential chromosomal interactions with selected Met4 targets (<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). In this method, a 256X LacO array is inserted near the gene of interest (viewpoint, or VP) to recruit LacI fused with DNA methyltransferase M.CviPI, which methylates proximal cytosines in the “GC” context in <italic>cis</italic> and in <italic>trans</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref></bold>).

<p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al. 2023</xref>), we performed MTAC assays with a VP near the <italic>MET6</italic> gene under ± met condition. This VP 3kb away from <italic>MET6</italic> captures highly-specific inter-chromosomal interactions with four other Met4-targeted genes under -met, but not +met, condition. To further illustrate this point, we carried out MTAC with <italic>MET13</italic> as the VP (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref></bold>). Under +met condition, MTAC only detects interactions from the adjacent local chromatin (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, S4A</bold>). When the same strain was switched to the -met condition, MTAC captures two far-<italic>cis</italic> interactions (intra-chromosomal interactions that are over 30kb apart) with two promoter regions near Met4 targeted genes (<italic>STR3</italic>, <italic>MUP1</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, S4A</bold>). Interestingly, these two regions were also found to interact with the <italic>MET6</italic> VP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Li et al. 2023</xref>). Taken together, these data support the clustering of a subset of Met4-targeted genes upon activation.</p>
<p>The model in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold> implies that the clustering of <italic>MET</italic> genes is mediated by Met4 / Met32. To test this idea, we carried out MTAC using the <italic>MET6</italic> VP ± acute auxin-induced degradation of Met4 ± met (<bold>Fig. S4B &amp; C</bold>). For the -met experiment, auxin (IAA) was added 30 mins prior to the met depletion so that Met4 activation would be largely eliminated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref></bold>). This would also prevent the accumulation of Met32, as it relies on Met4 for induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Menant et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lee et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Carrillo et al. 2012</xref>). Consistent with our previous observations, very few long-distance interactions were found in the +met repressed condition, regardless of the presence or absence of Met4 (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, (1) and (3)</bold>). Upon met depletion without IAA addition, we observed significant <italic>trans</italic> (inter-chromosomal) interactions between the <italic>MET6</italic> locus with three other Met4-targeted genes (<italic>MUP1</italic>, <italic>STR3</italic>, <italic>YKG9</italic>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, (2)</bold>). Importantly, these interactions disappear when Met4 was degraded (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, (4)</bold>). These data show that the presence of Met4, and likely Met32, is required for <italic>MET</italic> gene clustering. This is consistent with the model in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold> that clustering is mediated by Met4 / Met32 condensates.</p>

<title>Regions near Met TF binding sites constitute <italic>MET</italic> “transcriptional hotspot” in haploid yeast</title>
<p>We next investigated the functional role of Met4 condensates in gene expression. In our previous screen, we identified the <italic>MET13</italic> locus on chr7 as a “transcriptional hotspot”: when the <italic>S.kud MET3pr-</italic>GFP reporter was inserted into <italic>MET13</italic> or neighboring genes, it showed higher GFP expression than most of the other insertion sites upon induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Du et al. 2017</xref>). Combined with the observation that <italic>MET13</italic> locus co-localizes with the Met4 puncta (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref></bold>), this suggests a potential link between the higher reporter activity and Met4 / Met32 condensates. However, the initial screen was performed in diploids, while all the experiments above were carried out in haploids. We therefore first tested if <italic>MET13</italic> also functions as a transcriptional hotspot in haploid yeast. We again used the <italic>S.kud MET3pr</italic> for this test, as the sequence of this promoter deviates significantly with the endogenous <italic>MET3pr</italic>, allowing them to be differentiated in PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Du et al. 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>We created two haploid strains with the <italic>S.kud MET3pr-</italic>GFP reporter inserted near the <italic>MET13</italic> gene (<italic>CWC23</italic> and <italic>RSM23</italic>) and measured its transcriptional profile (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>) (<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>). For comparison, we also inserted the same reporter into two non-hotspot basal loci <italic>ATG36</italic> and <italic>LDS2</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). The GFP intensities from the reporter at <italic>CWC23</italic> and <italic>RSM23</italic> loci are ∼50% higher (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt; 1e-4) compared to the control under the -met condition (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Reporter GFP mRNA levels, as well as Pol II associated with the GFP ORF, are also significantly higher in the former strains (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C &amp; D</xref></bold>).

<p>Given the model in <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>, we reasoned that the enhanced activities of the GFP reporter may be due to increased local concentrations of TFs, which likely lead to higher TF occupancies. To test this idea, we performed ChIP of Met4 and Met32 followed by qPCR on the <italic>S.kud MET3pr</italic> at the hotspot vs basal genomic locations because it contains a Met32 motif.

This data supports a model where Met4 condensates associated with the endogenous <italic>MET</italic> genes enhance the activity of a nearby reporter. This model also predicts that such enhancement effect should be specific to the met pathway, i.e., inducible genes activated by other TFs should not benefit from higher local concentrations of <italic>MET</italic> activators.

<title>The deletion of a disordered region in Met4 reduces puncta formation and reporter expression at transcriptional hotspots</title>
<p>To determine the relation between Met4 condensates and its gene regulatory function more directly, we introduced mutations to Met4 to reduce its propensity to form condensates. Since LLPS is often promoted by IDRs, we first performed PONDR analysis of Met4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xue et al. 2010</xref>). This analysis reveals three distinct stretches of IDRs interspersed with two previously annotated functional domains: the activation domain (aa95-144), which interacts with mediator, and the auxiliary domain (aa312-375), which interacts with Met31/32 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kuras and Thomas 1995</xref>). AlphaFold also predicts that Met4 is largely devoid of folded structures (<bold>Fig. S2A</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jumper et al. 2021</xref>). To probe the effect of these IDRs on Met4 puncta formation, we first truncated individual IDR stretches: ΔIDR1 (aa1-69), ΔIDR2 (aa117-359), or ΔIDR3 (aa397-651). As Met4 is essential for cell viability in the -met media, we constructed strains containing the endogenous unlabeled Met4 with an additional copy of truncated Met4-GFP driven by the native <italic>MET4</italic> promoter. This allows us to visualize Met4 mutants without hindering cell growth (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref></bold>). Deletions of IDR2 and IDR3 both lead to significant reductions in Met4-GFP Fano number, with ΔIDR2 having a slightly more pronounced effect (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B &amp; C</xref>, S5A</bold>). To further specify the part of IDR2 that affects Met4 condensates, we generated shorter truncations within IDR2, ΔIDR2.1 (aa117-135), ΔIDR2.2 (aa136-270), and ΔIDR2.3 (aa271-359). All three truncations result in intermediate GFP Fano number between the full length Met4 and Met4-ΔIDR2 (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>, S5B &amp; C</bold>). These findings suggest that multiple IDRs contribute to Met4 condensation, and deleting parts of the Met4 IDR can diminish, but not completely eliminate, Met4 puncta formation.</p>

<p>When the full length Met4 is replaced by Met4 ΔIDR2.3, the strain is viable in the absence of met, allowing us to evaluate the functional consequence of this mutant on Met4 binding and transcriptional activation. Given our model and supporting evidence that Met4 condensates increase local TF concentration at Met4 targeted genes and enhance their expression, we expect a Met4 mutant less prone to condensate will result in diminished Met4 binding and reduced induction. We therefore compared the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data of the full-length vs truncated Met4. Consistent with the idea above, the Met4 ΔIDR2.3 shows decreased binding across all the previously annotated Met TF binding sites, without generating new ChIP-seq peaks (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> &amp; E</bold>). Interestingly, the three Met4 binding sites near <italic>MUP1</italic>, <italic>STR3</italic>, and <italic>YKG9</italic> that cluster with <italic>MET6</italic> show significantly more reduction in Met4 ChIP-seq peaks (reduced to 42±4%) than other Met4 sites (61±8%, <italic>P</italic>-value = 0.02) in the Met4 ΔIDR2.3 strain. Out of the 40 potential target genes, 22 show significant decreases in their mRNA level (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>, S5D, Table S4</bold>). Importantly, our model also predicts that decreased Met4 condensation should have more impact on target genes that are located near Met4 puncta than those farther away. To test this idea, we again took advantage of the <italic>MET3pr</italic>-GFP reporter inserted into hotspots and basal loci. We expect the reduced Met4 condensation to have a larger impact on the reporter activity in the former case because the reporter is only associated with Met4 puncta at hotspots (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). Indeed, after substituting Met4 with Met4-ΔIDR2.3 in these strains, we observed strong decreases in the reporter gene activity in hotspots but minimal effect on those in basal regions (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref></bold>). These findings collectively support a model wherein Met4 condensates cluster target genes, enhance their activity, and give rise to the formation of transcriptional hotspots.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we investigated TF distribution, 3D genome organization, and gene activation in the met response pathway using a combination of genetics, genomics, and imaging approaches. Our findings connect three emerging phenomena in gene regulation: TF condensates, co-regulated gene cluster, and transcriptional hotspot. More specifically, we show that the activator Met4 and its co-factor Met32 form puncta-like structures that co-localize with at least some Met4 target genes. Multiple <italic>MET</italic> genes on different chromosomes cluster in the 3D nuclei space, and such clustering requires the presence of Met4. Chromosomal loci near endogenous Met4 binding sites, in one case within a 40kb range, are hotspots for <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter expression. Mutations that decrease Met4 puncta formation lead to selective reduction of the reporter transcriptional activity at the hotspots.</p>

<title>Condensate formation of Met4 and Met32</title>
<p>Using live-cell imaging, we found that fluorescently labeled Met4 and Met32 from puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei under the -met condition. This is reflected by the higher Fano numbers in Met4 / Met32 pixel intensities in comparison to free GFP, and in the Met4 case, other chromatin-associated factors. High resolution microscopy of yeast TFs is challenging due to the small size of the nuclei. The low intensities of the Met4 / Met32 signals require high excitation for imaging, which also makes them prone to photo-bleaching. Thus, we were unable to measure Met4 and Met32 puncta dynamics <italic>in vivo</italic>. When purified <italic>in vitro</italic>, Met32-mCherry readily forms droplets with typical LLPS properties without molecular crowder, while His- and MBP-tagged Met4 remains diffusive at physiological salt concentration. We also found that Met4 partitions into the Met32 droplets when they are mixed, and inside cells, the two factors show significant co-localization. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that Met32 serves as a scaffold to nucleate the co-condensates of Met4 and other Met TFs. This may explain why the Met4 distribution becomes more puncta-like when switched from +met to - met condition, when Met32 becomes available inside the nuclei. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of Met4 LLPS is due to our <italic>in vitro</italic> condition (tag, impurity, lack of post-translational modification, etc.). Met4 is also reported to recruit the Mediator and SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Leroy et al. 2006</xref>), and these factors, together with Pol II and RNA, may also affect Met4 condensate formation <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Henninger et al. 2021</xref>).</p>

<title>TF condensates and the 3D genome topology</title>
<p>TF condensation <italic>in vivo</italic> occurs in a chromatin context, but the relation between TF condensates and 3D genome topology has not been extensively studied. By recruiting multiple TFs, mediator, and transcription machineries into proximity, TF binding loci can potentially serve as nucleation sites for transcription condensates. Looped enhancers and promoters, as well as clustered genes, may also function as scaffold and stabilize these condensates. This is best illustrated at super-enhancers (SEs), where clustered enhancer sites tend to associate with transcriptional condensates and lead to very high activities of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hnisz et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sabari et al. 2018</xref>). Synthetic LacO array and endogenous microsatellite repeats were also shown to promote local condensation of associated TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chong et al. 2018</xref>). Reversely, TF condensates can mediate long-distance chromosomal interactions by contacting multiple genomic sites and therefore inducing their 3D proximity. This idea is supported by the findings here: 1) multiple Met4-targeted genes are co-localized with Met4 condensates, 2) at least a subset of Met4-targeted genes form clusters with long-distance intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and 3) such clustering only occurs in -met activating condition in the presence of Met4. Similar observations were made during yeast heat shock response, where the activator Hsf1 coalesces and mediates transient clustering of heat shock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al. 2019</xref>). A few other mammalian TFs were also shown to contribute to 3D genome conformation. For example, YAP/TAZ organizes their target sites into clusters that co-localize with the YAP/TAZ/TEAD1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al. 2020</xref>). NUP98-HOXA9, a chimeric TF related to the pathogenesis of AML, was also shown to mediate long-distance chromosomal loops between NUP98-HOXA9 bound enhancers and oncogenes into SE-like clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahn et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, a <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter that is associated and activated by Met4 only co-localizes with Met4 puncta when inserted near native Met4 binding sites. Also, adding <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter gene into these sites does not further increase the local Met4 concentration (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B &amp; C</xref></bold>). These observations indicate that Met4 binding is not <italic>sufficient</italic> for a gene to nucleate or be recruited into a Met4 condensate. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear, but we speculate that some properties of the endogenous <italic>MET</italic> genes may facilitate their clustering with Met4 puncta. For example, some <italic>MET</italic> genes, like <italic>MET13</italic> and <italic>MET6</italic>, are associated with nuclear pore complex (NPC) even in the presence of met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Forey et al. 2021</xref>). The tethering by NPCs may increase the chance for these genes to come into proximity, enhancing the local density of Met4 target sites to nucleate the Met4 condensates. In contrast, a reporter gene inserted into random genomic locations may not be optimally positioned to contact NPC and/or other Met4 target genes. Further experiments are required to test these ideas. Notably, interaction with NPC was found to be necessary and sufficient to promote clustering of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brickner et al. 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>TF condensates and gene expression</title>
<p>The Met4 condensates represent a local environment with elevated Met4 concentrations, which can promote Met4 binding and lead to enhanced gene expression. Consistent with this idea, <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter inserted near these Met4 targets, which also co-localizes with the Met4 puncta, shows increased transcriptional activity. Near <italic>MET6</italic>, such hyper-activity of the reporter occurs over a 40kb range. According to previous measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bystricky et al. 2004</xref>), 40kb linear chromatin explores a 3D space with ∼200 nm diameter, which may reflect the size of the Met4 condensates. The elevation of transcription level is pathway-specific as <italic>GAL1Spr-</italic>GFP inserted into the same loci does not show the same effect. This finding agrees with the “specialized transcription factory” previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bartlett et al. 2006</xref>) and argues against a model where the transcription elevation solely relies on general transcription factors like mediator or transcription machinery.</p>
<p>The relation between Met4 condensation and transcriptional activity is further supported by Met4 ΔIDR2.3. This Met4 mutant, in comparison to full length Met4, reduces the Met4 puncta formation and the activities of most of its target genes in the genome. Importantly, ΔIDR2.3 does not have strong effect on the transcriptional activity of <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter inserted into basal loci, suggesting that this truncation does not directly impact Met4 integrity and its activation function. Instead, it selectively reduces reporter activity at transcriptional hotspots, consistent with the idea that such reduction is due to the disruption of Met4 condensates.</p>
<p>In terms of mechanism, we speculate that 1) high Met4 local concentration inside the condensates may increase the binding rate of Met4, and/or 2) multivalent interactions among Met4, Met32, and possibly other co-activators may slow down the dissociation of Met4 from its target genes. Both ideas are consistent with our observation that Met4 ΔIDR2.3 shows less binding than the full length Met4. The same mechanism has been proposed for other TF condensates, and in some cases, supported by direct kinetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Trojanowski et al. 2022</xref>). It should be noted that more TF binding does not necessarily lead to an increase in gene expression level, for example, transcription may be limited by a step downstream of TF binding. Consistent with this idea, a recent study reports that Gal4 condensation facilitates its recruitment to target genes but does not contribute to gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Meeussen et al. 2023</xref>). In human cells, artificially enhanced condensation of a TF Ews::Fli1 causes sequestering of this TF into the nucleolus, resulting in decreased expression of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chong et al. 2022</xref>). This indicates that the exact relation between TF condensates and gene expression relies on the nature of the multivalent interaction, location of condensate formation, transcription kinetics, etc., and it needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<title>TF condensates and stress response</title>
<p>The sulfur-containing amino acid methionine is a key metabolite for cell survival, and its depletion represents a major stress for budding yeast. Interestingly, the TFs that were found to form condensates in yeast, include Met4, Gal4, and Hsf1, all respond to certain types of environmental stress. Similar observations are made in higher eukaryotes. For example, YAP forms condensates in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cai et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al. 2020</xref>), and phyB in plants uses altered LLPS properties to sense light and temperature cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al. 2022</xref>). In contrast, constitutive TFs in yeast, like Reb1, Cbf1, and Sth1, are more evenly distributed in the nuclei (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref></bold>). The condensation of stress-responding TFs may reflect a functional need to rapidly concentrate related resources into a subset of the nuclei space for more efficient usage. In the case of Met4, its condensates indeed allow yeast cells to mount a stronger response to met depletion. In addition, TF condensates may accelerate TF target search and response rate, facilitate synchronized expression of target genes, and/or enhance the activation specificity. These potential condensate functions need to be further explored.</p>

<p>Yeast cells were grown in 50 ml SCD +10x Met media at OD<sub>660</sub> 0.3. The cells were centrifuged and washed 3 times with autoclaved H<sub>2</sub>O before transfer to 50 ml of SCD-Met and induced with 2 nM β-eastradiol for 2 hrs. After induction the cells were centrifuged at 4000g for 5 mins and collected in 800 µl of TE and 200 µl lysis buffer (0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0, 1 M Tris pH 8.0, 10% SDS) and incubated at 65 °C for 30 mins. The cell lysate (1ml) was then sonicated using a 30 s on 30 s off cycle at 4°C for 11 cycles. The sonicated lysate was centrifuged at 12,000g at 4 °C for 20 mins and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The supernatant was mixed with 500 µl for Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol (25:24:1) nucleic acid extraction. The methylated genomic DNA (5 µg) was incubated with 2 µg of anti-methylcytosine antibody in 1X IP buffer on a rotating platform 4°C for 8-12 hrs. Input DNA (1%, 50 ng) was set aside for normalization. The lysate/antibody complex was incubated with protein A/G agarose beads for 2 hrs and washed 3x with 1x IP buffer. The beads were resuspended with 210 µl digestion buffer and incubated on a rotating platform at 55 °C for 2 hrs. The eluted DNA was precipitated in 1 ml of ethanol and 3 µl glycogen (20mg/ml) and eluted in 60 µl of TE.</p>
<p>For strains with Met4 Auxin-induced degradation, we tagged the endogenous Met4 protein with V5-AID (Met4-V5-AID) and introduced OsTIR1 to the cells. Depletion of the Smc2 was achieved by adding auxin (Sigma, I2886) to a final concentration of 500 μM. Strains were incubated with auxin for 30 mins prior to MTAC experiment. Depletion was confirmed by western blot.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, James Lee, Lu Bai, and colleagues use a multifaceted approach to investigate the relationship between transcription factor condensate formation, transcription, and 3D gene clustering of the MET regulon in the model organism S. cerevisiae. This study represents a second clear example of inducible transcriptional condensates in budding yeast, as most evidence for transcriptional condensates arises from studies of mammalian systems. In addition, this study links the genomic location of transcriptional condensates to the potency of transcription of a reporter gene regulated by the master transcription factor contained in the condensate. The strength of evidence supporting these two conclusions is strong. Less strong is evidence supporting the claim that Met4-containing condensates mediate the clustering of genes in the MET regulon.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is for the most part clearly written, with the overriding model and specific hypothesis being tested clearly explained. Figure legends are particularly well written. An additional strength of the manuscript is that most of the main conclusions are supported by the data. This includes the propensity of Met4 and Met32 to form puncta-like structures under inducing conditions, formation of Met32-containing LLPS-like droplets in vitro (within which Met4 can colocalize), colocalization of Met4-GFP with Met4-target genes under inducing conditions, enhanced transcription of a Met3pr-GFP reporter when targeted within 1.5 - 5 kb of select Met4 target genes, and most impressively, evidence that several MET genes appear to reposition under transcriptionally inducing conditions. The latter is based on a recently reported novel in vivo methylation assay, MTAC, developed by the Bai lab.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My principal concern is that the authors fail to show convincing evidence for a key conclusion, highlighted in the title, that nuclear condensates per se drive MET gene clustering. Figure 4E demonstrates that Met4 molecules, not condensates per se, are necessary for fostering distant cis and trans interactions between MET6 and three other Met4 targets under -met inducing conditions. In addition, the paper would be strengthened by discussing a recent study conducted in yeast that comes to many of the same conclusions reported here, including the role of inducible TF condensates in driving 3D genome reorganization (Chowdhary et al, Mol. Cell 2022).</p>
<p>Other concerns:</p>
<p>(1) A central premise of the study is that the inducible formation of condensates underpins the induction of MET gene transcription and MET gene clustering. Yet, Figure 1 suggests (and the authors acknowledge) that puncta-like Met4-containing structures pre-exist in the nuclei of non-induced cells. Thus, the transcription and gene reorganization observed is due to a relatively modest increase in condensate-like structures. Are we dealing with two different types of Met4 condensates? (For example, different combinations of Met4 with its partners; Mediator- or Pol II-lacking vs. Mediator- or Pol II-containing; etc.?) At the very least, a comment to this effect is necessary.</p>
<p>(2) Using an in vitro assay, the authors demonstrate that Met4 colocalizes with Met32 LLPS droplets (Figure 2F). Is the same true in vivo - that is, is Met32 required for Met4 condensation? This could be readily tested using auxin-induced degradation of Met32. Along similar lines, the claim that Met32 is required for MET gene clustering (line 250) requires auxin-induced degradation of this protein.</p>
<p>(3) The authors use a single time point during -met induction (2 h) to evaluate TF clustering, transcription (mRNA abundance), and 3D restructuring. It would be informative to perform a kinetic analysis since such an analysis could reveal whether TF clustering precedes transcriptional induction or MET gene repositioning. Do the latter two phenomena occur concurrently or does one precede the other?</p>
<p>(4) Based on the MTAC assay, MET13 does not appear to engage in trans interactions with other Met4 targets, whereas MET6 does (Figures 4C and 4E). Does this difference stem from the greater occupancy of Met4 at MET6 vs. MET13, greater association of another Met co-factor with the chromatin of MET6 vs. MET13, or something else?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript combines live yeast cell imaging and other genomic approaches to study how transcription factor (TF) condensates might help organize and enhance the transcription of the target genes in the methionine starvation response pathway. The authors show that the TFs in this response can form phase-separated condensates through their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and mediate the spatial clustering of the related endogenous genes as well as reporter inserted near the endogenous target loci.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work uses rigorous experimental approaches, such as imaging of endogenously labeled TFs, determining expression and clustering of endogenous target genes, and reporter integration near the endogenous target loci. The importance of TFs is shown by rapid degradation. Single-cell data are combined with genomic sequencing-based assays. Control loci engineered in the same way are usually included. Some of these controls are very helpful in showing the pathway-specific effect of the TF condensates in enhancing transcription.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest weakness of this work is that the role of IDR and phase separation in mediating the target gene clustering is unclear. This is an important question. TF IDRs may have many functions including mediating phase separation and binding to other transcriptional molecules (not limited to proteins and may even include RNAs). The effect of IDR deletion on reduced Fano number in cells could come from reduced binding with other molecules. This should be tested on phase separation of the purified protein after IDR deletion. Also, the authors have not shown IDR deletion affects the clustering of the target genes, so IDR deletion may affect the binding of other molecules (not the general transcription machinery) that are specifically important for target gene transcription. If the self-association of the IDR is the main driving force of the clustering and target gene transcription enhancement, can one replace this IDR with totally unrelated IDRs that have been shown to mediate phase separation in non-transcription systems and still see the gene clustering and transcription enhancement effects? This work has all the setup to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The Met4 protein was tagged with MBP but Met 32 was not. MBP tag is well known to enhance protein solubility and prevent phase separation. This made the comparison of their in vitro phase behavior very different and led the authors to think that maybe Met32 is the scaffold in the co-condensates. If MBP was necessary to increase yield and solubility during expression and purification, it should be cleaved (a protease cleavage site should be engineered) to allow phase separation in vitro.</p>
<p>Are ATG36 and LDS2 also supposed to be induced by -met? This should be explained clearly. The signals are high at -met.</p>
<p>Figure 6B, the Met4-GFP seems to form condensates at all three loci without a very obvious difference, though 6C shows a difference. 6C is from only one picture each. The authors should probably quantify the signals from a large number of randomly selected pictures (cells) and do statistics.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors probe the connections between clustering of the Met4/32 transcription factors (TFs), clustering of their regulatory targets, and transcriptional regulation. While there is an increasing number of studies on TF clustering in vitro and in vivo, there is an important need to probe whether clustering plays a functional role in gene expression. Another important question is whether TF clustering leads to the clustering of relevant gene targets in vivo. Here the authors provide several lines of evidence to make a compelling case that Met4/32 and their target genes cluster and that this leads to an increase in transcription of these genes in the induced state. First, they found that, in the induced state, Met4/32 forms co-localized puncta in vivo. This is supported by in vitro studies showing that these TFs can form condensates in vitro with Med32 being the driver of these condensates. They found that two target genes, MET6 and MET13 have a higher probability of being co-localized with Met4 puncta compared with non-target loci. Using a targeted DNA methylation assay, they found that MET13 and MET6 show Met4-dependent long-range interactions with other Met4-regulated loci, consistent with the clustering of at least some target genes under induced conditions. Finally, by inserting a Met4-regulated reporter gene at variable distances from MET6, they provide evidence that insertion near this gene is a modest hotspot for activity.</p>

<p>(1) Please provide more information on the assay for puncta formation (Figure 1). It's unclear to me from the description provided how this assay was able to quantitate the number of puncta in cells.</p>
<p>1. How does the number of puncta in cells correspond with the number of Met-regulated genes? What are the implications of this calculation?</p>
<p>2. A control for chromosomal insertion of the Met-regulated reporter was a GAL4 promoter derivative reporter. However, this control promoter seems 5-10 fold more active than the Met-regulated promoter (Figure 6). It's possible that the high activity from the control promoter overcomes some other limiting step such that chromosomal location isn't important. It would be ideal if the authors used a promoter with comparable activity to the Met-reporter as a control.</p>
<p>(4) It seems like transcription from a very large number of genes is altered in the Met4 IDR mutant (Figure 7F). Why is this and could this variability affect the conclusions from this experiment?</p>
