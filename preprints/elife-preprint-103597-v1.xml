<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Malaria is a vector-borne disease, subject to climate change. The true impact of climate change on malaria dynamics is, however, still debated. Between 2008-2019, we studied patterns of malaria dynamics in a lowland area of western Kenya. We used wavelet analysis to assess the seasonality of monthly malaria incidence and related climatic factors, including air temperature, land surface temperature, rainfall and Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature. We performed a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform to decompose incidence and climatic factors and fitted bivariate linear regressions to analyse their relationships across time scales. We observed a strong semestrial seasonality of malaria with the emergence of an annual cycle with variation strongly associated with rainfall dynamics. Rainfall emerged as a significant short-term predictor, while temperature contributed more at higher time scales. We found a recent increase in the time lag between climatic factors and their related effects on malaria incidence. This augmentation is related to bed net coverage and El Niño events. Our study underlines the importance of considering long-term time scales when assessing malaria dynamics. The presented wavelet approach could be applicable to other infectious diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria is one of the most deadly infectious diseases and it continues to cause huge public health burden. Understanding its transmission dynamics is crucial for developing effective control and prevention strategies. Recently, a change of transmission dynamics has been observed, and the world incidence has reached a plateau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">WHO, 2023</xref>). This change in transmission dynamics has been attributed to many factors, including mosquitoes becoming resistant to insecticides, Plasmodium parasites that have become resistant to drugs and the potential influence of climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Field and Barros, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Tanser et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">WHO, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Malaria is a climate-driven infectious disease. Suitable weather conditions can favour its vector, the <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito. Research investigating the impact of climate on malaria incidence showed that key climatic factors are rainfall and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Mordecai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Thomson et al., 2017</xref>). The seasonal cycles of malaria incidence closely follow seasonal weather variations. Seasonality refers to the periodicity within a year, that is the patterns and fluctuations in malaria incidence or climatic factors that recur under the 1-year time scale, while multiannual cycles refer to periodicities of length greater than a year. We note that two (or more) periodicities can co-occur, for instance in the presence of a semestrial peak, but every other peak being higher in intensity (presence of a 6-month period together with a 12-month period). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Reiner et al. (2015)</xref> put forth a systematic review assessing the seasonality of different malaria metrics, and their relationships with climate data. In addition to showing that the best predictors for malaria outbreaks are usually temperature and rainfall, the authors observed that the time lag between a climatic event and an increase in malaria occurrence is highly dependent on the metric, and the area under observation. For instance, the authors found that the time lag between temperature and malaria incidence can vary from 0 to 9 months, while the time lag between rainfall and malaria incidence ranges between 0 and 6 months. Additionally, it was concluded that in most publications, the seasonality of malaria is directly linked to the seasonality of the main climatic factors (usually temperature and rainfall). This conclusion is still valid - most of the publications that considered seasonality investigated the relationship between malaria and climatic factors. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pascual et al. (2008)</xref> have observed multiannual cycles, inherent to the disease itself and which do not depend on external factors, such as climate. More recently, such cycles have been attributed to global climate drivers such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cazelles et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The aim of this paper was to strengthen the evidence-base about the periodicity of malaria incidence and its dependence/independence on climatic factors, based on a dataset of reported malaria incidence from a western lowland area in Kenya, along with its climate reports.</p>

<title>Dataset</title>
<p>Malaria cases were extracted from the population-based infectious disease surveillance (PBIDS) system, set up in 2005 by the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC). The PBIDS is conducted in 33 villages, and follows about 30,000 people residing within a 5km radius from the St. Elizabeth Lwak Mission Hospital in Asembo, Rarieda sub-county, Siaya county, Kenya. Patients with febrile illness symptoms were consented to provide finger prick blood for microscopy. Malaria was diagnosed when <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites were detected. We considered malaria cases among children under 5 years of age. Indeed, in our previous analyses using Bayesian methods we observed clearer seasonal patterns compared to older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nyawanda et al., 2023</xref>). Monthly malaria cases among these children from 2008 to 2019 were divided by the person-time (in years) of exposure to obtain the monthly time series of incidence (cases per person-year of observation). More detailed explanations of the dataset, along with a map of the study area, can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nyawanda et al. (2023)</xref>. Bed net coverage was also reported in the PBIDS. Households were routinely visited for interviews, and all household members were asked whether they slept under a bed net the preceding night. The proportion of household members who used bed nets was computed and aggregated at a monthly time scale.</p>
<p>Rainfall data were obtained via climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data (CHIRPS). Those data are precise at 5.6 × 5.6 km<sup>2</sup> spatial and 5 days temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Funk et al., 2015</xref>). Temperature data were extracted from two different sources. Air temperature was accessed through the ERA5-Land dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Muñoz Sabater, 2019</xref>), where daily air temperature is measured 2m above ground surface, at a 9 × 9 km<sup>2</sup> spatial and hourly time resolution. Land surface temperature at day (LSTD) and at night (LSTN) were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites. Spatial resolution is 1 × 1 km<sup>2</sup> and temporal resolution is 8 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Wan et al., 2015</xref>). Rainfall, air temperature, LSTD and LSTN were initially computed at their original spatial resolution and averaged per month. Then, the climate data were averaged at the village spatial resolution, and again averaged over all villages, to obtain one value for the whole study area. Missing LSTN values were estimated by averaging the value from the preceding and succeeding months. Land surface temperature (LST) was computed after aggregation as the average of LSTD and LSTN. Both air temperature and LST were selected in the analysis, because they have proven to have different effect on malaria at different time scales. The Niño 3.4 sea surface temperature (SST) index time series was used as an indicator for the El Niño Southern Oscillations (ENSO). ENSO is an important climatic phenomenon known for having an important impact worldwide, and can influence malaria outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anyamba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bouma et al., 1997</xref>). Values of the Niño 3.4 SST index are monthly averaged SSTs of the Niño 3.4 oceanic area, which is located between longitudes 120-170W and latitudes 5S-5N. The Niño 3.4 SST data were extracted from the HadISST1 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Rayner et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Analysis of periodicity</title>
<p>Seasonalities of malaria incidence and climate time series were analysed using wavelets, specifically through a continuous wavelet transform. The overall concept of wavelets is related to the search of frequencies (or inversely, periodicities/seasonalities) in a time series. They offer powerful tools for the investigation of non-stationary processes, rendering them a suitable approach for studying infectious diseases and climate data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cazelles et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>A wavelet is a function representing a small oscillation localized in time. In the process of the continuous wavelet transform, we used a wavelet of reference (a <italic>mother</italic> wavelet, in our case a Morlet wavelet) that we scaled and shifted. We applied a transform between the time series of interest and the wavelet obtained by scaling and shifting. For each of the scale coefficient <italic>s</italic> and the shift coefficient τ, the transform carried information on how strong the seasonality of period <italic>s</italic> was around time point τ in the time series. The wavelet power spectrum of the transform was the quantity carrying this information, and had been plotted as a heat map. The force of the periodicity was assessed at all scales/periods and all time points within the study duration. Statistical tests were employed to assess the true seasonal dynamics. Random lag-1 autoregressive models were simulated to generate a baseline distribution for the wavelet power spectrum. This process allowed us to test the wavelet power spectrum obtained from our data against the null hypothesis of ‘no seasonal pattern at this time point and period’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>). Taking the average wavelet power spectrum along a certain period gave the average power spectrum, an unbiased variant of the Fourier transform, which could also be tested for periodicity at different period values using simulations. A more complete description of the continuous wavelet transform can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cazelles et al. (2007)</xref>, and in the description of <italic>WaveletComp</italic>, the R-package used for computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rosch and Schmidbauer, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>In a similar way, we obtained information on the common, joint seasonal patterns of two time series: the malaria incidence and each of the climatic factors. For this, we used the cross-wavelet transform. The continuous wavelet transform was applied to both time series and the outputs were merged to compare the seasonal dynamics between the two time series. A wavelet power spectrum was produced and plotted as a heat map. A statistical test to evaluate the true joint seasonality was done similarly to the single time series case. The cross-wavelet power spectrum was averaged into an average power spectrum and tested for significance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Phase differences</title>
<p>In addition to assessing the joint seasonal dynamics, the cross-wavelet transform was applied to two time series to determine the phase differences between them. The phase differences carried information on the time between a peak in the first time series (the leading) and the closest following peak of the other time series (the lagging). The phase difference angle that is output from a cross-wavelet transform takes a value of <italic>θ</italic> ∈ [0, 2π). This angle represents the radial distance between two peaks. As an example, an angle of <italic>θ</italic> = 0 means synchronicity (time series are in-phase), and an angle of <italic>θ</italic> = π means that the time series are anti-phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<fig id="fig1" position="float" fig-type="figure">
<label>Figure 1.</label>
<caption><p>Relationship between the phase difference angles and the time series dynamics. When both time series are in phase, the phase difference angle is <italic>θ</italic> = 0 (upper left). When the red time series is ahead of the blue time series by a quarter of the period (3 units over a period of 12), the value of the phase difference angle is one quarter of the total circle, that is <italic>θ</italic> = π/2 (upper right). When both time series are anti-phase, the phase difference angle is <italic>θ</italic> = <italic>π</italic> (bottom left). When blue time series is behind by three quarter of period (here, 9 over 12 units), <italic>θ</italic> = 3π/2 (bottom right). We observe that we cannot distinguish mathematically with the situation where time series in blue is actually leading by one quarter. In our case, however, malaria incidence always follows the effect of climatic variables and the causality direction is clear. Hence, we avoid negative values when speaking about phase difference in months.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_fig1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Since the definition of phase difference strongly relies on the notion of periodicity, we could only compute reliable phase differences when both time series displayed a seasonal pattern at this period. Practically, this means that phase differences were only computed for time points and periods where joint periodicity was tested significant; they were plotted directly in the cross-wavelet power spectrum heat map within confidence areas, and took the shape of arrows displaying the angle stated above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Time scales decomposition</title>
<p>The direction of the relationship by time scale was obtained using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform. Differently from the continuous wavelet transform, the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform does not compute the periodicity of a time series at all periods. Instead, it parsimoniously decomposes the time series into different subseries, each having a specific periodicity. In other words, it extracts from an original time series its different time scales components, each subseries having its own periodicity. By applying a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform with a depth level of 3 on a single time series, we obtained four subseries: <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>, <italic>D</italic><sub>3</sub> and <italic>S</italic><sub>3</sub>. <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub> was the subseries of the lower period, while <italic>D</italic><sub>3</sub> was the subseries of the greater period. <italic>S</italic><sub>3</sub> retained the trend of the time series. Captured time scales are summarised in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>The four subseries summed up to the original time series, i.e.

<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_tbl1.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</table-wrap>
<p>A more comprehensive description of the method can be found in Appendix 1, and a detailed description of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Percival and Walden (2000)</xref>. Our study used the Coiflet wavelet filter of length 30. This wavelet filter had proven efficient over some artificially simulated data of the same nature as the data we studied.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Multiresolution analysis</title>
<p>After decomposing the time series into multiple subseries, we investigated the bivariate, linear relationships between the subseries of climatic factors and the subseries of malaria incidence. This was done by fitting a linear regression between one climatic subseries and the subseries of malaria incidence at the same time scale. The predictor, that is the climatic subseries was standardized and shifted by a certain lag. The lags were comprised between 0 and a maximal meaningful period at this time scale: 4 for the time scale <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>, 8 for the other time scales.</p>
<p>Decomposing a time series across different time scales generated highly redundant and repetitive subseries. Hence, shifting a climatic subseries by a lag of half the time scale brought the exact opposite results, with linear regression slopes having the opposite sign. To avoid this situation, we selected the lag according to the best fit (lowest Akaike information criterion [AIC]), but when we faced the situation of two different lags generating almost the same fit, we parsimoniously selected the smallest lag.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Lag variations</title>
<p>The results of the multiresolution analysis were used to turn the phase differences, defined in a previous section, into a dynamic evolution of the lags. We explicitly obtained the phase differences by selecting a slice at a given period, and we computed the phase differences at this period for all time points. Hence, we obtained phase differences function of time. The phase difference angles were converted into months using the formula
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>t</italic> is the phase difference in months, <italic>θ</italic> is the phase difference as an angle and <italic>s</italic> is the period under investigation. This phase difference in months can be turned into lags if and only if the direction of the relationship between the two variables is known at this period. A positive relationship implies that the lag is equal to the phase difference in months. A negative relationship requires to adjust the phase difference by half a period.</p>
<p>The variations of the lags were investigated using linear regressions between the lag variations and ‘crude’ climatic variables. Computing linear models between all climatic-intervention time series (including bed net coverage) and all lag variations of air temperature, LST and rainfall generated 18 linear regressions. We kept the two models with the lowest AIC.</p>

<title>Analysis of periodicity</title>
<p>Inspection of the malaria incidence time series in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> showed highly seasonal patterns, with repetitive peaks around June and January, which are the months that follow Kenya’s long and short rainy seasons respectively. The incidence declined over time from 2008 to 2015, with 2015 showing the lowest total yearly incidence. Subsequently, a shift was observed in the regime, with higher peaks in June, while peaks around January decreased in size. The wavelet power spectrum plot in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> tended to confirm this dynamic: malaria incidence showed a clear and statistically significant 6-month periodicity (semestrial seasonality) almost continuously within the whole study duration, with a gap in 2018. There was a slightly stronger 12-month periodicity (annual seasonality) appearing around 2017-2018, but this seasonality lacked significance. When averaged, the only statistically significant seasonality was the 6-month periodicity.</p>

<p>For air temperature, time series plot showed semestrial regular peaks around February and September (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). There was a tendency to switch to one single annual peak in February, from 2015 onwards. The continuous wavelet transform showed that there was no significant pattern of any kind up to 2012 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). From that year onwards, a strong and uninterrupted 12-month period pattern appeared, along with a clear and more punctual 6-month cycle around the years 2012, 2016 and 2019. Both seasonalities were significant when averaged.</p>
<p>There was a higher variation of seasonality in the case of LST (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Despite the peaks that regularly occurred in March and October, the continuous wavelet transform revealed highly noncontinuous seasonalities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). A 6-month period pattern was found in 2009, from 2011 to 2016, and in 2019. A 12-month seasonality occurred from 2009 to 2012 and from 2016 to 2019. Both seasonalities showed statistical significance when averaged.</p>
<p>Rainfall presented high peaks in precipitation in April-May, often followed by two usually lower peaks in September and November (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The wavelet power spectrum displayed significant seasonalities around the 6-month period, and additionally around the 12-month period in 2016-2018 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). The 12-month seasonality tested significant when accounting for time, but not when averaged over time. The 6-month period tested significant when averaged.</p>
<p>In contrast with the other climatic variables, Niño 3.4 SST presented higher seasonalities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). In addition to the regular annual peak around May, confirmed by the wavelet power spectrum throughout the time series but in 2015, we also observed an overall trend (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). This trend is assessed by the wavelet power spectrum as being a significant 36-month seasonality from 2008 up to the end of 2011. The wavelet power spectrum also revealed some semestrial seasonalities around 2014 and 2019. The average power spectrum showed statistically significant 6-month, 12-month and 36-month periods.</p>
<p>Inspection of the bed net coverage time series in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> was a bit different from the other time series, because there is <italic>a priori</italic> less reason to believe in the presence of any seasonal pattern than for climatic factors. A key observation was, however, the increase in bed net coverage over the study period, increasing from 76% in 2008 to almost 100% in early 2019.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the heat maps of the obtained cross-wavelet power spectra. We observed that air temperature along with malaria incidence exhibited a significant and almost uninterrupted joint 6-month seasonality (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). We also observed joint 12-month seasonalities in 2011 and from 2016 onwards. Both periods were tested significant at the 95% confidence threshold in the average power spectrum. Analysis of phase difference (arrows) revealed that a peak in temperature precedes a peak of incidence by around 3-5 months for the 6-month period. They also carried information of a 5 to 6 months delay between these two peaks at the 12-month period.</p>

<p>The LST cross-wavelet spectrum revealed the same joint dynamics with incidence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The 6-month seasonality showed statistical significance during the whole study duration but a small interruption at the beginning of 2010, while the 12-month seasonality was only significant in 2010-2011 and from 2016 onwards. Both periods were tested significant at the 95% confidence threshold in the average power spectrum. The phase differences for the 6-month period oscillated between 3.5 and 4.5 months. The phase differences for the 12-month period were about 4 months between 2010 and 2011, but around 6.5 months from 2016 onwards.</p>
<p>For rainfall, we obtained a clear and continuous joint seasonal pattern with incidence at the 6-month period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). A common 12-month seasonality was also observed between 2016 and 2018, but this period showed no statistical significance in the average power spectrum. For both time scales, arrows indicated phase differences of approximately 2.5 months.</p>
<p>Niño 3.4 SST showed less clear common seasonality with malaria incidence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). A common trend was observed at the 6-month period, with gaps in 2012 and 2016. An additional 12-month period joint pattern was observed in 2010-2013 and from 2016 onwards. These two seasonalities showed statistical significance in the average power spectrum. The phase differences were around 1 and 2 at the 6-month period, and around 1.5 at the 12-month period.</p>

<title>Lag variations</title>
<p>The phase differences obtained by the cross-wavelet transforms were turned into lags, allowing us to plot the evolution of the lags over time. Phase differences can only be obtained at periods and times where joint periodicity is assessed significant. We extracted the phase differences for the variables air temperature, LST and rainfall at the 6-month period. Rainfall being positively correlated with malaria incidence at the 6-month period, the phase differences (‘peak-to-peak’ elapsing time) were exactly the lag. For both air temperature and LST, they were negatively correlated to malaria incidence at this time scale; we added half-a-period (3 months) to the phase difference to obtain the lag. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> shows the evolution of the lag of these three variables over the course of the study period.</p>

<p>For the three climatic variables, we observed an upward trend in the lags from 2008 to 2019. Air temperature and LST lags fluctuated between 0.5 and 1.5 months, with interruptions in 2010 and 2018, when the joint periodicity was not significant.

<p>The first of these two models was the linear regression of the LST lag variation against the values of the Niño 3.4 SST time series.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature are recognized as driving the seasonality of malaria transmission. However, cycles lasting longer than 1 year might be due to either the internal dynamics of malaria or alternative climatic factors; the effect of climatic factors might be altered across time scales. The overall malaria dynamics and the elapsing lag time between the occurrence of a climatic event and its related effect on malaria incidence might change over time. In this study, we developed wavelet-based analyses to assess the seasonal patterns of malaria incidence and its related climatic effects in the lowlands of Siaya county in the western part of Kenya during 2008–2019, using the PBIDS dataset. We decomposed the relationship (force and direction) between the climatic factors and the malaria incidence. We investigated the evolution of the time lag between the climatic factors and the malaria incidence over the course of the study. These analyses enabled us to measure the variations of periodicity over time and the evolution of the climate-malaria incidence lags along to quantify the changes in climate-related effects on malaria across time scales.</p>
<p>In the analysis of periodicity section, we employed the continuous wavelet transform and the cross-wavelet transform to perform these analyses. A key finding of our study is that the malaria incidence in Siaya County exhibited a dominant 6-month seasonal cycle between 2008 and 2019. Towards the end of the study period in 2019, a 12-month seasonality was apparent, although it did not reach statistical significance. This closely aligns with the cycles of rainfall. Our findings are consistent with previous studies highlighting the rain-driven nature of malaria transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Boadu, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Reiner et al., 2015</xref>). The effect of rainfall on malaria is complex, as rains support the emergence of small water bodies favourable to the aquatic stages of the mosquito’s life cycle. On the other hand, heavy rains are known to flush away mosquito larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lafferty, 2009</xref>). Both air temperature and LST exhibited a 12-month (annual) seasonality. This result is not striking as the temperature is very likely to fluctuate annually. However, this pattern was not strongly reflected in malaria incidence, and rainfall seems to be a better predictor of malaria than temperature. The periodicity of Niño 3.4 SST showed considerable variation over time, including high-scale patterns, such as 36-month cycles. Hence, El Niño offers an explanation for the multiyear cycles of malaria reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pascual et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The exploration of the bivariate relationships between climate and malaria incidence across time scales has required a multi-resolution analysis, using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform. We observed discrepancies in the strength of relationships across time scales, as evidenced by the differences in slope coefficients. As predictor, climatic subseries were standardized before the regression, it supports that malaria incidence exhibits a stronger seasonality or trend at specific time scales. Additionally, it also highlights that the relationship between climate and malaria is itself weaker at certain time scales. Notably, the time scale with the strongest relationship for all variables was found to be <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub> (5-to 8-month periods), followed by <italic>D</italic><sub>3</sub> (9-to 16-month periods), aligning with the results obtained from continuous and cross-wavelet transforms. It is interesting to note that the trend (<italic>S</italic><sub>3</sub>, 16-month periods and longer) coefficient are greater than the finest time scale (<italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>, 1-to 4-month periods). This suggests that minor climate variations have a limited impact on malaria incidence at shorter time scales, whereas climatic trends may play a more substantial role in shaping long-term malaria dynamics.</p>
<p>The relationship between temperature and malaria incidence consistently displayed a negative correlation across all time scales. Both air temperature and LST exhibited similar time lags, ranging from 0 to 2 months. This direction of the relationship aligns with expectations: in lowlands, higher temperatures are associated with lower malaria transmission due to the climate being too warm for mosquitoes to optimally reproduce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beloconi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nyawanda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). It is interesting to note that at shorter time scales (<italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>, 5-to 8-month periods), LST had a greater impact than air temperature, while the opposite was observed at the highest time scale (<italic>S</italic><sub>3</sub>, 16-month periods and longer). However, we did not find any clear explanation for this change in dynamics across these two time scales.</p>
<p>Rainfall showed a positive relationship with a lag of 2 months, except at both the lowest and the highest time scales, where rainfall became statistically non-significant at any lag. The lag of 2 months and the positive relationship are in line with previous analyses conducted on this dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beloconi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nyawanda et al., 2023</xref>) and are supported by general knowledge of the effect of rainfall on malaria transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Reiner et al., 2015</xref>). The absence of relationship at the small time scales might indicate that small and disparate rains are not sufficient to impact the development of mosquitoes - or, at the opposite, that an intense and sudden rainfall can flush away the larvae. The absence of relationship at higher time scales is most likely due to the absence of a clear trend of rainfall over the years, while malaria incidence time series shows a clear decreasing trend. Interestingly, despite the significant contribution of rainfall to malaria incidence, it is not the factor that drives the changes in malaria dynamics at high time scales, with the latter being more likely to be driven by changes in the trend of temperature. In other words, while a lower share of malaria cases can be attributed to temperature rather than rainfall, it might be the upward trend of temperature that affects the change in malaria dynamic at the high time scales.</p>
<p>The relationship between Niño 3.4 SST and malaria incidence is significant across all time scales. El Niño or la Niña events are defined when the Niño 3.4 SST exceeds ± 0.4°C for a period of 6 months or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Trenberth, 1997</xref>). During El Niño events, heavy rains are typically observed in Kenya in November and December (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ototo et al., 2011</xref>). While El Niño is known to have an impact at inter-annual scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bouma et al., 1997</xref>), the prediction ability at shorter time scales may be attributed more to coincidence with other climatic variables than to a clear and real impact of SST on malaria incidence in Siaya.</p>
<p>The decomposition of the time series into subseries and the ensuing linear regression were meant to give the direction of the relationship between climatic factors and malaria incidence at different time scales. This has been used to adjust the phase differences, turn them into lags, and study their evolution over time. The analysis of the lag evolution was performed for the air temperature, LST, and rainfall; the only selected period was the 6-month cycle, as the other periods did not exhibit sufficiently significant joint seasonalities between climatic factors and malaria incidence, and joint seasonal patterns are necessary to compute the phase differences. The most striking finding of this analysis is the substantial increase in the time lag between these climatic variables and malaria incidence. The elapsing time between the occurrence of a peak of intensity in one climatic variable and its resulting peak on malaria incidence has more than doubled in certain cases. This highlights a real change in dynamics between climate and malaria and, to our knowledge, has not been reported before. We found a weak relationship between this increase of time lag and the values of the Niño 3.4 SST, as well as with the bed net coverage. However, there is no evidence of causality. Hence, further research is needed before drawing more definitive conclusions.</p>
<p>It is important to recognize a few limitations inherent in our analysis. First, regarding the multiresolution analysis, although it addresses the non-stationary dynamic of the data, our approach was restricted to linear and bivariate analyses. This is a significant limitation given that the effects of variables such as temperature and rainfall on malaria transmission are known to be nonlinear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Mordecai et al., 2019</xref>). Secondly, both temperature and rainfall are strong predictors of malaria transmission risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kapwata et al., 2021</xref>). However, performing a robust multivariate analysis using this methodology is challenging due to the particularly strong periodicity of the subseries.</p>
<p>The outcomes of our analysis offer several implications for public health practice. It is crucial to consider long-term timescales when planning malaria control strategies, as the transmission dynamics of malaria are continually evolving. Public health initiatives should therefore plan for anticipated changes over time. Monitoring climate variability remains a highly effective approach for anticipating malaria outbreaks and developing early-warning systems, which enable more proactive and timely response with malaria prevention and control efforts.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings indicate that seasonality in malaria incidence is strongly influenced by seasonality in rainfall, while changes in dynamic patterns are more likely driven by other climatic factors that exhibit clearer trends, such as temperature and Niño 3.4 SST. Moreover, our study revealed an increase in the lag duration of some climatic variables, which was associated with bed net coverage and Niño 3.4 SST, although no evidence of causality was found. The relevance of our findings extends to the development of early warning systems and climate change adaptation strategies. Our study underlines the importance of considering long-term time scales when assessing malaria dynamics and highlights the complex interplay between climate and malaria. By improving our understanding of these relationships, we can enhance preparedness and implement targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of malaria on vulnerable populations.</p>

<sec>
<title>Wavelet overview</title>
<p>Wavelets are commonly used for two main purposes. Continuous wavelet transforms allow us to explore the seasonality present in a time series, through descriptive graphs and statistical tests. On the other hand, discrete wavelet transforms algorithmically decompose the time series into subseries of different time scales.</p>
<p>The overall concept of wavelets is related to Fourier analysis and the search for frequencies of a time series (or, inversely, periodicities and seasonalities). However, by its inherent definition, Fourier analysis requires the strong assumption that the time series must be stationary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Daubechies, 1990</xref>). In the present study, both the epidemiological data and the climatic data violate this assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Pascual et al., 2008</xref>), and an alternative approach is therefore needed. Wavelet analysis is a good candidate for this exact reason; unlike the Fourier transform, the wavelet transform does not make use of sine waves to assess the periodicity, but of a ‘wavelet’ instead. As its name suggests, a wavelet is a small, localized in time oscillation. As a result, wavelet analysis is not altered by a change in the seasonal patterns over time, and non-stationary time series can be handled.</p>
<p>By applying a wavelet transform at time-point τ and scale <italic>s</italic> - this latter being related to the notion of Fourier period - to a time series, one could extract information on how strong the seasonal pattern of scale <italic>s</italic> was, around time τ. By proceeding similarly at all time points and scales, we collected valuable information on the seasonal behavior throughout the duration of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Continuous wavelet transform</title>
<p>Formally speaking, a wavelet is defined as a function ψ : ℝ → ℂ having at least zero mean and unit energy. Some additional requirements might however be needed for practical purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Percival and Walden, 2000</xref>). Many wavelets have been developed so far: Daubechies family’s wavelet, Paul’s, Meyer’s, Mexican hat being only a few of them. In our case, we made use of the Morlet wavelet to compute the continuous wavelet transform. The Morlet wavelet has indeed a good trade-off between time and scale resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Coulibaly and Burn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Grinsted et al., 2004</xref>). It is complex, and is therefore also suited to the bivariate case, comparing the coherence between two time series (see further)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rosch and Schmidbauer, 2018</xref>). The Morlet Wavelet is defined as follow:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
the coefficient ω<sub>0</sub> was here set to 6 for practical reasons, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Farge (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rosch and Schmidbauer (2018)</xref>.</p>
<p>This equation actually describes the ‘mother’ wavelet; the wavelet of reference. For computing the wavelet transform, we used various stretched and translated versions of the mother wavelet. We obtained the continuous wavelet transform at some time point τ and scale <italic>s</italic> by convolution between the time series and the appropriate wavelet at this time and scale. In other words:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>W<sub>x</sub></italic>(τ, <italic>s</italic>) ∈ ℂ is the continuous wavelet transform of the time series <italic>x</italic> at time τ and scale <italic>s</italic>, and the star <sup>⋆</sup> defines the complex conjugate.</p>
<p>Based on this quantity, we obtained the wavelet power spectrum at time τ and scale <italic>s</italic>. The formula below was originally from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>) but has been updated by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Liu et al., 2007</xref>) in order to adjust for scale bias.
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>S<sub>x</sub></italic>(τ, <italic>s</italic>) ∈ ℝ represents the wavelet power spectrum and the vertical bars indicates the modulus of a complex number.</p>
<p>The wavelet power spectrum was then plotted using a heat map, sometimes also called a Hovmöller diagram, displaying the power spectrum function of time and scale. The warmer the color, the higher the wavelet power spectrum and so the seasonal pattern. In addition, statistical tests were used to assess the true seasonal behavior. Random lag-1 autoregressive models were simulated to generate a baseline distribution for the wavelet power spectrum. This process allowed us to test the wavelet obtained from our data against the null hypothesis of ‘no seasonal pattern at this time and scale’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Taking the average wavelet power spectrum along a certain period gave the average power spectrum, an unbiased variant of the Fourier transform, which was also tested for seasonality at different period values.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Cross-wavelet transform</title>
<p>Based on a similar idea, continuous wavelet transform can be used to plot and test the common patterns in seasonalities between two time series. The so-called cross-wavelet transform is defined by the multiplication of the continuous wavelet transform of both time series as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Torrence and Compo (1998)</xref>, but the formula used here is adjusted with a factor 1/<italic>s</italic> following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Veleda et al. (2012)</xref>.
<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn5.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
with <italic>W<sub>x</sub></italic>(τ, <italic>s</italic>), <italic>W<sub>y</sub></italic>(τ, <italic>s</italic>) the continuous wavelet transform of time series <italic>x, y</italic> as previously defined.</p>
<p>Taking the modulus of this quantity and we obtained the cross-wavelet power spectrum, which could be plotted on a heat map similarly to the wavelet power spectrum:
<disp-formula id="eqn6">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn6.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>We could statistically assess seasonalities by testing the assumption of no periodicity using two artificially simulated autoregressive lag-1 time series as baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Torrence and Compo, 1998</xref>). Finally, averaging the cross-wavelet power spectrum returned the average power spectrum, which could also be tested for significance similarly to the average power spectrum.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Phase differences</title>
<p>Importantly, the cross-wavelet transform can also assess the phase differences between two time series. The phase difference carries a notion similar to the lag, but not exactly; The underlying information is the time between a peak in the first time series (the leading) and the closest following peak of the other time series (the lagging).</p>
<p>The phase difference angle takes a value <italic>θ</italic> ∈ [0, 2π). This angle represents the proportion of the period between two peaks. As an example, an angle of <italic>θ</italic> = 0 means synchronicity (time series are so-called in-phase), and an angle of <italic>θ</italic> = <italic>π</italic> means the time series are antiphases (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the definition of phase difference strongly relies on the notion of periodicity, we could only compute reliable phase differences when both time series displayed a periodic/seasonal pattern at this period. Practically, this means that phase differences were only computed for time points and periods where joint seasonality was assessed significant; it was plotted over the cross-wavelet power spectrum heat maps within confidence areas, and took the shape of arrows displaying the angle stated above.</p>
<p>Phase differences could be computed directly from the cross-wavelet transform, as the phase differences have proven to be the argument of the complex number resulting in the computation of the cross-wavelet transform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Rosch and Schmidbauer, 2018</xref>):
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn7.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>This angle lied within the interval (−π; +π]. It could be converted into a nonnegative angle using the formula:
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
in order to have <italic>θ</italic> ∈ [0; 2π). The function f rac(·) returns the fractional part of the input number.</p>
<p>Arrows plotted in the cross-wavelet plots are displaying the phase difference angles across time and scales. For explicitation, we could use package <italic>WaveletComp</italic> to select a slice of a given period, and plot the phase difference in term of the angle <italic>θ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) evolving over time. This angle could be converted into month using the formula
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn8.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
with <italic>θ</italic> the phase difference angle, and <italic>s</italic> the period under investigation. This phase difference could also be turned into a lag, requiring the knowledge of the direction of the relationship between the two variables at this period. A positive relationship would imply that the lag is equal to the phase difference in months. A negative relationship would require to adjust the phase difference by half a period.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform</title>
<p>We already had some methods to analyze the time series, for both climate and malaria incidence. However, we did not have a way to state the direction of the relationship between climatic factors and incidence, at a specific period (required to compute the phase differences).</p>
<p>To assess this, we did ‘split’ the time series into different subseries, each having a precise periodicity. Doing so allowed us to use bivariate linear regression over those subseries, to identify more specifically the lag between different time series and get an idea of the relationship between those two.</p>
<p>The following step was then period-dependent subseries decomposition, which could be done using a discrete wavelet transform. As its name may suggest, the discrete wavelet transform is the discretized counterpart of the continuous wavelet transform, even though its application is slightly different. While the continuous wavelet transform carries a lot of information on the seasonality of the time series at any time and scale, the underlying idea of a discrete wavelet transform is to store this information more parsimoniously.</p>
<p>To be more precise, in this situation we made use of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform, also sometimes called the decimated wavelet transform, an extension of the classic discrete wavelet transform. Maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform is more redundant, takes slightly more time to compute than discrete wavelet transform, but carries an important feature: a circular shift of the time series induces a circular shift of the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform, while this statement is not correct for discrete wavelet transform.</p>
<p>A better way to approach the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform is to see it as a filter. At the lowest scale, we applied this wavelet filter to retain the finest variations in the time series. This subseries, containing only the lower seasonalities, was called <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>D</italic> as ‘detail’. We stored it apart and continued with the coarsest scales of the time series, which leaked up through the filter at first stage. We upscaled the wavelet filter so that it retains longer seasonalities in the data. Once again, the filter retained a subseries presenting higher seasonalities, that was called <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>. And we repeated the process again and again until a certain layer <italic>J</italic>. The subseries <italic>D</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>, …, <italic>D<sub>J</sub></italic> were all carrying a particular seasonality. The higher seasonality that could not been caught at this point were carried in a ‘remainder’ subseries called <italic>S<sub>J</sub></italic>, <italic>S</italic> for ‘smooth’. An interesting property of the discrete wavelet transform is that we can reconstruct the original time series <italic>x</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) out of those subseries as follow:
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="24316488v1_eqn9.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The precise methodology behind this process is quite thorough and falls beyond the scope of this article. A detailed description can however be found in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Percival and Walden, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study made use of the Coiflet wavelet filter of length 30. This wavelet filter had indeed proven efficient over some artificially simulated data of the same nature as the studied data.</p>
<p>After decomposing the time series into multiple subseries, one could investigate the linear relationship between the subseries of climatic and intervention factors and the subseries of malaria incidence. This was done by using a linear regression between the two time series, with a chosen lag comprised between 0 and the maximal meaningful period at this time scale.</p>

<p>The manuscript presents a <bold>useful</bold> analysis of the relationship between climate variables and malaria incidence, for local temperature and rainfall and the global climate driver of ENSO from 2008 to 2019 in a lowland region of East Africa, with wavelet analyses and linear regressions after time series decomposition.

It is less persuasive on what is learned about the role of climate variability (non-seasonal climate effects), and it is also unclear how the analysis informs climate change and malaria, and this motivation for the work is not warranted as it pertains to longer time scales than those considered. The work should be better placed in the context of what is known for malaria in East Africa and in different transmission settings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the relationship between climate variables and malaria incidence from monthly records, for rainfall, temperature, and a measure of ENSO, in a lowland region of Kenya in East Africa. Wavelet analyses show significant variability at the seasonal scale at the 6-month scale with some variation in its signal over time, and some additional variability at the 12-month scale for some variables. As conducted, the analyses show weak (non-significant) signals at the interannual time scales (longer than seasonal). Cross-wavelet analysis also highlights the 6-month scale and the association of malaria and climate variables at that scale, with some signal at 12 months, reflecting the role of climate in seasonality. Evidence is presented for some small changes in the lags of the response of malaria to the seasonal climate drivers over time.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although there have been many studies of climate drivers of malaria dynamics in East Africa, these analyses have been largely focused on highlands where these drivers are expected to exhibit the strongest signal of association with disease burden at interannual and longer time scales. It is therefore of interest to take advantage of a relatively long time series of cases to examine the role of climate variables in more endemic malaria in lowlands.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Major comments:</p>
<p>The work is not sufficiently placed in the context of what is known about climate variability in East Africa, and the role of climate variables in the temporal variation of malaria cases in this region. This context includes the relationship between large (global/regional) drivers of interannual climate variability such as ENSO (and the Indian Ocean Dipole) and local temporal patterns in rainfall and temperature. There is for example literature on the influence of those drivers and the short and long rains in East Africa. That is, phenomena such as ENSO would influence malaria through those local climate variables. This context should be considered when formulating and interpreting the analyses.</p>
<p>There are conceptual problems with the design of the analyses which can limit the findings on association. It is not surprising that rainfall would exhibit a clear association at seasonal scales. It is nevertheless valuable to confirm this as the authors have done and to examine the faster than 12-month scale, given the typical pattern of two rainfall seasons in this area. However, the results on temperature are less clear. If rainfall is the main limiting factor for the transmission season, the temperature variation that would matter can be during the rainy periods. One would then see an association with temperature only in particular windows of time during the year, when rainfall is sufficient (see for example, Rodo et al. Nat. Commun. 2022, for this finding in a highland region of Ethiopia). For this situation, there would be no clear association with temperature when all months are considered, and one would not find a significant relationship (or a lagged one) between peak times in this climate factor and malaria's seasonal cases. It would be difficult for the wavelet analysis to reveal such an effect. Another consideration is whether to use an ENSO variable that includes seasonality or to use an ENSO index computed as an anomaly, to focus on interannual variability. That is, it is most relevant to consider how ENSO influences time scales of variation longer than seasonal (the multiannual variation in seasonal epidemics) and for this purpose, one would typically rely on an anomaly. This choice would better enable one to see whether there is a role of ENSO at interannual time scales. It would also make sense to analyze with cross-wavelets the effect of ENSO on local climate factors, temperature, and rainfall, and not only on malaria. This would allow us to establish evidence for a chain of causality, from a global driver of interannual variability to local climate variability to malaria incidence.</p>
<p>The multiresolution analysis and associated analysis of lag variations were confusing and difficult to follow as presented: (1) the lags chosen by the multiresolution analysis do not match the phase differences of the cross-wavelet analysis if I followed what was presented. On page 8, phase differences are expressed in months. I do not understand then the following statements on page 9: &quot;The phase differences obtained by the cross-wavelet transforms were turned into lags, allowing us to plot the evolution of the lags over time&quot;. The resulting lags in Figure 6 are shorter than the phase differences provided in the text on page 8. (2) The phase difference of the cross-wavelet analyses for malaria and temperature is also too long for this climate factor to explain an effect on the vector and then on the disease. (3) In Table 3, the regression results that are highlighted are those for Land Surface Temperatures (LST) and ENSO, with a weak but significant negative linear correlation, and for LST and bednet coverage, and this is considered part of the lag analysis. The previous text and analyses up to that point do not seem to consider the relationship of ENSO and local climate variables, or that between local climate variables and bednets (which would benefit from some context for the causal pathways this would reflect).</p>
<p>The conclusion in the Abstract: &quot;Our study underlines the importance of considering long-term time scales when assessing malaria dynamics. The presented wavelet approach could be applicable to other infectious diseases&quot; needs to be reformulated. The use of &quot;long-term&quot; time scales for those of ENSO and interannual variability is not consistent with the climate literature, where long-term could be interpreted as decadal and longer. The time scales beyond those of seasonality, especially those of climate variability, have been addressed in many malaria studies. It is not compelling to have the significance of this study be the importance of considering those time scales. This is not new. I recommend focusing on what has been done for lowland malaria and endemic regions (for example, in Laneri et al. PNAS 2015) as there has been less work for those regions than for seasonal epidemic ones of low transmission (e.g. altitude fringes and desert ones, e.g. Laneri et al. PloS Comp. Biol. 2010; Roy et al. Mal. J. 2015). Also, wavelet analyses have been used extensively by now to consider the association of climate variables and infectious diseases at multiple time scales. There is here an additional component of the analysis but the decomposition that underlies the linear regressions is also not that new, as decompositions of time series have been used before in this area. In summary, I recommend a more appropriate and compelling conclusion on what was learned about malaria at this location and what it may tell us about other, similar, locations, but not malaria dynamics everywhere.</p>
<p>The conversion from monthly cases to monthly incidence needs a better explanation of the Methods, rather than a referral to another paper. This is a key aspect of the data. It may be useful to plot the monthly time series of both variables in the Supplement, for comparison.</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence of the seasonal role of rainfall on malaria's seasonality in many regions. The literature cited here to support this well-known association is quite limited. It would be useful to provide a context that better reflects the literature and some context for the environmental conditions of this lowland region that would explain the dominant role of rainfall on malaria seasonality. Two papers (from 2017 and 2019) are cited in the second paragraph of the introduction as showing that &quot;key climatic factors are rainfall and temperatures&quot;. This is a misrepresentation of the field. That these factors matter to malaria in general has been known for a very long time given that the vectors are mosquitoes, and the cited studies are particular ones that examine the mechanistic basis of this link for modeling purposes. Either these papers are presented as examples, with a more accurate description of what they add to the earlier literature or earlier literature should be acknowledged. Also, what has been much less studied is the role of these variables at interannual time scales, as potentially mediating the effects of global drivers in teleconnections.</p>
<p>(2) Minor comments:</p>
<p>In relation to the conceptual issues raised above, it would be valuable to consider whether the negative association with temperature persists if one considers mean temperature during the rainy seasons only, against the total cases in the transmission season each year (as in Rodó et al. 2021). This would allow one to disentangle whether the negative association reflects a robust result or an artifact of an interaction between temperature and rainfall so that the former matters when the latter is permissive for transmission.</p>
<p>The conclusion in the Discussion &quot; This suggests that minor climate variations have a limited impact on malaria incidence at shorter time scales, whereas climatic trends may play a more substantial role in shaping long-term malaria dynamics&quot; is unsubstantiated. There is no clear result in the paper on climatic trends that I can see.</p>
<p>The Abstract writes: &quot;The true impact of climate change...&quot;. This paper is not about climate change but about climate seasonality and variability. This text needs to be changed to make it consistent with the content of the paper.</p>
<p>Page 2, Introduction: The statement on Pascual et al. 2008 is not completely accurate. This paper shows an interplay of climate variability and disease dynamics, but not cycles that are completely independent of climate.</p>
<p>Page 2, next sentence: &quot;More recently, such cycles have been attributed to global climate drivers such as ENSO (Cazelles et al., 2023)&quot;. This writing is also somewhat unclear. Are you referring to the cycles for the same location in Kenya? Or generically, to the interannual variability of malaria?</p>
<p>There are multiple places in the writing that could be edited.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The analyses of long-time malaria series to investigate the complex relationship between malaria incidence and climate is hampered by the non-stationarity introduced by both changing control interventions and irregular climate events such as the el nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By applying wavelets the authors were able to investigate the effect of the major climate factors such as rainfall, air and land temperature, and sea surface temperature (as a measure for ENSO) while at the same time taking into account changing bednet coverage. The wavelet approach is both flexible and powerful and was able to demonstrate well that shorter term. seasonal fluctuation in malaria incidence in Western Kenya is driven by rainfall patterns, while providing some evidence for temperature and SST may predict fluctuations at longer timescales.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While flexible and able to deal with non-stationarity, the wavelet approach does not really allow investigation of multiple factors at the same time but is limited to uni- and bivariate analyses. This limits the interpretability of the effect of complex climate patterns while also 'adjusting' for the changing control environment. There is also some concern that the choice of the wavelet and transforms used for different analyses (Morelet, Coiflet, maximal overlap discreet transform) may affect the results. The reasons for choosing these particular wavelets and transforms are not always evident.</p>
<p>The attempt to investigate the effect of longer terms / irregular period climate events is laudable. However, why were the analyses restricted to only ENSO (measured as SST)? Other climate factors such as e.g. the Indian Ocean Dipole (i.e. the difference in SST between the western and eastern Indian Ocean) are also known to affect climate and rainfall patterns in Eastern Africa.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this work is a compelling demonstration of the utility of wavelets for the analyses of (non-stationary) epidemiological time series data.</p>
