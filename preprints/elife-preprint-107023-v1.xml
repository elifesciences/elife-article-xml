<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) progression involves the replacement of protective embryo-derived Kupffer cells (KCs) by inflammatory monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs), yet the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3l1/YKL-40) as a critical metabolic regulator of hepatic macrophage fate. We observed high expression of Chi3l1 in both KCs and MoMFs during MASLD development. Genetic deletion of Chi3l1 specifically in KCs significantly exacerbated MASLD severity and metabolic dysfunction, whereas MoMF-specific Chi3l1 deletion showed minimal metabolic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that this cell type-specific regulation arises from differential metabolic requirements: KCs display elevated glucose metabolism compared to MoMFs. Chi3l1 directly interacts with glucose to inhibit its cellular uptake, thereby selectively protecting glucose-dependent KCs from metabolic stress-induced cell death while having negligible effects on less glucose-dependent MoMFs. These findings uncover a novel Chi3l1-mediated metabolic checkpoint that preferentially maintains KCs populations through glucose metabolism modulation, providing important new insights into the pathogenesis of MASLD and potential therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage-specific metabolic pathways.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the most prevalent chronic liver disorder in western populations, affecting approximately 30% of adults and driven by its strong association with obesity and metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The disease spectrum ranges from matabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver (MAFL) to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), with the latter characterized by steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and progressive fibrosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Central to MASLD pathogenesis are hepatic macrophages, particularly the embryo-derived Kupffer cells (KCs) that reside in liver sinusoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These self-renewing resident macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, play crucial roles in lipid homeostasis, as evidenced by studies showing that depletion of CD207<sup>+</sup> KCs leads to impaired triglyceride storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. When KCs die during MASH progression, they are gradually replaced by monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMFs) that exhibit more inflammatory properties and contribute to liver injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.This transition from protective embryo-derived KCs (EmKCs) to inflammatory monocyte-derived KCs (MoKCs) represents a critical juncture in disease progression, yet the mechanisms regulating this shift remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>A key determinant of macrophage function is cellular metabolism. Macrophages dynamically switch between glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation pathways to adapt to environmental changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. During MASLD, hepatic macrophages increase their glycolytic activity, which may exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. While glucose metabolism is known to influence macrophage polarization, its specific role in determining hepatic macrophage fate - particularly the balance between KCs and MoMFs - remains unknown. Chitinase 3-like 1 (Chi3l1/YKL-40) has emerged as an important regulator of macrophage biology, promoting cell survival through ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways while modulating anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, its potential role in macrophage metabolic reprogramming, particularly in the context of hepatic glucose metabolism, has not been explored.</p>
<p>In this study, we identify a novel mechanism by which Chi3l1 governs hepatic macrophage fate through metabolic regulation. We demonstrate that Chi3l1 directly interacts with glucose to suppress its uptake in macrophages. Strikingly, this interaction selectively protects glucose-high KCs from cell death in MASLD conditions, while having minimal effect on glucose-low MoMFs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized Chi3l1-mediated metabolic checkpoint that maintains KC populations, providing new insights into the pathogenesis of MASLD and potential therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Hepatic macrophages express Chi3l1</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamic changes in hepatic macrophages, we performed BD Rhapsody scRNA-seq on non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) isolated from healthy livers of mice fed a normal chow diet (NCD) and from livers of mice with MASLD induced by a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet. After quality control and filtration, we retained 23,312 cells from NCD livers and 6,567 cells from HFHC livers for downstream analysis. Using a graph-based clustering approach, we identified 32 distinct cell populations, visualized via uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Monocyte/macrophage subsets were further defined based on lineage-specific markers: Monocytes expressed <italic>Ly6c2, Chil3, S100a6, Ccr2, Itgam</italic>, and <italic>Cx3cr1</italic> but lacked macrophage markers. KCs were marked by <italic>Cd68, Vsig4, Clec4f, Timd4, Adgre1</italic>, and <italic>Clec1b</italic>. MoMFs were negative for KCs markers but positive for macrophage markers such as <italic>Ccr2, Cx3cr1, Cd9, Itgax, Gpnmb, Cd68</italic>, and <italic>Adgre1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B, C</xref>; UMAP in Fig S1A)<sup><italic>17</italic>,<italic>18</italic></sup>. ScRNA-seq analysis revealed high expression of <italic>Chil1</italic> (<italic>Chil1</italic> being the gene name for Chi3l1) in hepatic macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). To validate this, we performed immunofluorescence staining for Chi3l1 in hepatic macrophages using antibodies against Timd4, F4/80, and Chi3l1. Our results confirmed Chi3l1 expression in hepatic macrophages under both NCD and HFHC conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistently, patients with MAFL or MASH exhibited elevated hepatic <italic>Chil1</italic> mRNA levels, which correlated with MASLD severity and fibrosis stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>). These findings suggest that Chi3l1 is expressed in hepatic macrophages and may play a role in MASLD progression.</p>

<title>Deficiency of Chi3l1 in Kupffer cells promotes insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation</title>
<p>Given that hepatic macrophages are the primary source of Chi3l1 in the liver, we investigated its functional role by generating mice with conditional knockout (cKO) of <italic>Chil1</italic> in either KCs or MoMFs.

Impaired glucose metabolism, with worsened glucose tolerance (IGTT) and insulin resistance (ITT) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, B</xref>).

After 20 weeks on an HFHC diet: Hepatic lipid accumulation (H&amp;E, Oil Red O) was comparable to controls (Figure S4A, B).

<title>ScRNA-seq reveals upregulated glucose metabolism-related transcripts in KCs, correlating with cell death signatures</title>
<p>To dissect the distinct metabolic and functional profiles between KCs and MoMFs during MASLD progression, we analyzed our scRNA-seq data. Consistent with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, we observed decreased KCs numbers but increased MoMFs and monocytes in HFHC-fed mice compared to NCD controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that while both cell types exhibited activation of phagocytosis-related pathways (lysosome, phagosome, endocytosis, and efferocytosis), they displayed divergent cell fate patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). KCs showed strong cell death signatures, whereas MoMFs maintained proliferative activity without evidence of cell death (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Monocytes showed strong cell death and proliferative activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Given the significant role of metabolic regulation in cell fate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> we compared pathways involved in glucose metabolism, cell death, and cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, glucose metabolism pathways were significantly more active in KCs and monocytes compared to MoMFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, the cell proliferation pathway was highly activated in monocytes and consistently activated in MoMFs but not in KCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA)-based correlation analysis revealed a striking association between glucose metabolism and cell death pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These findings demonstrate distinct glucose metabolic activation patterns between KCs and MoMFs, which may underlie their divergent cell fates in MASLD progression.</p>

<title>Chi3l1 deficiency promote KCs death during MASLD</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Chi3l1 in KCs survival during MASLD, we generated <italic>Chil1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice, as Chi3l1 is a secreted protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.

After quality control, 6,813 high-quality cells were retained for analysis.

<p>Flow cytometry analysis validated these findings, using the gating strategy shown in Figure S6A. While WT and <italic>Chil1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice showed similar KC numbers at baseline, dramatic differences emerged during HFHC feeding. WT KC numbers remained stable at 8 weeks but decreased by 50% at 16 weeks. In contrast, <italic>Chil1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice exhibited accelerated KCs loss, with a 30% reduction by 8 weeks progressing to 60% by 16 weeks (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C, B</xref>).

<p>Histological analysis through Clec4f/TUNEL co-staining provided further confirmation.

<title>Molecular interaction between Chi3l1 and glucose</title>
<p>Our investigation into Chi3l1-mediated KCs survival revealed an unexpected structural relationship: Chi3l1 binds to glucose, which is structurally analogous to chitin, a polysaccharide well known to bind Chi3l1(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Bioinformatics analysis using the STITCH database further supported this observation, predicting a high probability of direct Chi3l1-glucose interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). To experimentally validate this interaction, we performed pull-down assays using biotin-labeled glucose incubated with plasma from HFHC-fed mice. Streptavidin bead isolation followed by anti-Chi3l1 Western blotting demonstrated specific binding between Chi3l1 and biotin-glucose, but not biotin alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, B</xref>). This interaction was competitively inhibited by unlabeled glucose, confirming specificity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Quantitative analysis using microscale thermophoresis with recombinant mouse Chi3l1 (rChi3l1) yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 4.95 mM for the Chi3l1-glucose interaction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, circulating Chi3l1 levels were significantly elevated in serum from HFHC-fed mice compared to baseline (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting a potential physiological role for this interaction in metabolic regulation. These findings establish Chi3l1 as a novel glucose-binding protein that may participate in glucose homeostasis during MASLD progression.</p>

<title>Chi3l1 limits glucose uptake and protects hepatic macrophages from cell death</title>
<p>To elucidate the functional consequences of Chi3l1-glucose binding, we examined glucose metabolism in hepatic macrophages. Using the fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, we performed uptake assays in KCs following 12-hour glucose starvation. While glycogen droplet size remained unchanged in untreated KCs regardless of rChi3l1 supplementation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), 2-NBDG exposure significantly increased glycogen accumulation. This effect was markedly suppressed by rChi3l1 co-treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), a phenotype replicated in BMDM (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). These results demonstrate that Chi3l1 restricts glucose uptake and subsequent glycogen storage.</p>

<p>Further validation using Stbd1 (a glycogen-binding protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>) immunofluorescence revealed minimal glycogen foci in glucose-deprived BMDM, with no rChi3l1-dependent differences. High-glucose conditions, however, triggered robust glycogen aggregation, which was significantly attenuated by rChi3l1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Concordantly, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) measurements showed reduced basal and total glycolytic capacity in rChi3l1-treated BMDMs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D,E</xref>), confirming Chi3l1âs role in limiting glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>To test whether Chi3l1-glucose binding influence cell survival, we employed a palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxicity cell-based model to better mimic the <italic>in vivo</italic> environment. rChi3l1 supplementation reduced PA-induced cleavage of caspase-3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>) and decreased KCs death (calcein/PI staining, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings establish Chi3l1 as a critical metabolic regulator that controls hepatic macrophage fate through a novel glucose-dependent mechanism in MASLD. Using cell-specific knockout models, we uncovered a fundamental dichotomy in Chi3l1 function: selective ablation in KCs dramatically accelerated MASLD progression and metabolic dysfunction, whereas deletion in MoMFs produced minimal metabolic effects. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed the molecular basis for this cell-type specificity - KCs exhibit a glucose-hungry metabolic phenotype that renders them uniquely dependent on Chi3l1-mediated regulation, while MoMFs maintain a relatively glucose-independent metabolic program. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrate that Chi3l1 functions as a physiological glucose sensor, directly binding extracellular glucose to limit its cellular uptake. This interaction establishes a crucial metabolic safeguard that specifically protects glucose-dependent KCs from lethal metabolic stress while sparing glucose-independent MoMFs. Through this precise modulation of glucose availability, Chi3l1 maintains metabolic homeostasis and preserves KCs populations during chronic dietary challenge (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Differential regulation of KCs and MoMFs fate by Chi3l1-glucose interaction.</title>
<p>KCs maintain a high-glucose activation state, while MoMFs exhibit a relatively low-glucose metabolic program. Chi3l1-glucose binding inhibits glucose uptake in KCs, thereby delaying KCs death and alleviating MASLD progression and metabolic dysfunction. In contrast, although Chi3l1-glucose binding similarly inhibits glucose uptake in MoMFs, their low basal glucose metabolism renders them resistant to this metabolic perturbation, resulting in minimal impact on MASLD pathogenesis</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Our study reveals fundamental differences in metabolic requirements between hepatic macrophage subsets that provide new insights into MASLD pathogenesis. We demonstrate that KCs and MoMFs play stage-specific roles in disease progression, with KCs serving as critical regulators of early metabolic homeostasis while MoMFs appear more involved in later inflammatory phases. This temporal specialization explains the striking dichotomy observed in our genetic models - KCs-specific Chi3l1 deletion dramatically exacerbated metabolic dysfunction, whereas MoMFs deletion showed minimal effects. The heightened glucose metabolism of KCs during MASLD renders them uniquely vulnerable to dietary stress. Chi3l1 serves as a crucial metabolic buffer in this context, directly protecting KCs through glucose modulation as evidenced by reduced glycogen accumulation and attenuated glycolytic flux. Our findings using the HFHC model complement previous findings in fibrogenic CDAA-HFAT models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> or MCD/CCL4 models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or human livers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, collectively suggesting Chi3l1 may have dual roles in MASLD - maintaining metabolic balance through KCs in early disease while potentially influencing fibrogenesis via MoMFs in advanced stages. The accelerated KCs death in knockout models provides direct experimental evidence linking macrophage survival to metabolic outcomes, resolving key questions about MASLD progression mechanisms.</p>
<p>The structural characteristics of Chi3l1 have been extensively studied. Chi3l1 is a homodimeric protein composed of two identical subunits. Each subunit consists of a catalytic domain and a carbohydrate-binding domain. The catalytic domain contains an active site capable of hydrolyzing chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The carbohydrate-binding domain is responsible for the interaction between Chi3l1 and various carbohydrate ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. It is likely that Chi3l1 also interacts with glucose through its carbohydrate-binding domain. However, the precise molecular interactions between Chi3l1 and glucose are still not fully elucidated, and further research is needed to explore these interactions in greater detail. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that Chi3l1 is upregulated in the serum of mice fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet for 16 weeks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). However, continuing to feed the mice for 24 weeks did not further increase the level of Chi3l1 (data not shown). This suggests that the level of Chi3l1 initially increases but reaches a plateau stage over time. These findings indicate that while Chi3l1 has the capability to bind with glucose, this interaction may be limited in living organisms.</p>
<p>Our findings carry important translational potential for MASLD treatment. The discovery of Chi3l1âs glucose-sensing function in KCs suggests two complementary therapeutic strategies: first, developing Chi3l1-based interventions to preserve KC populations during early metabolic dysfunction; second, creating cell-type-specific approaches that selectively modulate glucose metabolism in KCs while sparing MoMFs. The structural mapping of Chi3l1âs glucose-binding domain now enables rational design of small molecule mimetics to therapeutically enhance this protective pathway. Besides, several key questions emerge for future research to advance these therapeutic possibilities: (1) How glucose levels are coordinated with other death inducers such as lipid toxicity; (2) Whether competing carbohydrate ligands modulate Chi3l1âs glucose-sensing capacity in different metabolic states; (3) The clinical relevance of human Chi3l1 variants in MASLD susceptibility and progression. Addressing these questions will be crucial for translating our mechanistic insights into targeted therapies that account for the complex metabolic specialization of hepatic macrophage subsets.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal a novel metabolic checkpoint in which Chi3l1 selectively sustains KCs populations by modulating glucose metabolism, offering key insights into MASLD pathogenesis. The study highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting Chi3l1-glucose interactions to preserve protective KCs and curb MASLD progression. Future research should explore whether Chi3l1 supplementation or pharmacological modulation can rescue KCs viability, as well as investigate whether this mechanism extends to other macrophage-driven metabolic disorders, such as MASH or diabetes. By identifying cell type-specific metabolic vulnerabilities, this work paves the way for precision therapies that selectively manipulate macrophage subsets to treat liver disease.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> study in the role of CHI3L1 in Kupffer cells, the macrophages of the liver, showing that CHI3L1 alters glucose regulation in obesity. Specifically, Chi3l1 protects glucose-dependent Kupffer cells during Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by inhibiting glucose uptake, preventing metabolic stress and death. These data are <bold>compelling</bold>, yet require further validation.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Shan et al seeks to define the role of the CHI3L1 protein in macrophages during the progression of MASH. The authors argue that the Chil1 gene is expressed highly in hepatic macrophages. Subsequently, they use Chil1 flx mice crossed to Clec4F-Cre or LysM-Cre to assess the role of this factor in the progression of MASH using a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFC). They found that loss of Chil1 in KCs (Clec4F Cre) leads to enhanced KC death and worsened hepatic steatosis. Using scRNA seq, they also provide evidence that loss of this factor promotes gene programs related to cell death. From a mechanistic perspective, they provide evidence that CHI3L serves as a glucose sink and thus loss of this molecule enhances macrophage glucose uptake and susceptibility to cell death. Using a bone marrow macrophage system and KCs they demonstrate that cell death induced by palmitic acid is attenuated by the addition of rCHI3L1. While the article is well written and potentially highlights a new mechanism of macrophage dysfunction in MASH, there are some concerns about the current data that limit my enthusiasm for the study in its current form. Please see my specific comments below.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) The authors' interpretation of the results from the KC ( Clec4F) and MdM KO (LysM-Cre) experiments is flawed. For example, in Figure 2 the authors present data that knockout of Chil1 in KCs using Clec4f Cre produces worse liver steatosis and insulin resistance. However, in supplemental Figure 4, they perform the same experiment in LysM-Cre mice and find a somewhat different phenotype. The authors appear to be under the impression that LysM-Cre does not cause recombination in KCs and therefore interpret this data to mean that Chil1 is relevant in KCs and not MdMs. However, LysM-Cre DOES lead to efficient recombination in KCs and therefore Chil1 expression will be decreased in both KCs and MdM (along with PMNs) in this line.</p>
<p>Therefore, a phenotype observed with KC-KO should also be present in this model unless the authors argue that loss of Chil1 from the MdMs has the opposite phenotype of KCs and therefore attenuates the phenotype. The Cx3Cr1 CreER tamoxifen inducible system is currently the only macrophage Cre strategy that will avoid KC recombination. The authors need to rethink their results with the understanding that Chil1 is deleted from KCs in the LysM-Cre experiment. In addition, it appears that only one experiment was performed, with only 5 mice in each group for both the Clec4f and LysM-Cre data. This is generally not enough to make a firm conclusion for MASH diet experiments.</p>
<p>(2) The mouse weight gain is missing from Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 4. This data is critical to interpret the changes in liver pathology, especially since they have worse insulin resistance.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 4 suggests that KC death is increased with KO of Chil1. However, this data cannot be concluded from the plots shown. In Supplementary Figure 6 the authors provide a more appropriate gating scheme to quantify resident KCs that includes TIM4. The TIM4 data needs to be shown and quantified in Figure 4. As shown in Supplementary Figure 6, the F4/80 hi population is predominantly KCs at baseline; however, this is not true with MASH diets. Most of the recruited MoMFs also reside in the F4/80 hi gate where they can be identified by their lower expression of TIM4. The MoMF gate shown in this figure is incorrect. The CD11b hi population is predominantly PMNs, monocytes, and cDC,2 not MoMFs (PMID:33997821). In addition, the authors should stain the tissue for TIM4, which would also be expected to reveal a decrease in the number of resident KCs.</p>
<p>(4) While the Clec4F Cre is specific to KCs, there is also less data about the impact of the Cre system on KC biology. Therefore, when looking at cell death, the authors need to include some mice that express Clec4F cre without the floxed allele to rule out any effects of the Cre itself. In addition, if the cell death phenotype is real, it should also be present in LysM Cre system for the reasons described above. Therefore, the authors should quantify the KC number and dying KCs in this mouse line as well.</p>
<p>(5) I am somewhat concerned about the conclusion that Chil1 is highly expressed in liver macrophages. Looking at our own data and those from the Liver Atlas it appears that this gene is primarily expressed in neutrophils. At a minimum, the authors should address the expression of Chil1 in macrophage populations from other publicly available datasets in mouse MASH to validate their findings (several options include - PMID: 33440159, 32888418, 32362324). If expression of Chil1 is not present in these other data sets, perhaps an environmental/microbiome difference may account for the distinct expression pattern observed. Either way, it is important to address this issue.</p>

<p>The manuscript from Shan et al., sets out to investigate the role of Chi3l1 in different hepatic macrophage subsets (KCs and moMFs) in MASLD following their identification that KCs highly express this gene. To this end, they utilise Chi3l1KO, Clec4f-CrexChi3l1fl, and Lyz2-CrexChi3l1fl mice and WT controls fed a HFHC for different periods of time.</p>
<p>Firstly, the authors perform scRNA-seq, which led to the identification of Chi3l1 (encoded by Chil1) in macrophages. However, this is on a limited number of cells (especially in the HFHC context), and hence it would also be important to validate this finding in other publicly available MASLD/Fibrosis scRNA-seq datasets. Similarly, it would be important to examine if cells other than monocytes/macrophages also express this gene, given the use of the full KO in the manuscript. Along these lines, utilisation of publicly available human MASLD scRNA-seq datasets would also be important to understand where the increased expression observed in patients comes from and the overall relevance of macrophages in this finding.</p>
<p>Next, the authors use two different Cre lines (Clec4f-Cre and Lyz2-Cre) to target KCs and moMFs respectively. However, no evidence is provided to demonstrate that Chil1 is only deleted from the respective cells in the two CRE lines. Thus, KCs and moMFs should be sorted from both lines, and a qPCR performed to check the deletion of Chil1. This is especially important for the Lyz2-Cre, which has been routinely used in the literature to target KCs (as well as moMFs) and has (at least partial) penetrance in KCs (depending on the gene to be floxed). Also, while the Clec4f-Cre mice show an exacerbated MASLD phenotype, there is currently no baseline phenotype of these animals (or the Lyz2Cre) in steady state in relation to the same readouts provided in MASLD and the macrophage compartment. This is critical to understand if the phenotype is MASLD-specific or if loss of Chi3l1 already affects the macrophages under homeostatic conditions.</p>
<p>Next, the authors suggest that loss of Chi3l1 promotes KC death. However, to examine this, they use Chi3l1 full KO mice instead of the Clec4f-Cre line. The reason for this is not clear, because in this regard, it is now not clear whether the effects are regulated by loss of Chi3l1 from KCs or from other hepatic cells (see point above). The authors mention that Chi3l1 is a secreted protein, so does this mean other cells are also secreting it, and are these needed for KC death? In that case, this would not explain the phenotype in the CLEC4F-Cre mice. Here, the authors do perform a basic immunophenotyping of the macrophage populations; however, the markers used are outdated, making it difficult to interpret the findings. Instead of F4/80 and CD11b, which do not allow a perfect discrimination of KCs and moMFs, especially in HFHC diet-fed mice, more robust and specific markers of KCs should be used, including CLEC4F, VSIG4, and TIM4.</p>
<p>Additionally, while the authors report a reduction of KCs in terms of absolute numbers, there are no differences in proportions. This, coupled with a decrease also in moMF numbers at 16 weeks (when one would expect an increase if KCs are decreased, based on previous literature) suggests that the differences in KC numbers may be due to differences in total cell counts obtained from the obese livers compared with controls. To rule this out, total cell counts and total live CD45+ cell counts should be provided. Here, the authors also provide tunnel staining in situ to demonstrate increased KC death, but as it is typically notoriously difficult to visualise dying KCs in MASLD models, here it would be important to provide more images. Similarly, there appear to be many more Tunel+ cells in the KO that are not KCs; thus, it would be important to examine this in the CLEC4F-Cre line to ascertain direct versus indirect effects on cell survival.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors suggest that Chi3l1 exerts its effects through binding glucose and preventing its uptake. They use ex vivo/in vitro models to assess this with rChi3l1; however, here I miss the key in vivo experiment using the CLEC4F-Cre mice to prove that this in KCs is sufficient for the phenotype. This is critical to confirm the take-home message of the manuscript.</p>

<p>This paper investigates the role of Chi3l1 in regulating the fate of liver macrophages in the context of metabolic dysfunction leading to the development of MASLD. I do see value in this work, but some issues exist that should be addressed as well as possible.</p>
<p>Here are my comments:</p>
<p>(1) Chi3l1 has been linked to macrophage functions in MASLD/MASH, acute liver injury, and fibrosis models before (e.g., PMID: 37166517), which limits the novelty of the current work. It has even been linked to macrophage cell death/survival (PMID: 31250532) in the context of fibrosis, which is a main observation from the current study.</p>
<p>(2) The LysCre-experiments differ from experiments conducted by Ariel Feldstein's team (PMID: 37166517). What is the explanation for this difference? - The LysCre system is neither specific to macrophages (it also depletes in neutrophils, etc), nor is this system necessarily efficient in all myeloid cells (e.g., Kupffer cells vs other macrophages). The authors need to show the efficacy and specificity of the conditional KO regarding Chi3l1 in the different myeloid populations in the liver and the circulation.</p>
<p>(3) The conclusions are exclusively based on one MASLD model. I recommend confirming the key findings in a second, ideally a more fibrotic, MASH model.</p>
<p>(4) Very few human data are being provided (e.g., no work with own human liver samples, work with primary human cells). Thus, the translational relevance of the observations remains unclear.</p>
