<abstract><p>Ammonia is a morphogen in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and is known to arise from the catabolism of proteins and RNA. However, we show that extracellular adenosine deamination catalyzed by ‘adenosine deaminase related growth factor’ (ADGF), is a major source of ammonia, and demonstrate a direct role of ammonia in tip organizer development. The tip formed during early development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> functions analogously to the embryonic organizer of higher vertebrates. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cell lines carrying mutations in the gene <italic>adgf</italic> fail to establish an organizer, and this could be reversed by exposing the mutants to volatile ammonia. Interestingly, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> physically separated from the <italic>Dictyostelium adgf</italic> mutants in a partitioned dish, also rescues the mound arrest phenotype suggesting a cross-kingdom interaction that drives development. Both the substrate, adenosine and the product, ammonia regulate <italic>adgf</italic> expression, and ADGF acts downstream of the histidine kinase DhkD in regulating tip formation. Thus, the consecutive transformation of extracellular cAMP to adenosine, and adenosine to ammonia are integral steps during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development. Remarkably, in higher vertebrates, <italic>adgf</italic> expression is elevated during gastrulation and thus adenosine deamination may be a conserved process driving organizer development in different organisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During early embryonic development, organizers play an important role in patterning and directing the differentiation of surrounding cells into specific tissues and organs. The embryonic organizer establishes the developmental polarity in vertebrates; and similarly, in <italic>Dictyostelium,</italic> the mound/slug tip acts as an organizer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Rubin and Robertson, 1975</xref>) playing a pivotal role in guiding collective cell migration and patterning. Despite numerous investigations on <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> tip formation, the processes by which the tip establishes and maintains the primary developmental axis remains elusive. Gaining insights into the mechanisms regulating tip organizer function will offer valuable insights on orchestrated cell movements and processes underlying development.</p>
<p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> transitions from a unicellular amoeba to a multicellular organism in response to starvation. The cells aggregate into a mound, which gives rise to a migrating slug and ultimately a fruiting body composed of spores and a dead stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Raper, 1940</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Kessin, 2001</xref>). This process is regulated by diffusible signals including cAMP, adenosine, ammonia, and a chlorinated hexaphenone, ‘differentiation-inducing factor’ (DIF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bloom and Kay, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c165">Williams, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Gross, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Mahadeo and Parent, 2006</xref>). Importantly, the cell cycle phase soon after starvation is known to strongly influence the cell fate either as prestalk (pst) or prespore (psp) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c159">Weeks and Weijer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Jang and Gomer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Tip development in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> depends on cAMP signaling in turn regulating protein kinase A (PKA) activity, adenosine signaling, and morphogenetic cell movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Schaap and Wang, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Mann and Firtel, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Siegert and Weijer, 1995</xref>). Adenosine, a by-product of cAMP hydrolysis, acts as an inhibitory morphogen suppressing additional tip formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Schaap and Wang, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Adenosine deaminases (ADA) catalyse the breakdown of adenosine to generate inosine and ammonia, and are conserved among bacteria, invertebrates, vertebrates including mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Cristalli et al., 2001</xref>). In humans, two isoforms of ADA are known including ADA1 and ADA2, and the <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> homolog of ADA2 is adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF). Unlike ADA that is intracellular, ADGF is extracellular and also has a growth factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Li and Aksoy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Iijima et al., 2008</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>ada2</italic> are linked to lymphopenia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Gaspar, 2010</xref>), and vascular inflammation due to accumulation of toxic metabolites like dATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c174">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Notarangelo, 2016</xref>). In mice, <italic>ada2</italic> disruption leads to perinatal mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">Wakamiya et al., 1995</xref>), and overexpression of <italic>ada2</italic> results in aberrant heart and kidney development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Riazi et al., 2005</xref>). In frogs, mutations in <italic>ada2</italic> manifest in reduced body size and altered polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Iijima et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, certain isoforms of ADGF are known to play a pivotal role in cell proliferation by depleting extracellular adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c175">Zurovec et al., 2002</xref>), and loss of function of <italic>adgfA</italic> promotes melanotic tumour formation and larval death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dolezal et al., 2005</xref>). Adenosine deaminases are known to interact with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP), cluster of differentiation (CD26) expressed on T-cells and the adenosine receptor, A2AR (expressed on dendritic cells) to facilitate cell-cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Moreno et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, <italic>adgf</italic> plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell proliferation and development in several organisms.</p>
<p>Four isoforms of ADA are annotated in the <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Eichinger et al., 2005</xref>) including adenosine deaminase (<italic>ada</italic>; DDB_G0287371), adenosine deaminase acting on tRNA-1 (DDB_G0278943), adenosine deaminase tRNA-specific (DDB_G0288099) and adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (<italic>adgf</italic>; DDB_G0275179), and their role in growth and development is not known. In this study, we demonstrate that ammonia generated by ADGF plays a direct role in establishing the tip organizer, highlighting a novel link between nucleoside metabolism and developmental polarity in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>.</p>

<title>Differential regulation of <italic>adgf</italic> expression during growth and development</title>
<p><italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cell lines carrying mutations in the gene <italic>adgf</italic> were obtained from the genome wide <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> insertion (GWDI) bank, and were subjected to further analysis to know the role of <italic>adgf</italic> during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development. To verify the insertion of blasticidin <italic>(bsr)</italic> resistance cassette in <italic>adgf</italic> mutant, a diagnostic PCR was carried out and the integration was validated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of <italic>adgf</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In vertebrates, adenosine deaminases are expressed in a tissue specific manner to control growth and development. To determine whether <italic>adgf</italic> expression is differentially regulated during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development, qRT-PCR was performed using RNA isolated at 0 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h and 24 h post starvation. <italic>adgf</italic> expression peaks at 16 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) implying an important role for <italic>adgf</italic> later in development. At this time point, the expression of the other three isoforms of ADA were not significantly different from wild-type (WT), suggesting that the loss of <italic>adgf</italic> (data not shown) function is not compensated by the other isoforms.</p>

<title>The predicted structures of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ADGF and human ADA2 share a strong structural similarity</title>
<p>The <italic>D. discoideum adgf</italic> gene is predicted to encode a protein of 543 amino acids, and belongs to the metallo-transferases superfamily (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1A</xref>), having an ADA and an N-terminal domain similar to human ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1B</xref>). The ADGF sequence from the protein family database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/</ext-link>) was analysed using the online tool SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de">http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de</ext-link>), to know the presence of structurally similar domains. The different domains of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> ADGF (DdADGF) show a high degree of similarity with human ADA2. DdADGF shares 37.5% identity with human ADA2 and shares a sequence similarity of 59.5% with <italic>D. fasciculatum</italic>, 61.2% with <italic>D. pupureum,</italic> 53.6% with <italic>D. lacteum</italic> and 62.1% with <italic>Polysphondylium pallidum</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link>). Multiple sequence alignment reveals the presence of an N-terminal signal sequence characteristic of extracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1C</xref>).and conserved histidine and glutamine residues in the active site of both <italic>D. discoideum</italic> ADGF and human ADA2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The phylogenetic relation of ADGF to the classic ADA subfamily has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Maier et al., 2005</xref>). To determine the evolutionary relationship of DdADGF with that of other organisms, a phylogenetic analysis was carried out, and the amino acid alignment was created using MEGAX software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). The evolutionary history of ADGF was inferred using a Maximum Likelihood approach with Bootstrap analysis (100 iterations) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Felsenstein (1985)</xref>. The resulting phylogenetic tree indicated that DdADGF is closely related to the ADGF proteins of other Dictyostelids, including <italic>D. purpureum</italic>, <italic>Heterostelium pallidum,</italic> and <italic>Cavenderia fasciculata</italic>. DdADGF forms a distinct clade, likely representing a distant relative of its vertebrate homolog (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Figure S1E</xref>). Using the crystal structure of human ADA2, Cat eye syndrome critical region protein 1 (CECR1) as a template (PDB-3LGD), the structure of DdADGF was predicted by homology modeling (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>) (Figures S1 F-H). Alignment of DdADGF with human ADA2 yielded a root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 1 Å, indicating strong structural similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Eidhammer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Koehl, 2001</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>adgf</italic> controls aggregate size in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic></title>
<p>To understand the role of <italic>adgf</italic> during <italic>D. discoideum</italic> development, <italic>adgf</italic> mutants were plated at a density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on non-nutrient phosphate buffered agar plates and monitored thereafter. In comparison to WT, the aggregates of <italic>adgf <sup>−</sup></italic> were larger, and thus the number of aggregates were fewer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) than the WT. To determine the pathways impairing the tissue size in the mutant, RNA expression of countin (<italic>ctn</italic>) and small aggregates (<italic>smlA</italic>) were examined, and their levels were reduced significantly compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Countin factor (CF) regulates group size by reducing the expression of cell-cell adhesion proteins cadherin (<italic>cadA</italic>) and contact site A (<italic>csaA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Siu et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Coates and Harwood, 2001</xref>). Compared to WT, both cell-to-cell adhesion and <italic>cadA, csaA</italic> expression were higher in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>) suggesting that <italic>adgf</italic> regulates the overall size of the aggregates.</p>

<p>To know if <italic>adgf</italic> expression is differentially regulated between the two major cell types, psp-GFP tagged WT slugs were disaggregated, and using the fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), GFP-negative prestalk (pst-GFP⁻) and GFP-positive prespore (psp-GFP⁺) populations were obtained (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figures 9A-E</xref>), and RNA was isolated from both cell populations. Real time PCR analysis reveals that <italic>adgf</italic> expression is 4.95-fold higher in the psp-GFP⁺ than pst-GFP⁻ cells (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref>). The preferential sorting of WT cells to psp region and the <italic>adgf</italic> mutants (with reduced psp expression) to the pst part of the slug also reinforces the differential expression of <italic>adgf</italic>. Thus, cells with higher <italic>adgf</italic> expression preferentially sorted to the psp region and the absence of <italic>adgf</italic> in mutant cells may hinder their ability to adopt a prespore fate, leading to their preferential sorting in the pst region within the chimera.</p>

It is possible that ADA/ADGF converted adenosine analogues to inosine analogues, which in some manner affected development.

<p>Multiple sequence alignments, experiments with conditioned media and cell mixing with WT suggests that ADGF is secreted.

AMP deaminase, previously characterized in the mollusk <italic>Helix pomatia</italic>, has been identified as a member of ADGF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">Tzertzinis et al., 2023</xref>).

<title>Pathways generating ammonia in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic></title>
<p>Ammonia can come from a variety of sources both within and outside the cells and this can be from dead cells also.

During development, amino acids, total protein and RNA levels are reported to reduce with a significant increase in ammonia levels, thus equivocating the source of volatile ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Hames and Ashworth, 1974</xref>). The highly acidic, autophagic vesicles in pst cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Gross, 2009</xref>) are believed to catalyze the breakdown of proteins and RNA, also generating ammonia.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several deaminases or enzymatic reactions in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> may also generate ammonia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>).

<title>Role of ammonia during <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development</title>
<p>Ammonia is known to inhibit aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Schindler and Sussman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c164">Williams et al., 1984</xref>), affect aggregate territory size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">Thadani et al., 1977</xref>), aggregate density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Feit, 1988</xref>), cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Gross et al., 1988</xref>), culmination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Davies et al., 1993</xref>) and fruiting body size in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Lonski, 1976</xref>). Ammonia promotes psp over pst differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Newell et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">Sternfeld and David, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Gross et al. 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Oyama and Blumberg, 1986</xref>), and favors prolonged slug migration called ‘slugging’ over culmination by suppressing DIF biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Neave et al., 1983</xref>). Ammonia plays a crucial role in orienting cell masses, accelerating the movement of aggregating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bonner et al., 1986</xref>), and prevents the developmental transition of slugs to fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bradbury and Gross, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c158">Wang and Schaap, 1989</xref>). Enzymatic removal of ammonia causes the quick transition from slug to fruiting thus controlling the morphogenetic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Schindler and Sussman, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Beyond its broad effects on aggregation and culmination, ammonia also reinforces positional information by elevating intracellular cAMP levels, favoring prespore over prestalk differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bradbury and Gross, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Riley and Barclay, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Hopper et al., 1993</xref>). Ammonia is known to influence rapid patterning of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells confined in a restricted environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Sawai et al., 2002</xref>). In <italic>adgf</italic> mutants that have low ammonia levels, both neutral red staining and the prestalk marker <italic>ecmA/ ecmB</italic> expression are higher than the WT, and the mound arrest phenotype can be reversed by exposing the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant mounds to ammonia. As a gas, ammonia can diffuse generating a gradient. The slime sheath at the back of the slug is believed to prevent the diffusion of ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Gross, 2009</xref>), and ammonia escaping through the slug front neutralizes the acidic vesicles in prestalk cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonner, 1952</xref>). Thus, a rise in the pH of these acidic vesicles and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Poole and Ohkuma, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Gross et al, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Davies et al 1993</xref>), is known to increase the speed of chemotaxing amoebae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Siegert and Weijer, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">Van Duijn and Inouye, 1991</xref>), favouring collective cell movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bonner et al., 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">1989</xref>), and tipped mound development. Thus ammonia actively promotes the transition from mound to tipped mound formation.</p>
<p>Our results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) also show that the amount of ammonia released from adenosine is in the same order of magnitude as that from other sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c172">Yoshino et al., 2007</xref>). It is interesting that a mutation in <italic>adgf</italic> manifests in arrested tip development, although <italic>adgf</italic> expression was found to be higher in psp than pst cells. If a threshold concentration of ammonia is not present, collective cell movement influencing tip formation may be blocked at the mound stage. Increased <italic>adgf</italic> expression in psp than pst cell types suggest that low extracellular adenosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c161">Weijer and Durston, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Schaap and Wang, 1986</xref>) and high levels of ammonia influence psp cell fate. The decision between the formation of the tip (pst cells) and the ALC is controlled by the tip’s production of ammonia, which prevents the migration of ALCs towards the tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">Sternfeld and David, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Feit et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In slugger mutants, ammonia is known to inhibit tip formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Gee et al., 1994</xref>), but not in WT NC4. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c172">Yoshino et al., (2007)</xref> have also reported ammonia inhibiting both aggregation and tip formation in WT cells. However, ammonium chloride was used as a source of ammonia, and the potential interference from chloride ions cannot be ruled out. A mutant impaired in mitochondrial function, <italic>midA⁻</italic>, is reported to accumulate high levels of ammonia that inhibited development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">Torija et al., 2006</xref>). Notably, these cells were developed with overhead light, a condition that may influence ammonia sensitivity and the developmental phenotype. However, ammonia exerts no effect on tip formation in AX4 (data not shown). After the tips are established, the slugs/ fruiting bodies move away from ammonia, reflecting a process by which fruiting bodies position themselves from other structures to increase the possibility of spore dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Kosugi and Inouye, 1989</xref>). A gaseous signal can act over long distances in a short time and for instance ammonia promotes synchronous development in a colony of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Palková et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Palková and Forstova, 2000</xref>). The slug tip is known to release ammonia probably favouring synchronized development of the entire colony of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. However, after the tips are established ammonia exerts negative chemotaxis probably helping the slugs to move away from each other ensuring equal spacing of the fruiting bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Feit and Sollitto, 1987</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that ammonia acts as both a local and long-range regulatory signal, integrating environmental and cellular cues to coordinate multicellular development.</p>

Further, 5’-nucleotidase promoter activity is high in pstAB cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">Ubeidat et al., 2002</xref>) that significantly covers the tip region suggesting high adenosine levels in the tip.

<p>In <italic>adgf</italic> mutants, ammonia levels may not be sufficient enough to neutralize the acidic vesicles and hence, NR staining is intense in the pst region and the ALCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bonner, 1952</xref>).

<p>Adenylate cyclase (AC) activity is regulated by various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Steer, 1975</xref>).

Ammonia has been shown to increase the activity of AC-G in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> sori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Cotter et al., 1999</xref>). High ammonia levels by altering the pH, can affect the activity of numerous enzymes whose activity is pH dependent and thus the activity of AC can be impacted by pH variations. <italic>adgf</italic> mutants with low ammonia levels have reduced cAMP levels, and increase in ammonia causes a significant increase in <italic>aca</italic>A expression. In rat brain, ammonia is known to interact with manganese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Rivera-Mancía et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), that is known to increase <italic>aca</italic>A expression in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Loomis et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Khachatrian et al., 1987</xref>).

A surge in phosphodiesterase inhibition is thought to regulate this shift from concentric to spiral wave propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Palsson and Cox, 1996</xref>), and indeed the phosphodiesterase expression was higher in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant possibly distorting the wave propagation.</p>
<p>The mound/slug tip of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> generates cAMP pulses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">Traynor et al., 1992</xref>), and is known to suppress additional tip formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Farnsworth, 1973</xref>). Adenosine, that inhibits additional tip formation represses <italic>pde4</italic> expression whereas ammonia, that promotes tip elongation, increases <italic>pde4</italic> expression. Thus, the restoration of cAMP signaling and spiral wave propagation possibly leads to the rescue of the <italic>adgf <sup>−</sup></italic> mound arrest phenotype upon exposure to ammonia. Surprisingly adenosine exerts little effect on tip development in WT cells and studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Inouye (1989)</xref> also reinforce our observations, showing that adenosine does not significantly influence the conversion of pst to psp cells in shaking culture conditions.</p>
<p>A robust cAMP relay is required for the transition from concentric to spiral wave propagation, with the corresponding changes in adenylate cyclase or phosphodiesterase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Siegert and Weijer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Palsson and Cox, 1996</xref>).

However, further experiments will be required to ascertain this link.</p>

<title>Adenosine deamination drives tip organizer development</title>
<p>A crucial evidence supporting that adenosine deamination is singularly responsible for the rescue of <italic>adgf <sup>−</sup></italic> mound arrest comes from experiments where partitioned dish with buffered solution containing adenosine on one side, and the mutants on the other half of the dish. Addition of ADA to the buffer containing adenosine resulted in <italic>adgf</italic> mutants forming tipped mound. Although ammonia’s role in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> development is well established, this report is the first to show a novel role of ammonia in tip development. If natural variants of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> that fail to form tips exist in soil ecosystems, it is conceivable that these strains could still form fruiting bodies when in proximity to WT strains. This interaction would likely occur through volatile signals such as ammonia diffusing through the shared environment. These diffusible signals may help rescue or coordinate developmental processes among neighbouring cells. Notably, the development of an organism in its natural environment is strongly influenced by volatile compounds present in its surroundings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Schulz-Bohm et al., 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>The histidine kinase <italic>dhkD</italic>, a member of the two-component family of histidine kinases, appears to function upstream of <italic>adgf</italic>, adding to our understanding of the signaling cascade in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Histidine kinases play essential roles in regulating developmental transitions, with <italic>dhkC</italic>, for example, initiating the late developmental program that ultimately leads to fruiting body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Singleton et al., 1998</xref>).

<title>Model of ADGF action</title>
<p>Ammonia generated from multiple sources is likely to be quenched rapidly by the intracellular acidic vesicles of pst cells, increasing its pH and favoring collective cell movement driving mound/ slug tip development. However, the slime sheath at the back of the slug may prevent the diffusion of ammonia, and thus the major route of ammonia emission will be from the slug front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Farnsworth and Loomis, 1974</xref>). Although ammonia is likely to be formed from several sources in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, a critical threshold concentration of ammonia may be necessary for tip development. The failure of even one pathway may result in a drop-in ammonia levels, exerting an effect on development (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>). Thus, ammonia is likely to be important for the maturation of tip cells.</p>

<p>To determine the differential expression of <italic>adgf,</italic> if any, between the two major cell types, psp-GFP cells in AX4 background were developed on KK2 agar plates at a density of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm² until they reached the slug stage, as described by Ratner and Borth (1983). Fluorescence was initially monitored using microscopy to confirm GFP expression. Slugs were then dissociated in 20 mM phosphate buffer containing 40 mM EDTA, pH 7.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Nadin et al., 2000</xref>), filtered through a 10-μm nylon mesh, chilled on ice, and using FACS (FACS Discover S8 Image Sorter (BD Biosciences, USA)) the two cell types were sorted. Sorting was performed at a rate of 10,000 cells/s with a 488 nm laser. GFP-positive prespore (psp) cells and GFP-negative prestalk (pst) cells were collected separately on ice over several hours. Total RNA was extracted from both cell populations, and the expression of <italic>adgf</italic> was analyzed using RT-PCR.</p>

<p>After 14 h of development on phosphate buffered agar plates, WT and <italic>adgf <sup>−</sup></italic> mounds were disaggregated by repeated pipetting and vortexing using ice-cold KK2 buffer. Dissociated cells were resuspended in KK2 buffer and incubated at 150 rpm for 45 min. Single and non-adherent cells were counted using a Neubauer chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Lam et al., 1981</xref>).</p>

<title>Treatment of <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> cells with different compounds</title>
<p>A highly specific ADA inhibitor, DCF that inhibits both extra and intra-cellular ADAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cha et al., 1975</xref>) was mixed with the WT cell suspension and plated on 1% non-nutrient KK2 agar plates at a density of 5×10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Of the different DCF concentrations tested (10 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM and 1 µM), 100 nM showed complete tip inhibition.</p>
<p>For the enzymatic rescue assay, 10 U of bovine ADA dissolved in KK2 buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added onto mutant mounds. The concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP (2 mM), cAMP (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM), c-di-GMP (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM), adenosine (1 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM, 1 mM), caffeine (10 nM, 100 nM, 1 µM) and IBMX (0.5 mM) were based on previous publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chen and Schaap, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Nassir et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Siegert and Weijer, 1989</xref>) and these compounds were added independently either on top of the mounds or supplemented while plating.

<title>Genes involved in autophagy and tipped mound formation do not show altered expression in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant</title>
<p>Autophagy helps in maintaining cellular homeostasis by promoting the breakdown of damaged proteins and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Mizushima et al., 2008</xref>), and ammonia is recognised to be a diffusible regulator of autophagy in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Eng et al., 2010</xref>). To investigate if autophagy is impaired in the mutant, the expression of autophagy markers <italic>atg8</italic> and <italic>atg18</italic> were examined and there was no discernible change in the expression levels when compared to WT. The tipless to tipped mound transition as well as late developmental gene expression is regulated by <italic>gbf</italic>A, a G-box binding factor (GBF). However, in the <italic>adgf</italic> mutant the <italic>gbf</italic>A expression levels were comparable with no significant difference between the WT at 16 h (data not shown). Without the assay for autophagy as well as assay for GBF activity, these expression studies alone are not conclusive to rule out the role of these factors in tip formation.</p>

<title>ADA does not deaminate cytokinin</title>
<p>ADA is known to interact with 5’AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Hanif et al., 2022</xref>) and in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, 5′-AMP serves as a direct precursor of cytokinin, playing a significant role in cellular signaling and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">Taya et al., 1978</xref>). Although docking studies suggest low to moderate binding of ADGF with cytokinins (zeatin, dihydrozeatin, isopentenyl adenine), we carried a functional assay by mixing cytokinin and ADA with KK2 buffer in one side of the Petridish and found no rescue of the mutant in such conditions (data not shown), suggesting no functional activity between ADA and the versions of cytokinin tested.</p>

<title>Plausible routes of caffeine action rescuing the mound arrest phenotype</title>
<p>The <italic>adgf</italic> mound arrest could be rescued by the addition of the adenosine antagonist, caffeine but treatment with the <italic>pde4</italic> inhibitor, IBMX failed to rescue the mound arrest. Caffeine is known to reduce adenosine levels in blood plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Conlay et al., 1988</xref>) and also increase ammonium levels in urine samples of rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bernheim and Bernheim, 1945</xref>). Thus, the mound rescue upon caffeine treatment may be a result of reduced adenosine and increased ammonia levels. With respect to caffeine action on cAMP levels, the reports are contradictory. Caffeine has been reported to increase adenylate cyclase expression thereby increasing cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Hagmann, 1986</xref>) whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alvarez-Curto et al., (2007)</xref> found that caffeine reduced intracellular cAMP levels in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>. Although, caffeine is moderately potent in inhibiting PDE enzyme activity, the <italic>in vivo</italic> concentrations are likely to be low to be associated with effective PDE inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Burg and Werner, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Daly, 1993</xref>).</p>

<p>During the development of the unicellular eukaryote Dictyostelium discoideum, cells aggregate into mounds, forming protrusions or tips, which then become the front of migrating slugs and the top of fruiting bodies. This <bold>valuable</bold> study identifies adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF) as a key regulator of tip formation and <bold>convincingly</bold> shows that ADGF catalyses the conversion of adenosine to ammonia, allowing ammonia to initiate tip formation, and then elucidates pathways upstream and downstream of ADGF. The authors discuss the intriguing possibility that mammalian ADGF may also similarly regulate development.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work shows that a specific adenosine deaminase protein in Dictyostelium generates the ammonia that is required for tip formation during Dictyostelium development. Cells with an insertion in the adgf gene aggregate but do not form tips. A remarkable result, shown by several different ways, is that the adgf mutant can be rescued by exposing the mutant to ammonia gas. The authors also describe other phenotypes of the adgf mutant such as increased mound size, altered cAMP signaling, and abnormal cell type differentiation. It appears that the adgf mutant has defects the expression of a large number of genes, resulting in not only the tip defect but also the mound size, cAMP signaling, and differentiation phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data and statistics are excellent.</p>
<p>Comments on previous version:</p>
<p>Looks better, but I think you answered my questions (listed as weaknesses in the public review) in the reply to the reviewer but not in the paper. I'd suggest carefully thinking about my questions and addressing them in the Discussion (The authors have now done this).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper describes new insights into the role of adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (adgf), an enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of adenosine into ammonia and inosine, in tip formation during Dictyostelium development. The adgf null mutant has a pre-tip mound arrest phenotype, which can be rescued by external addition of ammonia. Analysis suggests that the phenotype involves changes in cAMP signaling possibly involving a histidine kinase dhkD, but details remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The generation of an adgf mutant showed a strong mound arrest phenotype and successful rescue by external ammonia. Characterisation of significant changes in cAMP signaling components, suggesting low cAMP signaling in the mutant and identification of the histidine kinase dhkD as a possible component of the transduction pathway. Identification of a change in cell-type differentiation towards prestalk fate</p>
<p>Comments on previous version:</p>
<p>The revised version of the paper has improved significantly in terms of structure and clarity. The additional data on rescue of total cAMP production by ammonia (Fig. 7C) in the adgf- mutant and the 5-fold increased prespore expression of adgf RNA compared to prestalk cells (Fig 9) are useful data additions.</p>
<p>The link between changes in cAMP signaling (lower aca expression) and wave geometry (concentric waves rather than spiral waves) remains speculative.</p>
<p>I noted that Fig 6 contains different images than the previous version (Fig 7).</p>
<p>The statement &quot;Interestingly, Klebsiella pneumoniae physically separated from the Dictyostelium adgf mutants in a partitioned dish, also rescues the mound arrest phenotype suggesting a cross-kingdom interaction that drives development&quot; in the summary is rather overdone. All experiments were performed with axenic strains (no bacteria).</p>
<p>as is the sentence &quot;Remarkably, in higher vertebrates, adgf expression is elevated during gastrulation and thus adenosine deamination may be a conserved process driving organizer development in different organisms&quot;</p>
<p>The data supporting this in the supplementary information is hardly legible and poorly presented. What is shown is ADA expression in different tissues, not at different stages. I would suggest taking these figures out and concentrating the summary on the key mechanistic findings of the paper. (The authors have now done this.)</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work shows that a specific adenosine deaminase protein in Dictyostelium generates the ammonia that is required for tip formation during Dictyostelium development. Cells with an insertion in the ADGF gene aggregate but do not form tips. A remarkable result, shown in several different ways, is that the ADGF mutant can be rescued by exposing the mutant to ammonia gas. The authors also describe other phenotypes of the ADGF mutant such as increased mound size, altered cAMP signalling, and abnormal cell type differentiation. It appears that the ADGF mutant has defects in the expression of a large number of genes, resulting in not only the tip defect but also the mound size, cAMP signalling, and differentiation phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data and statistics are excellent.</p>
<p>(1) Weaknesses: The key weakness is understanding why the cells bother to use a diffusible gas like ammonia as a signal to form a tip and continue development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ammonia can come from a variety of sources both within and outside the cells and this can be from dead cells also. Ammonia by increasing cAMP levels, trigger collective cell movement thereby establishing a tip in Dictyostelium. A gaseous signal can act over long distances in a short time and for instance ammonia promotes synchronous development in a colony of yeast cells (Palkova et al., 1997; Palkova and Forstova, 2000). The slug tip is known to release ammonia probably favouring synchronized development of the entire colony of Dictyostelium. However, after the tips are established ammonia exerts negative chemotaxis probably helping the slugs to move away from each other ensuring equal spacing of the fruiting bodies (Feit and Sollitto, 1987).</p>
<p>It is well known that ammonia serves as a signalling molecule influencing both multicellular organization and differentiation in Dictyostelium (Francis, 1964; Bonner et al., 1989; Bradbury and Gross, 1989). Ammonia by raising the pH of the intracellular acidic vesicles of prestalk cells (Poole and Ohkuma, 1981; Gross et al, 1983), and the cytoplasm, is known to increase the speed of chemotaxing amoebae (Siegert and Weijer, 1989; Van Duijn and Inouye, 1991), inducing collective cell movement (Bonner et al., 1988, 1989), favoring tipped mound development.</p>
<p>Ammonia produced in millimolar concentrations during tip formation (Schindler and Sussman, 1977) could ward off other predators in soil. For instance, ammonia released by Streptomyces symbionts of leaf-cutting ants is known to inhibit fungal pathogens (Dhodary and Spiteller, 2021). Additionally, ammonia may be recycled back into amino acids, as observed during breast cancer proliferation (Spinelli et al., 2017). Such a process may also occur in starving Dictyostelium cells, supporting survival and differentiation. These findings suggest that ammonia acts as both a local and long-range regulatory signal, integrating environmental and cellular cues to coordinate multicellular development.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The rescue of the mutant by adding ammonia gas to the entire culture indicates that ammonia conveys no positional information within the mound.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ammonia reinforces or maintains the positional information by elevating cAMP levels, favoring prespore differentiation (Bradbury and Gross, 1989; Riley and Barclay, 1990; Hopper et al., 1993). Ammonia is known to influence rapid patterning of Dictyostelium cells confined in a restricted environment (Sawai et al., 2002). In adgf mutants that have low ammonia levels, both neutral red staining (a marker for prestalk and ALCs) (Figure. S3) and the prestalk marker ecmA/ ecmB expression (Figure. 7D) are higher than the WT and the mound arrest phenotype can be reversed by exposing the adgf mutant mounds to ammonia.</p>
<p>Prestalk cells are enriched in acidic vesicles, and ammonia, by raising the pH of these vesicles and the cytoplasm (Davies et al 1993; Van Duijn and Inouye 1991), plays an active role in collective cell movement during tip formation (Bonner et al., 1989).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) By the time the cells have formed a mound, the cells have been starving for several hours, and desperately need to form a fruiting body to disperse some of themselves as spores, and thus need to form a tip no matter what.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Exposure of adgf mounds to ammonia, led to tip development within 4 h (Figure. 5). In contrast, adgf controls remained at the mound stage for at least 30 h. This demonstrates that starvation alone is not the trigger for tip development and ammonia promotes the transition from mound to tipped mound formation.</p>
<p>Many mound arrest mutants are blocked in development and do not proceed to form fruiting bodies (Carrin et al., 1994). Further, not all the mound arrest mutants tested in this study were rescued by ADA enzyme (Figure. S4A), and they continue to stay as mounds.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) One can envision that the local ammonia concentration is possibly informing the mound that some minimal number of cells are present (assuming that the ammonia concentration is proportional to the number of cells), but probably even a minuscule fruiting body would be preferable to the cells compared to a mound. This latter idea could be easily explored by examining the fate of the ADGF cells in the mound - do they all form spores? Do some form spores?</p>
<p>Or perhaps the ADGF is secreted by only one cell type, and the resulting ammonia tells the mound that for some reason that cell type is not present in the mound, allowing some of the cells to transdifferentiate into the needed cell type. Thus, elucidating if all or some cells produce ADGF would greatly strengthen this puzzling story.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A fraction of adgf mounds form bulkier spore heads by the end of 36 h as shown in Figure. 2H. This late recovery may be due to the expression of other ADA isoforms. Mixing WT and adgf mutant cell lines results in a chimeric slug with mutants occupying the prestalk region (Figure. 8) and suggests that WT ADGF favours prespore differentiation. However, it is not clear if ADGF is secreted by a particular cell type, as adenosine can be produced by both cell types, and the activity of three other intracellular ADAs may vary between the cell types. To address whether adgf expression is cell type-specific, prestalk and prespore cells will be separated by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and thereafter, adgf expression will be examined in each population.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper describes new insights into the role of adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF), an enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of adenosine into ammonia and inosine, in tip formation during Dictyostelium development. The ADGF null mutant has a pre-tip mound arrest phenotype, which can be rescued by the external addition of ammonia. Analysis suggests that the phenotype involves changes in cAMP signalling possibly involving a histidine kinase dhkD, but details remain to be resolved.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The generation of an ADGF mutant showed a strong mound arrest phenotype and successful rescue by external ammonia. Characterization of significant changes in cAMP signalling components, suggesting low cAMP signalling in the mutant and identification of the histidine kinase dhkD as a possible component of the transduction pathway. Identification of a change in cell type differentiation towards prestalk fate</p>
<p>(1) Weaknesses: Lack of details on the developmental time course of ADGF activity and cell type type-specific differences in ADGF expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>adgf expression was examined at 0, 8, 12, and 16 h (Figure. 1), and the total ADA activity was assayed at 12 and 16 h (Figure. 3). Previously, the 12 h data was not included, and it’s been added now (Figure. 3A). The adgf expression was found to be highest at 16 h and hence, the ADA assay was carried out at that time point. Since the ADA assay will also report the activity of other three isoforms, it will not exclusively reflect ADGF activity.</p>
<p>Mixing WT and adgf mutant cell lines results in a chimeric slug with mutants occupying the prestalk region (Figure. 8) suggesting that WT adgf favours prespore differentiation. To address whether adgf expression is cell type-specific, prestalk and prespore cells will be separated by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and thereafter, adgf expression will be examined in each population.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The absence of measurements to show that ammonia addition to the null mutant can rescue the proposed defects in cAMP signalling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The adgf mutant in comparison to WT has diminished acaA expression (Fig. 6B) and reduced cAMP levels (Fig. 6A) both at 12 and 16 h of development. The cAMP levels were measured at 8 h and 12 h in the mutant.</p>
<p>We would like to add that ammonia is known to increase cAMP levels (Riley and Barclay, 1990; Feit et al., 2001) in Dictyostelium. Exposure to ammonia increases acaA expression in WT (Figure. 7B) and is likely to increase acaA expression/ cAMP levels in the mutant also (Riley and Barclay, 1990; Feit et al., 2001) thereby rescuing the defects in cAMP signalling. Based on the comments, cAMP levels will also be measured in the mutant after the rescue with ammonia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) No direct measurements in the dhkD mutant to show that it acts upstream of adgf in the control of changes in cAMP signalling and tip formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>cAMP levels will be quantified in the dhkD mutant after treatment with ammonia. The histidine kinases dhkD and dhkC are reported to modulate phosphodiesterase RegA activity, thereby maintaining cAMP levels (Singleton et al., 1998; Singleton and Xiong, 2013). By activating RegA, dhkD ensures proper cAMP distribution within the mound, which is essential for the patterning of prestalk and prespore cells, as well as for tip formation (Singleton and Xiong, 2013). Therefore, ammonia exposure to dhkD mutants is likely to regulate cAMP signalling and thereby tip formation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Lines: 47,48 - &quot;The gradient of these morphogens along the slug axis determines the cell fate, either as prestalk (pst) or as prespore (psp) cells.&quot; - many workers have shown that this is not true - intrinsic factors such as cell cycle phase drive cell fate.</p>

<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have removed the line and rephrased as “Based on cell cycle phases, there exists a dichotomy of cell types, that biases cell fate as prestalk or prespore (Weeks and Weijer, 1994; Jang and Gomer, 2011).</p>

Synergy experiments show that the effect of the mutation is non-cell autonomous and further experiments show that the mound arrest phenotype can be rescued by the provision of ammonia vapour. These observations are well documented. Furthermore, the paper contains a wide variety of experiments attempting to place the observed effects in known signalling pathways. It is suggested that ADGF may function downstream of DhkD, a histidine kinase previously implicated in ammonia signalling. Ammonia has long been described to affect different aspects, including differentiation of slug and culmination stages of Dictyostelium development, possibly through modulating cAMP signalling, but the exact mechanisms of action have not yet been resolved. The experiments reported here to resolve the mechanistic basis of the mutant phenotype need focusing and further work.</p>

<p>In humans, two isoforms of ADA are known including ADA1 and ADA2, and the Dictyostelium homolog of ADA2 is adenosine deaminase-related growth factor (ADGF). Unlike ADA that is intracellular, ADGF is extracellular and also has a growth factor activity (Li and Aksoy, 2000; Iijima et al., 2008). Loss-of-function mutations in ada2 are linked to lymphopenia, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (Gaspar, 2010), and vascular inflammation due to accumulation of toxic metabolites like dATP (Notarangelo, 2016; Zhou et al., 2014).</p>

<p>(4) Results: This section would benefit from better streamlining by a separation of results that provide more mechanistic insight from more peripheral observations.</p>

<p>The manuscript will be revised and the peripheral observations (Figure. 2) will be shifted to the supplementary information.</p>

<p>(5) Line 84 needs to start with a description of the goal, to produce a knockout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Details on the knockout will be elaborated in the revised manuscript. Line number 84 (now 75). Dictyostelium cell lines carrying mutations in the gene adgf were obtained from the genome wide Dictyostelium insertion (GWDI) bank and were subjected to further analysis to know the role of adgf during Dictyostelium development.</p>

<p>(6) Knockout data (Figure 1) can be simplified and combined with a description of the expression profile and phenotype Figure 3 F, G, and Figure 5. Higher magnification and better resolution photographs of the mutants would be desirable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you, as suggested the data will be simplified (section E will be removed) and combined with a description of the expression profile and, the phenotype images of Figure 3 F, G, and Figure 5 ( now Figure. 2 F, G, and Figure. 4) will be replaced with better images/ resolution.</p>

<p>(7) It would also be relevant to know which cells actually express ADGF during development, using in-situ hybridisation or promoter-reporter constructs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address whether adgf expression is cell type-specific, prestalk and prespore cells will be separated by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and thereafter, adgf expression will be examined in each population.</p>

<p>(9) Figures 4A, B - It is shown that as could be expected ada activity is somewhat reduced and adenosine levels are slightly elevated. However, the fact that ada levels are low at 16hrs could just imply that differentiation of the ADGF- cells is blocked/delayed at an earlier time point. To interpret these data, it would be necessary to see an ada activity and adenosine time course comparison of wt and mutant, or to see that expression is regulated in a celltype specific manner that could explain this (see above). It would be good to combine this with the observation that ammonia levels are lower in the ADGF- mutant than wildtype and that the mutant phenotype, mound arrest can be rescued by an external supply of ammonia (Figure 6).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In Dictyostelium four isoforms of ADA including ADGF are present, and thus the time course of total ADA activity will also report the function of other isoforms. Further, a number of pathways, generate adenosine (Dunwiddie et al., 1997; Boison and Yegutkin, 2019). ADGF expression was examined at 0, 8, 12 and 16 h (Fig 1) and the ADA activity was assayed at 12 h, the time point where the expression gradually increases and reaches a peak at 16 h. Earlier, we have not shown the 12 h activity data which will be included in the revised version. ADGF expression was found to be highly elevated at 16 h and adenosine/ammonia levels were measured at the two points indicated in the mutant.</p>

<p>(10) Panel 4C could be combined with other measurements trying to arrive at more insight in the mechanisms by which ammonia controls tip formation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Panel 4C (now 3C) illustrates the genes involved in the conversion of cAMP to adenosine. Since Figure. 3 focuses on adenosine levels and ADA activity in both WT and adgf mutants, we have retained Panel 3C in Figure. 3, for its relevance to the experiment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(11) There is a large variety of experiments attempting to link the mutant phenotype and its rescue by ammonia to cAMP signalling, however, the data do not yet provide a clear answer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is well known that ammonia increases cAMP levels (Riley and Barclay, 1990; Feit et al., 2001) and adenylate cyclase activity (Cotter et al., 1999) in D. discoideum, and exposure to ammonia increases acaA expression (Fig 7B) suggesting that ammonia regulates cAMP signaling. To address the concerns, cAMP levels will be quantified in the mutant after ammonia treatment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(12) The mutant is shown to have lower cAMP levels at the mound stage which ties in with low levels of acaA expression (Figures 7A and B), also various phosphodiesterases, the extracellular phosphodiesterase pdsa and the intracellular phosphodiesterase regA show increased expression. Suggesting a functional role for cAMP signalling is that the addition of di cGMP, a known activator of acaA, can also rescue the mound phenotype (Figure 7E). There appears to be a partial rescue of the mound arrest phenotype level by the addition of 8Br-cAMP (fig 7C), suggesting that intracellular cAMP levels rather than extracellular cAMP signalling can rescue some of the defects in the ADGF- mutant. Better images and a time course would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The relevant images will be replaced and a developmental time course after 8-Br-cAMP treatment will be included in the revised manuscript (Figure. 6D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(13) There is also the somewhat surprising observation that low levels of caffeine, an inhibitor of acaA activation also rescues the phenotype (Figure 7F).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With respect to caffeine action on cAMP levels, the reports are contradictory. Caffeine has been reported to increase adenylate cyclase expression thereby increasing cAMP levels (Hagmann, 1986) whereas Alvarez-Curto et al., (2007) found that caffeine reduced intracellular cAMP levels in Dictyostelium. Caffeine, although is a known inhibitor of ACA, is also known to inhibit PDEs (Nehlig et al., 1992; Rosenfeld et al., 2014). Therefore, if caffeine differentially affects ADA and PDE activity, it may potentially counterbalance the effects and rescue the phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(14) The data attempting to asses cAMP wave propagation in mounds (Fig 7H) are of low quality and inconclusive in the absence of further analysis. It remains unresolved how this links to the rescue of the ADGF- phenotype by ammonia. There are no experiments that measure any of the effects in the mutant stimulated with ammonia or di-cGMP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The relevant images will be replaced (now Figure. 6H). Ammonia by increasing acaA expression (Figure. 7B), and cAMP levels (Figure. 7C) may restore spiral wave propagation, thereby rescuing the mutant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(15) A possible way forward could also come from the observation that ammonia can rescue the wobbling mound arrest phenotype from the histidine kinase mutant dhkD null mutant, which has regA as its direct target, linking ammonia and cAMP signalling. This is in line with other work that had suggested that another histidine kinase, dhkC transduces an ammonia signal sensor to regA activation. A dhkC null mutant was reported to have a rapid development phenotype and skip slug migration (Dev. Biol. (1998) 203, 345). There is no direct evidence to show that dhkD acts upstream of ADGF and changes in cAMP signalling, for instance, measurements of changes in ADA activity in the mutant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>cAMP levels will be quantified in the dhkD mutant after ammonia treatment and accordingly, the results will be revised.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(16) The paper makes several further observations on the mutant. After 16 hrs of development the adgf- mutant shows increased expression of the prestalk cell markers ecmA and ecmB and reduced expression of the prespore marker pspA. In synergy experiments with a majority of wildtype, these cells will sort to the tip of the forming slug, showing that the differentiation defect is cell autonomous (Fig 9). This is interesting but needs further work to obtain more mechanistic insight into why a mutant with a strong tip/stalk differentiation tendency fails to make a tip. Here again, knowing which cells express ADGF would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The adgf mutant shows increased prestalk marker expression in the mound but do not form a tip. It is well known that several mound arrest mutants form differentiated cells but are blocked in development with no tips (Carrin et al., 1994). This is addressed in the discussions (539). To address whether adgf expression is cell type-specific, prestalk and prespore cells will be separated by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), and thereafter, adgf expression will be examined in each population.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(17) The observed large mound phenotype could as suggested possibly be explained by the low ctn, smlA, and high cadA and csA expression observed in the mutant (Figure 3). The expression of some of these genes (csA) is known to require extracellular cAMP signalling. The reported low level of acaA expression and high level of pdsA expression could suggest low levels of cAMP signalling, but there are no actual measurements of the dynamics of cAMP signalling in this mutant to confirm this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The acaA expression was examined at 8 and 12 h (Figure. 6B) and cAMP levels were measured at 12 and 16 h in the adgf mutants (Figure. 6A). Both acaA expression and cAMP levels were reduced, suggesting that cells expressing adgf regulate acaA expression and cAMP levels. This regulation, in turn, is likely to influence cAMP signaling, collective cell movement within mounds, ultimately driving tip development. Exposure to ammonia led to increased acaA expression (Figure. 7B) in in WT. Based on the comments above, cAMP levels will be measured in the mutant before and after rescue with ammonia.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(18) Furthermore, it would be useful to quantify whether ammonia addition to the mutant reverses mound size and restores any of the gene expression defects observed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ammonia treatment soon after plating or six hours after plating, had no effect on the mound size (Figure. 5G).</p>

<p>(19) There are many experimental data in the supplementary data that appear less relevant and could be omitted Figure S1, S3, S4, S7, S8, S9, S10.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure S8, S9, S10 are omitted. We would like to retain the other figures</p>
<p>Figure S1 (now Figure. S2): It is widely believed that ammonia comes from protein (White and Sussman, 1961; Hames and Ashworth, 1974; Schindler and Sussman, 1977) and RNA (Walsh and Wright, 1978) catabolism. Figure. S2 shows no significant difference in protein and RNA levels between WT and adgf mutant strains, suggesting that adenosine deaminaserelated growth factor (ADGF) activity serves as a major source of ammonia and plays a crucial role in tip organizer development in Dictyostelium. Thus, it is important to retain this figure.</p>
<p>Figure S3 (now Figure. S4): The figure shows the treatment of various mound arrest mutants and multiple tip mutants with ADA enzyme and DCF, respectively, to investigate the pathway through which adgf functions. Additionally, it includes the rescue of the histidine kinase mutant dhkD with ammonia, indicating that dhkD acts upstream of adgf via ammonia signalling. Therefore, it is important to retain this figure.</p>
<p>Figure S4 (now Figure. S5): This figure represents the developmental phenotype of other deaminase mutants. Unlike adgf mutants, mutations in other deaminases do not result in complete mound arrest, despite some of these genes exhibiting strong expression during development. This underscores the critical role of adenosine deamination in tip formation. Therefore, let this figure be retained.</p>
<p>Figure S7 (now Figure. S8): Figure S8 presents the transcriptomic profile of ADGF during gastrulation and pre-gastrulation stages across different organisms, indicating that ADA/ADGF is consistently expressed during gastrulation in several vertebrates (Pijuan-Sala et al., 2019; Tyser et al., 2021). Notably, the process of gastrulation in higher organisms shares remarkable similarities with collective cell movement within the Dictyostelium mound (Weijer, 2009), suggesting a previously overlooked role of ammonia in organizer development. This implies that ADA may play a fundamental role in regulating morphogenesis across species, including Dictyostelium and vertebrates. Therefore, we would like to retain this figure.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(20). Given the current state of knowledge, speculation about the possible role of ADGF in organiser function in amniotes seems far-fetched. It is worth noting that the streak is not equivalent to the organiser. The discussion would benefit from limiting itself to the key results and implications.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The discussion is revised accordingly by removing the speculative role of ADGF in organizer function in amniotes. The lines “It is likely that ADA plays a conserved, fundamental role in regulating morphogenesis in Dictyostelium and other organisms including vertebrates” have been removed.</p>
