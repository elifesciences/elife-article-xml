<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that can be sensed by T cells, which are essential for the control of infection. In comparison to viral infections, Mtb antigens are relatively rare and hence, challenging to sample. Specialized antigen presentation pathways enable the presentation of such scarce antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which are, thus, uniquely poised to survey intracellular environments. A subset of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells prevalent in the airways, known as mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, can be activated through the presentation of Mtb antigens via the MHC class I-related protein 1 (MR1) molecule. Prior work demonstrates that endosomal calcium signaling is critical for MR1-mediated presentation of Mtb-derived antigens. Here, we show that the calcium-sensing trafficking proteins Synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and Syt7 specifically promote MAIT cell activation in response to Mtb-infected cells. In bronchial epithelial cells, Syt1 and Syt7 localize to late endo-lysosomes and MR1 vesicles. Loss of Syt1 and Syt7 results in enlarged MR1 vesicles and an increased number of MR1 vesicles in close proximity to Mtb-containing vacuoles during infection. This study identifies a novel pathway in which Syt1 and Syt7 facilitate the translocation of MR1 from Mtb-containing vacuoles, potentially to the cell surface for antigen presentation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide with an estimated 10.8 million infections and 1.25 million deaths in 2023<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. TB is caused by the bacillus <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), an intracellular pathogen that invades and replicates within host cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Unlike viruses, which hijack host machinery to synthesize viral proteins in the cytosol, Mtb antigens are inherently limited. To overcome this limitation, and because Mtb primarily resides within membrane-bound phagosomes, the immune system utilizes multiple pathways to sample distinct subcellular compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, for instance, can recognize Mtb-derived antigens and eliminate infected cells through specialized antigen processing and presentation mechanisms in myeloid cells as well as the airway epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Specifically, a subset of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells prevalent in the airways, known as mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, detects intracellular infections via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related protein 1 (MR1) molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. MAIT cells rapidly respond to infections, produce proinflammatory cytokines upon activation, and promote antimicrobial activity to control infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, understanding the specialized processing of Mtb antigens and their presentation by the MR1 molecule could contribute towards the development of effective vaccines and targeted therapies.</p>
<p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells recognize intracellular antigens presented by HLA-Ia and HLA-Ib. While HLA-Ia activates peptide-specific T cells restricted by a specific allele, HLA-Ib presents non-peptide antigens and interacts with donor-unrestricted T cells that recognize a broad spectrum of antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. MR1 is an evolutionarily conserved HLA-Ib molecule widely expressed in nucleated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Unlike other HLA-Ib molecules, MR1 presents small molecule metabolites derived from the microbial riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, including those from pathogens such as Mtb, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar <italic>typhimurium,</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Although 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-d-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU) is the most potent MR1 ligand identified, recent studies show that MR1 presents diverse ligands including those beyond the riboflavin pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. For example, MAIT cells recognize infection with <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic>, a microbe that cannot produce riboflavin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, MR1 can present host-derived bile acid metabolites, synthetic ligands, vitamin B6-derived compounds, nucleobase adducts, cigarette smoke components, derivatives of phenylpropanoids, and drug metabolites, leading to MR1-restricted T cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These findings highlight the diversity and abundance of MR1 ligands beyond what was previously understood.</p>
<p>The processing and presentation of MR1 ligands depend on the intracellular source of antigens. At steady state, MR1 is minimally expressed on the cell surface and predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and late endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Upon binding to small molecule ligands such as 5-OP-RU or acetyl-6-formylpterin (Ac-6-FP), which form a covalent bond with MR1, the ligand-loaded MR1 complex exits the ER and traffics to the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, it remains unclear whether this pathway accounts for the processing and presentation of antigens derived from intracellular microbes such as Mtb. Previous work from our group demonstrates the role of endosomal proteins in MR1 trafficking and differences in the presentation of intracellular Mtb antigens compared to exogenous antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent findings show that inhibition of endosomal calcium release via two-pore channels specifically reduces MR1 presentation of Mtb antigens, but not exogenous antigens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Thus, endosomal calcium signaling may serve as a key molecular signal in MR1 antigen processing and presentation of intracellular pathogens.</p>
<p>Multiple studies show that local calcium signaling influences vesicular trafficking, including the secretion of lysosome-related organelles and retrograde transport between cellular compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Synaptotagmins (Syts) are calcium-sensing trafficking proteins that localize to vesicles and mediate membrane fusion events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Syt1, which is highly enriched in neurons, facilitates vesicle exocytosis for neurotransmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In contrast, Syt7 is broadly expressed and localizes to late endosomes and lysosomes in macrophages and dendritic cells, where it mediates the translocation of MHC class II molecules from late endosomes to the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Syts act as part of the soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, which includes vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), Syntaxin, and synaptosome-associated protein. The interaction among these SNARE proteins is essential for membrane fusion and intracellular membrane trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that Syts may act as downstream effectors of localized calcium release. The formation of SNARE complexes facilitates vesicle fusion within endosomal compartments or with the plasma membrane, highlighting their potential role in MR1 antigen presentation.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that Syt1 and Syt7 specifically mediate MR1 presentation of Mtb-derived antigens. Loss of Syt1 and Syt7 disrupts cellular distribution and trafficking of MR1 during intracellular Mtb infection, hindering the translocation of the MR1 molecule from Mtb-containing vacuoles, potentially, to the cell surface for antigen presentation. This study highlights a novel role of Syt1 and Syt7 in MR1 trafficking for the presentation of Mtb antigens and provides critical insights into how the immune system samples and presents intracellular microbes.</p>

<title>Syt1 and Syt7 specifically mediate MR1 presentation of intracellular Mtb in epithelial cells</title>
<p>Based on the known function of Syts in vesicle exocytosis and as calcium sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that Syts play a role in MR1-dependent antigen presentation. Among 17 Syt isoforms, Syt1 and Syt7 are the most widely studied Syts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We first defined the expression of Syt1 and Syt7, two calcium-sensing Syts, in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells as well as differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells. Syt1 and Syt7 transcripts were expressed in both cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). While we previously found that small-interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of Syt7 reduced MR1-mediated presentation of Mtb in BEAS-2B cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, we sought to further define the role of these proteins in the presentation of mycobacterial antigens. As a result, we generated Syt1 and Syt7 knockout (KO) BEAS-2B cells using a lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9 system. We confirmed the gene knockout efficiency in clonal cell lines through Sanger sequencing and used the Inference of CRISPR Editing (ICE) tool to calculate editing efficiency and percent indel distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. The editing efficiency was 97% for Syt1 with -1 and -21 indel deletions. For Syt7, the editing efficiency was 96% with -14 and -15 indel deletions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1b</xref>). There was no observed cell toxicity in these clonal cell lines. Then, to determine the functional role of Syt1 and Syt7 in antigen presentation, we measured IFN-γ release from human T cell clones co-cultured with Mtb-infected BEAS-2B cells. We found that both Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B cells showed a decrease in MR1 presentation of Mtb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1c</xref>). To confirm that the degree of intracellular infection was not impacted by genetic deletion of Syt1 and Syt7, we used an HLA-B45-restricted T cell clone specific for the Mtb peptide CFP10<sub>2-9.</sub> Here, we did not observe any differences in the presentation of Mtb-derived antigen. Also, as controls for exogenously delivered antigens, there were no changes in presentation of <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (Msmeg) supernatant or the CFP10<sub>2-9</sub> peptide to the MAIT cell or the HLA-B45-restricted T cell clone, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1d</xref>). These findings show that genetic deletion of Syt1 and Syt7 specifically inhibited MR1 presentation of intracellular Mtb while leaving HLA-Ia (HLA-B45) presentation and presentation of exogenous antigens intact.</p>

<p>To further investigate if Syt1 and Syt7 contribute to an MR1 endosomal pathway involving recycling endosomes, we used a prodrug of 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU) as an antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. 5-A-RU is a precursor of 5-OP-RU, a highly potent MR1 ligand that is unstable without the formation of an MR1-antigen complex. While 5-A-RU is also unstable, a recently developed 5-A-RU prodrug exhibits greater stability. This prodrug requires enzymatic cleavage in acidic compartments for loading to occur in recycling endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. We found that deletion of Syt1 or Syt7 in BEAS-2B cells did not affect 5-A-RU prodrug presentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1e</xref>). Therefore, Syt1 and Syt7 are selectively involved in MR1 presentation of Mtb-derived antigens discrete from other MR1 endosomal antigen presentation pathways.</p>

<title>Syt1 and Syt7 do not affect Mtb uptake and growth</title>
<p>Prior publications have demonstrated that Syt7 can facilitate phagocytosis in macrophages, but does not affect phagocytic ability in dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. To examine whether Syt1 and Syt7 play a role in the uptake of Mtb in bronchial epithelial cells, we used an auxotrophic strain of Mtb (AuxMtb). AuxMtb is an attenuated strain of the virulent H37Rv Mtb that retains the region of difference 1 (RD1) locus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. RD1 encodes for ESAT-6 and CFP-10, which create pores and lyse phagosomes as in H37Rv Mtb. We further modified AuxMtb into a live/dead reporter strain, mEmeraldRFP-AuxMtb, which constitutively expresses mEmerald and tetracycline-inducible RFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. To assess uptake, we measured the percentage of live GFP<sup>+</sup> cells after overnight infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2a-b</xref>). There were no significant differences in AuxMtb uptake between Syt1 and Syt7 KO and wildtype BEAS-2B cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2c</xref>). To determine the viability of intracellular Mtb, we conducted colony-forming unit (CFU) assays in lysed cells after overnight infection. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2d</xref>, we observed no statistical differences in Mtb viability and growth. Lastly, we tested whether there was a change in MR1 expression in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells and we found no differences in <italic>Mr1</italic> transcripts by RT-qPCR compared to wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). These findings suggest that Syt1 and Syt7 influence antigen presentation independently of effects on Mtb uptake, Mtb growth, or <italic>Mr1</italic> transcript levels.</p>

As Syt1 and Syt7 are expressed in differentiated monocytic THP-1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1a</xref>), we generated Syt1 and Syt7 KO THP-1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. We confirmed knockout efficiency using Sanger sequencing and the ICE analysis tool. The editing efficiency was 95% for Syt1 with -1 and -20 indel deletions and 100% for Syt7 with -16 indel deletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3a</xref>). To identify the functional role of Syt1 and Syt7 in macrophages for MR1 presentation, we differentiated Syt1 and Syt7 KO THP-1 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and measured T cell-dependent IFN-γ release. We found that the genetic deletion of Syt1 and Syt7 in THP-1 cells also resulted in a decrease in MR1 presentation of Mtb, while we observed no changes in the presentation of Msmeg supernatant compared to wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3b-c</xref>). Due to HLA mismatch, we were not able to include controls for HLA-Ia and CFP10<sub>2-9</sub> peptide. However, these findings indicate that Syt1 and Syt7 also specifically promote MR1 presentation of Mtb and not exogenous antigen in professional antigen presenting cells.</p>

<title>Syt11 and ER-associated Esyt1 and Esyt2 do not selectively affect MR1 presentation of Mtb</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that Syt1 and Syt7 specifically mediate MR1 presentation of Mtb, we investigated additional calcium-related trafficking proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>.

We found that Syt11, Esyt1, and Esyt2 were highly expressed in BEAS-2B cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4a</xref>). To determine their roles in MR1 presentation, we transfected BEAS-2B cells with siRNAs targeting <italic>Syt11</italic>, <italic>Esyt1</italic>, or <italic>Esyt2</italic> and confirmed over 80% reduction in mRNA transcripts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4b</xref>). Co-culture with human T cell clones and measurement of T cell-dependent IFN-γ release revealed three distinct phenotypes. Syt11 knock-down increased MR1 presentation of Msmeg supernatant but had no effect on MR1 presentation of Mtb (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4c</xref>). In contrast, Esyt2 knockdown reduced MR1 presentation of both Mtb and Msmeg supernatant, while Esyt1 knockdown had no effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4d-e</xref>). Interestingly, the impact of Esyt2 knockdown on MR1 presentation was similar to that of Syntaxin 18 knockdown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, both of which localize to the ER and influence MR1 presentation of exogenous ligands and intracellular Mtb. Moreover, knockdown of these trafficking proteins did not alter HLA-B45 antigen presentation, indicating specific involvement of Syt11 and Esyt2 in MR1 presentation and distinguishing them from traditional HLA-Ia pathways (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4c-e</xref>). These findings demonstrate that among the calcium-related trafficking proteins we investigated, Syt1 and Syt7 uniquely contribute to the MR1 presentation of Mtb without affecting exogenous antigen presentation.</p>

<title>Syt1 and Syt7 localize in late endo-lysosomes and MR1 vesicles</title>

<title>Absence of Syt1 and Syt7 alters MR1 cellular distribution in lysosomal compartments</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Syt1 and Syt7 in MR1 vesicular trafficking and cellular distribution, we generated Syt1 and Syt7 KO in BEAS-2B MR1KO cells stably transduced with a doxycycline-inducible MR1-GFP plasmid (BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. We validated knockout efficiency using Sanger sequencing and the ICE tool (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6a</xref>). Similar to wildtype BEAS-2B cells, Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells exhibited a decrease in MR1 presentation of Mtb (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6b</xref>). Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells also demonstrated a small but statistically significant reduction in HLA-B45 presentation of Mtb. However, there was a more pronounced effect in MR1-mediated antigen presentation in Syt7 KO cells compared to WT. We hypothesized that the decreased MR1-mediated presentation of Mtb antigen could be due to decreased MR1 surface translocation in the presence of a ligand. To test this, we used Ac-6-FP, a potent MR1 ligand that induces MR1 translocation from the ER to the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Live-cell imaging showed no differences in MR1 cellular distribution in the presence or absence of Ac-6-FP between WT, Syt1, and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells as MR1 translocated from the ER and vesicles to the cell surface as expected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6c</xref>). Similarly, Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells did not alter MR1 surface translocation and HLA-Ia expression in the presence or absence of Ac-6-FP when measured by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6d</xref>). These findings suggest that Syt1 and Syt7 are not involved in the ER pathway of MR1 presentation of exogenous ligands and indicate that the reduction in MR1-mediated presentation of Mtb antigen in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells is independent of ER-mediated MR1 surface translocation.</p>

<p>We further explored MR1 cellular distribution in Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells by live-cell imaging. Interestingly, Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells exhibited enlargement of MR1 vesicles and an accumulation of vesicles in close proximity to one other (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6e</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed a significant increase in the area of larger MR1 vesicles in Syt1 (∼60%) and Syt7 (∼35%) KO cells compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6f</xref>). Given that Syt1, Syt7, and MR1 co-localize with markers associated with late endosomes (Rab7a) and lysosomes (LAMP1) at steady state, we hypothesized that these larger and accumulated MR1 collections localized to lysosomal compartments. To test this, we infected Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells with baculoviruses expressing RFP in either early endosomes (Rab5a) or lysosomes (LAMP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. We found that the larger MR1 vesicles in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells co-localized more with LAMP1 than Rab5a, similar to WT cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6g-h</xref>).

<title>Syt1 and Syt7 mediate trafficking of MR1 vesicles from the Mtb-containing vacuole</title>
<p>To understand whether Syt1 and Syt7 are involved in trafficking MR1 vesicles for antigen presentation during intracellular Mtb infection, we conducted live-cell imaging to visualize Mtb-containing vacuoles. Using Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells, we infected the cells with wildtype AuxMtb labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 NHS ester dye. Live-cell imaging showed that MR1 vesicles accumulated near Mtb-containing vacuoles in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7a</xref>). Quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the number of MR1 vesicles within 1 µm of AuxMtb for Syt1 (1.13 ± 0.46) and Syt7 KO (1.31 ± 0.46) cells compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7b</xref>). However, there were no significant differences in the total number or average speed of MR1 vesicles between WT, Syt1, and Syt7 KO cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7c</xref>). Furthermore, the surface of MR1 vesicles in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells showed a 3-fold increase in overlap area with Mtb surfaces (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7d</xref>). To confirm the increased number and surface overlap of MR1 vesicles with Mtb-containing vacuoles of Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells, we quantified MR1 expression within phagolysosomes using flow organellometry. Our lab previously established this method for separating and phenotyping subcellular compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Flow organellometry enables separation of plasma membrane, ER, lysosomes, and phagosomes in a 27% Percoll gradient. Phagosomes are detected in the last few subcellular fractions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. We infected WT, Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B:TET-MR1GFP cells overnight with wildtype AuxMtb labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 NHS ester dye. We performed flow organellometry to separate phagosomes from other subcellular fractions and identified enrichment of Mtb-containing vacuoles in fractions 42-50 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7e-f</xref>). When comparing MR1 expression within the fractions containing the highest percentage of Mtb<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> vesicles, Syt7 KO cells showed about 25% increase in the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of MR1 compared to WT cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7g</xref>). Although these findings do not determine the exact location of MR1 loading, they support a model whereby Syt1 and Syt7 transport MR1 vesicles, whether loaded or unloaded, from the Mtb-containing vacuoles and to the cell surface for antigen presentation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a unique role in surveilling intracellular environments. Sampling antigens from intracellular microbes is challenging due to their compartmentalization in membrane-bound organelles, low antigen concentrations, and pathogen immune evasion strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Thus, the immune system utilizes a specialized mechanism to process and present internalized microbes in the context of HLA-Ia in order to elicit strong cytotoxic T cell responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Complementing ER-based HLA-Ia-mediated antigen presentation, this highly efficient pathway surveys phagosomes, where foreign antigens are most enriched as they are the first compartment encountered by intracellular microbes. Similarly, HLA-Ib antigen presenting molecules sense and load unique antigens from different subcellular compartments. For example, HLA-E can process and load antigens in the phagosomes, whereas different CD1 isoforms have distinct antigen sources and loading compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the known MR1 ligands are small, hydrophilic, and unstable under physiological conditions, which are unlikely to be easily diffused or transported between subcellular compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Accordingly, this study highlights a distinct MR1 endosomal antigen presentation pathway mediated by Syt1 and Syt7 during intracellular Mtb infection and suggests MR1 antigen sampling could occur in Mtb-containing vacuoles.</p>
<p>Although the ER pathway of MR1 presentation is well characterized, this pathway does not fully address processing and presentation of intracellular microbes. McWilliam and colleagues show that MR1 mainly resides in the ER where the loading of exogenous ligand occurs. Small ligands such as 5-OP-RU and Ac-6-FP form a Schiff base bond with lysine 43 of MR1, serving as a molecular signal for MR1 to egress the ER and reach the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Also, treatment with Brefeldin A results in diminished recognition of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar <italic>typhimurium</italic>, implying transport of loaded MR1 from the ER to the cell surface or MR1 unable to reach the endosomes for loading. Further study has also identified interactions between MR1 and ER-associated chaperone proteins, such as TAPBPR and tapasin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, these studies primarily use hematopoietic C1R cells in conjunction with small MR1 ligands added to the extracellular culture medium. Therefore, the mechanisms of MR1 processing and presentation in Mtb-infected antigen presenting cells remain incompletely understood. Further investigation is needed to determine whether this pathway is universal for all intracellular microbes, how it varies across different cell types, and whether specific chaperone proteins assist in antigen loading. These discoveries will extend our understanding of diverse pathways involved in MR1 processing and presentation.</p>
<p>In the endosomal pathway of MR1 presentation, endosomal trafficking proteins and calcium signaling within endosomal compartments facilitate MR1 trafficking and presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Studies investigating the role of endosomal proteins and using exogenously derived antigens and intracellular Mtb infection show multiple MR1 antigen presentation pathways, which are influenced by the type and method of antigen delivery. For instance, VAMP4 knockdown disrupts MR1 presentation of Mtb, while Syntaxin 4 only affects presentation of Msmeg supernatant in bronchial epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Additionally, ligand exchange of pre-loaded MR1 occurs in post-ER compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Moreover, recent evidence shows endosomal calcium signaling as a potential mechanism to detect intracellular infection. Inhibition of endosomal calcium release from two-pore channels specifically decreases MR1 presentation of Mtb in human dendritic cells, setting this pathway apart from other pathways of MR1 antigen presentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>As calcium-sensing endosomal trafficking proteins, Syt1 and Syt7 are potential downstream effectors of endosomal calcium release. Syts are membrane-bound proteins in vesicles that mediate docking and fusion to exquisitely regulate exocytosis of synaptic vesicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. While Syts are extensively studied in presynaptic neurotransmitter release, recent evidence highlights broader roles for Syt1 and Syt7 in epithelial and antigen presenting cells. Syt1 is expressed in large dense core vesicles of adrenal chromaffin cells, where it regulates hormone release into the bloodstream<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. Loss of Syt1 in chromaffin cells results in delayed and reduced vesicle exocytosis. Syt7, on the other hand, is broadly expressed across human tissues compared to Syt1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Syt7 localizes to dense lysosomes in rat kidney cells, where its main function is to mediate lysosomal exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Further studies expand the role of Syt7 to immune cells, such as bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. In macrophages, Syt7 is essential for efficient phagocytosis and the delivery of lysosomes to nascent phagosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In dendritic cells, however, Syt7 deletion does not affect phagocytosis, but significantly delays the translocation of MHC class II to the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that this controlled regulation of exocytosis by Syt1 and Syt7 may play a role in this specialized mechanism of surveilling intracellular microbes by MR1.</p>
<p>The present study supports a unique pathway, in which Syt1 and Syt7 specifically mediate MR1 presentation during intracellular Mtb infection. HLA-Ia presentation of intracellular Mtb as well as presentation of exogenously derived antigens remained intact upon genetic deletion of Syt1 and Syt7. To understand the mechanism, we defined the localization of Syt1 and Syt7 in late endosomes and lysosomes of bronchial epithelial cells. Notably, we did not observe significant differences in Mtb uptake in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells, similar to previous findings showing that loss of Syt7 does not affect phagocytosis in dendritic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. However, our Mtb uptake assay involved overnight infections, in which other Syt proteins might compensate for the loss of Syt1 and Syt7 in facilitating phagocytosis. Importantly, the absence of Syt1 and Syt7 in bronchial epithelial cells altered MR1 cellular distribution. Larger MR1 vesicles that accumulated in close proximity to one another were LAMP1<sup>+</sup>, suggesting impaired MR1 vesicle trafficking from lysosomal compartments. This observation aligned with previous studies showing that Syt7 mobilizes lysosomal membrane to other compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Although Czibener and colleagues showed that Syt7 is recruited to nascent phagosomes in macrophages during zymosan particle uptake, their follow-up studies demonstrated a different role in dendritic cells. Specifically, in mature dendritic cells, Syt7 translocated to the plasma membrane, and its absence delayed translocation of MHC Class II to the cell surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Consistent with these findings, we observed an increase in the number of MR1 vesicles near Mtb-containing vacuoles by fluorescent microscopy and enhanced MR1 expression in Mtb<sup>+</sup>LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments via flow organellometry in Syt1 and Syt7 KO cells. Therefore, we postulate the role of Syt1 and Syt7 in delivering MR1-Mtb antigen complexes from Mtb-containing vacuoles to the cell surface for antigen presentation.</p>
<p>The current work extends our understanding of sampling intracellular microbes through a distinct MR1 endosomal pathway. Inhibition of endosomal calcium release in human dendritic cells and deletion of Syt1 and Syt7 in bronchial epithelial and differentiated monocytic cells all specifically reduce MR1 presentation of Mtb. This suggests that Syt1 and Syt7 act as downstream effectors of endosomal calcium signaling, which facilitate MR1 presentation of Mtb-derived antigens to activate MAIT cells. Moreover, these findings continue to support the existence of distinct MR1 antigen presentation pathways that differ by the type and method of antigen delivery. The endosomal pathway of MR1 presentation involving calcium signaling specifically affects MR1 presentation of Mtb without impacting the ER pathway and other endosomal pathways, reinforcing a specialized mechanism in surveying intracellular microbes. Furthermore, this study expands the role of Syts beyond synaptic vesicle exocytosis, demonstrating their function in antigen presentation during intracellular infection. Our data support a model in which Syt1 and Syt7 mediate the final step in a highly efficient pathway that enables the presentation of MR1-Mtb antigen complexes at the cell surface.</p>
<p>While this study highlights the unique roles of Syt1 and Syt7 in a specialized mechanism of sensing intracellular Mtb, several questions remain. In particular, the potential compensatory roles of other Syt family members and the function of calcium binding domains in antigen presentation warrant further investigation. Follow up studies could identify other SNARE proteins involved in this pathway. Furthermore, our findings suggest that antigen loading may occur in Mtb-containing vacuoles due to their proximity to and the fact that phagosomes are the initial compartments to acquire intracellular microbes. However, additional investigation is needed to determine the exact location of Mtb antigen loading and explore the presence of chaperone proteins in specific subcellular compartments. Overall, this study establishes a foundation for exploring calcium-sensitive endosomal proteins in antigen presentation and its broader implications in sampling intracellular microbes.</p>

<title>Bacterial Strains and Cell Lines</title>
<p>H37Rv <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) strain, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 Broth supplemented with Middlebrook ADC (BD), 0.05% Tween-80 (OmniPur), and 0.5% glycerol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Mtb was used from frozen glycerol stocks by passaging 20 times through a tuberculin syringe (BD) with a 27-gauge needle before infection. Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) of 8 was used for IFN-γ ELISpot assays. ΔleuD ΔpanCD double auxotroph Mtb (AuxMtb), an attenuated strain of H37Rv Mtb, was gifted by Dr. William Jacobs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. A modification of AuxMtb was generated to constitutively express the green fluorescent protein mEmerald and the tetracycline (tet)-inducible red fluorescent protein (mEmeraldRFP-AuxMtb)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. MOIs of 5 (for fluorescence microscopy), 8 (for Mtb uptake assay), and 10 (for flow organellometry assay) were used. <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (Msmeg, mc<sup>2</sup>155 strain) supernatant was obtained by culturing Msmeg for 24 hours in 7H9 broth, passing the supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter, and concentrating it using a 10kDa Amicon filter (Millipore Sigma). Msmeg supernatant was used from frozen aliquots stored at -80°C.</p>
<p>BEAS-2B and THP-1 cells were obtained from ATCC. BEAS-2B cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (GeminiBio) and L-Glutamine (Gibco). THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and L-Glutamine. Polyclonal BEAS-2B:tetMR1-GFP cells were developed by transducing BEAS-2B cells with tet-inducible MR1-GFP as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. BEAS-2B MR1KO:tetMR1-GFP clone D4 was generated by reconstituting a clonal BEAS-2B MR1 KO cell line with a lentiviral vector encoding GFP-tagged MR1A under a tet-inducible promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. The polyclonal cell line was sorted based on GFP expression, and individual clonal lines were generated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Due to the constitutive expression of Cas9 and the sgRNA targeting MR1, the MR1 sequence at each insertion of the tetMR1-GFP cassette into the genome was edited. CRISPR editing resulted in a V12I substitution for clone D4, which is phenotypically similar to cell lines over-expressing WT MR1A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Of note, bovine and porcine MR1 have an I at this position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Clone D4 was then used to generate Syt1 and Syt7 KO BEAS-2B MR1KO:tetMR1-GFP cells.</p>

<p>Co-localizations were analyzed using the “Spots” function and “spots colocalization” MatLab Xtension module on Imaris 7 (Bitplane). Area of MR1 vesicles were segregated into small (≤1 µm<sup>2</sup>) and large vesicle (&gt;1 µm<sup>2</sup>) using the “Surfaces” function based on MR1-GFP fluorescence intensity. For each cell, areas of small and large MR1 vesicles were averaged. Surface overlaps between MR1 and AuxMtb for each cell were analyzed using the “Surfaces” function and “overlapped area ratio.” Total number and average speed of MR1 vesicles for each cell were analyzed using the “Spots” function. Number of MR1 vesicles within 1 µm of Mtb was enumerated by first defining MR1 vesicles as “Spots” and Mtb as “Surfaces.” Then, MR1 vesicles were classified into two groups (≤1 µm and &gt;1 µm) using “shortest distance to surface” as a filter.

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study examines the contribution of synaptotagmin 1 and synaptotagmin 7 to metabolite antigen presentation to mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells; it begins to address a critical gap in our understanding of the antigen presentation mechanisms to these cells. Strengths of the study include the use of Mtb to study the dynamics of antigen presentation to MAIT cells instead of a synthetic antigen. However, the strength of the evidence to support the conclusion is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>. The conclusions could be enhanced by additional dissection of some of the cell biological events that lead to antigen presentation by MR1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Synaptotagmin 1 and Synaptotagmin 7 promote MR1-mediated presentation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens&quot;, authored by Kim et al., showed that the calcium-sensing trafficking proteins Synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and Syt7 specifically promote (are critical for) MAIT cell activation in response to Mtb-infected bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (Fig. 1) and monocyte-like cell line THP-1 (Figure 3) . This work also showed co-localization of Syt1 and Syt7 with Rab7a and Lamp1, but not with Rab5a (Figure 5). Loss of Syt1 and Syt7 resulted in a larger area of MR1 vesicles (Figure 6f) and an increased number of MR1 vesicles in close proximity to an Auxotrophic Mtb-containing vacuoles during infection (Figure 7ab). Moreover, flow organellometry was used to separate phagosomes from other subcellular fractions and identify enrichment of auxotrophic Mtb-containing vacuoles in fractions 42-50, which were enriched with Lamp1+ vacuoles or phagosomes (Figures 7e-f).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work nicely associated Syt1 and Syt7 with late endocytic compartments and Mtb+ vacuoles. Gene editing of Syt1 and Syt7 loci of bronchial epithelial and monocyte-like cells supported Syt1 and Syt7 facilitated maintaining a normal level of antigen presentation for MAIT cell activation in Mtb infection. Imaging analyses further supported that Syt1 and Syt7 mutants enhanced the overlaps of MR1 with Mtb fluorescence, and the MR1 proximity with Mtb-infected vacuoles, suggesting that Syt1 and Syt7 proteins help antigen presentation in Mtb infection for MAIT activation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Additional data are needed to support the conclusion, &quot;identify a novel pathway in which Syt1 and Syt7 facilitate the translocation of MR1 from Mtb-containing vacuoles&quot; and some pieces of other evidence may be seen by some to contradict this conclusion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study demonstrates that calcium-sensing trafficking proteins Synaptotagmin (Syt) 1 and Syt7 are involved in the efficient presentation of mycobacterial antigens by MR1 during M. tuberculosis infection.</p>
<p>This is achieved by creating antigen-presenting cells in which the Syt1 and Syt7 genes are knocked out. These mutated cell lines show significantly reduced stimulation of MAIT cells, while their stimulation of HLA class I-restricted T cells remains unchanged. Syt1 and Syt7 co-localize in a late endo-lysosomal compartment where MR1 molecules are also located, near M. tuberculosis-containing vacuoles.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work uncovers a new aspect of how mycobacterial antigens generated during infection are presented. The finding that Syt1 and Syt7 are relevant for final MR1 surface expression and presentation to MR1-restricted T cells is novel and adds valuable information to this process.</p>
<p>The experiments include all necessary controls and convincingly validate the role of Syt1 and Syt7.</p>
<p>Another key point is that these proteins are essential during infection, but they are not significant when an exogenous synthetic antigen is used in the experiments. This emphasizes the importance of studying infection as a physiological context for antigen presentation to MAIT cells.</p>
<p>An additional relevant aspect is that the study reveals the existence of different MR1 antigen presentation pathways, which differ from the endoplasmic reticulum or endosomal pathways that are typical for MHC-presented peptides.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The reduced MAIT cell response observed with Syt1 and Syt7-deficient cell lines is statistically significant but not completely abolished. This may suggest that only some MR1-loaded molecules depend on these two Syt proteins. Further research is needed to determine whether, during persistent M. tuberculosis infection, enough MR1-loaded molecules are produced and transported to the plasma membrane to sufficiently stimulate MAIT cells.</p>
<p>The study proposes that other Syt proteins might also play a role, as outlined by the authors. However, exploring potential redundant mechanisms that facilitate MR1 loading with antigens remains a challenging task.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the submitted manuscript, the authors investigate the role of Synaptotagmins (Syt1) and (Syt7) in MR1 presentation of MtB.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In the first series of experiments, the authors determined that knocking down Syt1 and Sy7 in antigen-presenting cells decreases IFN-γ production following cellular infection with Mtb. These experiments are well performed and controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Next, they aim to mechanistically investigate how Syt1 and Syt7 affect MtB presentation. In particular, they focus on MR1, a non-classical MHC-I molecule known to present endogenous and exogenous metabolites, including MtB metabolites.</p>
<p>Results from these next series of experiments are less clear. Firstly, they show that knocking down Syt1 and Sy7 does not change MtB phagocytosis as well as MR1 ER-plasma membrane translocation. Based on this, they suggest that Syt1 and Syt7 may affect MR1 trafficking in endosomal compartments. However, neither subcellular compartment analysis nor flow organelleometry clearly establishes the role of Syt1 and Syt7 in MtB trafficking.</p>
<p>Altogether, the notion that Synaptotagmins facilitate MR1 interaction with Mtb-containing compartments and its vesicular transport was already known. As such, the manuscript should add additional insight on where/how the interaction occurs. The reviewer is left with the notion that Syt1 and Sy7 may affect MR1 presentation, facilitating the trafficking of MR1 vesicles from endosomal compartments to either the cell surface or other endosomal compartments. The analysis is observational and additional data or discussion could address what the insight gained beyond what is already known from the literature.</p>
