<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Apical constriction is a basic mechanism for epithelial morphogenesis, making columnar cells into wedge shape and bending a flat cell sheet. It has long been thought that an apically localized myosin generates a contractile force and drives the cell deformation. However, when we tested the increased apical surface contractility in a cellular Potts model simulation, the constriction increased pressure inside the cell and pushed its lateral surface outward, making the cells adopt a drop shape instead of the expected wedge shape. To keep the lateral surface straight, we considered an alternative model in which the cell shape was determined by cell membrane elasticity and endocytosis, and the increased pressure is balanced among the cells. The cellular Potts model simulation succeeded in reproducing the apical constriction, and it also suggested that a too strong apical surface tension might prevent the tissue invagination.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The apical constriction is a general and fundamental process to bend or invaginate a flat epithelial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>). In the flat epithelium, cells are in a columnar shape with apical-basal polarity. During the apical constriction, the columnar cells decrease their apical surface and adopt a wedge shape, inducing a small angle between its opposite lateral surfaces. This cellular deformation is synchronized in a cluster of cells, and the angle of the lateral surfaces is summed across the cells to a larger tissue scale curve. Studies in genetics and molecular biology had revealed an involvement of the motor protein non-muscle myosin II which crosslinks and contracts the actin filament network. The actomyosin network is formed beneath the cell apical surface (cortical actomyosin) and lining apical-lateral cell-cell interface (circumferential actomyosin), linked with adherens junctions and tight junctions so that it makes a supracellular continuous structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Takeichi, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mesoderm invagination, ventral cells express transcription factors Twist and Snail which then induce expression of numerous genes including regulators of the actin and myosin, such as T48, Fog, Mist, RhoGEF2, Rho, and Rock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martin, 2020</xref>). The cortical and the circumferential actomyosin network are formed in the cells, and the cells undergo the apical constriction, while down-regulation of those regulators impaired the localization and activation of the myosin, and delayed or prevented the apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Xie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kölsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mason et al., 2013</xref>). Similar regulation of the myosin by Rho and Rock was found responsible for the apical constriction in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brodu and Casanova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Guru et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Manning et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Röper, 2012</xref>) and other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Münster et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Urbansky et al., 2016</xref>). In vertebrates, the cortical myosin was not observed but the circumferential myosin was enriched, recruited together with Rock by PDZ domain containing protein Shroom 3, which was also found responsible for the apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nishimura and Takeichi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Plageman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">McGreevy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hildebrand, 2005</xref>). Since the interruption of those pathways reduced the myosin accumulation and prevented the apical constriction, it had been modeled that the apical myosin generated a contractile force on the cell apical surface and drove the cell and tissue deformation.</p>
<p>The myosin-based model was validated by simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rauzi et al., 2013</xref>) with finite element model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Conte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perez-Mockus et al., 2017</xref>) or vertex model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Polyakov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Inoue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pérez-González et al., 2021</xref>). In the finite element model, a cell was represented by few quadrilateral elements and its cytosol was assumed to be viscous. The contractile forces on the cell apical, lateral, and basal surfaces were inferred from deformation of cells of the same representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brodland et al., 2010</xref>). The forces were varied in the simulation to show that the surface tension of the invaginated cells was more influential than those of surrounding cells, and that the invagination was robust against the variance in the force. In the vertex model, a cell was represented by a quadrilateral, polygon, or polyhedron with a surface tension on each edge or face and constraint on an area or volume inside. The differential surface tension was assigned based on the observation of myosin distribution in a modeled tissue, and varied to investigate its contribution. These studies succeeded in reproducing the apical constriction by the increased apical surface tension, and further investigated additional components, such as differential lateral and basal surface tension, boundary condition by an extracellular matrix, and compression by the surrounding cells, to make the resultant simulated deformation more similar to the modeled actual tissue.</p>
<p>Along with the cell autonomous deformation with the apical constriction, in many epithelial tissues bending and invagination were found mechanically promoted by surrounding cells. For example, actomyosin was localized to a boundary between amnioserosa and lateral epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hutson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hayes and Solon, 2017</xref>) or neural plate and epidermal ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hashimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galea et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2018</xref>). These supracellular cables draw arcs and merge at a midline like a canthus so that a contraction of the cable results in the decrease of the inner amnioserosa or neural plate apical surface. Similar supracellular myosin cables were found encircling salivary glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Röper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chung et al., 2017</xref>) and tracheal pit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ogura et al., 2018</xref>) during their invagination. In the same way as the contracting circumferential myosin belt in a cell decreasing the cell apical surface, the circular supracellular myosin cable contraction decreases the perimeter, the radius of the circle, and the area inside the circle. Also, a planar compression was proposed to be able to drive the epithelial folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brezavšček et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we revisited the driving mechanism of the apical constriction and investigated what cell physical properties were required for the cellular deformation. First we modified a cellular Potts model, which is another framework to simulate cellular tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>), so that it could represent an epithelial tissue, and simulated the effect of increased apical contractility mediated by apically localized myosin. Contrary to expectations, the cellular Potts model did not reproduce tissue invagination by the apical constriction but the cells were delaminated one-by-one from edges. By analysing a change in energy with respect to the cell shape, we found that the force to contract the cell apical surface was substantially affected by the entire cell shape. Next we considered an alternative driving mechanism for the apical constriction incorporating a cell apical surface elasticity, which might be regulated by endocytosis. It succeeded in reproducing the apical constriction and epithelial bending. In addition, the encircling supracellular myosin cable largely promoted the invagination by the apical constriction, suggesting that too high apical surface tension may keep the epithelium apical surface flat.</p>

<title>Extended cellular Potts model to simulate epithelial deformations</title>
<p>To model cellular and tissue deformations, we use the cellular Potts model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>). The model was first proposed to simulate cell sorting by assigning differential cell adhesion, which was expressed by a contact energy. In the basic cellular Potts model, cells are represented by sets of sites in a 2D lattice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), and their deformation is simulated by repeatedly updating a label on a randomly chosen site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b, b’</xref>). For a site <bold><italic>i</italic></bold>, the contact energy is calculated by ∑<sub><italic>j</italic>∈<bold><italic>N</italic></bold>(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>)</sub> <bold><italic>J</italic></bold> (σ(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>), σ(<italic>j</italic>)), where <bold><italic>N</italic></bold>(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>) is a neighborhood of <bold><italic>i</italic></bold>, σ(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>) represents a cell to which <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> belongs, and <bold><italic>J</italic></bold> defines an affinity between the cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>). The contact energy is summed among all sites to represent a surface contact energy. Later, in various studies of cell and tissue-scale phenomena, the cellular Potts model was employed with additional elements and was extended to 3D. For example, <bold><italic>Fortuna et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2020</italic></bold>) simulated a cell migration with material labels representing nucleus, cytoplasm, and lamellipodium within each cell. To simulate morphogenesis of an epithelial tissue with apico-basally polarized cells, the intracellular material labels were utilized to represent cell apical surface, lateral cell-cell junction, and basal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belmonte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adhyapok et al., 2021</xref>). Also, the cellular Potts model was combined with a finite element model so that it simulated how cells generated and were pulled by stress/strain on the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">van Oers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Rens and Merks, 2017</xref>).</p>

<p>To simulate the epithelial tissue morphogenesis, we developed a new cellular Potts model with the cell apical-basal polarity. The monolayer tissue was represented in a 2D lattice in order to save on computational cost, and while the general 2D cellular Potts model cast the epithelium plane to the lattice, our model cast the tissue section perpendicular to the plane. In this model, the cell was represented by a set of sites labeled with a cell identity σ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>), a cell type, and a cytosol τ corresponding to the cell type (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). The cell’s perimeter was partitioned automatically based on adjacency with other cells, and it was marked as apical, lateral, basal. Also, apico-lateral sites were marked as a location for the adherens junction. This cell representation also cast the vertical section of the cell. Therefore the interior area of the cell corresponded with a body of the cell, and a perimeter of the cell corresponded with the cell surface. Likewise the apical, lateral, and basal parts of the perimeter corresponded with the apical surface, cell-cell interface, and the basal surface of the cell respectively. Outside the epithelial cells, sites were labeled as a medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) and with materials representing an apical ECM and fluids in the apical and basal sides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). In this study, we assumed that the cell surface tension consisted of contractility and elasticity. We modeled the contractility as a constant force to decrease the surface, but not dependent on surface width or strain. We modeled the elasticity as a force proportional to the surface strain, working to return the surface to its original width. Note that in some studies the tension and the contractility are considered as equivalent, but they are distinguished in this study. In our cellular Potts model, the surface contractility was defined by the contact energy, and expressed by

where δ is the Kronecker delta, σ includes the cells and medium, τ includes the cytosols, apical ECM, and fluids, and <bold><italic>J</italic></bold> defines the contact energy between the materials τ(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>) and τ(<italic>j</italic>) when the sites <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> and <italic>j</italic> are in different cells or medium, i.e., δ(σ(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>), σ(<italic>j</italic>)) = 0. Then, the cell apical surface contractility <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> was defined by the contact energy between the cytosol and the apical side medium fluid, the lateral cell-cell junction contractility <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> was defined by the contact energy between the cytosols, and the basal surface contractility <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> was defined by the contact energy between the cytosol and the basal side medium fluid. For the surface elasticity, a perimeter length of the 2D cell was evaluated.

Note that the naming for the energy terms differs from preceding studies. For example, <bold><italic>Farhadifar et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2007</italic></bold>) named a surface energy term expressed by a proportional function “line tensions” and a term expressed by a quadratic function “contractility of the cell perimeter”. In this study, however, calling the quadratic term “contractility” would be misleading since it prevents the contraction when <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> &lt; <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>. Therefore we renamed the terms accordingly. To simulate the effect of the supracellular myosin cable encircling the invaginated cells, we added a potential energy to the model. The supracellular myosin cable is formed along the adherens junctions and pulls it horizontally toward a center of the invagination in the tissue plane. The potential energy was defined by a scalar field which made a horizontal gradient decreasing toward the center, and the scalar values for the adherens junction sites were averaged in each cell:

where λ denotes a bulk modulus, <bold><italic>A</italic></bold> represents an area of a cell, and <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub>0</sub> denotes its reference value. By combining the terms (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>), a tissue’s total energy ℋ was calculated. While the terms <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref> were included in all simulations since they were fundamental and designed in the original cellular Potts model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graner and Glazier, 1992</xref>), the other terms <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref> were optional and employed only for certain conditions. The cellular Potts model simulates the cell and tissue deformation by updating the label when it decreases ℋ, or when it increases ℋ, with a probability of <italic>e</italic><sup>−Δℋ/<italic>T</italic></sup>, where <italic>T</italic> denotes a fluctuation allowance of the system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g</xref>).</p>
<p>Before simulating the apical constriction, we first examined parameters for a stable epithelium. The energy ℋ included only the terms of the contact energy (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn1">Equation 1</xref>) and the area constraint (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn5">Equation 5</xref>), but the surface elasticity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref>) nor (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Equation 3</xref>) was not included, and thus the surface tension was determined by the contact energy. The term <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation 4</xref> was not included either. For a cell, its compression was determined by a balance between the pressure and the surface tension, i.e., the higher surface tension would compress the cell more. The bulk modulus λ was set 1, the lateral cell-cell junction contractility <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> was varied for different cell compressions, and the apical and basal surface contractilities <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> and <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> were varied proportional to <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>. When the cell basal and apical surface tensions were equal to the lateral cell-cell junction tension, cells were rounded and disconnected from each other, and the epithelium could not maintain the integrity (<xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure Supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, we assigned 2 or 4 times higher contact energy to the basal and apical surface than the lateral cell-cell junction in the following simulations.</p>

<title>Tissue deformation by increased apical contractility simulated with cellular Potts model</title>
<p>To test whether the apically localized actomyosin could drive the apical constriction, we simulated the epithelial cell monolayer with increased apical surface contractility. Some preceding studies assumed that the apical myosin generated the contractile force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Conte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perez-Mockus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pérez-González et al., 2021</xref>), while the others assumed the myosin to generate the elastic force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Polyakov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Inoue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nematbakhsh et al., 2020</xref>). It seems natural to consider that the myosin generates a force proportional to its density but not to the surface width nor the strain. For the sake of simplicity, we ignored the effect of the constriction on the apical myosin density, and discuss it later. Also, an experiment with cells cultured on a micro pattern showed that the myosin activity corresponded well to the contractility, and its effect on the elasticity, if any, was minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Labouesse et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we assigned to cells an additional apical surface contractility by setting <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> larger than <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> for the center pale blue cells. A simulation started from a flat monolayer of cells beneath the apical ECM, and was continued until resulting deformation of cells and tissue could be evaluated for success or failure of reproducing the apical constriction.</p>
<p>In contrast to the simulations in the preceding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Conte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perez-Mockus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pérez-González et al., 2021</xref>), our simulations could not reproduce the apical constriction, but cells with the increased apical surface contractility were covered by surrounding cells and delaminated one by one from edges (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref rid="video1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). When the compression <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>/<bold>Ā</bold> and the entire surface contractility was small, the covering cells were horizontally spread and their surface was extended largely during the covering. To prevent the surface expansion, we included the surface elasticity term (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn2">Equation 2</xref>). It kept the cells’ surface perimeter in a narrower range as expected, but still the center cells were delaminated and adopted similar shapes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). We also simulated deformation with the supracellular myosin cable but without the increased apical surface contractility. In the cross section, the shrinkage of the circular supracellular myosin cable was simulated with a move of adherens junction under the myosin cable toward the midline. Either with or without the surface elasticity, the center cells were covered by the pulled cells and delaminated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>

<p>These results suggest that the increased apical surface contractility and the supracellular myosin cable cannot drive the apical constriction. It was not limited to specific parameters but reproducible for various contractilities. It contradicts the current model that the apical constriction is driven by the increased contractility generated by the apically localized myosin.</p>

<title>Energy landscape with respect to cell shapes</title>
<p>To investigate the origin of the difference between the vertex model and the cellular Potts model results, we first looked into an early deformation of the cells in the cellular Potts model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a, b</xref>). It was characterized by 1) that only the edge cell shrank its apical surface, 2) that inner cells remained in the columnar shape, and 3) that a lateral surface of the edge cell was curved outward. These could be explained with a balanced apical surface contractility. For the sake of simplicity, consider a system of vertices linked by edges in a line, and the edges bear differential contractilities. For a vertex, a force exerted on the vertex is a sum of the opposing contractile forces on the linking two edges, and it will be zero when the two edges bear an equal contractility. In the same way, a force exerted on an apical cell-cell junction by the apical surface contractility was a sum of them and it would be zero when two adjacent cells bore an equal apical surface contractility. Then, a practical pulling force on the cell-cell junction by the cell apical surfaces remained only on the edge of the cells with the increased apical surface contractility (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c-e</xref>). The edge cell shrank its apical surface and consequently decreased its volume. The decrease in the volume increased the internal pressure due to the cell volume conservation, and a difference in the pressure between the contracting and non-contracting cells resulted in the lateral surface curvature.</p>

<p>Since the cellular Potts model results seemed acceptable, we next examined why the inner cells could shrink their apical surface in the vertex model by analyzing the energy with respect to cell shape. For the analysis of the cell shape in motion, we plotted a phase diagram for shapes of a single cell (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>). The cell shape was represented by vertices and edges linking the vertices, and its energy function was defined by a combination of the pressure and the surface contractility. While the conventional vertex model assumes only straight edges, we included also curved edges. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref> shows cell shapes with which the energy of the cell was at a minimum for an apical surface width and a curvature of the lateral surface. When the cell lateral surface was restricted to be straight, a plot of energy with respect to the apical surface width was well fitted by a quadratic polynomial (<italic>y</italic> = 0.0216<italic>x</italic><sup>2</sup> − 4.8409<italic>x</italic> + 5062.8, <bold><italic>R</italic></bold><sup>2</sup> = 0.9999) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g, h</xref>), indicating that the practical force <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>/<bold>Ā</bold> indicates how much cells were apico-basally compressed by the lateral surface contractility <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>/<bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> represents a ratio between the basal and lateral surface contractilities, and <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic></sub>/<bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> represents a ratio between the apical and basal surface contractilities in center pale blue five cells. There were 1000 updates between frames. to constrict the apical surface was attenuated by the deformation. Because of the attenuation, the constricting force was unbalanced between the shrunk edge cell and the inner columnar cell, and it allowed the inner cells to shrink the apical surface simultaneously. On the other hand, when the cell lateral surface was allowed to be curved and the cell changed its shape along a gradient of the energy landscape (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>), a plot of energy with respect to the apical surface was well fitted by a linear function (<italic>y</italic> = −4.3135<italic>x</italic> + 5055.3, <bold><italic>R</italic></bold><sup>2</sup> = 0.9992) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3h</xref>), indicating that a cell could shrink its apical surface without attenuating the constricting force. When the practical constricting force remained constant, the inner cell would remain in the columnar shape. These results indicate that the difference between the vertex model and the cellular Potts model results was due to the straight lateral surface imposed on the vertex model, a restriction that seems not natural for epithelial cells. Also, we expect that the cellular Potts model simulation with the increased apical surface contractility reproduced a phenotype of endocytosis down-regulation as discussed later.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Apical constriction by modified apical elasticity</title>
<p>Since the cellular Potts model simulation indicated that the increased apical surface contractility could not drive the apical constriction, we revisited requirements for the apical constriction. It requires 1) a mechanism to simultaneously shrink the apical surface among cells in a cluster, and 2) a mechanism to keep the lateral surface straight. Actually, the condition 2) can be satisfied when the condition 1) is achieved, because the simultaneous apical shrinkage will increase the pressures in the cells, but the increase will also be synchronized and thus the pressure will be balanced. As suggested by the cell shape energy analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>), the apical shrinkage can be synchronized when the energy function and its derivative are both increasing with respect to the apical width. The energy function of the partitioned perimeters elasticity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn3">Equation 3</xref>) has a such feature, and it may correspond to the stretching elasticity of cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Helfrich, 1973</xref>), where the apical reference value <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic>0</sub> can be modified by apical endocytosis/exocytosis. By decreasing <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic>0</sub> with the endocytosis, the cell membrane would contribute to the apical surface tension proportionally to the change <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic></sub> − <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>a</italic>0</sub>.</p>
<p>To validate our new model, we simulated the epithelial cell monolayer with the decreased elastic reference value (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref rid="video2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). The inner cells shrank the apical surface simultaneously and they were deformed into the wedge shape with fluctuating but almost straight lateral surfaces, succeeding in invaginating the tissue with various parameters. Note that the simulation results were not at a steady state but in the middle of the deformation. The simulations were paused at an arbitrary time point because it was hard to assess whether the tissue was in the steady state or not, and resultant configurations were checked to assess whether the cells were delaminated or not, and evaluated the invagination by comparing the center pale blue cells and surrounding pale green cells in an average distance to the apical ECM. Interestingly, the tissue apical surface was kept relatively flat when the surface elastic modulus was high even though the cells adopted the wedge shape (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>).</p>

If the inner cells bear higher apical surface contractility than the edge cells, that inner cells may shrink their apical surface.

<title>Inferred pressure distribution around <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo tracheal pit</title>
<p>In the new model, we proposed that the simultaneous increase in the pressure would keep the cell lateral cell-cell junction straight. However, it is also possible that other mechanisms may keep the lateral cell-cell junction straight, for example by decreasing cell volume so that the pressure is constant and balanced among the cells.

The geometrical tension inference is a method to measure relative junctional tensions and cell pressures from shapes of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Roffay et al., 2021</xref>), and we extended 2D Bayesian method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ishihara and Sugimura, 2012</xref>) to 3D for the measurement of invaginated tissue.</p>
<p>The tracheal pit is formed in a tracheal placode by the apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kondo and Hayashi, 2013</xref>). An initially flat apical surface of the tissue was bent to make the pit (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 a</xref>). During the process, there was no obvious change in the distribution pattern of cellular junctional tension inside and around the tracheal pit (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>). On the other hand, the apical surface area decreased and the relative pressure increased among the invaginated cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6c-e</xref>). Note that variances of the apical area and the relative pressure did not increase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d, e</xref>), suggesting that an actual pressure value was also increased simultaneously by the cell deformation. These results were consistent with our model, indicating that the lateral cell-cell junction of the tracheal pit cell was kept straight by the increasing but balanced pressure.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we demonstrated that the increased apical surface contractility could not drive the apical constriction, and proposed the alternative driving model with the apical surface elasticity remodeling. When the cells were assigned a high apical surface contractility, the cells became rounded and delaminated one by one from edges in the cellular Potts model simulation. These simulation results disagree with the conventional model of the apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Takeichi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martin, 2020</xref>) and its vertex model simulation results. However, the vertex model simulation was substantially affected by the straight lateral surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-f</xref>), which was not natural for the epithelial cells. An edge in the vertex model can be bent by interpolating vertices or can be represented with an arc of circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brakke, 1992</xref>). Even in cases where vertex models were extended to allow bent lateral surfaces, the model still limited cell rearrangement and neighbor changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pérez-González et al., 2021</xref>), limiting the cell delamination. Thus the difference in simulation results between the models could be due to whether the cell rearrangement was included or not. However, it is not clear how the absence of the cell rearrangement affected cell behaviors in the simulation, and it shall be studied in future. In contrast to the vertex model, the cellular Potts model included the curved cell surface and the cell rearrangement innately, it elucidated the importance of those factors. For the apical constriction, we considered the modified apical surface elasticity as a plausible underlying mechanism, where the synchronized decrease in cell volume and increase in pressure balances the pressure between the cells and keeps the lateral cell-cell interface straight. The requirement of simultaneous contraction is also consistent with the non-autonomous disruption of apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Guglielmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Galea et al., 2021</xref>). With the elasticity-based apical constriction model, the cellular Potts model reproduced a tissue invagination. It succeeded with a wide range of parameter values, indicating a robustness of the model. Note that the vertex model could also be extended to incorporate the curved edges and rearrangement of the cells by specifically programming them, and would reproduce the cell delamination. That is, we could find the importance of the balanced pressure because the cellular Potts model intrinscally included a high degree of freedom for the cell shape, the cell rearrangement, and the fluctuation. Also, we confirmed the increase in pressure among invaginated cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo tracheal pit. In the preceding studies, the apically localized myosin was assumed to generate either the contractile force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Sherrard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Conte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Perez-Mockus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pérez-González et al., 2021</xref>) or the elastic force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Polyakov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Inoue et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nematbakhsh et al., 2020</xref>). However, the limited cell shape in the vertex model made them similar in terms of the energy change during the apical constriction, i.e., the effective force to decrease the apical surface. In this study, we showed that the contractile force and the elastic force differently deformed the cells and tissue, and demonstrated why and how the elasticity was important for the apical constriction. Interestingly, the tissue apical surface remained relatively flat when the cells were assigned higher surface elastic modulus. Though it might seem contradicting that the surface elasticity was the dominant factor for the apical constriction, it could be explained that a too high surface tension will keep the apical surface short and thus straight as a result.</p>
<p>In our model, for the sake of simplicity, we ignored an effect of the constriction on the apical myosin density. If we presumed that the apical myosin would be condensed by the shrinkage of the apical surface, it would increase the apical tension in the shrinking cell and is expected to promote the cell delamination further. Therefore it would not change the results.</p>
<p>If the apical surface elasticity was the determinant factor for the apical constriction, then how does the apical surface contractility generated by the myosin contribute to it, and how is the apical surface elasticity regulated by molecules? In many tissues, the apical myosin was found not permanently active but its flow, activation, and resultant apical surface contraction was pulsed, followed by a partial relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Solon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Mason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Booth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kerridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mason et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Miao and Blankenship, 2020</xref>). The contraction and partial relaxation is iterated to decrease the apical surface progressively, and it is called ratchet model or ratcheting mechanism. While it is yet to be clarified how the ratcheting prevents the apical surface from expanding back to its original width during the relaxation, some studies pointed out an involvement of the endocytosis in the apical constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lee and Harland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Mateus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Ossipova et al., 2014</xref><bold><italic>, 2015</italic></bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Le and Chung, 2021</xref>), and especially in its ratcheting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Miao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kowalczyk et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen and He, 2022</xref>). When the apical endocytosis was impaired but the myosin activity was retained, cells exhibited the pulsed apical contraction but fully turned back to their original shape in the following relaxation. Interestingly, <bold><italic>Miao et al</italic></bold>. (<bold><italic>2019</italic></bold>) downregulated endocytosis in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> gastrula and observed the apical contraction in the edge cells of a mesoderm which would be invaginated by the apical constriction in the wild type embryo. This edge specific contraction resembles the result of simulations with the increased apical surface contractility (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), and the retained myosin activity might be consistent with the increased contractility. Together, the myosin surely generates the pulsed contractility and also might be constantly generating contractility at some magnitude. Then, how do the myosin and its pulsed and constant contractility contribute to the ratcheting and the apical constriction? Although most of the preceding studies supposed that the endocytosis regulated the ratcheting indirectly by facilitating apical actomyosin network remodeling, here we would propose that the cell membrane itself increases the apical surface tension by changing the reference value. Since the cell membrane is an elastic sheet, it bears the surface tension when extended, and the surface tension magnitude is proportional to the change from the reference value. The reference value is an area of the membrane when the membrane is not stretched nor compressed, and it can be decreased by the endocytosis. It might be also possible that the remodeling of the apical actomyosin ratchets the relaxation, as actin filament linker <italic>β</italic>H-spectrin was also reported regulating the ratcheting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Krueger et al., 2020</xref>). However, a resultant apical surface tension must be increasing with respect to the apical area, and an accountable mechanism is not known for the actomyosin network for such ratcheting and physical property. In summary, we propose that 1) the actomyosin generates pulsed contractility, and the cell apical surface is contracted temporally; 2) the contraction will be fully relaxed without the endocytosis; 3) the endocytosis decreases the reference value of the apical surface elasticity during the pulsed contraction; 4) after the pulsed contraction and endocytosis, the cell apical surface is partially relaxed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a</xref>). From the model of pulsed contractility and modified elasticity, we got expectations as described below. When the apical myosin is constantly active as in the conventional model, the increased contractility is balanced among the cells and makes the edge cells delaminated (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7b</xref>). Therefore the myosin activation must be pulsed and sporadic. When the myosin activity is pulsed and sporadic but not accompanied by the surface elasticity modification, the temporal contraction is fully relaxed and the tissue remains in the same shape (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>). When the sporadic pulse of myosin activation is followed by the endocytosis, the cells undergo the simultaneous apical contraction, and then the pressure is balanced among the cells, keeping the cell lateral cell-cell junction straight and deforming the cells into the wedge shape (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>). In the actual tissue, the apical localization of the myosin and regulators of the endocytosis were both patterned. However, it may be possible in theory that the myosin activation is not patterned but is pulsed across the entire tissue, while the endocytosis is patterned, and the tissue will be bent at the site of the increased endocytotic activity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7e</xref>). Another interesting notion was that too high myosin activation would prevent the apical constriction. Even if the apical contraction is synchronized and the lateral surface is kept straight so that the cells are deformed into the wedge shape, the too high apical surface tension will try to make the apical surface as short as possible, and the apical surface will be kept flat (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7f</xref>). On the other hand, mechanisms which does not generate the apical surface tension, such like the zippering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bahri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hashimoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Galea et al., 2017</xref>) or the supracellular myosin cable encircling the contracting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nishimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Röper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chung et al., 2017</xref>), may promote the deep invagination. Note that we also demonstrated that the supracellular contractile ring alone could not drive the tissue invagination (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). How actual individual tissues accomplish the synchronized apical contraction would be clarified by examining the physical property and dynamics of the cell membrane, the apical actomyosin network, the adherens junction, and the tight junction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we elucidated how distinctively the surface contractility and the surface elasticity would regulate tissue morphogenesis. Our simulation results were consistent with the studies of the endocytosis in apical constriction, and suggested why and how the endocytosis and the ratcheting was required for the apical constriction. The depth, curvature, and speed of the invagination might be influenced by the cell shape, configuration, and parameters, and how each condition contributes to the invagination shall be studied in future.</p>

<title>Cellular Potts model with subcellular components</title>
<p>To simulate epithelial cell and tissue deformation, we developed a cellular Potts model with subcellular components, subcellular locations, and a potential energy. The cellular Potts model is a stochastic simulation framework representing a cell with a set of sites in a lattice, and the deformation is simulated by updating a label on the site in Metropolis-style. In the update, a change in energy Δℋ is calculated between the original and a proposed new configuration, and accepted if Δℋ <italic>≤</italic> 0 or with probability <italic>e</italic><sup>−Δℋ/<italic>T</italic></sup> if Δℋ &gt; 0, where <italic>T</italic> represents a system temperature. With the subcellular components, the energy ℋ is defined by a contact energy between the subcellular components inside and across cells, and an area constraint of the cell. The contact energy is defined by

The contact energy between cytosols across cells, which defines the cell lateral surface contractility <bold><italic>J</italic></bold><sub><italic>l</italic></sub>, is also dependent on <bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>/<bold>Ā</bold> and set λ<bold><italic>w</italic></bold><sup>2</sup><bold><italic>h</italic></bold>(<bold><italic>A</italic></bold><sub>0</sub>/<bold>Ā</bold>− 1).

<p>In the update, first a site <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> is randomly selected, and then another site <italic>j</italic> is randomly selected from the neighborhood <bold><italic>N</italic></bold>(<bold><italic>i</italic></bold>). New labels representing cell and subcellular component for the site <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> are determined based on the labels on <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> and <italic>j</italic>. For example, if the site <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> was labeled with a cell σ<sub>1</sub> and <italic>j</italic> was labeled as ‘<italic>medium</italic>’ for cell identity and with ‘<italic>apical ECM</italic>’ for the subcellular component, the new label for <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> was ‘<italic>medium</italic>’ and ‘<italic>outer body fluid</italic>’. If the site <bold><italic>i</italic></bold> was labeled with ‘<italic>medium</italic>’ and ‘<italic>apical ECM</italic>’, then the update was rejected so that a cell would not intrude into the apical ECM. The update is iterated for an arbitrary duration, and results were visually checked if the tissue integrity was retained, the cells were delaminated, or the tissue was bent or invaginated.</p>

<title>Cellular Potts model with partial surface elasticity</title>
<p>To simulate the differential physical properties of the apical, lateral, and basal surfaces, the subcellular locations are marked automatically, and the marking is updated during the simulation. In each cell, sites adjacent to different cells but not to the medium are marked as lateral. At the initial configuration, sites adjacent to the apical ECM are marked as apical, and during the simulation, sites adjacent to medium and other apical sites in the same cell are marked as apical. At the initial configuration and during the simulation, sites adjacent to medium and not marked as apical are marked as basal. Therefore, once a cell is delaminated and loses its apical surface, afterwards all sites in the cell adjacent to the medium are marked as basal even if it is adjacent to the apical ECM or the outer body fluid. In addition, sites are marked as adherens junction if they are not apical, adjacent to an apical site of any cell, and adjacent to a lateral site of different cell.</p>

<p>To simulate an effect of supracellular myosin cable encircling the invaginated cells, we assigned a potential energy to the adherens junction.

<title>Energy landscape with respect to cell shape</title>
<p>To analyze the energy with respect to cell shape, we prepared a simple 2D model of single cell represented by four vertices and four edges. Apical and basal edges were straight, while a lateral edge was straight but another lateral edge was assigned a constant curvature. Let <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>1</sub>, <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>2</sub>, <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>3</sub>, and <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>4</sub> denote the vertices, where an edge between <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>1</sub> and <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>4</sub> is the apical, an edge between <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>2</sub> and <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>3</sub> is the basal, an edge between <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>1</sub> and <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>2</sub> is the curved lateral, and an edge between <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>3</sub> and <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><sub>4</sub> is the straight lateral edge.

<title>Conversion of adherens junction into graph</title>
<p>For the geometrical tension inference, the cells were segmented manually and converted to the vertices and edges representation. The 3D image of cadherin was projected onto the x-y plane, and the adherens junction was traced manually. The trace was narrowed to 1 pixel boundary by Fiji plugin MorphoLibJ Segmentation Interactive Marker-controlled Watershed. In the segmented image, the boundary pixels were scanned and the vertices were allocated for pixels incident to more than two cells, i.e., the boundary pixel was next to pixels in the cells. Next, all pairs of the cells were enumerated and checked if there were two vertices incident to both of the cells, and edges were allocated to link those vertices. Pixels incident to both of the cells were assigned to the edge, and a depth of the brightest pixel in the stack for x and y of each pixel was read. When the depth differed by more than 3 from an average depth of adjacent edge pixels, the depth was masked as a noise. For each vertex, a plane was fitted by the least square method to x, y, and depths of the incident edges pixels, and depth of the plane at the vertex x and y position was assigned to the vertex. Vertices closer than 2 to each other were merged into a vertex.</p>

An axis was set parallel with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="572310v3_inline2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>, and another axis was also set orthogonal to the first axis. The balance equation was obtained with respect to the axes.

</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The coefficients for <italic>T</italic><sub><bold><italic>i</italic></bold></sub>s and <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>s were combined in an <italic>n</italic>×<italic>m</italic> matrix <bold>A</bold> so that <bold>Ap</bold> represents the forces, where <italic>n</italic> is a number of the equations, <italic>m</italic> is a number of the tensions and pressures, and <bold>p</bold> is an <italic>m</italic>-dimensional vector composed of <italic>T</italic><sub><bold><italic>i</italic></bold></sub> and <bold><italic>P</italic></bold><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>The equations above are based on an assumption that an adherens junction is responsible for the edge tension and it makes an arc so that its angle of incidence to the vertex is parallel with the plane tangent at the vertex. We also approximated the tangent plane with the plane fitted to the adjacent vertices.</p>
<p>The Bayesian tension inference is to find the most likely distribution of tensions and pressures which makes <bold>Ap</bold> reasonably small. Since <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn13">Equation 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn14">Equation 14</xref> only evaluate the balance among the forces, it cannot estimate an absolute value but a relative value of the tension and pressure. It was numerically estimated as below. Let a parameter μ = σ<sup>2</sup>/ω<sup>2</sup>, where σ represents errors of the equations and ω is a variance of the tensions and pressures distribution. The parameter μ was searched for a minimization of Akaike’s Bayesian information criterion (ABIC). To calculate ABIC, we prepared τ = μ<sup>1/2</sup> and

and <bold>d</bold><sub><italic>H</italic>1</sub>, <bold>d</bold><sub><italic>H</italic>2</sub>, … be an array of absolute value of non-zero diagonal elements of <bold>H</bold>. The ABIC was calculated by

<p>The results from this study, which investigates the mechanisms necessary for initiating tissue invagination using a cellular Potts modelling approach, suggest that apical constriction is not sufficient to drive the process by itself. The study highlights how choices inherent to modelling - such as permitting straight or curved cell edges - may affect the outcome of simulations and, consequently, their biophysical interpretation.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Satoshi Yamashita et al., investigate the physical mechanisms driving tissue bending using the cellular Potts Model, starting from a planar cellular monolayer. They argue that apical length-independent tension control alone cannot explain bending phenomena in the cellular Potts Model, contrasting with previous works, particularly Vertex Models. They conclude that an apical elastic term, with zero rest value (due to endocytosis/exocytosis), is necessary to achieve apical constriction, and that tissue bending can be enhanced by adding a supracellular myosin cable. Additionally, a very high apical elastic constant promotes planar tissue configurations, opposing bending.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the careful comments and suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The authors claim that the cellular Potts Model (CPM) is unable to achieve the results of the vertex model (VM) simulations due to naturally non-straight cellular junctions in the CPM versus the VM. The lack of a substantial comparison undermines this assertion. None of the references mentioned in the manuscript are from a work using vertex model with straight cellular junctions, simulating apical constriction purely by a enhancing a length-independent apical tension. Sherrard et al and Pérez-González et al. use 2D and 3D Vertex Models, respectively, with a &quot;contractility&quot; force driving apical constriction. However, their models allow cell curvature. Both references suggest that the cell side flexibility of the CPM shouldn't be the main issue of the &quot;contractility model&quot; for apical constriction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment.</p>
<p>For the reports by Sherrard et al and Pérez-Gonález et al, lack of the cell rearrangement (T1 transition) might have caused the difference. Other than these, Muñoz et al. (doi:10.1016/j.jbiomech.2006.05.006), Polyakov et al. (doi:10.1016/j.bpj.2014.07.013), Inoue et al.</p>
<p>(doi:10.1007/s10237-016-0794-1), Sui et al.</p>
<p>(doi:10.1038/s41467-018-06497-3), and Guo et al. (doi:10.7554/eLife.69082) used simulation models with the straight lateral surface.</p>
<p>We updated an explanation about the difference between the vertex model and the cellular Potts model in the discussion.</p>
<p>P12L318 “An edge in the vertex model can be bent by interpolating vertices or can be represented with an arc of circle (Brakke, 1992). Even in cases where vertex models were extended to allow bent lateral surfaces, the model still limited cell rearrangement and neighbor changes (Pérez-González et al., 2021), limiting the cell delamination. Thus the difference in simulation results between the models could be due to whether the cell rearrangement was included or not. However, it is not clear how the absence of the cell rearrangement affected cell behaviors in the simulation, and it shall be studied in future. In contrast to the vertex model, the cellular Potts model included the curved cell surface and the cell rearrangement innately, it elucidated the importance of those factors.”</p>

<p>- The myosin cable is assumed to encircle the invaginated cells. Therefore, it is not clear why the force acts over the entire system (even when decreasing towards the center), and not locally in the contour of the group of cells under constriction. The specific form of the associated potential is missing. It is unclear how dependent the results of the manuscript are on these not-well-motivated and model-specific rules for the myosin cable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A circle radius decreases when the circle perimeter shrinks, and this was simulated with the myosin cable moving toward the midline in the cross section.</p>
<p>We added an explanation in the introduction and the results.</p>
<p>P2L74 “In the same way with the contracting circumferential myosin belt in a cell decreasing the cell apical surface, the circular supracellular myosin cable contraction decreases the perimeter, the radius of the circle, and an area inside the circle.”</p>
<p>P6L197 “In the cross section, the shrinkage of the circular supracellular myosin cable was simulated with a move of adherens junction under the myosin cable toward the midline.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors are using different names than the conventional ones for the energy terms. Their current attempt to clarify what is usually done in other works might lead to further confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct. However we named the energy terms differently because the conventional naming would be misleading in our simulation model.</p>
<p>We added an explanation in the results.</p>
<p>P4L140 “Note that the naming for the energy terms differs from preceding studies. For example, Farhadifar et al. (2007) named a surface energy term expressed by a proportional function &quot;line tensions&quot; and a term expressed by a quadratic function &quot;contractility of the cell perimeter&quot;. In this study, however, calling the quadratic term &quot;contractility&quot; would be misleading since it prevents the contraction when  &lt; _0. Therefore we renamed the terms accordingly.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In their work, the Authors study local mechanics in an invaginating epithelial tissue. The work, which is mostly computational, relies on the Cellular Potts model. The main result shows that an increased apical &quot;contractility&quot; is not sufficient to properly drive apical constriction and subsequent tissue invagination. The Authors propose an alternative model, where they consider an alternative driver, namely the &quot;apical surface elasticity&quot;.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>It is surprising that despite the fact that apical constriction and tissue invagination are probably most studied processes in tissue morphogenesis, the underlying physical mechanisms are still not entirely understood. This work supports this notion by showing that simply increasing apical tension is perhaps not sufficient to locally constrict and invaginate a tissue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the careful comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the Authors have improved and clarified certain aspects of their results as suggested by the Reviewers, the presentation still mostly relies on showing simulation snapshots. Snapshots can be useful, but when there are too many, the results are hard to read. The manuscript would benefit from more quantitative plots like phase diagrams etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the comment.</p>
<p>However, we could not make the qualitative measurement for the phase diagram since 1) the measurement must be applicable to all simulation results, and 2) measured values must match with the interpretation of the results. To do so, the measurement must distinguish a bent tissue, delaminated cells, a tissue with curved basal surface and flat apical surface, and a tissue with closed invagination. Such measurement is hardly designed.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I see that the authors have worked on improving their paper in the revision. However, I agree with both reviewer #1 and reviewer #2 that the presentation and discussion of findings could be clearer.</p>
<p>Concrete recommendations for improvement:</p>
<p>(1) I find the observation by reviewer #1 on cell rearrangement very illuminating: It is indeed another key difference between the Cellular Potts Model that the authors use compared to typical Vertex Models, and could very well explain the different model outcomes. The authors could expand on the discussion of this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated an explanation about the difference between the vertex model and the cellular Potts model in the discussion.</p>

<p>(2) In lines 161-164, the authors write &quot;Some preceding studies assumed that the apical myosin generated the contractile force (Sherrard et al, 2010: Conte et al., 2012; Perez-Mockus et al., 2017; Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2021), while others assumed the elastic force (Polyakov et al., 2014; Inoue et al. 2016; Nematbakhsh et al., 2020).&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly, in lines 316-319 the authors write &quot;In the preceding studies, the apically localized myosin was assumed to generate either the contractile force (Sherrard et al, 2010: Conte et al., 2012; Perez-Mockus et al., 2017; Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2021), or the elastic force (Polyakov et al., 2014; Inoue et al. 2016; Nematbakhsh et al., 2020).&quot;</p>
<p>The phrasing here is poor, as it suggests that the latter three studies (Polyakov et al., 2014; Inoue et al. 2016; Nematbakhsh et al., 2020) do not use the assumption that apical myosin generated contractile forces. This is wrong. All three of these studies do in fact assume apical surface contractility mediated by myosin. In addition, they also include other factors such as elastic restoring forces from the cell membrane (but not mediated by myosin as far as I understand).</p>
<p>These statements should be corrected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We named the energy term expressed with the proportional function “contractility” and the energy term expressed with the quadratic function “elasticity”. Here we did not define what biological molecules correspond with the contractility or the elasticity.</p>
<p>For the three studies, the effect of myosin was expressed by the quadratic function, and Polyakov et al. (2014) named it “springlike elastic properties”, Inoue et al. (2016) named it “Apical circumference elasticity”, and Nematbakhsh et al. (2020) named it “Actomyosin contractility”. To explain that the for generated by myosin was expressed with the quadratic function in these studies, we wrote that they “assumed the elastic force”.</p>
<p>We assumed the myosin activity to be approximated with the proportional function in later parts and proposed that the membrane might be expressed with the quadratic function and responsible for the apical constriction based on other studies.</p>
<p>To clarify this, we added it to the results.</p>
<p>P4L175 “Some preceding studies assumed that the apical myosin generated the contractile force (Sherrard et al., 2010; Conte et al., 2012; Perez-Mockus et al., 2017; Pérez-González et al., 2021), while the others assumed the myosin to generate the elastic force (Polyakov et al., 2014; Inoue et al., 2016; Nematbakhsh et al., 2020).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Lines 294-296: The phrasing suggests that the &quot;alternative driving mechanism&quot; consists of apical surface elasticity remodelling alone. This is not true, it's an additional mechanism, not an alternative. The authors' model works by the combined action of increased apical surface contractility and apical surface elasticity remodelling (and the effect can be strengthened by including a supracellular actomyosin cable).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the comment that the surface remodeling is not solely driving the apical constriction but with myosin activity. However, if we wrote it as an additional mechanism, it might look like that both the myosin activity alone and the surface remodeling alone could drive the apical constriction, and they would drive it better when combined together. So we replaced “mechanism” with “model”.</p>
<p>P12L311 “In this study, we demonstrated that the increased apical surface contractility could not drive the apical constriction, and proposed the alternative driving model with the apical surface elasticity remodeling.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In general, the part of the results section encompassing equations 1-5 should more explicitly state which equations were used in all simulations (Eqs1+5), and which ones were used only for certain conditions (Eqs2+3+4).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added it as follows.</p>
<p>P4L153 “While the terms Equation 1 and Equation 5 were included in all simulations since they were fundamental and designed in the original cellular Potts model (Graner and Glazier, 1992), the other terms Equation 2-Equation 4 were optional and employed only for certain conditions.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Lines 150-152: Please state which parameters were examined. I assume Equation 4 was also left out of this initial simulation, as it is the potential energy of the actomyosin cable that was only included in some simulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added it as follows.</p>
<p>P4L163 “The term Equation 4 was not included either. For a cell, its compression was determined by a balance between the pressure and the surface tension, i.e., the heigher surface tension would compress the cell more. The bulk modulus 𝜆 was set 1, the lateral cell-cell junction contractility 𝐽_𝑙 was varied for different cell compressions, and the apical and basal surface contractilities 𝐽_𝑎 and 𝐽_𝑏 were varied proportional to 𝐽_𝑙.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Lines 118-122: The sentence is very long and hard to parse. I suggest the following rephrasing:</p>

<p>- The phrase &quot;In addition, the encircling supracellular myosin cable largely promoted the invagination by the apical constriction, suggesting that too high apical surface tension may keep the epithelium apical surface flat.&quot; is not clear to me. It sounds contradictory.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This finding was unexpected and surprising for us too. However, it is actually not contradictory since stronger surface tension will make the surface flatter in general. Figure 4 shows the flat apical surface with the wedge shape cells for the too strong apical surface tension. On the other hand, the supracellular myosin cable promoted the cell shape changes without raising the surface tension, and thus it could make a sharp bending (Figure 5).</p>
<p>We updated the explanation for the effect of the supracellular myosin cable as follows.</p>
<p>P2L74 “In the same way as the contracting circumferential myosin belt in a cell decreasing the cell apical surface, the circular supracellular myosin cable contraction decreases the perimeter, the radius of the circle, and an area inside the circle.”</p>
<p>P6L197 “In the cross section, the shrinkage of the circular supracellular myosin cable was simulated with a move of adherens junction under the myosin cable toward the midline.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Even when the authors now avoid to say &quot;in contrast to vertex model simulations&quot; in pg.4, in the next section there is still the intention to compare VM to CPM. Idem in the Discussion section. The conclusion in that section is that the difference between the results arising with VM (achieving the constriction) and the CPM (not achieving the constriction, and leading to cell delamination) are due to the straight lateral surfaces. However, Sherrard et at could achieve the constriction with an enhanced apical surface contractility using a 2D VM that allows curvatures. Therefore, I don't think the main difference is given by the deformability of the lateral surfaces. Instead, it might be due to the facility of the CPM to drive cellular rearrangements, coupled to specific modeling rules such as the permanent lost of the &quot;apical side&quot; once a delamination occurs and the boundary conditions. A clear example is the observation of loss of cell-cell adherence when all the tensions are set the same. Instead, in a VM cells conserve their lateral neighbors in the uniform tension regime (Sherrard et at). Is it noteworthy that the two mentioned works using vertex models to achieve apical constriction (Sherrard et at. (2D) and Pérez-González (3D) et al.) seem to neglect T1 transitions. I specifically think the added discussion on the impact of the T1 events (fundamental for cell delamination) is quite poor. A more detailed description would help justify the differences between model outcomes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We updated an explanation about the difference between the vertex model and the cellular Potts model in the discussion.</p>
<p>P12L318 “ An edge in the vertex model can be bent by interpolating vertices or can be represented with an arc of circle (Brakke, 1992). Even in cases where vertex models were extended to allow bent lateral surfaces, the model still limited cell rearrangement and neighbor changes (Pérez-González et al., 2021), limiting the cell delamination. Thus the difference in simulation results between the models could be due to whether the cell rearrangement was included or not. However, it is not clear how the absence of the cell rearrangement affected cell behaviors in the simulation, and it shall be studied in future. In contrast to the vertex model, the cellular Potts model included the curved cell surface and the cell rearrangement innately, it elucidated the importance of those factors.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The Authors have addressed most of my initial comments. In my opinion, the results could be better represented. Overall, the manuscript contains too many snapshots that are hard to read. I am sure the Authors could come up with a parameter that would tell the overall shape of the tissue and distinguish between a proper invagination and delamination. Then they could plot this parameter in a phase diagram using color plots to show how varying values of model parameters affects the shape. Presentation aside, I believe the manuscript will be a valuable piece of work that will be very useful for the community of computational tissue mechanics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the comment.</p>
<p>However, we could not make a suitable qualitative measurement method. For the phase diagrams, the measurement must be applicable to simulation results, otherwise each figure introduce a new measurement and a color representation would just redraw the snapshots but no comparison between the figures. So the different measurements would make the figures more difficult to read.</p>
<p>The single measurement must distinguish the cell delamination by the increased surface contractility from the invagination by the modified surface elasticity and the supracellular contractile ring, even though the center cells were covered by the surrounding cells and lost contact with apical side extracellular medium in both cases.</p>
<p>With the center of mass, the delaminated cells would return large values because they were moved basally. With the tissue basal surface curvature, it would not measure if the tissue apical surface was also curved or kept flat. If the phase diagram and interpretation of the simulation results do not match with each other, it would be misleading.</p>
<p>A measurement meeting all these conditions was hardly designed.</p>
