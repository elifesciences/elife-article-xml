<title>Abstract</title><p>Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) comprise a large group of primate lentiviruses that endemically infect African monkeys. HIV-1 spilled over to humans from this viral reservoir, but the spillover did not occur directly from monkeys to humans. Instead, a key event was the introduction of SIVs into great apes, which then set the stage for infection of humans. Here, we investigate the role of the lentiviral entry receptor, CD4, in this key and fateful event in the history of SIV/HIV emergence. First, we reconstructed and tested ancient forms of CD4 at two important nodes in ape speciation, prior to the infection of chimpanzees and gorillas with these viruses. These ancestral CD4s fully supported entry of diverse SIV isolates related to the virus(es) that made this initial jump to apes. In stark contrast, modern chimpanzee and gorilla CD4s are more resistant to these viruses. To investigate how this resistance in CD4 was gained, we acquired CD4 sequences from 32 gorilla individuals of 2 species, and identified alleles that encode 8 unique CD4 proteins. Function testing of these identified allele-specific CD4 differences in susceptibility to virus entry. By engineering single point mutations from gorilla CD4 alleles into a permissive human CD4 receptor, we demonstrate that acquired SNPs in gorilla CD4 did convey resistance to virus entry. We provide a population genetic analysis to support the theory that selection is acting in favor of more and more resistant CD4 alleles in apes with endemic SIV infection (gorillas and chimpanzees), but not in other ape species (bonobo and orangutan) that lack SIV infections. Taken together, our results show that SIV has placed intense selective pressure on ape CD4, acting to drive the generation of SIV-resistant CD4 alleles in chimpanzees and gorillas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) comprise a large group of primate lentiviruses that infect African monkey species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Klatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>). HIV-1 emerged into humans from this diverse viral reservoir, but was not a spillover of virus directly from monkeys to humans. Instead, a key transition was the spillover of SIVs into great apes, which then set the stage for infection of humans <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. First, SIV of chimpanzees (SIVcpz) arose following the cross-species transmission and recombination of multiple SIVs from infected monkeys upon which chimpanzees predate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bailes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sharp et al., 2005</xref>). It is unknown if this virus recombination event occurred in the monkey reservoir before the first chimpanzee was infected, or if it occurred within chimpanzee populations. Subsequently, SIVcpz transmitted to gorillas (giving rise to SIVgor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heuverswyn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Takehisa et al., 2009</xref>). Chimpanzees and gorillas have been endemically infected with SIVcpz and SIVgor since those spillover events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</xref>). Spillover to humans from both chimpanzees and gorillas subsequently occurred on multiple occasions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heuverswyn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Keele et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Plantier et al., 2009</xref>). One of these spillovers yielded HIV-1 “group M” – the pandemic virus that has swept the globe and which has infected over 80 million people. A third great ape species native to Africa, the bonobo, remains uninfected with SIV. Orangutans, the final great ape species, are native to Asia and also remain uninfected.</p>

Chimpanzees became infected from this reservoir and new virus was created, SIVcpz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bailes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sharp et al., 2005</xref>). From there, chimpanzees infected both gorillas and humans. The final two great ape species, orangutans and bonobos, are not known to harbor any form of SIV.</p></caption>

<p>CD4 is the main viral entry receptor for primate lentiviruses (SIV and HIV). CD4 is a surface protein expressed on T cells, where it is bound by the viral envelope (Env) glycoprotein to begin viral entry. To understand the role that CD4 plays in dictating the host tropism of SIVs, one must first appreciate the remarkable evolutionary signatures contained in the CD4 gene. CD4 has evolved under positive natural selection over the course of primate evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). This type of selection operates in favor of new alleles of CD4 that have better resistance to virus entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Meyerson and Sawyer, 2011</xref>). As such, it has been noted that most of the sequence evolution in CD4 has been concentrated to its D1 domain, the region that contacts HIV and SIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Even though natural selection operates at the level of alleles and SNPs circulating within primate populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ohainle and Malik, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Russell et al., 2021</xref>), the ultimate outcome is fixed CD4 sequence divergence between species. As would be expected because of the selection at play, we have demonstrated that different primate orthologs vary dramatically in the viruses that they will engage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Warren et al., 2019a</xref>). Thus, there has been intense selection on CD4 in host species that are endemically infected with SIV.</p>
<p>Here, we focus on a key event in the emergence of HIV into humans – the transition of SIVs from monkeys to apes. First, we reconstructed and tested ancestral forms of CD4 at two important nodes in ape speciation, prior to the infection of chimpanzees and gorillas with these viruses. These ancestral CD4s fully supported entry of diverse SIV isolates representing the virus(es) that made this initial jump to apes. In stark contrast, modern chimpanzee and gorilla CD4s are less supportive of infection by these viruses, consistent with natural selection having shaped CD4 to resist infection. Second, we investigated the subsequent spillover of SIV from chimpanzees to gorillas. We gathered CD4 sequences from 32 gorilla individuals of 2 species, and identified CD4 alleles that encode 8 unique CD4 proteins. We then identified allele-specific CD4 differences in susceptibility to SIVcpz entry (the virus that spilled over to gorillas). By engineering single point mutations from gorilla CD4 alleles into a permissive human CD4 receptor, we demonstrate that these SNPs in CD4 are responsible for resistance to virus entry in gorillas, and provide a population genetic analysis to support the theory the selection is acting in favor of more and more resistant CD4 alleles in gorillas. Taken together, our results show that SIV has placed intense selective pressure on ape CD4, acting to drive the generation of SIV-resistant CD4 alleles and orthologs.</p>

<title>Receptor mediated resistance to SIV entry is a trait acquired during ape speciation</title>
<p>First, we wanted to know what ape CD4 was like before SIVs spilled over to apes and began to exert infection pressure on them. We used an alignment of CD4 from diverse simian primates, and the program PAML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang, 2007a</xref>), to infer ancestral CD4 sequences at the base of the hominin and hominid clades, at the evolutionary positions shown with red and blue nodes in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>. These ancestral nodes yielded CD4 sequences that differ from human CD4 by only 2 (hominin) and 5 (hominid) nonsynonymous substitutions. Only one of these changes mapped to the D1 domain of CD4 (N52S; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref></bold>). We then synthesized these ancient and extinct CD4 genes. We constructed stable cells lines where Cf2Th (canine) cells were transduced with retroviral vectors that stably integrated each of these CD4 genes (hominin ancestral CD4, hominoid ancestral CD4, human CD4, gorilla CD4, chimp CD4, or an empty vector). All cell lines were also engineered to express human CCR5, a critical co-receptor for SIV and HIV.</p>

</fig>
<p>We then tested these extinct and modern CD4 proteins for their ability to support viral entry mediated by SIVcpz Env. Since we don’t know the actual genetic sequence of the first SIV(s) to infect chimpanzees, the best alternate strategy is to test a phylogenetically diverse set of extant SIVcpz strains (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref></bold>). We also tested HIV-1 strains that are embedded within the SIVcpz clade, because these represent the virus spillovers from chimpanzees to humans. To generate pseudoviruses bearing SIVcpz and HIV Env, different SIVcpz and HIV-1 Env expression plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells along with a plasmid encoding HIV-1ΔEnv-eGFP. The cell lines stably expressing various CD4 proteins and human CCR5 were then infected with each of these pseudoviruses. The percent of GFP+ (infected) cells was measured by flow cytometry and viral titers on the different cell lines were calculated and reported as transducing units per milliliter (TDU/mL). All tested pseudoviruses displayed similar levels of infection on cells bearing human or the ancestral CD4 proteins (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, 2E</xref></bold>). This suggests that the ancestral versions of CD4 in apes were susceptible to primate lentivirus entry, just as human CD4 is known to be today. On the other hand, cells bearing chimpanzee and gorilla CD4s were generally less permissive to virus entry (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D, 2E</xref></bold>). We conclude that CD4 was originally permissive to primate lentiviruses, but that selective pressures exerted by SIVs in the chimpanzee and gorilla lineages have led to the retention of mutations that confer resistance to primate lentivirus infection. This has not happened in humans where selective pressure by HIV-1 is too new.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Gorilla CD4 alleles differentially support entry of SIVcpz</title>
<p>Natural selection operates on individuals within populations, and only over time can the effects of this selection be seen in the divergence of gene orthologs between species. We and others have already shown that SIVcpz has placed selective pressures on chimpanzees such that multiple CD4 alleles circulate in chimpanzees which resist SIVcpz entry better than human CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bibollet-Ruche et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Warren et al., 2019b</xref>). We next wanted to know if the same is true in gorilla populations. To similarly analyze gorilla CD4, we used the SNP data from the Great Ape Genome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prado-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) to identify extant CD4 alleles. We analyzed genetic data from 32 gorilla (<italic>Gorilla gorilla gorilla</italic> [n = 28]; <italic>Gorilla gorilla diehli</italic> [n = 1]; <italic>Gorilla beringei graueri</italic> [n = 3]) individuals and found six non-synonymous and five synonymous SNPs separating the individual alleles encoded. Five out of six of the non-synonymous polymorphisms are located within domain 1 of CD4 (two are in the same codon, codon 27) and one in domain 2 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). A study of over 100 fecal samples from gorillas at field sites in Africa recently identified the same set of SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). Within the gorilla samples, these amino acid differences result in eight distinct allelic CD4 protein haplotypes. The allele frequencies of these protein haplotypes are heterogeneous, where allele 5 is the most common (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref></bold>). (This, allele 5, was also the gorilla CD4 that was tested in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref></bold> and shown in the alignment in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>.) From looking at the sequences of these different alleles, we noticed a predicted glycosylation site (N-glycosylation tripeptide NXT) at position 15 that is fixed in the gorilla population but absent in the other African apes <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>)</bold>. Interestingly, the gorilla CD4 allele 2 codes for a proline at position 18, immediately after the tripeptide NCT, which strongly reduces the likelihood of glycosylation (Gavel and Heijne, 1990). Since five of the six protein altering polymorphisms are located in domain 1 of gorilla CD4, which directly binds to the lentiviral Env (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>) we next wanted to test their functional significance.</p>

</fig>
<p>We made stable cell lines expressing each gorilla CD4 allele, along with human CCR5 (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). We then infected each of these with GFP pseudoviruses displaying envelopes from different strains of SIVcpz, as described above. We quantified the number of GFP+ cells to measure for the differential usage of each CD4 allele. Again, we don’t know the exact strain of SIVcpz that initially infected gorillas, so instead we have tested a phylogenetic diversity of SIVcpz strains. We found substantial differences in susceptibility to pseudovirus entry between the alleles, varying by up to 2 orders of magnitude in some cases (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). All gorilla alleles were equal to, or more resistant to infection than, the human CD4. We also tested pseudoviruses displaying a diverse set of Envs from HIV-1 groups M and N, and found similar patterns (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). These data are consistent with SIV putting selective pressure on gorillas in favor of resistant alleles of CD4. However, as would be expected in a host-virus arms race, the viruses are evolving too. As such, we found considerable differences on the entry phenotype for each SIVcpz strain evaluated, where a single host CD4 allele can be highly restrictive to one strain, while being fully functional for entry of another. As an outlier, SIVcpz TAN2.69 showed a uniformly strong ability to use any of the gorilla CD4 alleles.</p>

<title>Human CD4 engineered to encode gorilla SNPs supports less SIVcpz entry</title>
<p>We next sought to evaluate if CD4 polymorphisms found in gorilla individuals are protective when engineered in the human version of CD4, a widely susceptible receptor for primate lentiviruses. First, we investigated gorilla CD4 allele 2, which encodes a proline at position 18 that is predicted to prevent an otherwise fixed N-glycosylation at position 15 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). We noticed that gorilla allele 2 CD4 is highly susceptible to most of the SIVcpz strains tested in this study (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref></bold>). Allele 3, which differs from allele 2 only by this proline, supported less entry by SIVcpz TAN1.910 presumably due to this change in glycosylation status (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold>). To explore the effects of this gorilla specific glycan at residue 15, we generated cell lines stably expressing a mutated version of human CD4 that encodes for the gorilla specific glycosylation motif. We then challenged these cells with pseudoviruses displaying the envelope of different SIVcpz strains and consistently found a decrease in susceptibility to entry compared to wild type human CD4 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). To confirm the glycosylation status of CD4, we performed CD4 western blotting on lysates from cells stably expressing each of the different versions of CD4. As expected, human T15N CD4, as well as gorilla allele 3, migrated at a higher molecular weight compared to human wild type CD4 and gorilla allele 2, corresponding to the predicted number of glycans on CD4 domain 1 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). We then treated the lysates with PNGase F, an N-linked glycosidase, and found that all CD4 versions migrated at the same rate, confirming that the mobility shift is due to the glycosylation status of CD4. Thus, most gorilla CD4 alleles have gained a glycan at position 15 that reduces entry of SIV as compared to human CD4. It seems that allele 2, which doesn’t have this glycan, would be at a fitness disadvantage. In support of this, allele 2 is one of the least frequent alleles in the gorilla population that we surveyed <bold>(<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>)</bold>.</p>

<p>We proceeded to test the amino acid residues at the other 3 polymorphic positions in domain 1 of gorilla CD4. We infected cells individually expressing mutant forms of human CD4 that coded for the gorilla specific residues at positions 27, 31, and 34. We found that in all cases, the mutant form of human CD4 encoding the gorilla specific amino acid was significantly more restrictive to at least two of the four SIVcpz strains when compared to human wild type CD4 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). In several cases, such as H27R CD4 expressing cells infected with SIVcpz MB897, we found drastic changes rendering a fully supportive receptor now highly refractory to infection by a single amino acid substitution. We found that the protective role of these gorilla specific substitutions was SIVcpz strain specific, demonstrating that collectively, the diversity found in gorilla individuals can confer relative protection to all the SIV strains we tested, but that SIVs are counter-evolving as well. These results suggest that single amino acid changes in domain 1 can drastically modify the interaction between CD4 and the lentivirus envelope, directly influencing virus entry.</p>
<p>To evaluate the reverse - if gorilla CD4 mutated to recapitulate the amino acids encoded in human CD4 may render the CD4 a better receptor for SIVcpz - we made and constructed cells expressing those CD4s and quantified the level of infection. We did not observe a full gain-of-function phenotype here and instead found only minimal increases in entry of SIVcpz through these receptors (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref></bold>). These results imply that the resistance to SIVcpz found in gorilla individuals is not dependent on single amino acids, but rather the cumulative effect of multiple SNPs. Overall, our data suggest that population-level diversity of CD4 in SIV-endemic gorillas confers some level of protection against multiple SIVcpz strains.</p>

<title>Positive selection has shaped the evolutionary trajectory of CD4 SNPs in SIV endemic host species</title>
<p>Natural selection influences the frequency of SNPs within populations. SNPs with deleterious effects will be kept at low frequency by purifying selection. On the other hand, mutations that confer a selective advantage will reach higher frequencies and/or be maintained in a population longer than expected due to different forms of positive selection (i.e., selective sweeps or frequency dependent selection). We next tested how polymorphism in CD4 has been shaped in ape species, with comparison made between apes that have been endemically infected with SIV (chimpanzees and gorillas) and those that have not (bonobos and orangutans).</p>
<p>Formal methods to detect the influence of selection on population-level nucleotide variation exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Fay and Wu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fu and Li, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Tajima, 1989</xref>), but their statistical power is decreased in non-human ape species due to their small sample sizes and lower levels of variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prado-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, we use a comparative approach to detect the signature of natural selection. To do this, we compare patterns of population level diversity between CD4 verus its neighboring genes. We compared SIV endemic apes (chimpanzee and gorillas) to apes uninfected (bonobos and orangutans) or recently infected on an evolutionary timescale (humans). This was performed for both nonsynonymous (protein altering) and synonymous (not protein altering) polymorphisms. Polymorphism data for chimpanzee, gorilla, bonobo, and two orangutan species were obtained from the Great Ape Genome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prado-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) for CD4 and 11 neighboring genes spanning 250 kb of the X-chromosome. For these same genes, human variation was obtained from the 1000 Genomes project. We calculated nucleotide diversity either based on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Watterson’s 𝜭<sub>ω</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Watterson, 1975</xref>)) or mean pairwise difference between individuals (𝜭<sub>ν</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tajima, 1983</xref>)). The mutation rate at CD4 does not appear to be elevated given similar levels of variation between CD4 and its neighboring loci when based on the number of SNPs (𝜭<sub>ω</sub>) (<bold>Table S1</bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>However, within the endemically infected species, nonsynonymous SNPs in CD4 are at a significantly higher frequency compared to neighboring loci, represented by 𝜭ν, (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tajima, 1983</xref>). This difference is not observed for synonymous variation. This discordance between nonsynonymous and synonymous variation suggests that the higher frequency of nonsynonymous variants at CD4 in the endemically infected species is not explained by neutral or demographic evolutionary forces. In addition, the higher frequency of segregating nonsynonymous variation is restricted to the endemically infected species. Taken together, these patterns are consistent with positive selection increasing the frequency of and/or maintaining nonsynonymous polymorphisms at CD4 within the endemically infected species only. Also, in support of this, we find that gorilla and chimpanzee nonsynonymous polymorphic sites are significantly concentrated on the domain 1 of CD4 when compared to the un/recently infected species (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref></bold>). This difference is statistically significant <bold>(<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>)</bold>. This data suggests that long-term endemic infection of SIV in ape populations may be driving nonsynonymous SNPs to higher frequency in CD4, particularly on the domain 1, the region that directly interacts with the primate lentivirus Env glycoprotein.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pathogens are strong selective drivers of host gene evolution. We and others have previously shown that the CD4 gene has evolved under strong positive selection throughout the evolution and speciation of simian primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Selection on CD4 is thought to be driven by its direct interaction with the lentiviral envelope (Env), which mediates viral entry. Indeed, most of the sequence evolution in CD4 has occurred in the D1 domain that contacts the lentivirus Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). We performed an updated analysis of positive selection in CD4 including new CD4 orthologs that have become available (<bold>Figure S4</bold>). We found that removing the D1 sequence from the analysis renders the gene no longer under positive selection. This sets the stage for the current study, which focuses on selection on CD4 within ape populations.</p>
<p>Within populations of animals, when alleles of CD4 arise that can resist SIV, they would be predicted to rise in frequency. We and others have demonstrated that many alleles circulating in chimpanzees convey an increased ability to restrict viral entry by SIVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bibollet-Ruche et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Warren et al., 2019b</xref>). This is also observed for many other African primate species, where amino acid polymorphisms in CD4 resist viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). It is important to note that many African primate species still harbor lentiviruses endemically, meaning that CD4 remains functional for viral entry of at least some viruses despite the selective pressure to resist it. Therefore, we understand CD4 to be evolving to convey natural tolerance to primates. &quot;Natural tolerance&quot; refers to a species’ ability to resist or tolerate a virus to an acceptable level for peaceful co-existence of the virus and host. It is obtained by evolutionary adaptations that occur over time, allowing the species to develop mechanisms to reduce the negative effects of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Pagán and García-Arenal, 2018</xref>). For example, some species may evolve barriers (like resistant forms of CD4) that reduce the titers that a virus can achieve in their body. Natural tolerance is often required before a virus can establish itself long- term in a host reservoir, and thus understanding it is key to understanding virus reservoirs in nature.</p>
<p>Herein, we strengthen the insight into lentiviral tolerance via CD4 evolution in three ways. 1) We reconstruct extinct ancestral forms of ape CD4 that pre-date SIV, and find that they were highly vulnerable to SIV entry. We then show that CD4 became less permissive to SIV in species that experienced long-term endemic infection. This resistant phenotype is associated with the accumulation of specific amino acid substitutions in the D1 domain of CD4. 2) We show that gorillas harbor a diversity of CD4 alleles, all of which are more resistant to SIV entry than is human CD4. Again, we show that these alleles are gaining resistance by accumulating amino acid substitutions in the D1 domain, one of which creates a new motif for post- translational addition of a glycan to the CD4 protein. Protective (to the host) glycosylation of CD4 has recently also been observed by us and others in chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bibollet-Ruche et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Warren et al., 2019b</xref>), and in another population sample of gorillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, the evolutionary acquisition of a glycan shield on CD4 may be a recurring theme in the evolution of primate species that are plagued with SIVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Russell et al., 2021</xref>). 3) Using population genetics analysis, we show that nonsynonymous SNPs are enriched within ape species that are endemically infected with SIV (chimpanzees and gorillas) relative to those that have not (bonobos and orangutans) or which have been infected for less than 100 years (humans). This increased population level diversity is observed only for CD4, and not shared by other genes neighboring the CD4 loci.</p>
<p>Collectively, it is now clear that the sequence diversity (within species) and divergence (between species) of primate CD4 is strongly driven by infection pressure from lentiviruses. There is a surprising outcome of virus-driven host evolution in that the divergence and diversity of these host genes ultimately comes at a detriment to the very viruses that drove this evolution. When host genes like CD4 become highly diverse within species, a given virus strain may only be able to infect a small number of individuals within the population. For instance, gorilla CD4 allele 1 is highly resistant to most of the SIVs we tested <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>)</bold>. In fact, we only found one SIV isolate, SIVcpz “TAN2.69,” that could enter cells through the receptor encoded by allele 1. That suggests that gorillas that are homozygous for allele 1 would largely be protected from most circulating SIV strains. Taking this example further, if allele 1 were to become high frequency within gorilla populations, many strains of SIV in gorillas could go extinct.</p>
<p>In the long-term, the virus-driven evolution of genes like CD4 also mean that virus spillover between species – including the zoonotic spillovers that yield new human viruses - are less likely to happen. Indeed, a prevailing theme that has emerged in recent years is that receptor sequence divergence serves as a potent barrier to the movement of viruses between species. Likewise, this study suggests that SIV entry is blocked by the CD4 receptor of some primate species, and some individuals, that it might encounter.</p>
<p>Therefore, spillover of lentiviruses between species will only happen when virus is transmitted between <italic>key individuals</italic> of two different species. The donor individual would need to have CD4 alleles that yield high titers of SIV in its body, and the recipient individual would need to have CD4 alleles that make it receptive to infection by this new virus.</p>

For human variants, the variant calls were made based on human reference genome annotation hg38, and individual-specific haplotypes were extracted by altering the reference sequence with the alternative SNPs annotated in the VCF files via custom Perl script. For non-human primate variants, the primate genome short read sequences were mapped to human reference genome hg19 to generate the VCF files, as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prado-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>). The SNPs in the VCF files were further filtered by the variant call quality (GQ ζ 15). Like the human sequences, the individual-specific haplotype sequences are re-constructed by correcting the reference sequence with VCF annotations.</p>
<p>In total we obtained population level variation for CD4 plus 15 other loci (six upstream and nine downstream). Four loci were removed from analysis because they have previously been shown to directly interact with a viral protein (USP5 and SPSB2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Rathore et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>)) or non-human primate sequencing reads did not map well with the human reference due to repetitive sequence (LAG3 and P3H3). Coding loci included in this study (in order 5’ to 3’) are: ZNF384, PIANP, COPS7A, MLF2, PTMS, CD4, GPR162, GNB3, CDCA3, TPI1, LRRC23 and ENO2. This was done for great ape species endemically infected with immunodeficiency viruses (chimpanzee and gorilla) and those newly or not infected (human, bonobo, Sumatran and Bornean orangutans).</p>
<p>Sequences were aligned for each species individually using the Muscle alignment program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Edgar, 2004</xref>). DnaSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rozas et al., 2017</xref>) was used to haplotype-phase the downloaded sequences and to calculate levels of nucleotide diversity for each locus. Rarely we would observe an internal stop codon within a locus’ reading frame. In these cases, both haplotypes for that individual were removed from analysis. We analyzed the subspecies of gorilla and chimpanzee together. While there is evidence of genetic differentiation between these subspecies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Prado-Martinez et al., 2013</xref>) this should not affect our comparisons as the differentiation is expected to be similar across all loci.</p>

Multiple sequence alignments were visually inspected, duplicate gene sequences were removed, and the gene isoform from each species that best aligned to the human reference was retained for further analysis. The terminal stop codon was removed and aligned DNA and protein sequences were exported as fasta files. Codon alignments were generated using PAL2NAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Suyama et al., 2006</xref>). Species cladograms for use in PAML were constructed following the species-level phylogenetic relatedness of primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Perelman et al., 2011</xref>).

<p>Codon alignments and unrooted species cladograms were used as input files for analysis of positive selection using the PAML4.8 software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang, 2007a</xref>). To detect selection, multiple sequence alignments were fit to the NSites models M7 (neutral model, codon values of dN/dS fit to a beta distribution bounded between 0 and 1), M8a (neutral model, similar to M7 but with an extra codon class fixed at dN/dS = 1) and M8 (positive selection model, similar to M8a but with the extra codon class allowed to have a dN/dS &gt; 1). A likelihood ratio test was performed to assess whether the model of positive selection (M8) yielded a significantly better fit to the data compared to null models (model comparisons M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs M8). Posterior probabilities (Bayes Empirical Bayes analysis) were assigned to individual codons with dN/dS values &gt; 1. To calculate the posterior mean of ω over a sliding window, the per-site ω value was extracted from the M8 model, and the average ω value within the designated window size (80 amino acids) was calculated across the open reading frame in a sliding manner. With the window slide 1 amino acid each time to calculate the smoothed mean ω values.</p>

<p>Population nucleotide diversity at a locus is estimated either based on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Watterson’s 𝜭<sub>ω</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Watterson, 1975</xref>)) or mean pairwise difference between individuals (𝜭<sub>Π</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tajima, 1983</xref>)). Level of variability based on the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms at a locus (𝜭<sub>Π</sub>) is not significantly different between CD4 and neighboring loci. Y-axis shows the mean and standard error of 𝜭<sub>Π</sub> for synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide variants at CD4 and neighboring loci across species endemically infected with SIV (chimpanzee and gorilla) or recently/uninfected (human, bonobo and orangutans). Schematic along bottom of each graph depicts the relative location of each locus and are as follows 5’ to 3’: ZNF384, PIANP, COPS7A, MLF2, PTMS, CD4, GPR162, GNB3, CDCA3, TPI1, LRRC23 and ENO2. Mann-Whitney test indicates whether heterozygosity at CD4 is significantly different than neighboring loci. We observe no difference in the total number of nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs, represented by 𝜭<sub>ω</sub> between CD4 and its genomic neighbors in the endemic and un/recently infected species (see also <bold>Table S1</bold>).</p></caption>

<caption><title>CD4 is under positive selection in primates.</title>
<p>Previous studies have identified CD4 as an HIV-1 cofactor that is evolving under positive (diversifying) selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). However, these studies were limited in that they analyzed <italic>CD4</italic> sequences from a narrow set of primate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), or included a larger species panel but lacked the complete <italic>CD4</italic> coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Meyerson et al., 2014</xref>). To extend on these studies, we collected full-length <italic>CD4</italic> sequences from 25 primate species (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) and tested for evidence of site-specific selective pressures using the <italic>codeml</italic> program on the Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Likelihood (PAML) package. <bold>(A)</bold> Cladogram of the primate species (n = 25) analyzed in this study. <bold>(B)</bold> The most amino-terminal extracellular domain of CD4 (domain 1, D1) is bound by the primate lentivirus (HIV/SIV) envelope glycoprotein (Env) during entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bour et al., 1995</xref>). We next sought to assess whether D1 alone is evolving under positive selection (presumably due to selective pressures exerted by SIVs), or if other regions of CD4 are also experiencing selective pressures for diversification. Site-specific selective pressures in primate CD4 (full gene; top), the CD4 D1 domain alone (amino acids 26-123; middle), and CD4 minus the signal peptide and the D1 domain (amino acids 123-458; bottom) were detected using the phylogenetic analysis maximum-likelihood (PAML) program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yang, 2007a</xref>). Positive selection among amino acid sites was tested using two model comparisons, M7 vs. M8 and M8a vs. M8. In each of these comparisons, the null models (M7, M8a) do not allow for sites under positive selection, while the alternative model (M8) does. Tables summarize the likelihood ratio test between the M7-M8 and M8a-M8 models. The 21′lnL value (twice the difference in the natural log of the likelihoods) is shown, along with the p- value with which the neutral models (M7 or M8a) are rejected in favor of the model of positive selection (M8). <bold>(C)</bold> To further identify codon sites in CD4 under positive selection, we calculated the posterior probability of ω &gt; 1 (where ω is the dN [nonsynonymous]/dS [synonymous] rate ratio, and values &gt; 1 in the model M8 indicate sites under selection) using the Bayes empirical Bayes approach. Plot of posterior probabilities (ω&gt;1 under maximum likelihood random-sites model M8) for all CD4 sites. Sites under positive selection (p<italic>ω &gt; 0.9</italic>) are shown in red. (<bold>D</bold>) The posterior mean of ω over a sliding window of 80 amino acids is shown (green line), along with the overall mean of ω across the entire gene (grey line). In both panels C and D, the amino acid positions are shown in relationship to human CD4, and the D1 domain of CD4 is highlighted in orange. <bold>(E)</bold> Cryo-EM structure of an HIV-1 Env trimer in complex with human CD4 (PDB 5U1F) was visualized in ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Goddard et al., 2017</xref>). Individual gp120 and gp41 subunits are colored in light and dark blue, respectively. The CD4 D1 domain (red) and D2-D4 domains (gray) are shown, with sites under positive selection (<italic>P</italic>ω &gt; 0.9) shown on the human sequence as red spheres. 9 of the 12 sites passing this stringent cutoff map to the Env- CD4 D1 domain interface.</p></caption>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on how lentiviral infection has driven the diversification of the HIV/SIV entry receptor CD4. Using a combination of molecular evolution approaches coupled with functional testing of extant and ancestral reconstructions of great ape CD4, the authors provide <bold>solid</bold> evidence to support the idea that endemic simian immunodeficiency virus infection in gorillas have selected for gorilla CD4 alleles that are more resistant to SIV infection. However, this conclusion would be supported more strongly with additional functional testing of other great ape CD4 relative to human and ancestral sequences. Additionally, given the difficulty in definitively proving drivers of selection, the current title of the study is considered an overstatement relative to the data presented.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors previously demonstrated that species-specific variation in primate CD4 impacts its ability to serve as a functional receptor for diverse SIVs. Here, Warren and Barbachano-Guerrero et al. perform population genetics analyses and functional characterization of great ape CD4 with a particular focus on gorillas, which are natural hosts of SIVgor. They first used ancestral reconstruction to derive the ancestral hominin and hominid CD4. Using pseudotyped viruses representing a panel of envelopes from SIVcpz and HIV strains, they find that these ancestral reconstructions of CD4 are more similar to human CD4 in terms of being a broadly susceptible entry receptor (in the context of mediating entry into Cf2Th cells stably expressing human CCR5). In contrast, extant gorilla and chimpanzee CD4 are functional entry receptors for a narrower range of HIV and SIVcpz isolates. Based on these differences, authors next surveyed gorilla sequences and identified several CD4 haplotypes, specifically in the region encoding the CD4 D1 domain, which directly contacts the viral glycoprotein and thus may impact the interaction. Consistent with this possibility, the authors demonstrated that gorilla CD4 haplotypes are, on average, less capable of supporting entry than human CD4, and that some are largely unable to function as SIV entry receptors. Interestingly, individual residues found at key positions in the gorilla CD4 D1 when tested in the context of human CD4 reduce entry of some virions pseudotyped with diverse SIVcpz envelopes, suggesting that individual amino acids can in part explain the observed differences across gorilla CD4 haplotypes. Finally, the authors perform statistical tests to infer that CD4 from great apes with endemic SIV (i.e., chimpanzees and gorillas) but not non-reservoirs (i.e., orangutans, bonobos) or recent spillover hosts (i.e., humans), have been subject to selection as a result of pressure from endemic SIV.</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The functional assays are appropriate to test the stated hypothesis, and the authors use a broad diversity of envelopes from HIV and SIVcpz strains. The authors also partially characterize one potential mechanism of gorilla CD4 resistance - receptor glycosylation at the derived N15 found in 5/6 gorilla haplotypes.</p>
<p>Ancestral reconstruction provides a particularly interesting aspect of the study, allowing authors to infer the ancestral state of hominid CD4 relative to modern CD4 from gorillas and chimpanzees. This, coupled with evidence supporting SIV-driven selection of gorilla CD4 diversity and the characterization of functional diversity of extant haplotypes provides several interesting findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The major inference of the work is that SIV infection of gorillas drove the observed diversity in gorilla CD4. This is supported by the majority of SNPs being localized to the CD4 D1, which directly interacts with the envelope, and the demonstrated functional consequences of that diversity for viral entry. However, SIVgor (to the best of my knowledge) only infects Western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), and one Gorilla gorilla diehli and three Gorilla beringei graueri individuals were included in the haplotype and allele frequency analyses. The presence of these haplotypes or the presence of similar allele frequencies in Eastern lowland and mountain gorillas would impact this conclusion. It would be helpful for the authors to clarify this point.</p>
<p>The authors appear to use a somewhat atypical approach to assess intra-population selection to compensate for relatively small numbers of NHP sequences (Fig. 6). However, they do not cite precedence for the robustness of the approach or the practice of grouping sequences from multiple species for the endemic vs other comparison. They also state in the methods that some genes encoded in the locus were removed from the analysis &quot;because they have previously been shown to directly interact with a viral protein.&quot; This seems to undercut the analysis and prevents alternative explanations for the observed diversity in CD4 (e.g., passenger mutations from selection at a neighboring locus).</p>
<p>Data in Figure 5 is graphed as % infected cells instead of virus titer (TDU/mL). It's unclear why this is the case, and prevents a comparison to data in Figure 2 and Figure 4.</p>
<p>The lack of pseudotyping with SIVgor envelope is a surprising omission from this study, that would help to contextualize the findings. Similarly, building gorilla CD4 haplotype SNPs onto the hominin ancestor (as opposed to extant human CD4) may provide additional insights that are meaningful toward understanding the evolutionary trajectory of gorilla CD4.</p>

<p>Lentiviral infection of primate species has been linked to the rapid mutational evolution of numerous primate genes that interact with these viruses, including genes that inhibit lentiviruses as well as genes required for viral infection. In this manuscript, Warren et al. provide further support for the diversification of CD4, the lentiviral entry receptor, to resist lentiviral infection in great ape populations. This work builds on their prior publication (Warren et al. 2019, PMCID: PMC6561292 ) and that of other groups (e.g., Russell et al. 2021, PMCID: PMC8020793; Bibollet-Ruche et al. 2019, PMCID: PMC6386711) documenting both sequence and functional diversity in CD4, specifically within (1) the CD4 domain that binds to the lentiviral envelope and (2) great ape populations with endemic lentiviruses. Thus, the paper's finding that gorilla populations exhibit diverse CD4 alleles that differ in their susceptibility to lentiviral infection is well demonstrated both here and in a prior publication.</p>
<p>To bolster the argument that lentiviruses are indeed the causative driver of this diversification, which seems likely from a logical perspective but is difficult to prove, Warren et al. pursue two novel lines of evidence. First, the authors reconstruct ancestral CD4 genes that predate lentiviral infection of hominid populations. They then demonstrate that resistance to lentiviral infection is a derived trait in chimpanzees and gorillas, which have been co-evolving with endemic lentiviruses, but not in humans, which only recently acquired HIV. Nevertheless, the derived resistance could be stochastic or due to drift. This argument would be strengthened by demonstrating that bonobo and orangutan CD4, which also do not have endemic lentiviruses, resemble the ancestral and human susceptibility to great-ape-infecting lentiviruses.</p>
<p>Second, Warren et al. provide a population genetic argument that only endemically infected primates exhibit diversifying selection, again arguing for endemic lentiviruses being the evolutionary driver. The authors compare SNP occurrence in CD4 to neighboring genes, demonstrating that non-synonymous SNP frequency is only elevated in endemically infected species. Moreover, these amino-acid-coding changes are significantly concentrated in the CD4 domain that binds the lentiviral envelope. This is a creative analysis to overcome the problem of very small sample sizes, with very few great ape individuals sequenced. The additional small number of species compared (2-3 in each group) also limits the power of the analysis; the authors could consider expanding their analysis to Old World Monkey species that do or do not have endemic lentiviruses, as well as great apes.</p>
<p>Overall, this manuscript lends additional support to a well-documented example of a host-virus arms race: that of lentiviruses and the viral entry receptor.</p>
