<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The canonical theory emphasizes fronto-parietal network (FPN) is key in mediating general fluid intelligence (gF). Meanwhile, recent studies show that multiple sensory regions in occipito-temporal border also play a key role in gF. However, the underlying mechanism is not yet clear. To investigate this issue, this study selects human MT complex (MT+), a region locates at the occipito-temporal border representing multiple sensory flows as a target brain area. Using ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA/glutamate concentrations in MT+ combining resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), behavioral examinations including MT+ perception suppression test and gF subtest in visuo-spatial component, we reveal that MT+ GABA and frontal-MT+ FC significantly correlate with the performance of visuo-spatial intelligence. Further, serial mediation model demonstrates that MT+ GABA predicting visuo-spatial <italic>g</italic>F fully mediated by reverberation effect between frontal and MT+ network. Our finding highlights that sensory cortex could integrate into complex cognition system as an intellectual hub.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>General fluid intelligence (gF) is a current problem-solving ability, which shows high inter-individual differences in humans(Cattell &amp; Raymond, 1963). At the beginning of the last century, Spearman(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Spearman, 1904</xref>) proposed that some general or g factor contributes to our cognition. Visuo-spatial intelligence, usually tested by visual materials, is considered to have high g-loading(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Colom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007</xref>). Recently, Duncan et al. show coding of gF in distributed regions including a new multiple-demand (MD) core, the multiple sensory regions at the temporo-occipital border(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>). However, more evidence is needed to uncover how the sensory cortex is a genuine cognitive core. The human extrastriate cortical region, middle temporal complex (MT+), locates at the temporo-occipital border(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>), and is a key region in the multiple representations of sensory flows (including optic, tactile, and auditory flows)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bedny et al., 2010</xref>; Ricciardi et al., 2007); this ideally suits it to be a new MD core. To further investigate this issue, this work conducted multi-level examination including biochemical (glutamatergic - gabaergic in MT+), regional-systemic (brain connectivity with MT+ - based), and behavioral (visual motion function in MT+) levels to reveal if the function of MT+ contributes to the visuo-spatial component of gF.</p>
<p>Using a well-known visual motion paradigm (center-surround antagonism)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>), Melnick et al found a strong link between suppression index (SI) of motion perception and the scores of the block design test (BDT, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WASI), which measures the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these findings, MT+ is likely to play a key role in MD system of gF. Strong connectivity between the core regions suggests a mechanism for large-scale information exchange and integration in the brain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbey, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cole et al., 2012</xref>). This potential conjunctive coding may overlap with the inhibition and/or excitation mechanism of MT+. Taken together, we hypothesized that 3D visuo-spatial intelligence (the performance of BDT) might be predicted by the inhibitory and/or excitation mechanisms in MT+ and the integrative functions connecting MT+ with frontal cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). To verify the specificity of MT+, we used primary visual cortex (V1) - based GABA/Glu as control as it mediates the 2D rather than 3D visual domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Born &amp; Bradley, 2005</xref>).</p>

The inhibition mechanism centered on MT+ GABA, including molecular level - the GABAergic inhibition in MT+ (green circle), brain connectivity of MT+ - frontal relating to MT+ GABA (blue circle), and perceptual suppression of visual motion (the behavioral presentation of MT+ function, red circle), contributes to the visuo-spatial component of gF (3D domain, yellow circle).

There was a structure MRI scanning before each MRS data acquisition.

<p>We employ ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology to reliably resolve GABA and Glu concentrations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ende, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Song et al., 2021</xref>), and first demonstrate GABAergic inhibition mechanisms (but not excitatory Glu) in MT+ region involve in the 3D visuo-spatial ability. Further, analysis of functional brain connectivity at rest reveals that the network (between MT+ and frontal cortex) relating to MT+ GABA and perceptual suppression contribute the visuo-spatial intelligence. Our results provide direct evidence that inhibitory mechanisms centered on GABA levels in MT+ region (a sensory cortex) mediate multi-level visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF thus drawing a direct connection of biochemistry, brain connectivity, and behavioral levels.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To determine whether the function of MT+ cortex contributes to visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF, we adopted the experimental design depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>. Participants underwent two MRI sessions: the first encompassing resting-state fMRI and magnetic resonance spectra (MRS), and the second solely involving MRS. A 30-minute interval separated these sessions, during which participants performed motion discrimination tasks (using center-surround antagonism stimuli)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>) and the block design test (BDT), which assesses the visuo-spatial ability (3D domain) of gF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>). Both the volume-of-interests (VOIs) of MRS scanning in the left MT+ (targeted brain area) and the left primary visual cortex (V1, control brain area) had dimensions of 2×2×2 cm<sup>3</sup>, and the MRS scanning sequences were randomized across the two sessions. The MT+ MRS VOIs were demarcated using an anatomical landmark(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>). For 14 subjects, we also utilized fMRI to functionally pinpoint the MT+ to validate the placement of the VOI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a, b</xref>). The V1 MRS VOIs were anatomically defined (Methods). Here, MRS data after extensive quality control (31/36 in MT+, and 28/36 in V1) were taken for further analysis (Methods).</p>

<title>GABA and Glu concentrations in MT+ and V1 and their relation to SI and BDT</title>
<p>An example of MRS from voxel located in MT+ is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>. LCModel fittings for GABA spectra from all subjects in MT+ (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and V1 (<italic>n</italic> = 28) are illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> (color scale presents the BDT scores). We discerned a significant association between the inter-subjects’ BDT scores and the GABA levels in MT+ voxels, but not in V1 voxels. Quantitative analysis displayed that BDT significantly correlates with GABA concentrations in MT+ voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). After using partial correlation to control for the effect of age, the relationship remains significant (<italic>r</italic><sub>partial</sub> = 0.43 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, 1 participant excluded due to the age greater than mean + 2.5SD) In contrast, there was no obvious correlation between BDT and GABA levels in V1 voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">figure supplement 1a</xref>). We show that SI significantly correlates with GABA levels in MT+ voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.44, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). In contrast, no significant correlation between SI and GABA concentrations in V1 voxels was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">figure supplement 1b</xref>). This finding supports the hypothesis that motion perception is associated with neural activity in MT+ area, but not in V1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>Unlike in the case of GABA, no significant correlations between BDT and Glu levels were found in both MT+ and V1 voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). While, as expected(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Song et al., 2021</xref>), we observed significant positive correlations between GABA and Glu concentrations in both MT+ (<italic>r</italic> = 0.62, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>n</italic> = 31) and V1 voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.56, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <italic>n</italic> = 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">figure supplement 3a, b</xref>). Additionally, a significant correlation between SI and BDT was discerned (<italic>r</italic> = 0.51, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <italic>n</italic> = 34, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">figure supplement 4a</xref>, <italic>r</italic><sub>partial</sub> = 0.67, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 1 participant excluded due to the age greater than mean + 2.5SD), corroborating previous conclusions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>).

<title>MT - frontal FC relates to SI and BDT</title>
<p>We next took the left MT+ as the seed region and separately measured interregional FCs between the seed region and each voxel in the frontal regions (a priori search space). These measurements were correlated with performance in 3D visuospatial ability (BDT) to identify FCs with significant correlations. Results from connectivity-BDT analysis are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. We found that brain regions with FC strength to the seed region (left MT+) significantly correlated with BDT scores were situated within the canonical cognitive cores of MD system or FPN (Brodmann areas (BAs) 6, 9, 10, 46, 47)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gray et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007</xref>). Across the whole brain search, the similar FCs (between MT+ and frontal cognitive cores) still showed significant correlations with BDT scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table supplement 1</xref>) (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5a</xref>). Additionally, we identified certain parietal regions (BAs 7, 39, 40) with significant correlations between their connectivity to the left MT+ and the BDT scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table supplement 1</xref>) (also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">figure supplement 5a</xref>). These significant connections between MT+ and FPN/MD system suggest that left MT+ is involved in the efficient information integration network, serving as a maker of intellectual hub.</p>

<p>Then, we correlated MT+ - based global FCs with SI. Though spatial suppression during motion perception (quantified by SI) is considered to be the function of area MT+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>), the top-down modulation from the frontal cortex can increase surround suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Our connectivity-SI analysis in the frontal regions (a priori search space) displayed 3 brain regions in which FCs strength significantly correlated with SI: right BA4/6, left BA6, and right BA46 (summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table supplement 2</xref>, and shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Across the whole brain search, we identified total 7 brain regions in which FCs strength significantly correlated with SI, and 3 of these were in the frontal cortex.

<title>Local MT+ GABA acts on SI and BDT via global MT-frontal connectivity</title>
<p>To determine whether local neurotransmitter levels (such as GABA and Glu) in the MT+ region mediate the broader 3D visuo-spatial ability of BDT, which as a component of gF, is linked to the frontal cortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>), we correlated the significant FCs of MT – frontal in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> (also shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with the GABA and Glu levels in MT+ region. The results revealed that only two FCs significantly correlated with inhibitory GABA levels in MT+: 1) the FC of left MT+ - right BA 46 (significantly negative correlation, <italic>r</italic> = - 0.56, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, <italic>n</italic> = 29, FDR correction, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> left); 2) the FC of left MT+ - right BA 6 (significantly positive correlation, <italic>r</italic> = 0.69, <italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <italic>n</italic> = 29, FDR correction, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> left) (also shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There were no significant correlations between these FCs and the excitatory Glu levels in MT+ (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Across the whole brain search, we obtained the same two MT+ - frontal FCs significantly correlating with both MT+ GABA levels and BDT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table supplement 4</xref>), this is consistent with the results in a priori search space (frontal cortex) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We then correlated the significant FCs in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> (also in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Table supplement 2</xref>) with GABA and Glu concentrations in MT+ and found that almost all the correlations are significant except one (between the FC of left MT+ - right BA46 and the Glu levels in MT+) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls5">Table supplement 5</xref>). Among the three FCs, the clusters of two FCs have substantial voxel overlap with the FCs we found by the connectivity-BDT analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref>). Across the whole brain search, there were total 7 brain regions in which FCs strength were significantly correlated with SI, all the 7 FCs significantly correlated the MT+ GABA levels, while, no FC had significant correlation with the MT+ Glu levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls6">Table supplement 6</xref>). Taken together, our results displayed that the overlap FCs from the analyses of connectivity - behavior (BDT and SI)-GABA are the MT+ - BA 46 and MT+ - BA 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref>). These results suggest that the FCs of MT+ - frontal regions (BA 46 and BA 6) coupling with local MT+ GABA underlie the neural basis for both the simple motion perception (quantified by SI) and the complex 3D visuo-spatial ability (quantified by BDT).</p>

<p>In order to fully investigate the potential roles of multivariable contributing to BDT scores, serial mediation analyses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hayes, 2013</xref>) were applied to the MR and behavioral data. Following our hypothesis, the independent variable (X) is MT+ GABA, the dependent variable (Y) is BDT scores, the covariate is the age, and the mediators are FC (M1) and SI (M2). We used the overlap clusters from the analyses of connectivity-BDT-GABA and connectivity-SI-GABA to compute the FC of MT+ - BA46, 1 participant was excluded due to his age greater than mean + 2.5SD. The serial mediation model is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>. GABA levels in MT+ significantly negatively correlated with the FC of MT+ - BA46 (β = - 0.32, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), which in turn significantly negatively correlated with SI (β = - 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.035), and consequently, significantly positively correlated with BDT (β = 38.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009). Critically, bootstrapped analyses revealed that our hypothesized indirect effect (i.e., MT+ GABA → FC of MT+ - BA46 → SI → BDT) was significant (β = 2.28, SE = 1.54, 95% CI = [0.03, 5.94]). The model accounted for 34% of the variance in BDT. However, when considering the MT-BA6 FC as the mediator M1, the serial model does not show a significant indirect effect. Consequently, we explored a mediation model, which revealed that the MT-BA6 FC totally mediates the relationship between GABA and BDS. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). For sensitivity purposes, we tested the alternative models, in which the order of the mediators was reversed. The pathway that MT+ GABA was predicted to be associated with SI, followed by the FC of MT+ - BA 46, and then BDT, did not yield the chained mediation effects on BDT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">figure supplement 6</xref>).</p>
<p>To summarize (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), the results from the serial mediation analyses are consistent with our hypothesis. That is, higher GABAergic inhibition in MT+ relates to stronger negative FC between MT+ and BA46, leading to enhanced ability for surround suppression (filtering out irrelevant information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin, 2015</xref>), ultimately resulting in more efficient visual 3D processing of gF (the higher BDT scores).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide evidence that MT+ inhibitory mechanisms mediate processing in the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF on multiple levels, that is, from molecular over brain connectivity to behavior. First, this study found that higher MT+ inhibitory GABA levels (but not excitatory Glu) relate to FC between MT+ and BA 46 that contribute to both SI and BDT. Our serial mediation analyses indicate that the inhibitory mechanisms linking to MT+, including GABA levels in MT+ (but not Glu), FCs of MT+ - BA46 coupling with MT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu), and behavior (SI indexing perceptual suppression in MT+) predict the inter-subject variance in the 3D gF task (BDT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Second, we demonstrate discrete GABAergic inhibition mechanisms in MT+ that mediate the strong FCs between MT+ - frontal regions (BA46 and BA6): significant negative correlation with the FC of MT+ - BA 46 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), whereas significant positive correlation with the FC of MT+ - BA 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). This indicates that different frontal regions, DLPFC (BA 46) and premotor cortex (BA6), contribute uniquely to gF through MT+ - based inhibitory mechanisms.</p>
<p>The goal of our research is to reveal that the inhibitory (not excitatory) mechanism in MT+ contributes to multi-level processing in 3D visuo-spatial ability (BDT). Monkey electrophysiological experiments revealed that selective attention gates the visual cortex, including area MT, effectively suppressing the irrelevant information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Everling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Treue &amp; Maunsell, 1996</xref>). These findings aligns with the “neural efficiency” hypothesis of intelligence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Haier et al., 1988</xref>), which puts forward the human brain’s ability to suppress the repetition of information. Neural suppression is associated with the balance between excitation and inhibition (EIB), usually represented by covariation between Glutamate and GABA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>). Here, this study exploited the high spectral resolution afforded by ultrahigh field (7T) MRS to reliably resolve GABA measurement, adequately discriminate the glutamate and glutamine signals, and resolve the high accuracy Glu measurement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ende, 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>This work implemented the MRS scanning in MT+ (3D visual domain) and V1 (2D visual domain) regions and found that MT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu) significantly correlated with BDT, i.e., the higher GABA levels in MT+ (rather than excitatory Glu) relate to higher visual 3D processing (BDT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). We searched the global MT+ - based FCs with the connectivity-BDT analyses (in priori search space and whole brain search to valid), and then, correlated these significant FCs with the GABA and Glu concentrations in MT+, and found two FCs (MT+ - BA46 and MT+ - BA6) significantly correlating with MT+ inhibitory GABA (whereas no FC significantly correlated with MT+ excitatory Glu). Accordingly, our results emphasize the importance of MT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu) in processing the 3D visual-spatial intelligence (BDT). Crucially, a previous study has reported a strong link between motion spatial suppression (SI) and the performance of BDT(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>). Our recent human study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Song et al., 2021</xref>) and other study’s animal experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sato et al., 2016</xref>) demonstrated that the conjoint action of inhibition (GABA) and excitation (Glu) underlies visual spatial suppression.</p>
<p>In this work, our novel data show the chained mediation effects from local MT+GABA to more global BDT: MT+ GABA → FC (MT+ and BA46) → SI → BDT. Thereby, our data indicate that inhibitory mechanisms in MT+, from the biochemistry over FC to the behavioral level, can predict the inter-subject variance in the 3D gF task (BDT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>Another interesting finding reveal that GABAergic inhibition in MT+ coupling with distinct brain connectivity mechanisms between BA 46-MT+ and BA6-MT+. A previous human fMRI experiment found that the positive and negative correlations between BDT and the activation of frontal regions appeared at different reasoning phases (validation or integration phases during reasoning)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>). On the one hand, a monkey electrophysiological experiment reported the delayed modulation from PFC (especially in DLPFC (BA 46))) to area MT during a visual motion task(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zaksas &amp; Pasternak, 2006</xref>). Computational models converged with empirical data of awake monkey experiments present slow temporal modulation from PFC to MT/MST(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, human MEG studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wilming et al., 2020</xref>) reported that the gamma-band activity in the visual cortex (including area MT) exhibited high coherence with the activity in (pre-) motor regions (BA 4/6). These works suggest that the relation of long-range FC and local inhibition mechanism (MT+ GABA) might indicate that inhibition in MT+ contributes to efficient long-range integration and coordination in distant brain areas like the prefrontal and premotor cortex.</p>
<p>How does MT+ assemble into the MD system as an intellectual hub rather than a simple input module? The results in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, c</xref> showed that the overlap brain regions from the analyses of connectivity-BDT-GABA/connectivity-SI-GABA are the MT+ - BA 46. This overlap couples with local visual suppression (SI) and consequently plays an important role in intelligence (BDT). The direction discrimination task in this work (the visual motion paradigm of center-surround antagonism) was previously considered a mainly local function of MT+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>). However, our results with connectivity-SI analyses revealed that both local (FC within BA 18) and global brain connectivity (FC between MT+ and frontal regions) contribute to SI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table supplement 3</xref>). In human psychophysical experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>) the brief stimulus duration (∼100 ms) in motion discrimination precludes most top-down attentional effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zaksas &amp; Pasternak, 2006</xref>), while, attention, which predicted the performance of the motion discrimination task, was sustained throughout the stimulus intervals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, animal experiments have revealed that the local circuits in the visual cortex combing with the top-down modulation and intracortical horizontal connection mediate the visual-spatial suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Angelucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Keller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Our results (shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref>, right) present the intrinsic binding of local GABAergic inhibition in MT+, which suppressing redundancy of visual motion processing (SI), and the activity of brain connectivity between MT+ and frontal regions. These individually inherent traits may contribute to the individual difference in 3D visuo-spatial ability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a, b</xref>, left). A candidate divisive normalization model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Carandini &amp; Heeger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Reynolds &amp; Heeger, 2009</xref>) can explain how such reverberation affects the process of suppressing the irrelevant information, from perception to intelligence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Tadin, 2015</xref>). We summarize a framework (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) to indicate and visualize our findings.</p>
<p>Together, this study offers a comprehensive insight into how the information exchange and integration between the sensory cortex (MT+) and cognition core of BA 46, coupling with the MT+ GABA, can predict the performance of 3D visuo-spatial ability (BDT). Our results provide direct evidence that a sensory cortex (MT+), at biochemistry, connectivity, and behavior levels, can assemble into complex cognition as an intellectual hub.</p>

<p>Thirty-six healthy subjects (18 female, mean age: 23.6 years±2.1, range: 20 to 29 years) participated in this study, they were recruited from Zhejiang University. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. In addition, they reported no psychotropic medication use, no illicit drug use within the past month, no alcohol use within 3 days prior to scanning, and right-handed. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Zhejiang University and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All participants signed informed consent forms prior to the start of the study and were compensated for their time. All subjects participated in the motion spatial suppression psychophysical, resting-state fMRI and MRS (MT+ and V1 regions, in random sequence) experiments, but only part of the MRS data (31/36 in MT+ region and 28/36 in V1 region) survived quality control (see the part of MRS date processing).

<title>Motion surrounding suppression measurement</title>
<p>All stimuli were generated using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with Psychophysics Toolbox(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brainard, 1997</xref>), and were shown on a linearized monitor (1920×1080 resolution, 100-Hz refresh rate, Cambridge Research System, Kent, UK). The viewing distance was 72 cm from the screen, with the head stabilized by a chinrest. Stimuli were drawn against a gray (56 cd per m<sup>-2</sup>) background.</p>
<p>A schematic of the stimuli and trial sequences is shown in our recent study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Song et al., 2021</xref>). The stimulus was a vertical drifting sinusoidal grating (contrast, 50%; spatial frequency, 1 cycle/°; speed, 4°/s) of either small (diameter of 2°) or large (diameter of 10°) size. The edge of the grating was blurred with a raised cosine function (width, 0.3°). A cross was presented in the center of the screen at the beginning of each trial for 500ms, and participants were instructed to fixate at the cross and to keep fixating at the cross throughout the trial. In each trial, a grating of either large or small size was randomly presented at the center of the screen. The grating drifted either leftward or rightward, and participants were asked to judge the perceived moving direction by a key press. Response time was not limited. The grating was ramped on and off with a Gaussian temporal envelope, and the grating duration was defined as 1 SD of the Gaussian function. The duration was adaptively adjusted in each trial, and duration thresholds were estimated by a staircase procedure. Thresholds for large and small gratings were obtained from a 160-trial block that contained four interleaved 3-down/1-up staircases. For each participant, we computed the correct rate for different stimulus durations separately for each stimulus size. These values were then fitted to a cumulative Gaussian function, and the duration threshold corresponding to the 75% correct point on the psychometric function was estimated for each stimulus size.</p>
<p>Stimulus demonstration and practice trials were presented before the first run. Auditory feedback was provided for each wrong response. To quantify the spatial suppression strength, we calculated the spatial suppression index (SI), defined as the difference of log10 thresholds for large versus small stimuli(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>):

<title>MR experimental procedure</title>
<p>MR experiments were performed in a 7T whole body MR system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a Nova Medical 32 channel array head coil. Sessions included resting-state functional MRI, fMRI localizer scan, structural image scanning, and MRS scan. Resting-state scans were acquired with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution (transverse orientation, TR/TE = 2000/20.6 ms, 160 volumes, slice number = 90, flip angle = 70°, eyes closed). Structural images were acquired using a MP2RAGE sequence (TR/ TI1/ TI2 = 5000/901/3200 ms) with 0.7-mm isotropic resolution. MRS data were collected within two regions (MT+ and V1) for each subject, and we divided them into two sessions to avoid discomfort caused by long scanning. The order of MRS VOIs (MT+ and V1) in the two sessions was counterbalanced across participants. Interval between two sessions was used for block design and motion discrimination tasks. One session included fMRI localizer scan, structural image scanning, and MRS scan for the MT+ region; the other session included structural image scan, and MRS scan for the V1 region. Spectroscopy data were acquired using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS single-voxel short-TE STEAM (Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode) sequence(Frahm et al., 1989) (TE/TM/TR = 6/32/7100ms) with 4096 sampling points, 4-kHz bandwidth, 16 averages, 8 repetitions, 20×20×20 mm<sup>3</sup> VOI size, and VAPOR (variable power and optimized relaxation delays) water suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tkáč et al., 1999</xref>). Prior to acquisition, first- and second-order shims were adjusted using FASTMAP (fast, automatic shimming technique by mapping along projections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gruetter, 1993</xref>). Two non-suppressed water spectra were also acquired: one for phase and eddy current correction (only RF pulse, 4 averages) and another for metabolite quantification (VAPOR none, 4 averages). Voxels were positioned based on anatomical landmarks using a structural image scan collected in the same session, while avoiding contamination by CSF, bone, and fat. The MT+ VOIs were placed in the ventrolateral occipital lobe, which was based on anatomical landmarks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>). We did not distinguish between the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in these MT+ VOIs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Huk et al., 2002</xref>). For 14 subjects, we also functionally identified MT+ as a check on the placement of the VOI. A protocol was used with a drifting grating (15% contrast) alternated with a static grating across blocks (10 s block duration, 160 TRs total). Using fMRI BOLD signals, these localizer data were processed online to identify the MT+ voxels in the lateral occipital cortex, which responded more strongly to moving vs. static gratings. In addition, we only used the left MT+ as the target region to scan, which was motivated by studies showing that left MT+ was more effective at causing perceptual effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>). For V1 region, the VOI was positioned on each subject’s calcarine sulcus on the left side(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>) based on anatomical landmarks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boucard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>)</p>

The preprocessing steps included discard of the first five volumes, slice timing, realignment to the 90th slice, coregistration of each subject’s T1-weighted anatomical and functional images, segmentation of the anatomical images into six types of tissues using DARTEL, linear detrend, regressing nuisance variables (including realignment Friston 24-parameter, global signal, white matter and CSF signal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Friston et al., 1996</xref>), normalization to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space with the voxel size of 1.5× 1.5× 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup> using DARTEL, spatial smoothing with a Gaussian kernel of 3 mm full-width-half-maximum (FWHM), and band-pass filtering with Standard frequency band (SFB, 0.01–0.1 Hz). Spherical ROI with a radius of 6mm was placed in left MT. The coordinate for left MT (−46, −72, −4, in MNI space) was obtained by our localizer fMRI experiment. We calculated the seed-to-voxel whole brain FC map for each subject. All the FC values were Fisher-Z-transformed.</p>
<p>We did a similar connectivity-behavior analysis to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Song et al., 2008</xref>). First, we computed the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between BDT scores and the FC values across subjects in a voxel-based way. Then, to evaluate the significance, we transformed the <italic>r</italic>-value into <italic>t</italic>-value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="585863v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>df</italic> denotes to the degrees of freedom, and <italic>r</italic> is the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between BDT scores and the FC values. Here, <italic>df</italic> was equal to 27. The brain regions in which the FC values to the seed region was significantly correlated with the BDT scores were obtained with a threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005 for regions of <italic>a priori</italic> (|<italic>t</italic><sub>(27)</sub> | ≥ 3.057, and adjacent cluster size ≥ 23 voxels (AlphaSim corrected)), and <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 for whole-brain analyses (|<italic>t</italic> (27) | ≥ 2.771 and adjacent cluster size ≥ 37 voxels (AlphaSim corrected).</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>PROCESS version 3.4, a toolbox in SPSS, was used to examine the mediation model. There are some prerequisites for mediation analysis: the independent variable should be a significant predictor of the mediator, and the mediator should be a significant predictor of the dependent variable.</p>
<p>SPSS 20 (IBM, USA) was used to conduct all the remaining statistical analysis in the study. We evaluated the correlation of variables (GABA, Glu, SI, BDT) using Pearson’s correlation analysis. Differences or correlations were considered statistically significant if <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Significances with multiple comparisons were tested with false discovery rate (<italic>FDR</italic>) correction. The effect of age on intelligence was controlled for by using partial correlation in the correlation analysis and was taken as a covariate in the serial mediation model analysis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of human intelligence has been the focus of cognitive neuroscience research, and finding some objective behavioral or neural indicators of intelligence has been an ongoing problem for scientists for many years. Melnick et al, 2013 found for the first time that the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception predicts an individual's IQ score. This is because IQ is likely associated with the ability to suppress irrelevant information. In this study, a high-resolution MRS approach was used to test this theory. In this paper, the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception was found to be correlated with the visuo-spatial subtest of gF, while both variables were also correlated with the GABA concentration of MT+ in the human brain. In addition, there was no significant relationship with the excitatory transmitter Glu. At the same time, SI was also associated with MT+ and several frontal cortex FCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) 7T high-resolution MRS is used.</p>
<p>(2) This study combines the behavioral tests, MRS, and fMRI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the intro, it seems to me that the multiple-demand (MD) regions are the key in this study. However, I didn't see any results associated with the MD regions. Did I miss something??</p>
<p>(2) How was the sample size determined? Is it sufficient??</p>
<p>(3) In Schallmo elife 2018, there was no correlation between GABA concentration and SI. How can we justify the different results different here?</p>
<p>(4) Basically this study contains the data of SI, BDT, GABA in MT+ and V1, Glu in MT+ and V1-all 6 measurements. There should be 6x5/2 = 15 pairwise correlations. However, not all of these results are included in Figure 1 and supplementary 1-3. I understand that it is not necessary to include all figures. But I suggest reporting all values in one Table.</p>
<p>(5) In Melnick (2013), the IQ scores were measured by the full set of WAIS-III, including all subtests. However, this study only used the visual spatial domain of gF. I wonder why only the visuo-spatial subtest was used not the full WAIS-III?</p>
<p>(6) In the functional connectivity part, there is no explanation as to why only the left MT+ was set to the seed region. What is the problem with the right MT+?</p>
<p>(7) In Melnick (2013), the authors also reported the correlation between IQ and absolute duration thresholds of small and large stimuli. Please include these analyses as well.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Recent studies have identified specific regions within the occipito-temporal cortex as part of a broader fronto-parietal, domain-general, or &quot;multiple-demand&quot; (MD) network that mediates fluid intelligence (gF). According to the abstract, the authors aim to explore the mechanistic roles of these occipito-temporal regions by examining GABA/glutamate concentrations. However, the introduction presents a different rationale: investigating whether area MT+ specifically, could be a core component of the MD network.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors provide evidence that GABA concentrations in MT+ and its functional connectivity with frontal areas significantly correlate with visuo-spatial intelligence performance. Additionally, serial mediation analysis suggests that inhibitory mechanisms in MT+ contribute to individual differences in a specific subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, which assesses visuo-spatial aspects of gF.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the findings are compelling and the analyses robust, the study's rationale and interpretations need strengthening. For instance, Assem et al. (2020) have previously defined the core and extended MD networks, identifying the occipito-temporal regions as TE1m and TE1p, which are located more rostrally than MT+. Area MT+ might overlap with brain regions identified previously in Fedorenko et al., 2013, however the authors attribute these activations to attentional enhancement of visual representations in the more difficult conditions of their tasks. For the aforementioned reasons, It is unclear why the authors chose MT+ as their focus. A stronger rationale for this selection is necessary and how it fits with the core/extended MD networks.</p>
<p>Moreover, although the study links MT+ inhibitory mechanisms to a visuo-spatial component of gF, this evidence alone may not suffice to position MT+ as a new core of the MD network. The MD network's definition typically encompasses a range of cognitive domains, including working memory, mathematics, language, and relational reasoning. Therefore, the claim that MT+ represents a new core of MD needs to be supported by more comprehensive evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript aims to understand the role of GABA-ergic inhibition in the human MT+ region in predicting visuo-spatial intelligence through a combination of behavioral measures, fMRI (for functional connectivity measurement), and MRS (for GABA/glutamate concentration measurement). While this is a commendable goal, it becomes apparent that the authors lack fundamental understanding of vision, intelligence, or the relevant literature. As a result, the execution of the research is less coherent, dampening the enthusiasm of the review.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive Approach: The study adopts a multi-level approach, i.e., neurochemical analysis of GABA levels, functional connectivity, and behavioral measures to provide a holistic understanding of the relationship between GABA-ergic inhibition and visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>
<p>(2) Sophisticated Techniques: The use of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology for measuring GABA and glutamate concentrations in the MT+ region is a recent development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Study Design and Hypothesis</p>
<p>
(1) The central hypothesis of the manuscript posits that &quot;3D visuo-spatial intelligence (the performance of BDT) might be predicted by the inhibitory and/or excitation mechanisms in MT+ and the integrative functions connecting MT+ with the frontal cortex.&quot; However, several issues arise:</p>
<p>
1.1 The Suppression Index depicted in Figure 1a, labeled as the &quot;behavior circle,&quot; appears irrelevant to the central hypothesis.</p>
<p>
1.2 The construct of 3D visuo-spatial intelligence, operationalized as the performance in the Block Design task, is inconsistently treated as another behavioral task throughout the manuscript, leading to confusion.</p>
<p>
1.3 The schematics in Figure 1a and Figure 6 appear too high-level to be falsifiable. It is suggested that the authors formulate specific and testable hypotheses and preregister them before data collection.</p>
<p>(2) Central to the hypothesis and design of the manuscript is a misinterpretation of a prior study by Melnick et al. (2013). While the original study identified a strong correlation between WAIS (IQ) and the Suppression Index (SI), the current manuscript erroneously asserts a specific relationship between the block design test (from WAIS) and SI. It should be noted that in the original paper, WAIS comprises Similarities, Vocabulary, Block design, and Matrix reasoning tests in Study 1, while the complete WAIS is used in Study 2. Did the authors conduct other WAIS subtests other than the block design task?</p>
<p>(3) Additionally, there are numerous misleading references and unsubstantiated claims throughout the manuscript. As an example of misleading reference, &quot;the human MT ... a key region in the multiple representations of sensory flows (including optic, tactile, and auditory flows) (Bedny et al., 2010; Ricciardi et al., 2007); this ideally suits it to be a new MD core.&quot; The two references in this sentence are claims about plasticity in the congenitally blind with sensory deprivation from birth, which is not really relevant to the proposal that hMT+ is a new MD core in healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>
Another example of unsubstantiated claim: the rationale for selecting V1 as the control region is based on the assertion that &quot;it mediates the 2D rather than 3D visual domain (Born &amp; Bradley, 2005)&quot;. That's not the point made in the Born &amp; Bradley (2005) paper on MT. It's crucial to note that V1 is where the initial binocular convergence occurs in cortex, i.e., inputs from both the right and left eyes to generate a perception of depth.</p>
<p>Results &amp; Discussion</p>
<p>
(1) The missing correlation between SI and BDT is crucial to the rest of the analysis. The authors should discuss whether they replicated the pattern of results from Melnick et al. (2013) despite using only one WAIS subtest.</p>
<p>(2) ROIs: can the authors clarify if the results are based on bilateral MT+/V1 or just those in the left hemisphere? Can the authors plot the MRS scan area in V1? I would be surprised if it's precise to V1 and doesn't spread to V2/3 (which is fine to report as early visual cortex).</p>
<p>(3) Did the authors examine V1 FC with either the frontal regions and/or whole brain, as a control analysis? If not, can the author justify why V1 serves as the control region only in the MRS but not in FC (Figure 4) or the mediation analysis (Figure 5)? That seems a little odd given that control analyses are needed to establish the specificity of the claim to MT+.</p>
<p>(4) It is not clear how to interpret the similarity or difference between panels a and b in Figure 4.</p>
<p>(5) SI is not relevant to the authors' priori hypothesis, but is included in several mediation analyses. Can the authors do model comparisons between the ones in Figure 5c, d, and Figure S6? In other words, is SI necessary in the mediation model? There seem discrepancies between the necessity of SI in Figures 5c/S6 vs. Figure 5d.</p>
<p>(6) The sudden appearance of &quot;efficient information&quot; in Figure 6, referring to the neural efficiency hypothesis, raises concerns. Efficient visual information processing occurs throughout the visual cortex, starting from V1. Thus, it appears somewhat selective to apply the neural efficiency hypothesis to MT+ in this context.</p>
<p>Transparency Issues:</p>
<p>
(1) Don't think it's acceptable to make the claim that &quot;All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary information&quot;. It is the results or visualizations of data analysis, rather than the raw data themselves, that are presented in the paper/supp info.</p>
<p>(2) No GitHub link has been provided in the manuscript to access the source data, which limits the reproducibility and transparency of the study.</p>
<p>Minor:</p>
<p>
&quot;Locates&quot; should be replaced with &quot;located&quot; throughout the paper. For example: &quot;To investigate this issue, this study selects the human MT complex (hMT+), a region located at the occipito-temporal border, which represents multiple sensory flows, as the target brain area.&quot;</p>
<p>Use &quot;hMT+&quot; instead of &quot;MT+&quot; to be consistent with the term in the literature.</p>
<p>&quot;Green circle&quot; in Figure 1 should be corrected to match its actual color.</p>
<p>The abbreviation for the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale should be &quot;WAIS,&quot; not &quot;WASI.&quot;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of human intelligence has been the focus of cognitive neuroscience research, and finding some objective behavioral or neural indicators of intelligence has been an ongoing problem for scientists for many years. Melnick et al, 2013 found for the first time that the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception predicts an individual's IQ score. This is because IQ is likely associated with the ability to suppress irrelevant information. In this study, a high-resolution MRS approach was used to test this theory.

In addition, there was no significant relationship with the excitatory transmitter Glu. At the same time, SI was also associated with MT+ and several frontal cortex FCs.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) In the intro, it seems to me that the multiple-demand (MD) regions are the key in this study. However, I didn't see any results associated with the MD regions. Did I miss something??</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. After careful consideration, we agree with your point of view. According to the results of Melnick 2013, the motion surround suppression (SI) and the time thresholds of small and large gratings representing hMT+ functionality are correlated with Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indicators, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. This suggests that hMT+ does have the potential to become the core of MD system. However, due to our results only delving into “the GABA-ergic inhibition in human MT predicts visuo-spatial intelligence mediated by reverberation with frontal cortex”, it is not yet sufficient to prove that hMT+is the core node of the MD system, we will adjust the explanatory logic of the article, that is, emphasizing the de-redundancy of hMT+ in visual-spatial intelligence and the improvement of information processing efficiency, while weakening the significance of hMT+ in MD systems.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) How was the sample size determined? Is it sufficient??</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. We use G*power to determine our sample size. In the study by Melnick (2013), they reported a medium effect between SI and Perception Reasoning sub-ability (r=0.47). Here we use this r value as the correlation coefficient (ρ H1), setting the power at the commonly used threshold of 0.8 and the alpha error probability at 0.05. The required sample size is calculated to be 26. This ensures that our study has adequate power to yield valid statistical results. Furthermore, compared to earlier within-subject studies like Schallmo et al.'s 2018 research, which used 22 datasets to examine GABA levels in MT+ and the early visual cortex (EVC), our study includes a more extensive dataset.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Schallmo elife 2018, there was no correlation between GABA concentration and SI. How can we justify the different results different here?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. There are several differences between us:</p>
<p>a. While the earlier study by Schallmo et al. (2018) employed 3T MRS, we utilize 7T MRS, enhancing our ability to detect and measure GABA with greater accuracy.</p>
<p>b. Schallmo elife 2018 choose to use the bilateral hMT+ as the MRS measurement region while we use the left hMT+. The reason why we focus on left hMT+ are describe in reviewer 1. (6). Briefly, use of left MT/V5 as a target was motivated by studies demonstrating that left MT/V5 TMS is more effective at causing perceptual effects (Tadin et al., 2011).</p>
<p>c. The resolution of MRS sequence in Schallmo elife 2018 is 3 cm isotropic voxel, while we apply 2 cm isotropic voxel. This helps us more precisely locate hMT+ and exclude more white matter signal.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Basically this study contains the data of SI, BDT, GABA in MT+ and V1, Glu in MT+ and V1-all 6 measurements. There should be 6x5/2 = 15 pairwise correlations. However, not all of these results are included in Figure 1 and supplementary 1-3. I understand that it is not necessary to include all figures. But I suggest reporting all values in one Table.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the good suggestion, we are planning to make a correlation matrix to reporting all values.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In Melnick (2013), the IQ scores were measured by the full set of WAIS-III, including all subtests. However, this study only used the visual spatial domain of gF. I wonder why only the visuo-spatial subtest was used not the full WAIS-III?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The decision was informed by Melnick’s findings which indicated high correlations between Surround suppression (SI) and the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indexes, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. It is well-established that the hMT+ region of the brain is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D perception). Furthermore, motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of hMT+, aligns closely with this region's activities. Given this context, the Perception Reasoning sub-ability was deemed to have the clearest mechanism for further exploration. Consequently, we selected the most representative subtest of Perception Reasoning—the Block Design Test—which primarily assesses 3D visual intelligence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In the functional connectivity part, there is no explanation as to why only the left MT+ was set to the seed region. What is the problem with the right MT+?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The main reason is that our MRS ROI is the left hMT+, we would like to make different models’ ROI consistent to each other. Use of left MT/V5 as a target was motivated by studies demonstrating that left MT/V5 TMS is more effective at causing perceptual effects (Tadin et al., 2011). In addition, we will check the results of our localizer to confirm whether similar findings are consistently replicated.</p>

<p>The authors provide evidence that GABA concentrations in MT+ and its functional connectivity with frontal areas significantly correlate with visuo-spatial intelligence performance. Additionally, serial mediation analysis suggests that inhibitory mechanisms in MT+ contribute to individual differences in a specific subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, which assesses visuo-spatial aspects of gF.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the findings are compelling and the analyses robust, the study's rationale and interpretations need strengthening. For instance, Assem et al. (2020) have previously defined the core and extended MD networks, identifying the occipito-temporal regions as TE1m and TE1p, which are located more rostrally than MT+. Area MT+ might overlap with brain regions identified previously in Fedorenko et al., 2013, however the authors attribute these activations to attentional enhancement of visual representations in the more difficult conditions of their tasks. For the aforementioned reasons, It is unclear why the authors chose MT+ as their focus. A stronger rationale for this selection is necessary and how it fits with the core/extended MD networks.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate reviewer’s opinions. The reason why we focus on hMT+ is following: According to the results of Melnick 2013, the motion surround suppression (SI) and the time thresholds of small and large gratings representing hMT+ functionality are correlated with Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indicators, with high correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. In addition, Fedorenko et al. 2013, the averaged MD activity region appears to overlap with hMT+. Based on these findings, we assume that hMT+ does have the potential to become the core of MD system.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Moreover, although the study links MT+ inhibitory mechanisms to a visuo-spatial component of gF, this evidence alone may not suffice to position MT+ as a new core of the MD network. The MD network's definition typically encompasses a range of cognitive domains, including working memory, mathematics, language, and relational reasoning. Therefore, the claim that MT+ represents a new core of MD needs to be supported by more comprehensive evidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. After careful consideration, we agree with your point of view. Due to our results only delving into visuo-spatial intelligence, it is not yet sufficient to prove that hMT is the core node of the MD system. We will adjust the explanatory logic of the article, that is, emphasizing the de-redundancy of hMT+in visual-spatial intelligence and the improvement of information processing efficiency, while weakening the significance of hMT+ in MD systems.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript aims to understand the role of GABA-ergic inhibition in the human MT+ region in predicting visuo-spatial intelligence through a combination of behavioral measures, fMRI (for functional connectivity measurement), and MRS (for GABA/glutamate concentration measurement). While this is a commendable goal, it becomes apparent that the authors lack fundamental understanding of vision, intelligence, or the relevant literature. As a result, the execution of the research is less coherent, dampening the enthusiasm of the review.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive Approach: The study adopts a multi-level approach, i.e., neurochemical analysis of GABA levels, functional connectivity, and behavioral measures to provide a holistic understanding of the relationship between GABA-ergic inhibition and visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>
<p>(2) Sophisticated Techniques: The use of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology for measuring GABA and glutamate concentrations in the MT+ region is a recent development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Study Design and Hypothesis</p>
<p>(1) The central hypothesis of the manuscript posits that &quot;3D visuo-spatial intelligence (the performance of BDT) might be predicted by the inhibitory and/or excitation mechanisms in MT+ and the integrative functions connecting MT+ with the frontal cortex.&quot; However, several issues arise:</p>
<p>(1.1) The Suppression Index depicted in Figure 1a, labeled as the &quot;behavior circle,&quot; appears irrelevant to the central hypothesis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In our study, the inhibitory mechanisms in hMT+ are conceptualized through two models: the neurotransmitter model and the behavior model. The Suppression Index is essential for elucidating the local inhibitory mechanisms within behavior model. However, we acknowledge that our initial presentation in the introduction may not have clearly articulated our hypothesis, potentially leading to misunderstandings. We plan to revise the introduction to better clarify these connections and ensure the relevance of the Suppression Index is comprehensively understood.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) The construct of 3D visuo-spatial intelligence, operationalized as the performance in the Block Design task, is inconsistently treated as another behavioral task throughout the manuscript, leading to confusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We acknowledge that our manuscript may have inconsistently presented this construct across different sections, causing confusion. To address this, we plan to ensure a consistent description of 3D visuo-spatial intelligence in both the introduction and the discussion sections. But we would like to maintain 'Block Design task score' within the results section to help readers clarify which subtest we use.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.3) The schematics in Figure 1a and Figure 6 appear too high-level to be falsifiable. It is suggested that the authors formulate specific and testable hypotheses and preregister them before data collection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We are planning to revise the Figure 1a and make it less abstract and more logical. For Figure 6, the schematic represents our theoretical framework of how hMT+ works in the 3D viso-spatial intelligence, we believe the elements within this framework are grounded in related theories and supported by evidence discussed in our results and discussions section, making them specific and testable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Central to the hypothesis and design of the manuscript is a misinterpretation of a prior study by Melnick et al. (2013). While the original study identified a strong correlation between WAIS (IQ) and the Suppression Index (SI), the current manuscript erroneously asserts a specific relationship between the block design test (from WAIS) and SI. It should be noted that in the original paper, WAIS comprises Similarities, Vocabulary, Block design, and Matrix reasoning tests in Study 1, while the complete WAIS is used in Study 2. Did the authors conduct other WAIS subtests other than the block design task?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. Reviewer #1 also asked this question, we copy the answers in here “The decision was informed by Melnick’s findings which indicated high correlations between Surround suppression (SI) and the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indexes, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. It is well-established that the hMT+ region of the brain is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D perception). Furthermore, motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of hMT+, aligns closely with this region's activities. Given this context, the Perception Reasoning sub-ability was deemed to have the clearest mechanism for further exploration. Consequently, we selected the most representative subtest of Perception Reasoning—the Block Design Test—which primarily assesses 3D visual intelligence.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Additionally, there are numerous misleading references and unsubstantiated claims throughout the manuscript. As an example of misleading reference, &quot;the human MT ... a key region in the multiple representations of sensory flows (including optic, tactile, and auditory flows) (Bedny et al., 2010; Ricciardi et al., 2007); this ideally suits it to be a new MD core.&quot; The two references in this sentence are claims about plasticity in the congenitally blind with sensory deprivation from birth, which is not really relevant to the proposal that hMT+ is a new MD core in healthy volunteers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have carefully read the corresponding references and considered the corresponding theories and agree with these comments. Due to our results only delving into “the GABA-ergic inhibition in human MT predicts visuo-spatial intelligence mediated by reverberation with frontal cortex”, it is not yet sufficient to prove that hMT+ is the core node of the MD system, we will adjust the explanatory logic of the article, that is, emphasizing the de redundancy of hMT+in visual-spatial intelligence and the improvement of information processing efficiency, while weakening the significance of hMT+ in MD systems. In addition, regarding the potential central role of hMT+ in the MD system, we agree with your view that research on hMT+ as a multisensory integration hub mainly focuses on developmental processes. Meanwhile, in adults, the MST region of hMT+ is considered a multisensory integration area for visual and vestibular inputs, which potentially supports the role of hMT+ in multitasking multisensory systems (Gu et al., J. Neurosci, 26(1), 73–85, 2006; Fetsch et al., Nat. Neurosci, 15, 146–154, 2012.). Further research could explore how other intelligence sub-ability such as working memory and language comprehension are facilitated by hMT+'s features.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another example of unsubstantiated claim: the rationale for selecting V1 as the control region is based on the assertion that &quot;it mediates the 2D rather than 3D visual domain (Born &amp; Bradley, 2005)&quot;. That's not the point made in the Born &amp; Bradley (2005) paper on MT. It's crucial to note that V1 is where the initial binocular convergence occurs in cortex, i.e., inputs from both the right and left eyes to generate a perception of depth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. We acknowledge the inappropriate citation of &quot;Born &amp; Bradley, 2005,&quot; which focuses solely on the structure and function of the visual area MT. However, we believe that choosing hMT+ as the domain for 3D visual analysis and V1 as the control region is justified. Cumming and DeAngelis (Annu Rev Neurosci, 24:203–238.2001) state that binocular disparity provides the visual system with information about the three-dimensional layout of the environment, and the link between perception and neuronal activity is stronger in the extrastriate cortex (especially MT) than in the primary visual cortex(V1). This supports our choice and emphasizes the relevance of MT+ in our study. We will revise our reference in the revised version.</p>

<p>Results &amp; Discussion</p>
<p>(1) The missing correlation between SI and BDT is crucial to the rest of the analysis. The authors should discuss whether they replicated the pattern of results from Melnick et al. (2013) despite using only one WAIS subtest.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for reviewer’s suggestion. Now the correlation result is placed in the supplemental material, we will put it back to the main text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) ROIs: can the authors clarify if the results are based on bilateral MT+/V1 or just those in the left hemisphere? Can the authors plot the MRS scan area in V1? I would be surprised if it's precise to V1 and doesn't spread to V2/3 (which is fine to report as early visual cortex).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for reviewer’s suggestion. We plan to draw the V1 ROI MRS scanning area and use the visual template to check if the scanning area contains V2/3. If it does, we will refer to it as the early visual cortex rather than specifically V1 in our reporting.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Did the authors examine V1 FC with either the frontal regions and/or whole brain, as a control analysis? If not, can the author justify why V1 serves as the control region only in the MRS but not in FC (Figure 4) or the mediation analysis (Figure 5)? That seems a little odd given that control analyses are needed to establish the specificity of the claim to MT+</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank for reviewer’s suggestion. We plan to do the V1 FC-behavior connection as control analysis. For mediation analysis, since V1 GABA/Glu has no correlation with BDT score, it is not sufficient to apply mediation analysis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is not clear how to interpret the similarity or difference between panels a and b in Figure 4.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We plan to further interpret the difference between a and b in the revised version. Panels a represents BDT score correlated hMT+-region FC, which is obviously involved in frontal cortex. While panels b represents SI correlated hMT+-region FC, which shows relatively less regions. The overlap region is what we are interested in and explain how local inhibitory mechanisms works in the 3D viso-spatial intelligence. In addition, we would like to revise Figure 4 and point out the overlap region.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) SI is not relevant to the authors‘ priori hypothesis, but is included in several mediation analyses. Can the authors do model comparisons between the ones in Figure 5c, d, and Figure S6? In other words, is SI necessary in the mediation model? There seem discrepancies between the necessity of SI in Figures 5c/S6 vs. Figure 5d.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. The relationship between the Suppression Index (SI) and our a priori hypotheses is elaborated in the response to reviewer 3, section (1). SI plays a crucial role in explicating how local inhibitory mechanisms function within the context of the 3D visuo-spatial task. Additionally, Figure 5c illustrates the interaction between the frontal cortex and hMT+, showing how the effects from the frontal cortex (BA46) on the Block Design Task are fully mediated by SI. This further underscores the significance of SI in our model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The sudden appearance of &quot;efficient information&quot; in Figure 6, referring to the neural efficiency hypothesis, raises concerns. Efficient visual information processing occurs throughout the visual cortex, starting from V1. Thus, it appears somewhat selective to apply the neural efficiency hypothesis to MT+ in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. There is no doubt that V1 involved in efficient visual information processing. However, in our result, the V1 GABA has no significant correlation between BDT score, suggesting that the V1 efficient processing might not sufficiently account for the individual differences in 3D viso-spatial intelligence. Additionally, we will clarify our use of the neural efficiency hypothesis by incorporating it into the introduction of our paper to better frame our argument.</p>

<p>Transparency Issues:</p>
<p>(1) Don't think it's acceptable to make the claim that &quot;All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary information&quot;. It is the results or visualizations of data analysis, rather than the raw data themselves, that are presented in the paper/supp info.</p>
