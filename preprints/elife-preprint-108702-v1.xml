<title>Abstract</title><p>The eye is a complex organ composed of two main structures – the retina and the lens. It forms by the invagination of the lens forming head surface ectoderm embedding into the forming optic cup. This “outside-in” mode of morphogenesis ensures that the light focusing lens is positioned centrally inside of the eye in the highly constrained environment of the developing embryo. Advances in stem cell biology in the last decade introduced organoids as model to study organogenesis under normal and diseased conditions. However, even though strikingly similar at some points, it remained elusive to which extend the generation of individual structural features in organoids recapitulates <italic>in vivo</italic> organogenesis. Here we describe the generation of fish ocular organoids composed of both, lens and retina, using pluripotent embryonic cells from medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>). Formation of the organoid lens followed the key molecular features of the process <italic>in vivo</italic>, including the establishment of lens progenitor cells and their subsequent differentiation into lens fiber cells. In a process dependent on the coordinated activity of BMP and FGF signaling, lens formation in ocular organoids was marked by the expression of key genes implicated in organismal lens development. Despite adhering to the basic molecular machinery of lens formation <italic>in vivo</italic>, the morphogenesis into a spherical lens followed an “inside-out” mode. Lens progenitor cells were initially established and differentiated into a spherical lens directly inside of the retina. Subsequent displacement of the lens from the center of the organoid towards its surface ultimately led to the formation of a cup-shaped retina with a centrally positioned lens. Our study highlights that the self-organization of the organoid can favor routes that were not selected for in the developing embryo. Those routes can lead to an alternative, though highly similar outcome with the respect to achieving specific structural features in an unconstrained, embryo-free environment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The tissues of the embryo develop in an evolutionarily selected confined space with robust physical and biochemical constraints. Precise spatio-temporal gradients of growth factors aligned with complex mechanical forces guide cell and tissue interactions, permitting the coordinated formation of functional tissues and organs. Eye development is an example of complex organ formation relying on the coordinated interactions of tissues of different embryonic origin. This ultimately results in the positioning of a light-focusing lens in the center of the light-sensing retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cardozo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Casey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chow and Lang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cvekl and Ashery-Padan, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>While the lens originates from the head surface ectoderm (SE), the retina originates from optic vesicle (OV), a lateral evagination of the forming diencephalon. In vertebrates, eye development is initiated at the end of gastrulation when the anterior ectoderm is patterned into the neural plate, non-neuronal ectoderm and the neural plate border at their interface. Lens-committed progenitors are first found in the anterior neural plate border, also called the anterior pre-placodal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bailey and Streit, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bhattacharyya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">McCabe and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Schlosser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Toro and Varga, 2007</xref>). Retina-committed progenitors, on the other hand, are established within the anterior neural plate, by the specification of the eye field, followed by the evagination of the optic vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adelmann, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Eagleson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Kenyon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Once the retina-forming OV contacts the lens-competent ectoderm, interactions of OV, SE and the surrounding tissues result in the formation of the lens placode within the head surface ectoderm. The concomitant invagination of lens placode and morphogenesis of the OV then lead to the formation of the lens vesicle in the center of the forming optic cup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Casey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chow and Lang, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cvekl and Ashery-Padan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>). Initially the lens vesicle is composed of lens progenitor cells. It is further patterned into lens epithelium at the anterior part of the lens, while posteriorly located progenitors differentiate into lens fiber cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Kallifatidis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). The differentiation of lens fiber cells is characterized by the production and accumulation of crystallin proteins, the main structural proteins of the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Cvekl et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Donaldson et al., 2017</xref>). This transition is marked by the extensive elongation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Fudge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Rao and Maddala, 2006</xref>) and the subsequent degradation of all organelles and de-nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bassnett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brennan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chaffee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Wride, 2011</xref>), minimizing light scattering and providing optimal refractive properties, all together resulting in the optical properties of the lens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bassnett et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies have shown that the conserved process of lens formation depends on the intricate interplay of intrinsic factors and extracellular signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Cvekl and Ashery-Padan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cvekl and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">McAvoy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ogino and Yasuda, 2000</xref>). The transcription factors <italic>Pax6</italic>, c-<italic>Maf, Sox1, Prox1, Hsf4, Six3</italic>, <italic>Foxe3</italic>, <italic>Pitx3</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> characterise early lens development and are directly involved in the processes of initial lens morphogenesis and lens fiber cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Cvekl and Duncan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Cvekl and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Lang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Ogino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ogino and Yasuda, 2000</xref>). Establishment of lens-competent progenitors as well as differentiation of lens fiber cells relies on the interplay of the FGF, BMP, and WNT signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Faber et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Furuta and Hogan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Grocott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Jarrin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Kreslova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Le and Musil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Litsiou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Lovicu and McAvoy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">McAvoy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Rajagopal et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Although many aspects of lens formation are well characterized, addressing the molecular mechanisms in the complex environment of the developing embryo is often challenging. Advances in stem cell and developmental biology allowed the introduction, fast development and prominent use of organoids as new models to study complex processes of <italic>ex vivo</italic> organ formation. Those allow to gain insight into cellular and molecular processes in normal and diseased conditions in a controlled and experimentally accessible <italic>in vitro</italic> environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hofer and Lutolf, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kretzschmar and Clevers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahu and Sharan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Mouse, human and fish pluripotent embryonic stem cells have been shown to self-organise into retinal tissue when aggregated and cultured under minimal growth factor 3D suspension culture conditions. Retinal organoids recapitulate key aspects of embryonic development with respect to cell fate commitment, tissue patterning, cell differentiation and physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kuwahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Völkner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zilova et al., 2021</xref>). Since the culture conditions for the generation of retinal organoids favor neuroectodermal differentiation over non-neuronal ectodermal fates, they did so far not allow for concomitant lens formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Kuwahara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zilova et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Generation of lens-like structures (lentoid bodies) by stepwise differentiation of human ES or iPS cells has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Cvekl and Camerino, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dincer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Leung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). However, most lens differentiation protocols directly favor the promotion of placodal fate on the expense of the neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dincer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). This rendered the generation of more complex organoids composed of cell types of diverse embryonic origin challenging. Interestingly, two independent studies had reported the appearance of lens marker-expressing cells in close vicinity to retina tissue in 3D organoid culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Gabriel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Mellough et al., 2015</xref>). However, considering the complex nature of tissue interactions required for the coordinated formation of both lens and retina <italic>in vivo</italic>, this raises the intriguing question of how a lens is formed in neuronal organoids and to what extend that process recapitulates <italic>in vivo</italic> organ formation.</p>
<p>Here we used organoids derived from <italic>Oryzias latipes</italic> blastula cells as a model system to investigate the formation of ocular organoids composed of both, retina and lens. By following the individual populations of lens– and retina-committed progenitors, we found that similar to the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, lens and retina originate from spatially confined and separated populations of progenitor cells. The subsequent differentiation into their respective lineages was found to be dependent on BMP and FGF signaling pathways. Their differentiation and morphogenesis are characterized by the expression of key regulatory factors implicated in eye (lens and retina) organogenesis, however following an entirely different morphogenetic route towards forming an eye cup enclosing a centrally positioned lens.</p>

<p>Aggregation of fish primary pluripotent cells in DMEM/F12-based differentiation media supplemented with 5% knockout serum replacement and 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4 (see Materials and Methods for detailed composition) resulted in the efficient formation of retinal organoids containing a single transparent, spherical lens-like structure surrounded by neuronal tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The lens-like structure was clearly visible at day 4 but first signs of its formation could be observed from day 2 onwards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>, asterisk). We showed that organoids were composed of both retina and lens tissue, arranged in a way that was reminiscent of the tissue arrangement in the embryonic eye by using reporter lines and molecular markers. Differentiated lens cells expressing crystallin were labelled in the <italic>Gaudí<sup>RSG</sup></italic> transgenic reporter line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Centanin et al., 2014</xref>) that carries a <italic>crystallin::ECFP</italic> (<italic>Cry::ECFP</italic>) reporter. Lens fiber cells were identified with the “lens fiber cell” marker antibody ZL-1 (referred to as LFC), and early and late lens cells were identified with an anti-Prox1 antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Prox1 is expressed by cells of the lens placode and differentiating lens fiber cells of different species including mouse, zebrafish and medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Mikula Mrstakova and Kozmik, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Pistocchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Wigle et al., 1999</xref>). Anti-LFC labels lens fiber cells in zebrafish and is suggested to target one of the crystallin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Greiling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Shi et al., 2006</xref>). In the medaka embryo, the expression of both, crystallin promoter-driven ECFP and LFC marker was observed exclusively in the lens 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). Prox1 immunolabeling was detected in the lens and a subpopulation of differentiating retinal cells in the central region of the retina (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). The expression of all three lens markers was detected in day 4 ocular organoids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), demonstrating that the spherical structure formed by the organoids is indeed the lens. ECFP labeling was sparse (25 % <italic>Cry::ECFP</italic>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>) reflecting the mode of generation of the organoids by a combination of 25 % cells carrying the <italic>Cry::ECFP</italic> reporter and 75 % wild-type cells (see Materials and Methods for details).</p>

<p>The transgenic reporter lines <italic>Atoh7::EGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Del Bene et al., 2007</xref>) and <italic>Rx3::H2B-GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Rembold et al., 2006</xref>) were used to identify retinal tissue in lens carrying organoids. In embryos <italic>Atoh7::EGFP</italic> activity was confined to the retina, labelling differentiating retinal neurons at 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>). In organoids, labeled retinal cells surrounded the forming lens, reminiscent of the situation in the eye. To address the distribution of retinal and lens cells we used blastula cells from <italic>Atoh7::EGFP</italic> and <italic>Rx3::H2B-GFP</italic> retina-specific reporter lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) and co-labeled <italic>Rx3::H2B-GFP</italic>-derived day 4 organoids with anti-LFC antibody (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of the organoid lens revealed a great similarity with structural features of the developing embryonic lens, such as the elongation of Prox1<sup>+</sup>/LFC<sup>+</sup> cells, typical for differentiating lens fiber cells and atypically looking nuclei indicating disorganization of nuclear material, a process tightly connected to lens fiber cell differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>, arrowhead).</p>
<p>In 462 organoids derived from 38 independent experiments we observed lens formation, in 83.5 % (n=386) of organoids. A careful evaluation of different culture conditions and their impact on the lens formation revealed that lens formation depends on supplementation of the DMEM/F12-based differentiation media with 20 mM HEPES buffer (Figure S1a and 1b). While organoids grown without HEPES supplementation never formed lenses (n=63 organoids in 6 independent experiments, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zilova et al., 2021</xref>), 92 % of organoids grown in media supplemented with HEPES (n=83 organoids in 6 independent experiments) formed lenses (Figure S1b).</p>
<p>We tested the impact of extracellular matrix (ECM) supplementation on lens formation, as existing protocols for generation of lentoid bodies from human pluripotent embryonic stem cells mostly rely on supplementation with ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dincer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Leung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 2010</xref>), usually in form of Matrigel. Interestingly, lens cell fate specification as well as lens fiber cell differentiation, judged by the expression of Prox1 and LFC, occurred independently of Matrigel (2 % final concentration) supplementation in medaka-derived organoids (Figure S1c).</p>

<title>The lens originates from a spatially distinct population of placodal progenitors located in the central region of the organoid</title>
<p>We further investigated the origin of lens cells and how its formation compares to lens development <italic>in vivo</italic> in the developing organism. In the embryo, the lens originates from the lens competent head surface ectoderm (SE, magenta), which directly abuts the evaginating optic vesicle (OV, prospective retina, green) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). OV and SE invaginate in a coordinated way to form a lens sphere surrounded by the retina. In medaka embryos, those processes occur between 1 dpf and 2 dpf (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, 3b). Concomitant with the completion of lens formation, the differentiation of lens fiber cells is initiated and marked by the expression of crystallin proteins (LFC; cyan) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). To track the distribution of lens and retinal progenitors, we generated organoids from the <italic>Rx3::H2B-GFP</italic> reporter line, which highlights retina-committed cells by nuclear GFP expression (Figure S2a and 2b). To visualize lens-committed progenitor cells within the SE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Mikula Mrstakova and Kozmik, 2024</xref>), we co-labeled those organoids with an anti-Prox1 antibody (Figure S2b) and followed the expression of <italic>Rx3</italic>-specific GFP and Prox1 from day 1 to day 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Retinal progenitor cells were distinctly localized in the cortical region around the surface of day 1 organoids (Figure S2d, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>, Video S1), while lens progenitors (expressing Prox1) were not detectable at this stage (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Expression of retinal markers was confined exclusively to the cortex and was never detected in the central part of the organoid (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>, Figure S2d, Video S1). From day 1.5 onwards (stage S22 – 1 day and 14 h) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Iwamatsu, 2004</xref>), embryos as well as organoids (30 hours post aggregation) started expressing Prox1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In the embryo, Prox1 expression was localized to the surface of the head, labeling the presumptive lens region (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>). In the organoid, the expression was confined to the central core of the organoid with Prox1<sup>+</sup> cells organized into a sphere (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Prox1 expression in the central core of the organoids was followed by the expression of lens fiber cell differentiation marker LFC at day 2, concomitant with the onset of Prox1 and crystallin expression in the embryo (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).</p>

<p>To specifically address the dynamics, onset, and cellular re-arrangements of lens-committed progenitors, we generated a <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> reporter line. <italic>Foxe3</italic> (winged helix/forkhead domain transcription factor) is necessary for proper lens development and is expressed by the cells of the presumptive lens ectoderm and lens epithelium of different species, including medaka (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blixt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brownell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Mikula Mrstakova and Kozmik, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Shi et al., 2006</xref>). This pattern is fully recapitulated by <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> with an onset of expression starting at 1 dpf (stage S20/S21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Iwamatsu, 2004</xref>). It was further expressed by the majority of lens cells at 2 dpf, where it preceded the expression of lens fiber cell marker LFC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). During development, the lens is composed of anteriorly located lens epithelium (proliferative lens progenitors) and posteriorly and centrally located differentiating lens fiber cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Greiling et al., 2010</xref>). We could differentiate those parts of the developing lens with <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> expression in both, lens fiber cells and lens epithelium in 3 dpf embryo, and the expression of Prox1 and LFC restricted to differentiating fiber cells, but excluded from the lens epithelium (Figure S3a, arrows). Analysis at later stages showed that at 4 dpf, <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> expression was maintained in the lens epithelium (proliferatively active progenitors) and was nearly undetectable in differentiated lens fiber cells (Figure S3b, arrows).</p>
<p>In organoids, lens progenitor cells expressing <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> were first found in the central core at day 1 (26 hours post aggregation) (Video S2, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, Video S3). These cells appeared in a pattern complementary to the retinal marker <italic>Rx3::H2B-GFP</italic> (Video S1), indicating that lens progenitor cells originate from a spatially distinct population in the central core of the organoid. We never detected any <italic>Rx3</italic>-positive cells eventually acquiring a lens fate. To address the distribution of lens and retina domains, we generated organoids from mixed blastula cells derived from the retina-specific reporter line <italic>Rx2::H2B-RFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Inoue and Wittbrodt, 2011</xref>) and the lens specific reporter line <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> (Figure S3c). By day 2, lens progenitor cells expressing <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic> contributed to the formation of a spherical lens in the central core of the organoid surrounded by unlabeled cells and eventually by the cortical retinal tissue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>, Video S4). This was confirmed by time-lapse imaging of ocular organoid development from day 1 to day 2 where <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic>-expressing cells appear initially in the core region of the organoid where they organize into a spherical lens within 16 hours (Video S2, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This process was accompanied by gradual displacement of the forming lens from center to the periphery where the lens is eventually reaching the surface of the organoid (Video S2, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<p>Further analysis showed that the organoid lens consists of proliferating as well as differentiating cells (Figure S3d and 3e), however not in distinct domains as in the embryo. We found that <italic>Foxe3-</italic>driven GFP was co-expressed with the LFC differentiation marker in day 2 organoids (Figure S3e). EdU incorporation also showed that the lens is formed by proliferative (EdU<sup>+</sup>) <italic>Foxe3::GFP</italic>-expressing cells (Figure S3d). On the surface of day 2 organoid lenses, we initially detected stretches of Foxe3<sup>+</sup>/LFC<sup>-</sup> cells, reminiscent of the lens progenitor cells of the lens epithelium (Figure S3e and 3f, arrows). However, at day 4, organoid lenses did not show any apparent lens epithelium (Prox1<sup>-</sup>/LFC<sup>-</sup>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). In fact, we did not detect any Prox1<sup>-</sup>/LFC<sup>-</sup> cells on the surface of the day 4 lenses, indicating that in organoid lenses a lens epithelium is absent at later stages.</p>

<title>Lens size scales with organoid size</title>
<p>Since retinal and lens progenitors occupied distinct regions within the organoid, we next investigated how their distribution is affected by total organoid size. We generated organoids from different numbers of cells at day 0 (4,000, 2,000, 1,000 and 500 cells). This approach resulted in organoids of different sizes at day 1: organoids derived from 4,000 cells had an average diameter of 521 ± 13 µm, those from 2,000 cells measured 379 ± 15 µm, from 1,000 cells 310 ± 22 µm, and from 500 cells 201 ± 55 µm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, 5b and 5d). Interestingly, the thickness of the tissue acquiring retinal progenitor cell identity in the cortex of the ocular organoid (<italic>Rx3::H2B-GFP</italic>) remained constant, independent of the initial size of the aggregate reaching to the depth of: 59.7 μm ± 1.6 μm for 4,000 cells; 55.6 ± 3.1 μm for 2,000 cells; 56.4 μm ± 3.2 μm for 1,000 cells and 55.4 μm ± 6.8 μm for 500 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). While the thickness of retinal neuroepithelium stayed constant, the lens size scaled proportionally with the size of the organoid. By day 4, larger organoids developed larger lenses, whereas smaller organoids formed smaller lenses (224 μm ± 12 μm for 4,000 cells; 199 μm ± 26 μm for 2,000 cells; 115 μm ± 33 μm for 1,000 cells and 68 μm ± 20 μm for 500 cells) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>). Although 500 cell derived organoids were able to form lenses, the efficiency of lens formation was considerably lower (33.3 %; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>) than in organoids of the bigger sizes (between 86.7 – 95 % for organoids generated by 1,000 or more cells) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>). Ocular organoids generated by the aggregation of less than 500 cells did not form any lenses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5g</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that lens size scales with the size of the organoid and is defined by the constant thickness of the forming retina.</p>

<title>Lens formation depends on temporal activity of FGF and BMP signaling</title>
<p>The competence to form a lens is established during the formation of the anterior neural plate within the region of the anterior neural plate border and is regulated by the coordinated activity of BMP and FGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Litsiou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Sjödal et al., 2007</xref>).

In contrast, inhibition of FGF signaling with SU5402-mediated did not affect initial lens formation if applied from day 0 to day 1 and allowed expression of both, lens placode and lens differentiation markers. However, it efficiently blocked the differentiation of lens fiber cells when applied from day 1 to day 2, and completely prevented the expression of the LFC marker (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref>, 6c and 6d). This indicates that similar to embryonic development, the establishment of lens competence (between day 0 and day 1) depends on the activity of BMP signaling, while FGF signaling is required for the lens differentiation process (day 1 to day 2).</p>

<p>Our comparative analysis indicates highly reminiscent gene expression patterns of key marker genes when comparing organoid and embryonic lens development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>, Data S1). This demonstrates that our conditions promote the development of ocular organoids in which the expression of key markers genes is temporally recapitulating the order of expression in the development of the embryonic lens.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> organoid development builds on the remarkable ability of embryonic stem cells or progenitor cells to autonomously self-organize in higher order structures with sophisticated microarchitecture, often closely resembling cell type compositions, 3D structure, and the function of the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Camp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dye et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Eiraku et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Lancaster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCracken et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we used medaka derived pluripotent cells as a model for the generation of complex ocular organoids composed of both, retina and lens. We showed that fish retinal organoids efficiently form embedded lenses, in a process that employs the molecular pathways including expression of key transcription factors and utilization of extracellular signaling pathways, as the embryo. In contrast to <italic>in vivo</italic> development, organoid cells did not follow the canonical process of lens formation, but used an alternative mode of cellular assembly to generate and grow the lens. While in the embryo, the lens sphere is shaped by the coordinated invagination of lens committed head surface ectoderm and retina-forming optic vesicle neuroepithelium, lens progenitors in the organoid were established in a different fashion directly inside of the retinal organoid to form the lens.</p>
<p>By following early progenitors of both retina (<italic>Rx3</italic>) and lens (<italic>Foxe3</italic>) we found that retina progenitor identity was acquired at the surface, while a spherical domain with lens progenitor identity was established in the center of the organoid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>). While in the embryo the lens originates from the head surface ectoderm, non-canonical routes to lens regeneration have been described in some species. In newts, the lens can be regenerated from the pigmented epithelial cells of the iris after injury or lens removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agata et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Grogg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Maki et al., 2007</xref>). Lens formation was also observed in the cultures of chick neuroretinal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Iida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Okada et al., 1975</xref>) showing that retinal-fated cells can give rise to lens cells under certain circumstances. However, in medaka ocular organoids, retina and lens are formed by spatially separated populations of retina– and lens-committed progenitor cells.</p>
<p>The size of the lens scaled with the size of the organoid and was limited by the volume of the organoid that acquired retinal fate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). The constant depth of retinal fated cells in the cortex under the surface of the organoid, regardless of the size of the aggregate, suggests that retinal fate is influenced by environmental gradients, which cause the diffusion-limited availability of retina-inducing factors. It has previously been shown that cells on the surface of the organoid experience higher level of oxygen tension, higher level of nutrients and signaling molecules than cells located more centrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Grün et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">McMurtrey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Qian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Tse et al., 2021</xref>) when grown in 3D suspension culture. Additionally, cells at the surface experience different mechanical forces, mostly due to the interactions with ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Vining and Mooney, 2017</xref>). Both, retinal as well as lens fates, were established either before ECM addition or in the absence of Matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Zilova et al., 2021</xref>, this study), making the environmental gradient more likely to contribute to the observed tissue arrangement in fish organoids.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Bmp inhibition in the early stages of organoid development, before the appearance of <italic>Foxe3</italic>-expressing lens progenitor cells (day 0 to day 1) completely abolished lens formation, while BMP inhibition during the lens formation process (from day 1 to day 2) did not show any impact. Thus, we hypothesize that a source of BMP in the forming neuroretina establishes initial lens competence in the center of the organoid. During normal development, BMP4 is secreted by the neuroepithelium of the developing OV and was found to be essential for lens induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Furuta and Hogan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Rajagopal et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, ablation of the prospective neuroectoderm in chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Kamachi et al., 1998</xref>) or defective OV formation in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Klimova and Kozmik, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Mathers et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Porter et al., 1997</xref>) prevents lens formation, indicating that the developing neuroepithelium stimulates lens formation within the pre-placodal ectoderm. The emergence of lens fate in the center of ocular organoids consequently depends on a critical threshold of the morphogen to be reached in the center. The scaling of lens size with organoid size supports this hypothesis as larger organoids are better suited to reach this threshold – potentially due to increased total ligand production (in the forming neuroretina) resulting in the formation of a more pronounced gradient.</p>
<p>During normal development, developing retinal cells have been suggested to serve as a source of FGFs stimulating expression of lens structural genes and inducing lens differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chow et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Faber et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gunhaga, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Le and Musil, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">McAvoy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Robinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, blocking of FGF signaling activity during organoid lens formation prevented lens differentiation. The dependency of lens formation on the activity of BMP and FGF signaling pathways has been well documented also in other <italic>in vitro</italic> systems where transient activation of BMP and FGF signaling is necessary for the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation of lens-like structures (lentoid bodies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dincer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Fu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Leung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Yang et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since organoids show remarkable similarities to their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts when it comes to cellular composition and key structural features, we naturally tend to infer that corresponding structures are formed by corresponding cellular processes in both systems. Here we show an example of an alternative mode of cellular assembly that leads to a similar structural and molecular outcome.</p>
<p>Organoids can recapitulate many aspects of embryonic development. However, the absence of embryonic constraints can lead to significant differences in tissue organization, cellular interactions, and overall structure. While the goal of many organoid studies is to replicate <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions as closely as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hofer and Lutolf, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Kretzschmar and Clevers, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Sahu and Sharan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>), the unconstrained environment of organoids offers a unique opportunity to tap the organoid’s potential of self-organization. This can uncover alternative developmental pathways that are not apparent <italic>in vivo</italic> and could expand our understanding of the plasticity, robustness and adaptability of developmental programs when unleashed from evolutionary constraints. Insights gained from alternative assembly processes could inform the design of synthetic biological systems and potentially lead to innovative strategies for creating complex tissues and organs <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates that ocular organoids can generate both retina and lens through a non-canonical, &quot;inside-out&quot; morphogenetic route. The work is <bold>solid</bold>, with well-designed experiments combining imaging, molecular analyses, and transcriptomics to establish that lens formation in organoids follows conserved molecular programs despite an alternative morphogenesis. These findings expand our understanding of self-organization and developmental plasticity, and will be of broad interest to researchers working on eye development, organoids, and tissue engineering.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors focused on medaka retinal organoids to investigate the mechanism underlying the eye cup morphogenesis. The authors succeeded to induce lens formation in fish retinal organoids using 3D suspension culture with minimal growth factor-containing media containing the Hepes. At day 1, Rx3:H2B-GFP＋ cells appear in the surface region of organoids. At day 1.5, Prox1+cells appear in the interface area between the organoid surface and the core of central cell mass, which develops a spherical-shaped lens later. So, Prox1+ cells covers the surface of the internal lens cell core. At day 2, foxe3:GFP+ cells appear in the Prox1+ area, where early lens fiber marker, LFC, starts to be expressed. In addition, foxe3:GFP+ cells show EdU+ incorporation, indicating that foxe3:GFP+ cells have lens epithelial cell-characters. At day 4, cry:EGFP+ cells differentiate inside the spherical lens core, whose surface area consists of LFC+ and Prox1+ cells. Furthermore, at day 4, the lens core moves towards the surface of retinal organoids to form an eyecup like structure, although this morphogenesis &quot;inside out&quot; mechanism is different from in vivo cellular &quot;outside -in&quot; mechanism of eye cup formation. From these data, the authors conclude that optic cup formation, especially the positioning of the lens, is established in retinal organoids though the different mechanism of in vivo morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Overall, manuscript presentation is nice. However, there are still obscure points to understand background mechanism. My comments are shown below.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) At the initial stage of retinal organoid morphogenesis, a spherical lens is centrally positioned inside the retinal organoids, by covering a central lens core by the outer cell sheet of retinal precursor cells. I wonder if the formation of this structure may be understood by differential cell adhesive activity or mechanical tension between lens core cells and retinal cell sheet, just like the previous study done by Heisenberg lab on the spatial patterning of endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm (Nat. Cell Biol. 10, 429 - 436 (2008)). Lens core cells may be integrated inside retinal cell mass by cell sorting through the direct interaction between retinal cells and lens cells, or between lens cells and the culture media. After day 1, it is also possible to understand that lens core moves towards the surface of retinal organoids, if adhesive/tensile force states of lens core cells may be change by secretion of extracellular matrix. I wonder if the authors measure physical property, adhesive activity and solidness, of retinal precursor cells and lens core cells. If retinal organoids at day 1 are dissociated and cultured again, do they show the same patterning of internal lens core covering by the outer retinal cell sheet?</p>
<p>(2) Optic cup is evaginated from the lateral wall of neuroepithelium of the diencephalon. In zebrafish, cell movement occurs from the pigment epithelium to the neural retina during eye morphogenesis in an FGF-dependent manner. How the medaka optic cup morphogenesis is coordinated? I also wonder if the authors conduct the tracking of cell migration during optic cup morphogenesis to reveal how cell migration and cell division are regulated in lens of the Medaka retinal organoids. It is also interesting to examine how retinal cell movement is coordinated during Medaka retinal organoids.</p>
<p>(3) The authors showed that blockade of FGF signaling affects lens fiber differentiation in day 1-2, whereas lens formation seems to be intact in the presence of FGF receptor inhibitor in day 0-1. I suggest the authors to examine which tissue is a target of FGF signaling in retinal organoids, using markers such as pea3, which is a downstream target of ERK branch of FGF signaling. Since FGF signaling promotes cell proliferation, is the lens core size normal in SU5402-treated organoids from day 0 to day 1?</p>
<p>(4) Fig. 3f and 3g indicate that there is some cell population located between foxe3:GFP+ cells and rx2:H2B-RFP+ cells. What kind of cell-type is occupied in the interface area between foxe3:GFP+ cells and rx2:H2B-RFP+ cells?</p>
<p>(5) Fig. 5e indicates the depth of Rx3 expression at day 1. Is the depth the thickness of Rx3 expressing cell sheet, which covers the central lens core in the organoids? If so, I wonder if total cell number of Rx3 expressing cell sheet may be different in each seeded-cell number, because thickness is the same across each seeded-cell number, but the surface area size may be different depending on underneath the lens core size. Please clarify this point.</p>
<p>(6) Noggin application inhibits lens formation at day 0-1. BMP signaling regulates formation of lens placode and olfactory placode at the early stage of development. It is interesting to examine whether Noggin-treated organoid expands olfactory placode area. Please check forebrain territory markers.</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>Strength: This study is unique. The authors examined eye cup morphogenesis using fish retinal organoids. Eye cup normally consists of the lens, the neural retina, pigment epithelium and optic stalk. However, retinal organoids seem to be simple and consists of two cell types, lens and retina. Interestingly, a similar optic cup-like structure is achieved in both cases; however, underlying mechanism is different. It is interesting to investigate how eye morphogenesis is regulated in retinal organoids, under the unconstrained embryo-free environment.</p>
<p>Limitation: Description is OK, but analysis is not much profound. It is necessary to apply a bit more molecular and cellular level analysis, such as tracking of cell movement and visualization of FGF signaling in organoid tissues.</p>
<p>Advancement: The current study is descriptive. Need some conceptual advance, which impact cell biology field or medical science.</p>
<p>Audience: The target audience of current study are still within ophthalmology and neuroscience community people, maybe translational/clinical rather than basic biology. To beyond specific fields, need to formulate a general principle for cell and developmental biology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study from Stahl et al., the authors demonstrate that medaka pluripotent embryonic cells can self-organise into eye organoids containing both retina and lens tissues. While these organoids can self-organize into an eye structure that resembles the vertebrate eye, they are built from a fundamentally different morphogenetic process - an &quot;inside-out&quot; mechanism where the lens forms centrally and moves outward, rather than the normal &quot;outside-in&quot; embryonic process. This is a very interesting discovery, both for our understanding of developmental biology and the potential for tissue engineering applications. The study would benefit from some additional experiments and a few clarifications. The authors suggest that the lens cells are the ones that move from the central to a more superficial position. Is this an active movement of lens cells or just the passive consequence of the retina cells acquiring a cup shape? Are the retina cells migrating behind the lens or the lens cells pushing outwards? High-resolution imaging of organoid cup formation, tracking retina cells in combination with membrane labeling of all cells would help elucidate the morphogenetic processes occurring in the organoids. Membrane labeling would also be useful as Prox1 positive lens cells appear elongated in embryos while in the organoids, cell shapes seem less organised, less compact and not elongated (for example as shown in Fig 3f,g).</p>
<p>The organoids could be a useful tool to address how cell fate is linked to cell shape acquisition. In the forming organoids, retinal tissue initially forms on the outside, while non-retinal tissue is located in the centre; this central tissue later expresses lens markers. Do the authors have any insights into why fate acquisition occurs in this pattern? Is there a difference in proliferation rates between the centrally located cells and the external ones? Could it be that highly proliferative cells give rise to neural retina (NR), while lower proliferating cells become lens?</p>
<p>What happens in organoids that do not form lenses? Do these organoids still generate foxe3 positive cells that fail to develop into a proper lens structure? And in the absence of lens formation, does the retina still acquire a cup shape?</p>
<p>The author suggest that lens formation occurs even in the absence of Matrigel. Is the process slower in these conditions? Are the resulting organoids smaller? While there are indeed some LFC expressing cells by day2, these cells are not very well organised and the pattern of expression seems dotty. Moreover, LFC staining seems to localise posterior to the LFC negative, lens-like structure (e.g. Fig.S1 3o'clock).</p>
<p>How do these organoids develop beyond day 4? Do they maintain their structural integrity at later stages?</p>
<p>The role of HEPES in promoting organoid formation is intriguing. Do the authors have any insights into why it is important in this context? Have the authors tried other culture conditions and does culture condition influence the morphogenetic pathways occurring within the organoids?</p>
<p>Significance:</p>
<p>This is a very interesting paper, and it will be important to determine whether this alternative morphogenetic process is specific to medaka or if similar developmental routes can be recapitulated in organoid cultures from other vertebrate species.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Stahl and colleagues reports an approach to generate ocular organoids composed of retinal and lens structures, derived from Medaka blastula cells. The authors present a comprehensive characterisation of the timeline followed by lens and retinal progenitors, showing these have distinct origins, and that they recapitulate the expression of differentiation markers found in vivo. Despite this molecular recapitulation, morphogenesis is strikingly different, with lens progenitors arising at the centre of the organoid, and subsequently translocating to the outside.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>- The manuscript presents a beautiful set of high-quality images showing expression of lens differentiation markers over time in the organoids. The set of experiments is very robust, with high numbers of organoids analysed and reproducible data. The mechanism by which lens specification is promoted in these organoids is, however, poorly analysed, and the reader does not get a clear understanding of what is different in these experiments, as compared to previous attempts, to support lens differentiation.

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The authors focused on medaka retinal organoids to investigate the mechanism underlying the eye cup morphogenesis. The authors succeeded to induce lens formation in fish retinal organoids using 3D suspension culture with minimal growth factor-containing media containing the Hepes. At day 1, Rx3:H2B-GFP＋ cells appear in the surface region of organoids. At day 1.5, Prox1+cells appear in the interface area between the organoid surface and the core of central cell mass, which develops a spherical-shaped lens later. So, Prox1+ cells covers the surface of the internal lens cell core. At day 2, foxe3:GFP+ cells appear in the Prox1+ area, where early lens fiber marker, LFC, starts to be expressed. In addition, foxe3:GFP+ cells show EdU+ incorporation, indicating that foxe3:GFP+ cells have lens epithelial cell-characters. At day 4, cry:EGFP+ cells differentiate inside the spherical lens core, whose the surface area consists of LFC+ and Prox1+ cells. Furthermore, at day 4, the lens core moves towards the surface of retinal organoids to form an eye-cup like structure, although this morphogenesis &quot;inside out&quot; mechanism is different from in vivo cellular &quot;outside -in&quot; mechanism of eye cup formation. From these data, the authors conclude that optic cup formation, especially the positioning of the lens, is established in retinal organoids though the different mechanism of in vivo morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Overall, manuscript presentation is nice. However, there are still obscure points to understand background mechanism. My comments are shown below.</p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) At the initial stage of retinal organoid morphogenesis, a spherical lens is centrally positioned inside the retinal organoids, by covering a central lens core by the outer cell sheet of retinal precursor cells. I wonder if the formation of this structure may be understood by differential cell adhesive activity or mechanical tension between lens core cells and retinal cell sheet, just like the previous study done by Heisenberg lab on the spatial patterning of endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm (Nat. Cell Biol. 10, 429 - 436 (2008)). Lens core cells may be integrated inside retinal cell mass by cell sorting through the direct interaction between retinal cells and lens cells, or between lens cells and the culture media. After day 1, it is also possible to understand that lens core moves towards the surface of retinal organoids, if adhesive/tensile force states of lens core cells may be change by secretion of extracellular matrix. I wonder if the authors measure physical property, adhesive activity and solidness, of retinal precursor cells and lens core cells. If retinal organoids at day 1 are dissociated and cultured again, do they show the same patterning of internal lens core covering by the outer retinal cell sheet?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question, whether different adhesive activity is involved in cell sorting and lens formation is indeed very intriguing. To address this point, we will include additional experiment (see Revision Plan, experiment 1). This experiment will be based on the dissociation and re-aggregation of lens-forming organoids as suggested by the reviewer. To monitor cell type specific sorting, we will employ a lens progenitor reporter line Foxe3::GFP and the retina-specific Rx2::H2B-RFP. If different adhesive activities of lens and retinal progenitor cells are involved and drive the process of cell sorting, dissociation and re-aggregation will result in cell sorting based on their identity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Optic cup is evaginated from the lateral wall of neuroepithelium of the diencephalon. In zebrafish, cell movement occurs from the pigment epithelium to the neural retina during eye morphogenesis in an FGF-dependent manner. How the medaka optic cup morphogenesis is coordinated? I also wonder if the authors conduct the tracking of cell migration during optic cup morphogenesis to reveal how cell migration and cell division are regulated in lens of the Medaka retinal organoids. It is also interesting to examine how retinal cell movement is coordinated during Medaka retinal organoids.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Looking into the detail of how optic cup-looking tissue arrangement of ocular organoids is achieved on cellular level is of course interesting. Our previous study showed that optic vesicles of medaka retinal organoids do not form optic cups (for details please see Zilova et al., 2021, eLIFE). We assume that the formation of cup-looking structure of the ocular organoids is mediated by the following processes: establishment of retina and lens domains at the specific region of the organoid – retina on the surface and lens in the center (see Figure S2 d and Figure 3e, and Figure 4). Further dislocation of the centrally formed lens towards the organoid periphery through the retina layer, places the lens to the periphery while retinal cells stay static. We assume that the “cup-like” shape is acquired by extrusion of the lens from the center of the organoid. To clarify this process with respect to tissue rearrangements and cell movements, we will include additional experiments (see Revision Plan, experiment 2) and follow lens- and retina-fated cells (by employing lens-specific Foxe3::GFP and retina-specific Rx2::H2B-RFP reporter lines) through the process of lens extrusion to dissect individual contribution of retinal/lens cells to this process (cross-reference with Reviewer #2).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors showed that blockade of FGF signaling affects lens fiber differentiation in day 1-2, whereas lens formation seems to be intact in the presence of FGF receptor inhibitor in day 0-1. I suggest the authors to examine which tissue is a target of FGF signaling in retinal organoids, using markers such as pea3, which is a downstream target of ERK branch of FGF signaling. Since FGF signaling promotes cell proliferation, is the lens core size normal in SU5402-treated organoids from day 0 to day 1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Assessing the activity of FGF signaling (cross-reference to Reviewer #3) in the organoids is indeed an important point. To address which tissue is the target of FGF signaling we will include additional experiments and assess the phosphorylation status of ERK (pERK) and expression of the ERK downstream target pea3, as suggested by the reviewer (see Revision Plan, experiment 3). That will allow to identify the tissue within the organoid responding to the Fgf signaling.</p>
<p>Lens core size of organoids treated with SU5402 from day 0 to day 1 is fully comparable to the control (please see Figure 6b).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Fig. 3f and 3g indicate that there is some cell population located between foxe3:GFP+ cells and rx2:H2B-RFP+ cells. What kind of cell-type is occupied in the interface area between foxe3:GFP+ cells and rx2:H2B-RFP+ cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That is for sure an interesting question. We are aware of this population of cells. We currently do not have data that would with certainty clarify the fate of those cells. We are currently following up on that question with the use of scRNA sequencing, however we will not be able to address this question in the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Fig. 5e indicates the depth of Rx3 expression at day 1. Is the depth the thickness of Rx3 expressing cell sheet, which covers the central lens core in the organoids? If so, I wonder if total cell number of Rx3 expressing cell sheet may be different in each seeded-cell number, because thickness is the same across each seeded-cell number, but the surface area size may be different depending on underneath the lens core size. Please clarify this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. Figure 5e indicates the thickness of the cell sheet expressing Rx3 that lies on the surface of the organoid. Indeed, the number of Rx3-expressing cells (and lens cells) scales with the size of the organoid as stated in the submitted manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Noggin application inhibits lens formation at day 0-1. BMP signaling regulates formation of lens placode and olfactory placode at the early stage of development. It is interesting to examine whether Noggin-treated organoid expands olfactory placode area. Please check forebrain territory markers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>What tissue differentiates at the expense of the lens in BMP inhibitor-treated organoids is of course an intriguing question. To address the identity of cells differentiated under this condition we will include an additional experiment (see Revision Plan, experiment 4 as suggested by the reviewer). We will check for the expression of Lhx2, Otx2 and Huc/D to address this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I have no minor comments</p>
<p><bold>Referees cross-commenting</bold></p>
<p>I agree that all reviewers have similar suggestions, which are reasonable and provided the same estimated time for revision.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>This study is unique. The authors examined eye cup morphogenesis using fish retinal organoids. Eye cup normally consists of the lens, the neural retina, pigment epithelium and optic stalk. However, retinal organoids seem to be simple and consists of two cell types, lens and retina. Interestingly, a similar optic cup-like structure is achieved in both cases; however, underlying mechanism is different. It is interesting to investigate how eye morphogenesis is regulated in retinal organoids,under the unconstrained embryo-free environment.</p>
<p>Limitation:</p>
<p>Description is OK, but analysis is not much profound. It is necessary to apply a bit more molecular and cellular level analysis, such as tracking of cell movement and visualization of FGF signnaling in organoid tissues.</p>
<p>Advancement:</p>
<p>The current study is descriptive. Need some conceptual advance, which impact cell biology field or medical science.</p>
<p>Audience:</p>
<p>The target audience of current study are still within ophthalmology and neuroscience community people, maybe translational/clinical rather than basic biology. To beyond specific fields, need to formulate a general principle for cell and developmental biology.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>In this study from Stahl et al., the authors demonstrate that medaka pluripotent embryonic cells can self-organise into eye organoids containing both retina and lens tissues. While these organoids can self-organize into an eye structure that resembles the vertebrate eye, they are built from a fundamentally different morphogenetic process – an “inside-out” mechanism where the lens forms centrally and moves outward, rather than the normal “outside-in” embryonic process. This is a very interesting discovery, both for our understanding of developmental biology and the potential for tissue engineering applications. The study would benefit from some additional experiments and a few clarifications.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that the lens cells are the ones that move from the central to a more superficial position. Is this an active movement of lens cells or just the passive consequence of the retina cells acquiring a cup shape? Are the retina cells migrating behind the lens or the lens cells pushing outwards? High-resolution imaging of organoid cup formation, tracking retina cells in combination with membrane labeling of all cells would help elucidate the morphogenetic processes occurring in the organoids. Membrane labeling would also be useful as Prox1 positive lens cells appear elongated in embryos while in the organoids, cell shapes seem less organised, less compact and not elongated (for example as shown in Fig 3f,g).</p>

<p>Looking into the detail of how optic cup-looking tissue arrangement of ocular organoids is achieved on cellular level is of course interesting. We assume that the formation of cup-looking structures of the ocular organoids is mediated by following processes: establishment of retina and lens domains at a specific region of the organoid – retina on the surface and lens in the center (see Figure S2 d and Figure 3e, and Figure 4). Further dislocation of centrally formed lenses towards the organoid periphery through the retina layer, place the lens to the periphery while retinal cells stay static. We assume that the “cup-like” shape is acquired by extrusion of the lens.

We will follow lens- and retina-fated cells (by employing lens-specific Foxe3::GFP and retina-specific Rx2::H2B-RFP reporter lines) through the process of lens extrusion to dissect the individual contribution of retinal/lens cells to this process (cross-reference with Reviewer #1).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The organoids could be a useful tool to address how cell fate is linked to cell shape acquisition. In the forming organoids, retinal tissue initially forms on the outside, while non-retinal tissue is located in the centre; this central tissue later expresses lens markers. Do the authors have any insights into why fate acquisition occurs in this pattern? Is there a difference in proliferation rates between the centrally located cells and the external ones? Could it be that highly proliferative cells give rise to neural retina (NR), while lower proliferating cells become lens?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The question how is the retinal and lens domain established in this specific manner is indeed intriguing and very interesting. We dedicated a part of the discussion to this topic. We discuss the role of the diffusion limit and the potential contribution of BMB and FGF signaling to this arrangement. Additional experiments (see Revision Plan, experiment 3) addressing the source and target tissues of FGF and BMP signaling in the organoid will ultimately bring more clarity to our understanding of the tissue arrangements in the organoid.</p>
<p>Although analysis of the proliferation rate of the cells at the surface and in the central region of the organoid might possibly show some differences in the proliferation rates between lens and retinal cells, we do not have any indications, that the proliferation rate itself would be instructive or superior to the cell fate decisions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What happens in organoids that do not form lenses? Do these organoids still generate foxe3 positive cells that fail to develop into a proper lens structure? And in the absence of lens formation, does the retina still acquire a cup shape?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Lens formation is primarily dependent on acquisition/specification of Foxe3-expressing lens placode progenitors. If those are not present, a lens does not develop. Once Foxe3-expressing progenitors are established, a lens is formed in unperturbed conditions (measured by the presence of expression of crystallin proteins). In such conditions, organoids that do not have a lens, do not carry Foxe3-expressing cells.</p>
<p>In the absence of the lens, the organoid is composed of retinal neuroepithelium, that does not form an optic cup (for details of such phenotypes please see Zilova et al., 2021, eLIFE).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The author suggest that lens formation occurs even in the absence of Matrigel. Is the process slower in these conditions? Are the resulting organoids smaller? While there are indeed some LFC expressing cells by day2, these cells are not very well organised and the pattern of expression seems dotty. Moreover, LFC staining seems to localise posterior to the LFC negative, lens-like structure (e.g. Fig.S1 3o’clock).</p>
<p>How do these organoids develop beyond day 4? Do they maintain their structural integrity at later stages?</p>
<p>The role of HEPES in promoting organoid formation is intriguing. Do the authors have any insights into why it is important in this context? Have the authors tried other culture conditions and does culture condition influence the morphogenetic pathways occurring within the organoids?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We were not clear in the wording and describing of our observation. Indeed, Matrigel is not required for acquisition of lens fate, which can be demonstrated with the expression of lens-specific markers. However, the presence of Matrigel has a profound impact on the structural aspects of organoid formation. Matrigel is essential for organization of retinal-committed cells into the retinal epithelium (Zilova et al., 2021, eLIFE). The absence of the structure of the retinal epithelium can indeed negatively impact on the cellular organization and the overall lens structure. To clarify the contribution of the Matrigel to the speed of organoid lens development and to the overall structure of the organoid lens we will perform additional experiments (see Revision Plan, experiment 5). With the use of Foxe3::GFP reporter line we will measure the onset of the lens-specific gene expression. In addition, we will use the immunohistochemistry to assess the gross morphology and size of the organoids grown without the Matrigel (cross-reference with Reviewer #3).</p>
<p>The role of the HEPES in lens formation is indeed very intriguing and currently under investigation. As HEPES is mainly used to regulate pH of the culture media and pH might have an impact on multiple cellular processes, it will require significant time investment to dissect molecular mechanism underlying the effect of HEPES on the process of lens formation (cross reference with Reviewer #3) and therefore cannot be addressed in the current manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Referees cross-commenting</bold></p>
<p>Pleased to see that all the other reviewers are positive about the study and raise similar concerns and comments</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Significance):</bold></p>
<p>This is a very interesting paper, and it will be important to determine whether this alternative morphogenetic process is specific to medaka or if similar developmental routes can be recapitulated in organoid cultures from other vertebrate species.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Stahl and colleagues reports an approach to generate ocular organoids composed of retinal and lens structures, derived from Medaka blastula cells. The authors present a comprehensive characterisation of the timeline followed by lens and retinal progenitors, showing these have distinct origins, and that they recapitulate the expression of differentiation markers found in vivo. Despite this molecular recapitulation, morphogenesis is strikingly different, with lens progenitors arising at the centre of the organoid, and subsequently translocating to the outside.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>- The manuscript presents a beautiful set of high quality images showing expression of lens differentiation markers over time in the organoids. The set of experiments is very robust, with high numbers of organoids analysed and reproducible data. The mechanism by which lens specification is promoted in these organoids is, however, poorly analysed, and the reader does not get a clear understanding of what is different in these experiments, as compared to previous attempts, to support lens differentiation. There is a mention to HEPES supplementation, but no further analysis is provided, and the fact that the process is independent of ECM contradicts, as the authors point out, previous reports. The manuscript would benefit from a more detailed analysis of the mechanisms that lead to lens differentiation in this setting.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Yes. The figures show the expression of lens and retinal markers in the embryo in later developmental stages and the timing of their expression can be documented with higher temporal resolution. In the revised version of the manuscript, we will provide the information about the onset of expression of Rx3::H2B-GFP (retina) and Foxe3::GFP (lens) (see Author response image 1). Rx3 represents one of the earlies markers labeling the presumptive eye field within the region of the anterior neural plate (S16, late gastrula). FoxE3::GFP expression can be detected within the head surface ectoderm before the lens placode is formed showing that Foxe3 is a suitable marker of placodal progenitors in medaka.</p>
<p>We are convinced that the onset of Rx3 and Foxe3-driven reporters is early enough to make the claim about the separate origin of the lens (placodal) and retinal (anterior neuroectoderm) tissues within the ocular organoids.</p>

<p>Indeed, addressing the source of BMP and FGF activation would bring more clarity in understanding the mechanism of retina/lens specification within the ocular organoids (cross reference with Reviewer #1). To address this point, we will include additional experiments (see Revision Plan, experiment 3).

<p>Revision Plan:</p>
<p>(1) To address whether differential adhesion properties of retinal and lens progenitors mediate cell sorting to establish retina and lens domains in the organoids (Reviewer #1, comment 1), we will perform dissociation of the organoids on day 1 and subsequential re-aggregation. This experiment will allow to follow cell type specific adhesion properties of lens and retinal progenitor cells. We will employ lens progenitor reporter line Foxe3::GFP and retina-specific Rx2::H2B-RFP to monitor cell type specific sorting with fluorescent microscopy.</p>
<p>(2)   Multiple reviewers (Reviewer #1, Reviewer #2, Reviewer #3) asked for the presentation of detailed in vivo imaging experiment showing individual contributions of retina- and lens- fated cells to the resulting tissue organization withing the ocular organoid. We will perform in vivo live imaging experiment to follow the movements of individual lens (Foxe3::GFP) and retinal (Rx2::H2B-GFP) cells from day 1 to day 2 of organoid development to address this point.</p>
<p>(3) Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #3 raised questions concerning the role of FGF and BMP signaling and sources of these signaling pathway activities in ocular organoid tissue arrangement. To address this point and bring more light into the molecular mechanisms regulating lens and retina tissue arrangement in the organoid, we will perform additional experiment. We will assess the expression of candidate FGF and BMP ligands (Fgf8, Bmp7 and Bmp4) and activation of downstream effectors (p-ERK, p-SMAD) and the direct transcriptional target of Fgf signaling (Pea3) in the developing organoids. This will allow the identification of the tissue producing the ligand on one site and tissue responding to the signaling on the other site and help out to narrow down the molecular mechanism controlling tissue arrangements in the organoid.</p>
<p>(4) We will analyze the expression of forebrain territory markers in organoids treated with the BMP inhibitor to identify the identity of the tissue differentiating at the expense of lens under the BMP inhibition (suggested by Reviewer #1). We will label Noggin-treated organoids with the antibodies against Lhx2, Otx2 and HuC/D to address this point.</p>
<p>(5) We will provide more comprehensive analysis of the organoids grown without the Matrigel and compare them to the organoids grown in the presence of the Matrigel (mentioned by Reviewer #2 and Reviewer #3). With the use of lens progenitor-specific Foxe3::GFP reporter line, we will measure the onset of the lens-specific gene expression. In addition, we will use the immunohistochemistry to assess the gross morphology and size of the organoids grown without the Matrigel.</p>

<p>Is there a difference in proliferation rates between the centrally located cells and the external ones? Could it be that highly proliferative cells give rise to neural retina (NR), while lower proliferating cells become lens?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Although analysis of the proliferation rate of the cells at the surface and in the central region of the organoid might possibly show some differences in the proliferation rates between lens and retinal cells, we do not have any indications, that the proliferation rate itself would be instructive or superior to the cell fate decisions.</p>
