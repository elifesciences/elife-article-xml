<title>Abstract</title><p>Two-photon (2P) fluorescence imaging through gradient index (GRIN) lens-based endoscopes is fundamental to investigate the functional properties of neural populations in deep brain circuits. However, GRIN lenses have intrinsic optical aberrations, which severely degrade their imaging performance. GRIN aberrations decrease the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of fluorescence signals, especially in lateral portions of the field-of-view (FOV), leading to restricted FOV and smaller number of recorded neurons. This is especially relevant for GRIN lenses of several millimeters in length, which are needed to reach the deeper regions of the rodent brain. We have previously demonstrated a novel method to enlarge the FOV and improve the spatial resolution of two-photon microendoscopes based on GRIN lenses of length &lt; 4.1 mm (Antonini et al. eLife 2020). However, previously developed microendoscopes were too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. In this study, we combined optical simulations with fabrication of aspherical polymer microlenses through three-dimensional (3D) microprinting to correct for optical aberrations in long (length &gt; 6 mm) GRIN lens-based microendoscopes (diameter, 500 µm). Long corrected microendoscopes had improved spatial resolution, enabling imaging in significantly enlarged FOVs. Moreover, using synthetic calcium data we showed that aberration correction enabled detection of cells with higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neurons. Finally, we applied long corrected microendoscopes to perform large-scale and high precision recordings of calcium signals in populations of neurons in the olfactory cortex, a brain region laying approximately 5 mm from the brain surface, of awake head-tethered mice. Long corrected microendoscopes are powerful new tools enabling population imaging with unprecedented large FOV and high spatial resolution in the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Combining GRIN lens-based endoscopy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> with 2P fluorescence imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> is a powerful approach to study the physiology of deep brain circuits. 2P microscopy enables structure-function analysis and the identification of the encoding properties of specific neuronal ensembles with high spatiotemporal resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> while GRIN lenses allow relaying the imaging plane deep within the scattering brain tissue. For example, in the mouse orbitofrontal cortex 2P microscopy through GRIN endoscopes showed that orbitofrontal neurons respond to either caloric rewards or social stimuli, indicating the presence of functionally distinct feeding and social neuronal subnetworks in this deep cortical region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Similarly, in the lateral hypothalamus combining GRIN endoscopes with 2P imaging revealed neurons encoding thermal punishment and reward and this subset of neurons was distinct from the ensemble of neurons encoding caloric reward <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Other ventral brain regions, such as the olfactory cortex, can be imaged with an invasive preparation, which does not require a GRIN lens but which is incompatible with imaging in awake behaving animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In the olfactory cortex, GRIN lens-based 2P endoscopy becomes necessary in awake animals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, where head tilting is not compatible with animal performance in a behavioral task.</p>
<p>One limitation of GRIN lens-based endoscopy is that GRIN lenses suffer from intrinsic optical aberrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. GRIN aberrations can be both on-axis and off-axis and severely degrade the quality of 2P imaging. GRIN aberrations distort the point spread function (PSF) and enlarge the excitation volume of the focal spot, leading to reduced SNR of fluorescence signals and decreased spatial resolution <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This effect is not uniform across the FOV and is particularly relevant in lateral portions of the FOV, generating uneven spatial resolution and inhomogeneous amplitude of fluorescence signals across the FOV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Various adaptive optics methods were developed to correct optical aberrations in GRIN lenses. For example, initial efforts utilized optical compensation by low-order electrostatic membrane mirror <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Alternatively, adaptive optics through pupil segmentation was used to efficiently correct GRIN aberrations, increasing the intensity of recorded fluorescence signals and enlarging the imaging FOV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. More recently, geometric transformation adaptive optics has been developed and applied for the correction of aberration in GRIN lenses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, adaptive optics approaches require substantial modification of the optical path of the microscope <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, needs <italic>ad-hoc</italic> software controls <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and may limit the temporal resolution of imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Alternatively, mm-size plano-convex lenses have been combined with GRIN lenses to correct on-axis aberrations and increase the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the optical system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. However, this method is difficult to apply to GRIN lenses of cross section smaller than 1 mm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, because of the difficulty in manufacturing high-precision optics with small radial dimension and complex profile. Recently, a novel method based on 3D microprinting of polymer optics was developed to correct for GRIN aberrations by placing aspherical corrective lenses at the back end of the GRIN lens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. This approach is attractive because it is built-in on the GRIN lens and corrected microendoscopes are ready-to-use, requiring no change in the optical set-up. However, previous work demonstrated feasibility of this method only for GRIN lenses of length &lt; 4.1 mm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, which are too short to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain.</p>
<p>In this study, we designed, developed and validated correction of optical aberrations in GRIN lenses of length 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm using a combination of ray-trace simulation, 3D microprinting by 2P lithography, simulated calcium data, and experimental characterization. Validation of the new corrected microendoscopes is provided with proof-of-principle experiments in a ventral brain region, the olfactory cortex, of awake head-fixed mice.</p>

<title>Design of aberration corrected microendoscopic probes based on long GRIN rods</title>
<p>We selected two GRIN singlet rod lenses (here on GRIN rods) suitable for multiphoton fluorescence imaging in ventral regions of the mouse brain. The two selected GRIN rods had NA = 0.5 on both sides, 500 µm diameter, 1.5 and 2.0 pitch, and 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm length, respectively. For both GRIN rods, we modeled an optical assembly composed of the GRIN rod, a thin layer of glass (representing a 100 µm thick glass coverslip) attached to the back end of the GRIN rod, and an aspheric corrective lens (here on called corrective lens) aligned to the rod and attached to the opposite side of the glass coverslip with respect to the GRIN rod (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). We designed the aspheric surface of the corrective lens using ray-trace simulations at the wavelength (λ<sub>exc</sub>) of 920 nm, the excitation wavelength commonly used for 2P imaging of the popular genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP. The design of the corrective lens was an iterative process in which the parameters that define the corrective lens surface were automatically varied to obtain the highest and most homogeneous spatial resolution possible over the longest possible radial distance from the optical axis (see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for details on simulation parameters). More specifically, we simulated the corrective lens profile such that the Strehl ratio (defined as the peak intensity of the focal spot of an aberrated optical system normalized to the peak intensity of the focal spot of the ideal optical system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>) of the corrected microendoscope remained above the threshold of 0.8 for the longest possible radial distance from the optical axis. The values of Strehl ratio equal to 0.8 corresponded to the lower bound of the diffraction-limited condition set by the Maréchal criterion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Our simulations showed that the profiles of the two corrective lenses displayed in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A, B led to an increase in the radius of the diffraction-limited FOV compared to the case in which the corrective lens was not positioned in the back end of the GRIN rods (uncorrected microendoscopes). The simulated increase in the radius of the diffraction-limited FOV was 5.4 times and 5.7 times for the 6.4 mm-long and 8.8 mm-long probe, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, E</xref>). To visualize the expected improvement of the spatial resolution in corrected microendoscopes, we simulated the PSF of uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes at different radial distances from the optical axis. For both the 6.4 mm-long and 8.8 mm-long GRIN rods, we found that the PSF of the uncorrected probe was strongly aberrated and highly irregular at ∼ 90 µm away from the center of the FOV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, F</xref>). In contrast, in the corrected microendoscopes the PSF had regular shape and, at &gt; 90 µm away from the optical axis, it was similar to the one measured at the center of the FOV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, F, see</xref> also <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Microfabrication of corrective lenses and assembly of long corrected microendoscopes</title>
<p>Due to the small size of the simulated corrective lenses (diameter: 500 µm; height: few tens of µm), we first used 3D microprinting based on 2P lithography to fabricate aspherical corrective lens prototypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. We then replicated the prototypes using a molding procedure <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The molding strategy enabled us to obtain large numbers of aspherical lens replica directly manufactured onto a round glass coverslip in a much faster and cheaper way compared to 3D microprinting. We checked that the surface of the corrective lenses was in good agreement with the simulated profile (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Next, we assembled microendoscopes following the scheme in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, using a plain coverslip for the uncorrected case, while we used a coverslip with a corrective lens replica for the corrected case (this applies to all the experiments described in the manuscript). In the assembly of the microendoscope, we attached the round coverslip to the annular support structure shown in (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, called hereon ring), which had two functions: <italic>i)</italic> to facilitate holding the probe during stereotactic surgery implantation; <italic>ii)</italic> to provide stability to the microendoscope once implanted on the animal skull. We used either metallic rings (external diameter: 7 mm) or plastic rings (external diameter: 4.5 mm). Plastic rings were specifically designed and 3D printed to be compatible with commercial holders (ProView Implant Kit, Inscopix Inc. Mountain View, CA) to ease stereotaxic implantation (see Materials and Methods). The alignment and assembly of all the microendoscope components was performed with a custom optomechanical set-up similar to that described in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Improved optical performance of long corrected microendoscopes</title>
<p>We tested the optical performance of the new corrected microendoscopes in 2P laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) using a pulsed laser tuned at 920 nm. Microendoscopes were coupled to the 2P microscope using a previously described customized mount <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To visualize the effect of the corrective lens on the axial extension of the excitation volume, we imaged subresolved homogenous fluorescent layers (layer thickness: ∼300 nm) using uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref> shows the <italic>x, z</italic> intensity projections of z-stacks acquired through the subresolved fluorescent layers under both conditions (i.e., uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes). Strong off-axis aberrations of the GRIN lens generated a significant loss of fluorescence intensity in the marginal portions of the FOV in uncorrected microendoscopes (both the 6.4 mm-long, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A, B, and</xref> the 8.8 mm-long, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>, D). In contrast, fluorescence signal was collected over longer distances from the center of the FOV in corrected microendoscopes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>). Moreover, for GRIN rods of both lengths the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the film profile obtained with uncorrected microendoscopes increased with distance from the optical axis and became rapidly larger than 20 µm. In contrast, the film profile obtained with corrected microendoscopes showed more homogenous FWHM values across an extended FOV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref>).</p>

<p>To evaluate the increase in area of the sample that could be imaged with the corrected microendoscopes, we first characterized potential distortion of the FOV introduced by the microendoscopes. Using a calibration ruler, we measured the local magnification factor at different radial distances from the optical axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E, F</xref>). We defined the local magnification factor as the ratio between the nominal pixel size (i.e. pixel size that applies to undistorted images collected with the microscope objective alone) and the real pixel size of the image collected with the same microendoscope objective coupled to the microendoscope (see Materials and Methods). Pixel size and distance displayed in the following panels and graphs are calibrated for FOV distortion and indicate real dimensions in the samples (see also Materials and Methods and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). We then measured the spatial resolution of microendoscopes by imaging subresolved fluorescent beads (bead diameter: 100 nm) located at different radial distances from the optical axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, J</xref>). We found that the axial dimension of the beads imaged with uncorrected microendoscopes rapidly increased with radial distance, whereas the spatial resolution of corrected microendoscopes remained more homogeneous over longer radial distances and more similar to the one measured on-axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G, J</xref> and <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). We set a threshold of 10 µm on the axial resolution to define the radius of the effective FOV (corresponding to the black triangles in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I, J</xref>) in uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes. We observed an enlargement of the effective FOV area of 4.7 times and 2.3 times for the 6.4 mm-long microendoscope and the 8.8 mm-long microendoscope, respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

<p>The optical characterization described above indicated that corrected microendoscopes of both lengths enabled imaging a larger FOV area compared to uncorrected microendoscopes. This result can be explained by the fact that corrected microendoscopes showed higher spatial resolution and increased probability of 2P fluorescence excitation in the marginal portions of the FOV. Corrected microendoscopes should therefore allow highly contrasted imaging of cell bodies and thin cellular processes over an extended FOV compared to uncorrected microendoscopes. Using both uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes, we confirmed these predictions by imaging the same region of a fixed brain slice expressing jGCaMP7f in neurons. We found that aberration correction enabled to clearly resolve neuronal somata and processes in the lateral portions of the FOV, whereas in the absence of the corrective lens the same structures located in the peripheral portion of the FOV appeared dim, strongly aberrated, and hardly detectable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<title>More accurate sampling of simulated neuronal activity with long corrected microendoscopes</title>
<p>Using simulated calcium t-series, we next evaluated the impact of the improved optical performance of long aberration corrected microendoscopes on the ability to extract information about neuronal activity. To this aim, we compared simulated calcium traces imaged with either uncorrected or corrected microendoscopes with the ground truth neuronal activity, i.e. the neuronal activity used to generate the simulated t-series. To build synthetic calcium data, we first generated neurons with 3D distribution and anatomical properties (i.e., cell size and cell density) similar to those measured in the mouse olfactory cortex <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, the ventral brain region which we will be imaging <italic>in vivo</italic> (see next section of Results), and the biophysical characteristics of one of the two indicators used in our experiments, jGCaMP8f <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (see also Materials and Methods). We then simulated the optical sampling of 3D volume of neurons with the PSF properties of the uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes characterized above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Fluorescence signals integrated over the PSF volume were then projected on a 2D matrix of pixels in time, with a frequency of 30 Hz, to obtain synthetic t-series (duration: 5 min, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, D</xref>). We finally detected neuronal cell bodies and extracted fluorescence traces from regions of interest (ROIs) of synthetic t-series using established methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> commonly applied to real data and compared between the case of uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes. We found that the use of corrected probes allowed segmenting more ROIs with high SNR compared to uncorrected microendoscopes, shifting the distribution of SNR across ROIs to higher mean SNR values. This was true for both the microendoscopes based on the 6.4 mm GRIN rod (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>) and the microendoscope based on the 8.8 mm long GRIN rod (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Moreover, for both microendoscope types, aberration correction increased the maximal radial distance at which ROIs with high (&gt; 15) SNR could be observed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, F</xref>). These findings demonstrate that correcting for optical aberrations increases the probability of recording ROIs with larger SNR of fluorescent signals.</p>

<p>The higher and more homogeneous axial resolution across the FOV afforded by the corrected probes could be useful not only to increase the SNR of neural calcium signals, but also to better isolate individual neurons, decreasing signal contamination across neighboring cells. To test this hypothesis, we considered correlations in “adjacent” simulated neurons, defined as pairs of neurons for which the distance between their centroids was ≤ 25 µm (the soma of excitatory neurons in the olfactory cortex is around 10 µm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). Compared to uncorrected probes, we found that corrected microendoscopes of both lengths led to lower fraction of pairs of adjacent cells whose activity correlated significantly more than expected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, F</xref> and <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 5</xref>), confirming reduced cross contamination among cells. The fraction of pairs of adjacent cells (out of the total number of adjacent pairs) whose activity correlated significantly more than expected increased as a function of the SNR threshold for corrected and uncorrected microendoscopes of both lengths (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A, F</xref>). This effect was due to a larger decrease of the total number of pairs of adjacent cells as a function of the SNR threshold compared to the decrease in the number of pairs of adjacent cells whose activity was more correlated than expected (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, in uncorrected microendoscopes the pairwise correlation of adjacent cells showed a larger linear dependence on the radial distance of the pair from the center of the FOV compared to corrected microendoscopes (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A, C</xref>, see also Materials and Methods). We interpreted these findings on correlated neuronal activity as due to the enlarged PSF of uncorrected microendoscopes in lateral portion of the FOV (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), leading to increased signal contamination by sampling across neurons. These results thus suggest that corrected microendoscopes decrease the artefactual correlation of nearby neurons by diminishing the spatial extension of the excitation volume used for sampling neuronal activity (PSF, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Using synthetic data, we could precisely quantify the extent to which correcting aberration in microendoscopes decreased mixing signals across neurons. For each ROI, we computed a general linear model (GLM) of the contributions to fluorescence signals of the activity of all ground truth simulated neurons, called “sources”, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C, G, H</xref>). From the GLM coefficients, we extracted a source “purity” index, which reached its highest possible value of 1 when only one source contributed to the calcium fluorescent trace in the considered ROI and had values &lt; 1 when different source neurons were mixed in the fluorescent signal of the considered ROI. For uncorrected microendoscopes of both lengths, we found that purity rapidly decreased with the radial distance of the ROI from the center of the FOV. In contrast, for corrected microendoscopes the purity index decreased far more slowly with the radial distance and the slope of the linear fit of the purity distribution as a function of the radial distance was significantly smaller than that of the uncorrected probe (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C, H</xref>). For any value of the SNR threshold used to select neurons, the purity index was also larger for corrected than for uncorrected probes (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B, D</xref>). Moreover, for each ROI we analyzed the correlation of the extracted traces with the most correlated ground truth neuron (“first ground truth source”) as a function of the radial distance of the ROI (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D, E, I, J</xref>). For microendoscopes of both lengths, we observed that ROIs from t-series generated with corrected microendoscopes displayed larger correlation with the ground truth signal of an individual neuron over longer distances from the optical axis, compared to uncorrected probes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E, J</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that corrected microendoscopes enabled more precise recording of individual cellular source neurons and enhanced demixing of signals coming from different neurons.</p>

<p>In recorded t-series, we first observed that the SNR of calcium events recorded in individual cells was constant across the FOV (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>).

We found no dependence of the pairwise correlation on the distance from the center of the FOV. In fact, the slope of the linear fit of pairwise correlation as a function of the radial distance was not significantly different from zero (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ventral regions of the brain, such as the olfactory cortex, the hypothalamus, and the amygdala play fundamental roles in controlling the processing of sensory information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, circadian rhythms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, hormone release <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, decision making <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and adaptation of instinctive and motivational behavior <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Since these ventral areas typically lay deeper than 4 mm down the brain surface in rodents and larger mammals (e.g., rats, cats, and marmosets), high resolution 2P imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> of these regions typically requires the use of light guides, which relay the focal plane of the microscope objective down to the target brain area. One popular solution for deep 2P imaging is using GRIN lenses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, cylindrical rod lenses characterized by refractive index which varies with the radial distance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Since inserting GRIN lenses in the brain damages the tissue above the target area <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, reducing the cross section of the GRIN lenses is desired when imaging these deep brain regions. However, GRIN lenses are not ideal optical elements and they have intrinsic optical aberrations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, which significantly degrade the PSF and reduce the effective FOV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. As a consequence of these intrinsic limitations, previous studies using GRIN lens 2P imaging in ventral regions of the mouse brain were limited to image a small number of neurons with uneven spatial resolution across the FOV and low SNR in lateral portion of the FOV <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Developing endoscopic probes with improved optical properties and more homogeneous spatial resolution, which are long enough to enable imaging in the most ventral regions of the rodent brain while maintaining a small (≤ 500 µm) cross section, is thus a compelling need in this field of research. In the current study, we developed, characterized, and validated new aberration corrected microendoscopic probes to address this critical need. Corrected microendoscopes had length of 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm (see Materials and Methods), allowing reaching the deepest structures of the mouse brain, and cross section of 500 µm. Corrected microendoscopes displayed improved spatial resolution across the FOV and significantly enlarged effective FOV. Moreover, in simulated calcium t-series we found that aberration correction led to higher SNR of fluorescent signals and decreased cross-contamination between neighboring neurons. In awake head-fixed mice, corrected microendoscopes were put to the test imaging neuronal circuits of the olfactory cortex, a brain area laying about 5 mm down the surface and involved in the processing of olfactory information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We first searched for the corrected microendoscope design using ray-trace simulations and identified the profile of the corrective optical elements, which, when placed in the back end of the GRIN rods, improved the optical performance of the long GRIN rods considered in this study. Ray-trace simulations showed strongly aberrated PSF in lateral portions of the FOV of uncorrected microendoscopes and predicted that single corrective optical elements with the aspherical profiles shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref> improved the optical performance of microendoscopes of either length. The profile of the identified corrective optical element was specific to the type of GRIN rod considered. In simulations, corrected microendoscopes showed improved and more homogeneous PSF across the FOV and enlarged effective FOV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Supported by the encouraging preliminary results of the simulations, we aimed to fabricate the identified corrective lenses. The challenge posed by the small cross section of the GRIN rods (500 µm), which we considered in this study, and the free-form profiles of the designed corrective microlenses could only be met by 2P lithography <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. The 2P lithography fabrication of these free-form corrective microlenses was successfully realized, achieving precise accuracy in the lens profiles and ensuring high-quality optical surfaces. Once corrective optical elements were fabricated, we optically characterized corrected microendoscopes using subresolved fluorescent beads and layers. We first observed that uncorrected microendoscopes of either length displayed strong astigmatism and had largely distorted PSF in lateral regions of the FOV. In corrected microendoscopes, we instead found that the PSF had regular shape and constrained values for larger radial distances, leading to more homogeneous spatial resolution across the FOV and enlarged effective FOV. Importantly, experimental values describing the improvement of the optical performance of the corrected microendoscopes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) were generally in good agreement with the prediction of the optical simulations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Did the improved optical properties of corrected microendoscopes increase the quality of imaging when corrected microendoscopes were applied to biological samples? We directly addressed this question by performing 2P imaging with uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes in brain slices in which neurons expressed a green fluorescent indicator. In uncorrected microendoscopes, we found that neuronal cell bodies were bright and well contrasted only in the center of the FOV and that neuronal cell bodies were dimmer and blurred in lateral regions of the FOV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Moreover, neuronal processes could be observed only in the center of the FOV and not in lateral portions of the FOV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, in corrected microendoscopes of either length, we found that neurons were bright and well contrasted across the whole FOV, which enabled distinguishing neurons, which were blurred and merged together when imaged with uncorrected microendoscopes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Furthermore, small neuronal processes could be observed throughout the entire FOV. These imaging findings in brain slices are in line with the results of the optical simulation and of the experimental characterization, which showed improved PSF and more homogeneous spatial resolution in corrected microendoscopes compared to uncorrected ones.</p>
<p>How does the improved optical performance of corrected microendoscope translate into enhanced ability to extract meaningful information from population of neurons in functional fluorescence imaging experiments? We addressed this question generating and analyzing synthetic calcium data in which we could compare the signals extracted from simulated recordings using uncorrected and corrected microendoscopes with the ground truth signals, which were used to generate the simulations. We found that the aberration correction led to an increase in the number of ROI with high SNR and, correspondingly, a decrease in the number of ROIs with low SNR. Moreover, aberration correction led to high and more stable purity of source demixing over radial distance, which, in turn, led to a major decrease in the artificial overestimation of correlations between adjacent neurons due to source mixing. Since investigating neuronal population codes needs quantification of neuronal activity with large SNR, high precision, and limited contamination, we expect the corrected microendoscopes presented in this manuscript will greatly contribute to the investigation of deep brain regions. In particular, the reduction of artificial overestimation of correlations due to source mixing appears crucial to precisely evaluate within-network neuron-to-neuron communication and investigate the role of correlations between neurons in population codes. Artificial correlations between nearby neurons would bias estimates of neuron-to-neuron communication toward overestimating communications at short distances. Moreover, because source mixing duplicates one neuron into another and thus can only increase redundancy, artificial correlations would also bias the effect of correlations on population coding by artificially inflating redundant correlations over synergistic interactions between neurons <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, correcting optical aberrations in GRIN lenses as presented in this study appears essential for the unbiased characterization of single-neuron and population codes in deeper brain structures.</p>
<p>We used long corrected microendoscopes to measure population dynamics in the olfactory cortex of awake head-restrained mice with unprecedentedly high spatial resolution across the FOV. In agreement with the results of our optical characterization and of the synthetic calcium data, we found that the SNR of calcium signals was independent on the radial distance and that high SNR calcium signals could be recorded across the whole FOV. Moreover, we observed that the correlation between calcium signals of adjacent neurons did not depend on the radial distance, in line with the more homogeneous PSF that characterizes corrected microendoscopes. The correlation between the calcium signals of any pair of neurons displayed, instead, a negative dependence on the distance between the two neurons. This decrease in correlation could reflect a slight change in the laminar position of recorded neurons or suggest a decrease in recurrent connectivity between neurons of the olfactory cortex with distance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In relationship to studies on the olfactory cortex, the improved optical characteristics of corrected microendoscopes increase our ability to understand the properties of this network in several fundamental ways. First, imaging more cells with increased SNR improves our ability to decipher information encoded by neural ensembles in the olfactory cortex. For example, we will be able to characterize the odor response properties of genetically defined subpopulations of olfactory cortex neurons, which may be too sparse to be reliably captured in the smaller effective FOV of uncorrected GRIN lenses. Second, imaging more cells with high SNR in each mouse will allow us to explore differences between individual mice, rather than pooling cells from different animals. Third, less cross-contamination of fluorescence signals improves cell segmentation and motion correction, which are major challenges when imaging mice that are awake or actively engaged in behavioral tasks <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Finally, improved cell segmentation facilitates cell tracking in chronic imaging experiments. Thus, corrected microendoscopes will enhance our ability to monitor individual cells over extended periods of time, for example while mice learn to perform an odor discrimination task <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Alternative methods to correct optical aberrations in GRIN lenses include, for example, low-order adaptive optics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, adaptive optics through pupil segmentation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and geometric transformation adaptive optics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In the first approach, an adaptive optics module comprising an electrostatic membrane mirror was introduced in the optical path of the 2P microscope and it was shown to significantly improve the microscope PSF <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. In adaptive optics through pupil segmentation instead, the objective rear lens was divided into N different subsections. By comparing images acquired with light going through each individual pupil segment with images acquired with light going through the whole pupil, local wavefront tilts introduced by aberrations were calculated and corrected for using a spatial light modulator (SLM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This method was applied to GRIN lens-based endoscopes of larger diameter (i.e., 1.4 mm) compared to the one used in this study (i.e., 0.5 mm) and it was shown to enlarge the effective FOV during 2P imaging <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Finally, in geometric transformation adaptive optics, a 90-degrees rotation was applied to the aberrated beam spatial profile exiting a first GRIN lens and the aberrated beam was passed through a second GRIN lens. This strategy was effective in correcting chromatic and volumetric aberrations in GRIN microendoscopes of small cross section (500 µm <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>). However, all adaptive optics methods described above require substantial change the optical set-up (e.g., the insertion of an SLM, membrane mirror, and additional optics) and the development of specific software control <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Additionally, under certain conditions pupil segmentation may limit the acquisition frame rate of the system <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In contrast to the methods described above, the long corrected microendoscopes presented in the current manuscript do not limit the temporal resolution of the acquisition system, require no modification of the hardware and software of the optical set-up, and are easily coupled to any standard 2P microscope. The corrected microendoscopes presented in this study thus represent a ready-to-use solution, which will likely ease the adoption of aberration correction in GRIN lens-based 2P functional imaging across experimental laboratories.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we designed, developed, and validated a new series of aberration-corrected GRIN lens-based microendoscopes, which are long enough to reach the most ventral regions of the mouse brain. Long corrected microendoscopes had improved axial resolution and several folds enlarged effective FOV. Importantly, these optical improvements enabled more precise extraction of single cell and population signals from 2P imaging recordings. We validated long corrected microendoscopes by performing functional imaging of the olfactory cortex circuits in awake head-fixed mice. Long corrected microendoscope provide a unique combination of high and homogenous optical properties across the FOV and minimal invasiveness. Furthermore, they do not require modification of the hardware and software of the optical microscope, providing a ready-to-use solution to experimental laboratories. We foresee that the long corrected microendoscopes developed in this study will drastically improve the yield of 2P imaging in deep brain areas of mice and larger mammals, such as rats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, cats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, and marmosets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Ray-trace simulations of corrected microendoscopes</title>
<p>To identify the design of the corrective optics to obtain aberration corrected microendoscopes, we performed ray-trace simulations using OpticStudio 15 (Zemax, Kirkland, WA, US) and integrating the optical model of two commercially available GRIN rods (NEM-050-25-10-860-S-1.5p and NEM-050-25-10-860-S-2.0p, GRIN needle endomicroscopes, GRINTECH Gmbh, Jena, Germany). The wavelength selected for simulations was 920 nm, the commonly used excitation wavelength for 2P imaging of green-emitting fluorescent indicators <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. In simulations, we placed the aspheric lens, whose refractive index corresponded to that of the UV-curable glue we used for microendoscope fabrication (NOA63, see also below), on one side and the back end of the GRIN rod on the other side. 100 µm of BK7 glass were interposed between the corrective lens and the GRIN rod. The profile of the aspheric lens was identified by optimizing a merit function, which took into account the Strehl ratio of focal spots simulated at different field radial distances (up to 200 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and up to 160 µm for the 8.8 mm-long GRIN rod) after being relayed by the optical assembly. During the optimization, the working distance was constrained to values compatible with neurophysiological experiments (∼180-220 µm) and the refractive indices simulated at the two ends of the optical assembly were 1 (air) and 1.33 (brain tissue). The following formula described the surface profile of aspheric lenses similarly to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>:

To compute the spatial resolution of simulated microendoscopes, we fitted x, y, z intensity profiles of the simulated PSFs with Gaussian curves. The ray-trace simulations demonstrated improved Strehl ratio values with GRIN lenses of slightly longer working distances (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Custom) compared to the two commercial GRIN rods initially considered (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, Commercial).

<title>Aspherical lens microprinting and microendoscope assembly</title>
<p>The aspheric profiles of the corrective lenses obtained with optical simulations were converted into 3D structure files by a CAD software (SolidWorks, Waltham, MA). The aspherical lens prototypes were then fabricated with a commercial 3D microprinter based on 2P polymerization (Photonic Professional GT2+, Nanoscribe, Karlsruhe, DE) using a proprietary photoresin (IP-S, Nanoscribe, Karlsruhe, DE) and a 25x 0.8-NA microscope objective in Dip-in Laser Lithography (DiLL) configuration. Once the lens’ volume was fully polymerized in Solid printing mode, the residual unpolymerized material was removed with immersion in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) for 10 minutes, followed by ∼ 5-minute immersion in isopropyl alcohol. The lens prototypes were finally coated with 200 nm of gold with a sputter coater and inspected with scanning electron microscopy to confirm absence of surface defects.</p>
<p>To enable fast manufacturing of multiple corrected microendoscopes, we generated replicas of the aspherical lenses using a molding procedure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) as in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We first fabricated negative molds with PDMS (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit, Dow, Midland, MI, US) casted onto the aspherical lens prototype and solidified at room temperature for 48 hours. We then deposited a small drop of optically transparent UV-curable glue (NOA63, Norland Products, Cranbury, NJ, US) to fill the negative mold. Extreme care was used to avoid bubble formation in this experimental step. We placed a round glass coverslip (coverslip diameter: 3 or 5 mm in diameter; coverslip thickness: 100 µm) on top of the drop of UV-curable glue and pressured it against the PDMS mold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). NOA63 was solidified with UV light exposure for 10 minutes. After UV curing, the coverslip with the attached corrective lens was sealed to a customized metal or plastic support ring of appropriate diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). The support ring, the coverslip and the aspherical lens formed the upper part of the corrected microendoscope, to be subsequently coupled to the proper GRIN rod (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) using a custom-built opto-mechanical stage and NOA63 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The GRIN rod was positioned perpendicularly to the glass coverslip, on the other side of the coverslip compared to the corrective lens, and aligned to the aspherical lens perimeter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

<title>Stylus profilometer measurements on polymeric corrective lenses</title>
<p>To measure the surface of the replicated corrective lenses, we used a stylus profilometer (stylus radius, 5 µm; applied “force”, 1 mg; horizontal resolution, 0.056 µm; Dektak 150 Profiler, Veeco, Plainview, NY). We measured the height of the surface of multiple polymer corrective lenses for both the microendoscope types. For each corrective lens replica, we measured the profile along three different diameters in order to evaluate potential asymmetries in the lens replication process. The radial profiles obtained for each microendoscope type were aligned and pooled together to calculate the average profile (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Optical characterization of corrected microendoscopes</title>
<p>We performed optical characterization of corrected and uncorrected microendoscopes using 2P laser scanning microscopes equipped with femtosecond tunable laser sources (80 MHz repetition rate, Chameleon Ultra II or Chameleon Discovery, Coherent, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US) tuned at 920 nm excitation wavelength and coupled to an Ultima IV or an Investigator scan head (Bruker Corporation, Billerica, MA, US). We used a 20x dry objective (EC Epiplan-Neofluar, NA = 0.5, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and coupled it with the microendoscopes using a custom optomechanical mount similarly to <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The mount was equipped with a micrometric translator to adjust the distance between the objective lens and the upper surface of the corrected microendoscope. We acquired series of z-stacks of different calibration samples (subresolved fluorescent films, subresolved fluorescent beads, calibration rulers, and mouse fixed brain slices) moving the whole mount carrying both the objective and the microendoscope, so that their reciprocal distance remained fixed during the acquisition. For all measurements, the distance between the objective and the upper surface of the coverslip was set to 100 µm for uncorrected microendoscopes and to 150 µm and 180 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscopes, respectively. This choice was made taking into account the working distances of simulated corrected probes (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The front end of the GRIN rod was immersed into a drop of distilled water, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for fixed brain slices, which was placed over the calibration sample. Due to the short working distance of the microendoscopes (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), we put no coverslip over the samples. For each measurement, experimental replicates were obtained using corrected microendoscopes assembled with distinct optical elements (i.e., different GRIN lenses and different corrective lenses). The uncorrected microendoscopes were assembled either using different optical elements compared to the corrected ones, or were obtained from the corrected probes after the mechanical removal of the corrective lens. The analysis of z-stacks acquired through calibration samples was performed using Imagej/Fiji and custom code written in Matlab (R2022b, MathWorks, Natick, MA, US). In the following paragraphs, we defined “nominal” pixel size as the one determined by imaging a calibration ruler (see below) with the microscope objective alone.</p>
<sec id="s4c1">
<title>Subresolved fluorescent films</title>
<p>To evaluate the axial extension of the excitation volume for the two types of microendoscopes as a function of the radial distance, we imaged subresolved homogeneous fluorescent layers (thickness: ∼ 300 nm) mounted on a microscope slide. We acquired z-stacks at 256 pixels x 256 pixels resolution (nominal pixel size: 1.73 µm/pixel) with 2 µm axial step and 16 frame averaging. To analyze the axial profile of the imaged film, for each z-stack we generated the mean <italic>x</italic>, <italic>z</italic> intensity projection by averaging 180 evenly distributed sections passing through the center of the FOV of the microendoscope. This <italic>x</italic>, <italic>z</italic> fluorescence intensity projection represents the section of the FOV. From this image we then extracted the fluorescence intensity profiles along 100 segments evenly distributed across the FOV and orthogonal to the line that is locally tangent to the film profile. We measured the thickness of the average film profile across the FOV as FWHM of Gaussian curves fitting the extracted fluorescence intensity profiles along the segments. Data were binned along the <italic>x</italic> coordinate of the image (bin size: 10 pixels). To set the zero of the <italic>x</italic> coordinate, we fitted the longitudinal intensity profile of the section of the film (along the section of the FOV) to a Gaussian curve and we selected the pixel corresponding to the peak. We finally averaged together binned data obtained from multiple subresolved layer acquisitions using different microendoscopes.</p>

<title>Calibration rulers</title>
<p>To properly calibrate microendoscope images, we used a calibration ruler with ticks spaced every 10 µm along two orthogonal directions (4-dot calibration slide, Cat. No. 1101002300142, Motic, Hong Kong). The ruler was oriented such that the ruler ticks were along the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions of the acquired image and the crossing point between the two orthogonal directions of the ruler was positioned at the center of the microendoscope FOV. z-stacks of the ruler were acquired at 512 pixels x 512 pixels resolution (nominal pixel size: 1.06 µm/pixel) with 2 µm axial step and 8 frame averaging. For each z-stack, we generated the maximum intensity projection and identified tick locations as the local maxima of the intensity profiles obtained along two lines drawn along the two ruler directions. We then counted the number of pixels between the identified tick locations and the center of the FOV. Due to the circular symmetry of GRIN lens-based microendoscopes, we averaged together data obtained along the four radii of the ruler. We finally averaged across measurements performed with different microendoscopes. Knowing the average number of pixels in between adjacent ticks in the image and the real distance between adjacent ticks in the sample (10 µm), we could determine, at each tick position, the local pixel size by dividing 10 µm by the mean number of pixels in between two adjacent ticks.</p>
<p>We observed that corrected microendoscopes had uneven magnification across the FOV (distortion), meaning that the local pixel size is not homogeneous all over the FOV. To characterize the uneven magnification independently of the acquisition setting (pixel size and microscope magnification), we computed the local magnification factor. This quantity was used to calibrate the local pixel size as a function of the radial distance. The local magnification factor was defined as the ratio between the nominal pixel size and the local pixel size obtained as described above. The values of the local magnification factor as a function of the radial distance were fitted with a quartic function <italic>f(x) = ax<sup>4</sup> + bx<sup>2</sup> + c</italic> for each microendoscope type (uncorrected and corrected) and the fitting function was used to calibrate the pixel size of all acquired images (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). For each image acquired using corrected microendoscopes (e.g., <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), we show the scale bar corresponding to the calibrated local pixel size at the center of the FOV. The radial change of pixel size in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> directions is visualized by a color-coded bar located close to the image and representing the local magnification factor normalized to the magnification factor at the center of the FOV. Additionally, considering the cumulative effect of the local change in the pixel size, we performed a calibration of radial distances longer than 10-20 µm, using the same ruler measurements described above. This calibration was obtained by fitting the nominal radial distances at which we identified the ruler ticks as a function of their real distances (given by the ruler spacing) with a quartic function <italic>g(x) = dx<sup>4</sup> + ex<sup>2</sup> + fx + h,</italic> for each microendoscope type (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The fitting function was then used to calculate the real distance among different structures across the FOV.</p>

<title>Subresolved fluorescent beads</title>
<p>To quantify the extension of the PSF, we imaged subresolved fluorescent beads (FluoSpheres Carboxylate-Modified Microspheres, diameter: 100 nm, Cat. No. F8803, Thermofisher, Waltham, MA, US) monodispersed in a thin layer of poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/mL, Cat. No. P2636, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) on a microscope slide. Multiple z-stacks were acquired at 512 pixels x 512 pixels resolution (nominal pixel size: 0.049 µm/pixel) with 0.5 µm axial step and 8 frame averaging. Fluorescent beads were present across the FOV at different nominal radial distances from the optical axis (0-175 µm for corrected probes, 0-75 µm for uncorrected probes). In uncorrected microendoscopes, strong aberrations prevented imaging beads at nominal radial distances &gt; 75 µm. To quantify the axial resolution, for each bead we generated the <italic>z</italic>-axis intensity profile using the average value of the fluorescence signal within a ROI encompassing the whole bead perimeter after background subtraction and fitted this profile to either one or two Gaussian curves. For single Gaussian curves, we estimated the axial resolution as FWHM of the curve. In the case of fitting with two Gaussian curves, we computed the axial resolution as the sum of the half width at half maximum of the two Gaussian curves and the distance between their peaks. To quantify the lateral resolution, we generated the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic> intensity projections of individual beads and measured the intensity spatial distribution along 8 profiles in 8 different and equally spaced directions centered on the bead. We fitted each intensity profile to a Gaussian curve and we computed the average value of the FWHM of each curve as the lateral resolution. For each microendoscope type, measurements of axial and lateral resolution performed with multiple microendoscopes on multiple beads for each radial distance were pooled together to compute the mean value.</p>

<p>Neural spiking activity was simulated for 5 minutes in 1 ms time steps. Each neuron was randomly paired with other neurons (probability of two neurons of being paired equal to 0.05) to form groups of neurons with shared activity. The activity of each neuron was then simulated as the sum of an independent Poisson process and as many shared Poisson processes as the number of groups the neuron belonged to. The spike rate of the summed Poisson processes was the same for all neurons (0.3 Hz). These conditions resulted in average pairwise correlations of ground truth calcium activity larger than zero (average correlation 0.041 ± 0.001, n = 968130).

To generate the synthetic calcium imaging <italic>t</italic>-series, we used the experimental measurements of spatial resolution reported in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I, J</xref> for both corrected and uncorrected microendoscopes. For corrected microendoscopes, the 5<sup>th</sup> order polynomial function fitted to the experimental measurements of subresolved fluorescent films was rotated along the z-axis to generate the synthetic imaging focal surface. Moreover, the volume of fluorescence excitation was an ellipsoid resembling the experimentally measured PSF of corrected microendoscopes. For uncorrected microendoscopes, the synthetic imaging surfaces were two spherical shells with curvature radius estimated from the data (curvature radius: 273 μm and 2000 μm for the 6.4 mm-long uncorrected microendoscope and 992 μm and 2000 μm for the 8.8 mm-long uncorrected microendoscope) and the volume of fluorescence excitation was an ellipsoid resembling the experimentally measured PSF of uncorrected microendoscopes.</p>
<p>Simulated excitation volumes were synthetically scanned along the imaging focal surface (or surfaces), such that their axial direction was always orthogonal to the imaging focal surface(s). We exactly followed methods previously published in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For completeness, the procedure description is repeated here. All voxels within the excitation volumes contributed to the signal of the corresponding pixel in the simulated FOV, as follows:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>If the pixel was at the FOV edge (radial distance &gt; 200 µm and &gt;180 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscopes, respectively), its signal was randomly sampled from a normal distribution, with mean and SD estimated from four experimental t-series recorded <italic>in vivo</italic> with the 8.8 mm-long corrected microendoscope and jGCaMP8f expressed in the mouse piriform cortex (see the paragraph “2P microscopy in the mouse olfactory cortex”). The temporal average intensities of pixels in the edges of the microendoscope FOVs, containing dark noise, were used to fit a Gaussian mixture model (component 1: proportion = 0.35; mean = 137.48; SD = 48.96; component 2: proportion = 0.65; mean = 126.83; SD = 5.02). The SD of the dark noise was assumed to depend on the dark noise mean in a linear way, with parameters estimated from the same experimental data (intercept, p<sub>0</sub> = -175.39; linear coefficient, p<sub>1</sub> = 1.57). The simulated dark noise was generated with the mean randomly sampled from the Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) distribution and the SD proportional to the mean.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the pixel was in the central part of the FOV (radial distance ≤ 200 µm and ≤ 180 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long microendoscopes, respectively) but no neurons were within the excitation volume, the pixel signal was randomly sampled from a normal distribution with mean and SD estimated from experimental data. The mean intensity of pixels that were neither in the edges nor belonging to ROIs were fitted using a lognormal distribution (mean = 6.54, SD = 0.78.) and the best linear fit between the squared root of the mean intensity and the intensity SD was computed (p<sub>0</sub> = 29.91, p<sub>1</sub> = 7.75). Simulated noise in the FOV was generated as Gaussian noise with mean randomly sampled from the lognormal distribution and SD proportional to the square root of the mean.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>If the pixel was in the central portion of the FOV (radial distance ≤ 200 µm and ≤180 µm for the 6.4 mm-long and the 8.8 mm-long microendoscopes, respectively) and at least one neuron was in the excitation volume(s), each voxel in the excitation volume(s) was assigned either Gaussian noise (estimated as in the previous condition) in case no neurons were in that voxel, or the fluorescence intensity of the neuron sampled by that voxel. If a neuron was contained within a voxel, Gaussian noise was also added to its signal. The mean of the added Gaussian noise was zero, while the SD was proportional to the square root of the mean intensity of the voxel, with the coefficients estimated from a linear fit between the square root of the mean intensity and the intensity SD of pixels assigned to ROIs in experimental data (p<sub>0</sub> = 322.18, p<sub>1</sub> = 0.98). The activity of all the voxels falling within the excitation volume(s) was then averaged to obtain the pixel’s fluorescence intensity. The intensity of each pixel signal was finally modulated as a function of the radial position within the FOV, accordingly to the optical characterization of corrected and uncorrected microendoscopes using the radial intensity obtained by imaging the subresolved fluorescent films (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p></list-item>

Pearson’s correlation was computed with the function <italic>numpy.corrcoef</italic>. To evaluate the contamination of pairwise correlation artefactually introduced by the spatial extension of the microendoscope excitation volume in uncorrected or corrected synthetic t-series, we estimated the expected cell pair correlation based on the simulated ground truth calcium activity as described below. We first computed the mean Pearson’s correlation between the activity traces of any possible ground truth source pair for each simulated FOV. For each microendoscope type, we then defined the expected cell pair correlation as the mean Pearson’s correlation of any possible ground truth source pair averaged over different FOV, plus three SD (see <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 5</xref> for parameters). In simulated t-series, any cell pair with pairwise correlation above the expected value could not be attributed to correlations between the ground truth calcium activity of source neurons and was expected to arise only because of the source mixing due to finite optical resolution of microendoscopic probes. Thus, we restricted the analysis to cell pairs with pairwise correlation higher than expected. We pooled together pairwise correlation data from FOV obtained for the same microendoscope type and we computed the percentage of detected adjacent cell pairs that had pairwise correlation higher than the expected cell pair correlation for different peak SNR thresholds. Pairwise correlation of adjacent cell pairs that exceeded the expected cell pair correlation threshold was also analyzed as a function of the radial distance of the cell pair, that was defined as the distance between the center of the FOV and the midpoint of the segment connecting the centroids of the two bounding boxes drawn by CITE-ON <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3A, C</xref>).</p>

The threshold for statistical significance was set at 0.05 and indicated as follows: *, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, **, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, ***, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. <italic>p</italic> values higher than 0.05 were considered non significant (n.s.). Data are presented as mean values ± s.e.m., unless otherwise stated. Linear regressions were performed using the function <italic>scipy.stats.linregress</italic>. To test the significance of linear fit slope being different from zero, we used the Wald test with <italic>t</italic>-distribution in case the fit residuals were normally distributed and the permutation test with the function <italic>stats.permutation_test</italic> if the fit residuals were not normally distributed. The null distribution of linear coefficients used in the permutation test was built performing multiple linear regressions on a subset of possible permutations of data (permutation type: ‘pairings’, 10<sup>4</sup> permutations for <italic>n</italic> &lt; 500, 10<sup>5</sup> permutations for <italic>n</italic> ≥ 500). To test the significance of linear fit slopes being different from each other, we used a permutation test in which the observations were randomly assigned to the two samples (corrected or uncorrected). The null distribution was built calculating the difference between the two slopes for a subset of possible permutation of data (10<sup>4</sup> permutations for <italic>n</italic> &lt; 500, 10<sup>5</sup> permutations for <italic>n</italic> ≥ 500). To test the significance of the difference between two means of non-normally distributed samples, we used a permutation test. In this case, the null distribution was built calculating the difference between the two mean values for a subset of possible permutations of data (permutation type: ‘independent’, 10<sup>4</sup> permutations for <italic>n</italic> &lt; 500, 10<sup>5</sup> permutations for <italic>n</italic> ≥ 500).</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study builds on previous work by the authors by presenting a potentially key method for correcting optical aberrations in GRIN lens-based micro endoscopes used for imaging deep brain regions. By combining simulations and experiments, the authors show that the obtained field of view is significantly increased with corrected, versus uncorrected microendoscopes. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although some aspects of the manuscript should be clarified and missing information provided. Because the approach described in this paper does not require any microscope or software modifications, it can be readily adopted by neuroscientists who wish to image neuronal activity deep in the brain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sattin, Nardin, and colleagues designed and evaluated corrective microlenses that increase the useable field of view of two long (&gt;6mm) thin (500 um diameter) GRIN lenses used in deep-tissue two-photon imaging. This paper closely follows the thread of earlier work from the same group (e.g. Antonini et al, 2020; eLife), filling out the quiver of available extended-field-of-view 2P endoscopes with these longer lenses. The lenses are made by a molding process that appears practical and easy to adopt with conventional two-photon microscopes.</p>
<p>Simulations are used to motivate the benefits of extended field of view, demonstrating that more cells can be recorded, with less mixing of signals in extracted traces, when recorded with higher optical resolution. In vivo tests were performed in the piriform cortex, which is difficult to access, especially in chronic preparations.</p>
<p>The design, characterization, and simulations are clear and thorough, but not exhaustive (see below), and do not break new ground in optical design or biological application. However, the approach shows much promise, including for applications not mentioned in the present text such as miniaturized GRIN-based microscopes. Readers will largely be interested in this work for practical reasons: to apply the authors' corrected endoscopes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The text is clearly written, the ex vivo analysis is thorough and well-supported, and the figures are clear. The authors achieved their aims, as evidenced by the images presented, and were able to make measurements from large numbers of cells simultaneously in vivo in a difficult preparation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The novelty of the present work over previous efforts from the same group is not well explained. What needed to be done differently to correct these longer GRIN lenses?</p>
<p>(2) Some strong motivations for the method are not presented. For example, the introduction (page 3) focuses on identifying neurons with different coding properties, but this can be done with electrophysiology (albeit with different strengths and weaknesses). Compared to electrophysiology, optical methods more clearly excel at genetic targeting, subcellular measurements, and molecular specificity; these could be mentioned. Another example, in comparing microfabricated lenses to other approaches, an unmentioned advantage is miniaturization and potential application to mini-2P microscopes, which use GRIN lenses.</p>
<p>(3) Some potentially useful information is lacking, leaving critical questions for potential adopters:</p>
<p>How sensitive is the assembly to decenter between the corrective optic and the GRIN lens? What is the yield of fabrication and of assembly?</p>
<p>Supplementary Figure 1: Is this really a good agreement between the design and measured profile? Does the figure error (~10 um in some cases on average) noticeably degrade the image? How do individual radial profiles compare to the presented means?</p>
<p>
What is the practical effect of the strong field curvature? Are the edges of the field, which come very close to the lens surface, a practical limitation?</p>
<p>The lenses appear to be corrected for monochromatic light; high-performance microscopes are generally achromatic. Is the bandwidth of two-photon excitation sufficient to warrant optimization over multiple wavelengths?</p>
<p>GRIN lenses are often used to access a 3D volume by scanning in z (including in this study). How does the corrective lens affect imaging performance over the 3D field of view?</p>
<p>(4) The in vivo images (Figure 7D) have a less impressive resolution and field than the ex vivo images (Figure 4B), and the reason for this is not clear. Given the difference in performance, how does this compare to an uncorrected endoscope in the same preparation? Is the reduced performance related to uncorrected motion, field curvature, working distance, etc? Regarding Figure 7, there is no analysis of the biological significance of the calcium signals or even a description of where olfactory stimuli were presented. The timescale of jGCaMP8f signals in Figure 7E is uncharacteristically slow for this indicator (compared to Zhang et al 2023 (Nature)), though perhaps this is related to the physiology of these cells or the stimuli.</p>
<p>(5) The claim of unprecedented spatial resolution across the FOV (page 18) is hard to evaluate and is not supported by references to quantitative comparisons. The promises of the method for future studies (pages 18-19) could also be better supported by analysis or experiment, but these are minor and to me, do not detract from the appeal of the work.</p>
<p>(6) The text is lengthy and the material is repeated, especially between the introduction and conclusion. Consolidating introductory material to the introduction would avoid diluting interesting points in the discussion.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors present an approach to correct GRIN lens aberrations, which primarily cause a decrease in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), particularly in the lateral regions of the field-of-view (FOV), thereby limiting the usable FOV. The authors propose to mitigate these aberrations by designing and fabricating aspherical corrective lenses using ray trace simulations and two-photon lithography, respectively; the corrective lenses are then mounted on the back aperture of the GRIN lens.</p>
<p>This approach was previously demonstrated by the same lab for GRIN lenses shorter than 4.1 mm (Antonini et al., eLife, 2020). In the current work, the authors extend their method to a new class of GRIN lenses with lengths exceeding 6 mm, enabling access to deeper brain regions as most ventral regions of the mouse brain. Specifically, they designed and characterized corrective lenses for GRIN lenses measuring 6.4 mm and 8.8 mm in length. Finally, they applied these corrected long micro-endoscopes to perform high-precision calcium signal recordings in the olfactory cortex.</p>
<p>Compared with alternative approaches using adaptive optics, the main strength of this method is that it does not require hardware or software modifications, nor does it limit the system's temporal resolution. The manuscript is well-written, the data are clearly presented, and the experiments convincingly demonstrate the advantages of the corrective lenses.</p>
<p>The implementation of these long corrected micro-endoscopes, demonstrated here for deep imaging in the mouse olfactory bulb, will also enable deep imaging in larger mammals such as rats or marmosets.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work presents the development, characterization, and use of new thin microendoscopes (500µm diameter) whose accessible field of view has been extended by the addition of a corrective optical element glued to the entrance face. Two micro endoscopes of different lengths (6.4mm and 8.8mm) have been developed, allowing imaging of neuronal activity in brain regions &gt;4mm deep. An alternative solution to increase the field of view could be to add an adaptive optics loop to the microscope to correct the aberrations of the GRIN lens. The solution presented in this paper does not require any modification of the optical microscope and can therefore be easily accessible to any neuroscience laboratory performing optical imaging of neuronal activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The paper is generally clear and well-written. The scientific approach is well structured and numerous experiments and simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of corrected microendoscopes. In particular, we can highlight several consistent and convincing pieces of evidence for the improved performance of corrected micro endoscopes:</p>
<p>
a) PSFs measured with corrected micro endoscopes 75µm from the centre of the FOV show a significant reduction in optical aberrations compared to PSFs measured with uncorrected micro endoscopes.</p>
<p>
b) Morphological imaging of fixed brain slices shows that optical resolution is maintained over a larger field of view with corrected micro endoscopes compared to uncorrected ones, allowing neuronal processes to be revealed even close to the edge of the FOV.</p>
<p>
c) Using synthetic calcium data, the authors showed that the signals obtained with the corrected microendoscopes have a significantly stronger correlation with the ground truth signals than those obtained with uncorrected microendoscopes.</p>
<p>(2) There is a strong need for high-quality micro endoscopes to image deep brain regions in vivo. The solution proposed by the authors is simple, efficient, and potentially easy to disseminate within the neuroscience community.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Many points need to be clarified/discussed. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>a) It is written in the methods: « The uncorrected microendoscopes were assembled either using different optical elements compared to the corrected ones or were obtained from the corrected probes after the mechanical removal of the corrective lens. »</p>
<p>
This is not very clear: the uncorrected microendoscopes are not simply the unmodified GRIN lenses?</p>
<p>b) In the results of the simulation of neuronal activity (Figure 5A, for example), the neurons in the center of the FOV have a very large diameter (of about 30µm). This should be discussed. Also, why is the optical resolution so low on these images?</p>
<p>c) It seems that we can't see the same neurons on the left and right panels of Figure 5D. This should be discussed.</p>
<p>d) It is not very clear to me why in Figure 6A, F the fraction of adjacent cell pairs that are more correlated than expected increases as a function of the threshold on peak SNR. The authors showed in Supplementary Figure 3B that the mean purity index increases as a function of the threshold on peak SNR for all micro endoscopes. Therefore, I would have expected the correlation between adjacent cells to decrease as a function of the threshold on peak SNR. Similarly, the mean purity index for the corrected short microendoscope is close to 1 for high thresholds on peak SNR: therefore, I would have expected the fraction of adjacent cell pairs that are more correlated than expected to be close to 0 under these conditions. It would be interesting to clarify these points.</p>
<p>e) Figures 6C, H: I think it would be fairer to compare the uncorrected and corrected endomicroscopes using the same effective FOV.</p>
<p>f) Figure 7E: Many calcium transients have a strange shape, with a very fast decay following a plateau or a slower decay. Is this the result of motion artefacts or analysis artefacts? Also, the duration of many calcium transients seems to be long (several seconds) for GCaMP8f. These points should be discussed.</p>
<p>g) The authors do not mention the influence of the neuropil on their data. Did they subtract the neuropil's contribution to the signals from the somata? It is known from the literature that the presence of the neuropil creates artificial correlations between neurons, which decrease with the distance between the neurons (Grødem, S., Nymoen, I., Vatne, G.H. et al. An updated suite of viral vectors for in vivo calcium imaging using intracerebral and retro-orbital injections in male mice. Nat Commun 14, 608 (2023). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36324-3">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36324-3</ext-link>; Keemink SW, Lowe SC, Pakan JMP, Dylda E, van Rossum MCW, Rochefort NL. FISSA: A neuropil decontamination toolbox for calcium imaging signals. Sci Rep. 2018 Feb 22;8(1):3493. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-21640-2. PMID: 29472547; PMCID: PMC5823956)</p>
<p>
This point should be addressed.</p>
<p>h) Also, what are the expected correlations between neurons in the pyriform cortex? Are there measurements in the literature with which the authors could compare their data?</p>
<p>(2) The way the data is presented doesn't always make it easy to compare the performance of corrected and uncorrected lenses. Here are two examples:</p>
<p>a) In Figures 4 to 6, it would be easier to compare the FOVs of corrected and uncorrected lenses if the scale bars (at the centre of the FOV) were identical. In this way, the neurons at the centre of the FOV would appear the same size in the two images, and the distances between the neurons at the centre of the FOV would appear similar. Here, the scale bar is significantly larger for the corrected lenses, which may give the illusion of a larger effective FOV.</p>
<p>b) In Figures 3A-D it would be more informative to plot the distances in microns rather than pixels. This would also allow a better comparison of the micro endoscopes (as the pixel sizes seem to be different for the corrected and uncorrected micro endoscopes).</p>
<p>(3) There seems to be a discrepancy between the performance of the long lenses (8.8mm) in the different experiments, which should be discussed in the article. For example, the results in Figure 4 show a considerable enlargement of the FOV, whereas the results in Figure 6 show a very moderate enlargement of the distance at which the person's correlation with the first ground truth emitter starts to drop.</p>
<p>a) There is also a significant discrepancy between measured and simulated optical performance, which is not discussed. Optical simulations (Figure 1) show that the useful FOV (defined as the radius for which the size of the PSF along the optical axis remains below 10µm) should be at least 90µm for the corrected microendoscopes of both lengths. However, for the long microendoscopes, Figure 3J shows that the axial resolution at 90µm is 17µm. It would be interesting to discuss the origin of this discrepancy: does it depend on the microendoscope used? Are there inaccuracies in the construction of the aspheric corrective lens or in the assembly with the GRIN lens? If there is variability between different lenses, how are the lenses selected for imaging experiments?</p>
