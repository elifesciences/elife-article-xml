<title>Abstract</title><p>RNAs in circulation carry sequence-specific regulatory information between cells in plant, animal, and host-pathogen systems. Such RNA can cross generational boundaries, as evidenced by somatic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> silencing genes of matching sequence in progeny. Here we dissect the intergenerational path taken by dsRNA from parental circulation and discover that cytosolic import through the dsRNA importer SID-1 in the parental germline and/or developing progeny varies with developmental time and dsRNA substrates. Loss of SID-1 enhances initiation of heritable RNA silencing within the germline and causes changes in the expression of the <bold><italic>s</italic></bold><italic>id-1</italic>-<bold>d</bold>ependent <bold>g</bold>ene <italic>sdg-1</italic> that last for more than 100 generations after restoration of SID-1. The SDG-1 protein is enriched in perinuclear Z granules required for heritable RNA silencing but is expressed from a retrotransposon targeted by such silencing. This auto-inhibitory loop reveals how retrotransposons could persist by hosting genes that regulate their own silencing.</p>

<title>Main text</title>
<p>RNAs released into circulation can act as intercellular messages that are used for gene regulation in distant cells. Examples include secretion of small RNAs within exosomes in response to pathogenic fungal infection in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, virus-like proteins with their coding mRNAs in developing <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, microRNAs from adipose tissue in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and small RNAs from the epididymis in mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Such extracellular RNAs have also been detected in humans, but their roles in gene regulation remain unclear despite their use as diagnostic markers for diseases (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>). Furthermore, the recent development of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based drugs (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>; refs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>) that can silence genes of matching sequence through RNA interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> has heightened interest in understanding the import of dsRNA into cells. A conserved dsRNA-selective importer, SID-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, is required for the import of extracellular dsRNA into the cytosol of any cell in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This entry into the cytosol is distinct from and can follow the uptake of dsRNA into cells, which can rely on other receptors (e.g., SID-2 for uptake from the intestinal lumen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>). SID-1 has two homologs in mammals – SIDT1 and SIDT2. Although similar cytosolic entry of dsRNA through these mammalian homologs of SID-1 is supported by studies in mice reporting entry of viral dsRNA through SIDT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, enhanced dsRNA uptake when SIDT1 is overexpressed <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, and uptake of ingested dsRNA into cells through SIDT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, alternative roles for SIDT1 and/or SIDT2 in the uptake of cholesterol have also been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Secretion of dsRNA from <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues expressing dsRNA from transgenes has been inferred based upon the SID-1-dependent silencing of matching genes in other tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Secreted dsRNA from neurons can silence genes of matching sequence in most somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and within the germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Extracellular dsRNA delivered into parental circulation by injection or ingestion also enters the germline and can cause silencing of matching genes in progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In every case, the entry of dsRNA into the cytosol dictates when and where the processing of extracellular dsRNA can begin. Such intergenerational transport of RNA is an attractive mechanism for explaining endogenous, gene-specific effects in progeny that could occur in response to changes in somatic tissues of parents. However, which conditions induce transport of dsRNA into the germline, when during development this transport occurs, and what regulatory consequences ensue in progeny upon uptake of extracellular dsRNA from parents are all unknown. Despite this lack of knowledge, the analysis of transgenerational gene silencing triggered by dsRNA has revealed that a class of small RNAs called 22G RNA made using the mRNA targeted by dsRNA and bound by Argonaute proteins in the germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> is necessary for observing silencing in every generation.</p>
<p>Timed dsRNA injection into animals or timed dsRNA ingestion by animals has been the only way to study mechanisms of dsRNA transport throughout <italic>C elegans</italic> development since no tools to induce dsRNA secretion from cells have been developed. Injection of dsRNA into adult <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals demonstrated that extracellular dsRNA can be directly transmitted to progeny without entry into the cytosol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. This intergenerational transmission of dsRNA in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> adult animals requires the yolk receptor RME-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and is independent of parental 22G RNA production because dsRNA cannot enter the cytosol in the parent. In further support of the initial intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA or dsRNA-derived signals not requiring 22G RNAs, <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA from parents that lack <italic>gfp</italic> sequences are transported to progeny (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref> in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). Thus, the silencing signals transported from parent to progeny include the extracellular dsRNA and its derived silencing signals, independent of 22G RNAs. However, 22G RNAs are required for silencing and they may be used for intergenerational transport in subsequent generations.</p>

<p>All dsRNAs, regardless of length, have been assumed to be equivalent substrates for entry into the cytosol. This assumption is supported by the uptake of a variety of dsRNA substrates when <italic>C. elegans</italic> SID-1 is overexpressed in heterologous <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Yet, two key observations suggest that dsRNA can take multiple routes <italic>in vivo</italic> before SID-1-dependent entry into the cytosol. One, even in the presence of SID-1, dsRNA ingested during early adulthood requires RME-2 to cause silencing in progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Two, 50-bp fluorescently-labeled dsRNA requires RME-2 for entry from parental circulation into oocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Establishing the contexts for the use of different modes of dsRNA transport is crucial for understanding the processes regulated by endogenous extracellular dsRNA.</p>
<p>Here, we dissect the intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA and discover a role for this mechanism in modulating RNA regulation within the germline. Extracellular dsRNA is transported with developmental and substrate specificity from parental circulation to progeny, and its release from neurons can be enhanced using light-induced oxidative damage. Blocking dsRNA import into the cytosol of all cells revealed heritable changes in gene expression and led to the identification of <bold><italic>s</italic></bold><italic>id-1</italic>-<bold>d</bold>ependent <bold>g</bold>ene-1 (<italic>sdg-1</italic>). The <italic>sdg-1</italic> coding sequence is located within a retrotransposon that is targeted by RNA silencing in the germline. Yet, the SDG-1 protein colocalizes with regulators of RNA silencing in perinuclear granules within the germline and dynamically enters the nucleus in proximal oocytes and in cells of developing embryos. Measurements of <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression using native mRNA, a translational reporter, or a transcriptional reporter reveal that expression is easily perturbed in different mutants that impact dsRNA-mediated gene regulation. Expression varies between the two gonad arms of wild-type animals, and different mutant isolates can show an increase or decrease in expression, indicative of a loss of buffered gene expression within the germline. However, consistent with an overall role for SDG-1 (and potentially other SDGs) in promoting RNA silencing, either loss of SID-1 or overexpression of SDG-1 enhances piRNA-mediated silencing within the germline initiated by mating. Therefore, we propose that the import of extracellular dsRNA into the germline tunes intracellular pathways that cause heritable RNA silencing.</p>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>Requirements for the entry of extracellular dsRNA into the germline change during development</title>
<p>A convenient method for the delivery of extracellular dsRNA into <italic>C. elegans</italic> at various times during larval development is the expression of dsRNA in the bacteria that the animals ingest as food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. To determine when ingested dsRNA can enter the germline and cause silencing, we exposed developing animals with a ubiquitously expressed protein (GTBP-1) tagged with GFP to bacteria that express <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA. Silencing was detectable within the germline from the second larval stage (L2) onwards (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 1a), but either exposure to ingested dsRNA beyond the fourth larval stage (L4) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) or injection of dsRNA into the 1-day old adult germline (Extended Data Fig. 1b) was required to observe silencing in the germline of 3-day old adults. Combined with the need for exposure to dsRNA after the L4 stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> for silencing in progeny, even for just 24 hours (Extended Data Fig. 1c), these observations suggest that heritable RNA silencing is not effectively initiated during early development of the germline despite detectable silencing within the germline. One possible explanation for this observation could be that both RNAs derived from the imported dsRNA and downstream silencing signals are continually diluted by the proliferation of germ cells. Heritable silencing by dsRNA ingested from the L4 stage to the first day of adulthood likely relies on entry of dsRNA into the proximal germline because silencing of a somatic gene in progeny after parental ingestion of dsRNA during this period required RME-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1c), which is enriched in the proximal germline (Extended Data Fig. 1d and ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>), and some <italic>gtbp-1::gfp</italic> animals exposed to <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA up to the first day of adulthood showed more silencing in the proximal germline (Extended Data Fig. 1e).</p>
<p>Thus, these results reveal three periods of germline development that can be broadly distinguished based on the response to ingested dsRNA: (1) from the first larval to the fourth larval stage when exposure to dsRNA does not result in maximal silencing within the germline in adults (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>); (2) from the fourth larval stage to early adulthood when entry of dsRNA primarily occurs in the proximal germline through RME-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1c,e); and (3) later adulthood when germline silencing by ingested dsRNA is maximal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) and ingested dsRNA can effectively silence progeny independent of RME-2 (Extended Data Fig. 1c and ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>). These differences in the entry of ingested dsRNA into cells and/or subsequent silencing could be driven by a variety of changes during development. These include changes in the uptake of dsRNA into the intestine, distribution of dsRNA to other tissues from the intestine, import of dsRNA into the germline, and availability of RNA silencing factors within the germline.</p>

<sec id="s1b">
<title>Oxidative damage in neurons expressing dsRNA enhances silencing in the germline by neuronal dsRNA</title>
<p>Another approach for delivering extracellular dsRNA into the germline that better mimics dsRNA transport between cells is the secretion of dsRNA from neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. However, the extent of such secretion throughout development is unpredictable. To modulate the secretion of dsRNA from somatic cells into parental circulation during development, we adapted an optogenetic approach for damaging somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Specifically, we generated animals that express the mini singlet oxygen generator (miniSOG) protein in neurons and exposed them to blue light. While animals expressing miniSOG from a single-copy transgene did not show an appreciable defect when compared with wild-type animals, those expressing miniSOG from a multi-copy transgene were paralyzed (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b, <italic>top</italic>) and had visibly damaged neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2b, <italic>bottom</italic>). Using this system, we induced oxidative damage in the neurons of animals that expressed dsRNA under the control of a neuronal promoter and evaluated silencing of target genes with matching sequence expressed in other tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). By exposing animals to blue light for 60 minutes at different times during development (Extended Data Fig. 2c), we observed SID-1-dependent enhancement in the silencing of the hypodermal gene <italic>bli-1</italic> at the adult stage by neuronal <italic>bli-1</italic>-dsRNA, with maximal silencing when oxidative damage occurred during mid-to-late larval development (Extended Data Fig. 2d, light exposure every 6 hours from 42 to 66 hours post L4-stage of parent; Extended Data Fig. 2e, ∼2-fold increase from 14.9% to 29.1% in a background with <bold>e</bold>nhanced <bold>R</bold>NA <bold>i</bold>nterference (<italic>eri-1(-)</italic>) and ∼6-fold increase from ∼1.6% to ∼9.8% in a wild-type background). A similar period of maximal SID-1-dependent enhancement of silencing was also observed when neurons expressing <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA were damaged and silencing of a two-gene operon that expresses two fluorescent proteins, mCherry::H2B and GFP::H2B, in the germline was measured (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-d</xref>, and Extended Data Fig. 2f – 48 to 60 hours post L4-stage of parent; <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> allele (<italic>jam80[nonsense]</italic>) is depicted in Extended Data Fig. 3). While silencing of <italic>gfp::h2b</italic> was observed throughout the germline, silencing of the other cistron <italic>mCherry::h2b</italic> was also observed sometimes, albeit restricted to specific regions of the germline. Silencing of <italic>mCherry::h2b</italic> was most frequent in the proximal germline and was not observed in any other region without silencing in the proximal germline (proximal germline – 57%, distal germline – 47%, sperm – 29%, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>), likely due to reduction of <italic>mCherry::h2b::gfp::h2b</italic> pre-mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> in those regions. Consistently, the silencing of both <italic>gfp::h2b</italic> and <italic>mCherry::h2b</italic> was eliminated in the absence of the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1 (Extended Data Fig. 2g). The pattern of <italic>mCherry::h2b</italic> silencing is similar to the spatial pattern observed for the RME-2-dependent entry of dsRNA delivered into parental circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and is consistent with the pattern of target mRNA degradation in the germline by extracellular dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. However, silencing of <italic>gfp::h2b</italic> in the germline by neuronal dsRNA did not show a detectable dependence on RME-2 (Extended Data Fig. 2h - difficulty in obtaining transgenic animals that also lack RME-2 resulted in a low sample size for this experiment).</p>

<p>Thus, by modulating the secretion of dsRNA from somatic cells for the first time, we gained two insights into the intercellular transport of dsRNA: (1) oxidative damage of neurons during particular periods in development increases the amount of dsRNA and/or changes the kinds of dsRNA in circulation either because of specific enhancement of secretion or nonspecific spillage; and (2) there is a preference for silencing by neuronal dsRNA in the proximal germline. However, the temporal and/or spatial preferences observed for silencing by both neuronal and ingested dsRNA could be because of unknown characteristics of the exported neuronal dsRNA or ingested dsRNA expressed from bacteria (e.g., modifications, lengths, structures, etc.) that influence import or subsequent silencing. This hypothesis is supported by the different genetic requirements reported for silencing by neuronal <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA compared to other sources of <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Alternatively, these preferences could reflect universal constraints for silencing using any extracellular dsRNA (e.g. expression patterns of factors that promote the import or processing of dsRNA).</p>

<title>Extracellular dsRNA in parental circulation can be transported through multiple routes to cause silencing in progeny</title>
<p>While the characteristics of extracellular dsRNA imported into the germline from ingested bacteria or from neurons are unknown, delivery of chemically defined dsRNA into the extracellular space in <italic>C. elegans</italic> can be accomplished using microinjection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.

However, some dependence on RME-2 for silencing in progeny was discernable when lower concentrations of dsRNA were used (Extended Data Fig. 4a, <italic>right</italic>). This result and previous results demonstrating proximal germline-specific silencing in contexts where silencing is less robust (Extended Data Fig. 1e and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>) are consistent with RME-2-dependent uptake of dsRNA being a route for extracellular dsRNA to enter the germline. The difference in parental RME-2 requirement for silencing in progeny observed for dsRNA ingested (Extended Data Fig. 1c) or injected (Extended Data Fig. 4a) at the L4 stage could similarly reflect the accumulation of different amounts of dsRNA in parental circulation (e.g., more upon injection than upon ingestion), and/or different kinds of dsRNA (e.g., because of modifications in bacteria or upon transit through the intestine). However, these possibilities could not be easily distinguished because sensitive northern blotting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> revealed that both bacterial and <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed dsRNA consist of a complex mix of dsRNAs (Extended Data Fig. 4b-d; consistent with refs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>), hereafter called mixed dsRNA.</p>

<p>In contrast, when synthesized <italic>gfp</italic>-dsRNA of a defined length (50 bp) with a fluorescent label was injected into circulation in adult animals, no entry into the germline was observed in the absence of RME-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. We found that silencing of <italic>unc-22</italic> in progeny by similarly synthesized but unlabeled 50-bp <italic>unc-22</italic>-dsRNA with a 5’ OH delivered into parental circulation also showed a strong requirement for RME-2, unlike mixed dsRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). Further comparison between the two forms of dsRNA revealed that silencing in progeny by 50-bp dsRNA injected into parental circulation was detectably less efficient in somatic cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 5a,b, <italic>left</italic>), even when ∼14X more 50-bp dsRNA was delivered into parental circulation (Extended Data Fig. 5b, <italic>right</italic>), and was also less efficient in the germline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 5a,c). Efficient silencing in response to added dsRNA requires nuclear Argonaute proteins: NRDE-3 in somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and HRDE-1 in the germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Both 50-bp dsRNA and mixed dsRNA relied on the HRDE-1 for silencing within the germline (Extended Data Fig. 5a,c) and could silence independent of NRDE-3 in somatic cells (Extended Data Fig. 5a,c). Therefore, the observed difference in the extent of silencing cannot be attributed to differential engagement of these Argonautes, but rather could be the result of differences in the ability of each type of dsRNA to bind to upstream factors in the RNA interference pathway (e.g. RDE-4), differences in the stability of each type of dsRNA, and/or differences in the intergenerational transport of each type of dsRNA. In addition to the diversity of RNA lengths observed in mixed dsRNA, another known feature that could distinguish dsRNA transcribed in bacteria or <italic>in vitro</italic> from synthesized 50-bp dsRNA is the presence of 5’ triphosphates on the transcribed dsRNA species instead of the 5’ OH present in synthesized 50-bp dsRNA. In support of the impact of 5’ phosphates on transport and/or silencing, addition of 5’ monophosphates to synthesized 50-bp dsRNA injected into parental circulation reduced the dependence on RME-2 for silencing in progeny (Extended Data Fig. 4e,f), potentially by enhancing the ability of synthesized dsRNA to be imported by other dsRNA importers (e.g. SID-1) in the absence of RME-2. Thus, the requirements for dsRNA entry into the germline and subsequent silencing vary for different lengths and/or chemical forms of dsRNA (see summary in Extended Data Table 1).</p>
<p>Fluorescently labeled 50-bp dsRNA delivered into parental circulation localized within intestinal cells in progeny (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <italic>top left</italic>), as has been observed for vitellogenin proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and fluorescent dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Accumulation of fluorescently labeled dsRNA was also detected at the apical membrane of the intestine, which could reflect exocytosis of dsRNA into the lumen of developing intestinal cells. However, separation of the fluorescent label from dsRNA catalyzed by cellular enzymes cannot be excluded. Therefore, to dissect differences, if any, between the transport of unlabeled short dsRNA (synthesized 50-bp with 5’OH) and mixed dsRNA (mixture transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic> using ∼1 kb DNA template) we injected <italic>unc-22</italic>-dsRNA into animals with mutations in genes that play roles in the import of dsRNA. We found that maternal SID-1 was required for silencing by short dsRNA in progeny (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, left bars), suggesting that the SID-1-dependent entry of short dsRNA into the cytosol likely occurs in the injected parent or during early development in progeny. Uptake of dsRNA from the intestinal lumen requires SID-2, a transmembrane protein located in the apical membranes of intestinal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. We found that SID-2 was not required for most silencing in progeny by short or mixed dsRNA injected into parental circulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <italic>top right</italic> and <italic>bottom</italic>). Exit of dsRNA from intracellular vesicles requires SID-5, a transmembrane protein located in endolysosomal membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Silencing in wild-type animals was comparable to silencing in <italic>sid-5(-)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <italic>top right</italic>). However, when animals that lacked SID-1 were injected, SID-5 was required in progeny for silencing by mixed dsRNA from parental circulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>, right bars; as also reported in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>). Since dsRNA is expected to be present in vesicles upon entry through RME-2 in the absence of SID-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, this observation suggests that SID-5 is required for the release of mixed dsRNA from inherited vesicles in progeny.</p>
<p>In summary, injected extracellular dsRNA can enter the germline in parents and be transmitted to progeny through two routes with different substrate selectivity. One route is preferentially used by short dsRNA and relies on RME-2-mediated endocytosis of dsRNA into oocytes, where early exit from vesicles is required for silencing in progeny as evidenced by the need for maternal SID-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, blue). The other route appears to exclude short dsRNA but allows mixed dsRNA entry into the cytosol in the parental germline through SID-1 and exit from inherited vesicles in progeny through a process that requires both zygotic SID-1 and SID-5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, grey; ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>).</p>

<title>Expression of SID-1 is consistent with a role in the intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA</title>
<p>All routes of dsRNA transport deduced using the experimental addition of dsRNA ultimately require SID-1 for entry into the cytosol. The proposed model (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) for dsRNA transport into the germline and to progeny suggests the expression pattern of SID-1 is likely to include the germline. We used Cas9-mediated genome editing to insert a piRNA-resistant <italic>mCherry</italic> sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> into the <italic>sid-1</italic> coding sequence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) to observe the endogenous expression pattern of SID-1::mCherry. This fusion protein was detectably functional in contrast to other attempts at tagging SID-1 (see <italic>Technical comments</italic> in Methods). Fluorescence from SID-1::mCherry was visible in the proximal and distal regions of the adult germline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). Expression also progressively increased during development with tissue-specific enrichment in the developing embryo (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <italic>left</italic>), becoming ubiquitous in hatched L1 larvae (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>,d). SID-1::mCherry was not easily detectable in the germline during later larval development (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>, <italic>middle</italic> and <italic>right</italic>). In combination with the expression of RME-2 observed in the proximal germline (Extended Data Fig. 1d; ref<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>), this expression pattern of SID-1 is consistent with the entry of most dsRNA from circulation of adult animals into the germline, followed by activity of transport mechanisms in developing embryos and early larvae that inherit parental dsRNA.</p>

</fig>
<p>To determine if acute, induced expression rather than developmental expression of SID-1 can be sufficient for the import of dsRNA into the germline, we engineered the endogenous <italic>sid-1</italic> gene to transcribe a fusion transcript with an aptamer-regulated ribozyme (Extended Data Fig. 6a, <italic>left</italic>) that cleaves itself when not bound to tetracycline (Extended Data Fig. 6a, <italic>right</italic>) (based on ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>). Exposing these animals to tetracycline enabled silencing by dsRNA in somatic tissues (hypodermis: Extended Data Fig. 6b, <italic>left</italic>; body-wall muscles: Extended Data Fig. 6b, <italic>right</italic>), indicative of stabilization of <italic>sid-1</italic> mRNA, production of SID-1 protein, and subsequent dsRNA import in somatic cells. However, such tetracycline-induced silencing was not detectable in the germline (Extended Data Fig. 6c-f). Yet, similar tagging of the ubiquitously expressed gene <italic>gtbp-1::gfp</italic> resulted in detectable rescue of expression within the germline by tetracycline (Extended Data Fig. 6g). A possible explanation for the poor rescue of SID-1 activity within the germline is that post-transcriptional mechanisms targeting <italic>sid-1</italic> mRNA in the germline but not in somatic cells interfere with tetracycline-dependent stabilization of the <italic>sid-1</italic> transcript (e.g., piRNA-based regulation of <italic>sid-1</italic> mRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>), or that acute stabilization of the <italic>sid-1</italic> transcript does not override developmental regulation of SID-1 translation.</p>
<p>Additional attempts to tag the SID-1 protein guided by structure and to modulate <italic>sid-1</italic> transcripts guided by post-transcriptional regulatory interactions could improve control of dsRNA transport between cells. Nevertheless, the developmentally regulated expression observed for both SID-1 and RME-2 in the germline is consistent with intergenerational or transgenerational effects of endogenous dsRNA from parental circulation after development of the adult germline.</p>

<title>Temporary loss of <italic>sid-1</italic> causes a transgenerational increase in the levels of mRNA from two germline genes</title>
<p>To understand how the dsRNA importer SID-1 might be used in endogenous gene regulation across generations, we searched for <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent changes in gene expression that could be heritable (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 7).

The most upregulated gene in <italic>sid-1(jam113[deletion])</italic>, <italic>F14F9.5</italic> (Extended Data Fig. 7b), which is located immediately 3’ to <italic>sid-1</italic> in the genome, was only misregulated in the deletion mutant and not in the nonsense mutant (Extended Data Fig. 7c, <italic>left</italic>). Both mutants, however, were equally defective for silencing by ingested dsRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). This observation suggests that while both mutations result in loss of SID-1 protein, the deletion of <italic>sid-1</italic> also changes local regulatory sequences (potentially explaining upregulation of the neighboring gene <italic>F14F9.5</italic>) and eliminates <italic>sid-1</italic> mRNA, which could participate in RNA-based regulatory interactions within the germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we could detect two genes that were upregulated in both <italic>sid-1(jam113[deletion])</italic> and <italic>sid-1(jam80[nonsense])</italic> animals (red in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d, <italic>top</italic>, and</xref> Extended Data Fig. 7b): the identical loci <italic>W09B7.2/F07B7.2</italic> (Extended Data Fig. 7c, <italic>middle</italic>), and <italic>Y102A5C.36</italic> (Extended Data Fig. 7c, <italic>right</italic>). Intriguingly, another gene <italic>cls-3</italic> also changed in both mutants (Extended Data Table 2) but in different directions (∼3.4-fold decrease in the <italic>sid-1(jam80[nonsense])</italic> mutant but a ∼5.8-fold increase in the <italic>sid-1(jam113[deletion])</italic> mutant), suggesting that the direction of change in expression can vary. Conservatively, we began by analyzing only the two genes with mRNA levels that changed in the same direction in both <italic>sid-1</italic> mutants. Both <italic>W09B7.2/F07B7.2</italic> and <italic>Y102A5C.36</italic> have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> to be expressed within the germline (Extended Data Fig. 7d, <italic>left</italic>) and regulated by endogenous small RNAs (Extended Data Fig. 7d, <italic>middle</italic> and <italic>right</italic>). Spliced mRNA levels measured at a later generation using RT-qPCR demonstrated that both transcripts were upregulated in <italic>sid-1(jam80[nonsense])</italic> animals compared to wild-type animals as expected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>), but no upregulation was detectable in <italic>sid-1(jam113[deletion])</italic> animals (Extended Data Fig. 7e). This difference between the two <italic>sid-1</italic> mutants could reflect increased variation in expression (as was observed for <italic>cls-3</italic> using RNAseq) or could reflect complex effects caused by deletion of <italic>sid-1</italic> DNA (e.g., <italic>F14F9.5</italic> overexpression, loss of <italic>sid-1</italic> mRNA, etc.) that could be independent of SID-1 protein function.</p>

<p>To determine if expression of <italic>sdg-1</italic> and <italic>sdg-2</italic> is regulated by other proteins that play a role in RNA silencing within the germline, we examined 21 published datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> that reported changes that depend on such proteins. For each dataset, we determined if the lists of genes reported as showing significant changes in mutants compared to the respective wild types included <italic>sdg-1</italic> and/or <italic>sdg-2</italic>. This analysis revealed that changes in mRNA and/or antisense small RNAs of <italic>sdg-1</italic> were detected in 20 of the 21 datasets while changes in <italic>sdg-2</italic> were observed in 9 of 21 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). When detected, changes in <italic>sdg-2</italic> were in the same direction as changes in <italic>sdg-1</italic>, suggestive of similar regulation of both genes.</p>
<p>RNAs transcribed in the germline can be recognized as they exit the nuclear pores by piRNAs bound to the Argonaute PRG-1, which recruits them for regulation by antisense small RNAs called 22G RNA made by proteins organized within perinuclear germ granules (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>). Interaction with piRNAs was detected for RNA from <italic>sid-1</italic>, <italic>sdg-1</italic>, and <italic>sdg-2</italic>, and the control gene <italic>tbb-2</italic> using crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), consistent with their germline expression. Depletion of downstream 22G RNAs targeting both <italic>sid-1</italic> and <italic>sdg-1</italic> was detectable upon loss of the germ granule component MUT-16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Both genes were among the top 500 genes targeted by 22G RNAs bound by the secondary Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), suggesting similar downregulation of both genes using 22G RNAs. Furthermore, multiple datasets support downregulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> within the germline by HRDE-1/WAGO-9-bound 22G RNAs in the absence of PRG-1. One, loss of HRDE-1/WAGO-9 increased <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA in whole animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) and in dissected gonads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Two, loss of PRG-1 decreased <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) and increased 22G RNAs that are antisense to <italic>sdg-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) in dissected gonads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Three, although animals that lack PRG-1 become progressively sterile, the increase in <italic>sdg-1</italic> 22G RNA persisted in near-sterile animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, near-sterile in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>), and this increase was eliminated upon additional loss of HRDE-1/WAGO-9 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, near-sterile in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>As expected for <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent downregulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic>, multiple datasets reveal an inverse relationship between the two genes. In animals lacking PRG-1, <italic>sid-1</italic> RNA levels increased and <italic>sid-1</italic> 22G RNAs decreased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), but both <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA and <italic>sdg-2</italic> RNA levels decreased along with an increase in 22G RNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). This inverse relationship between <italic>sid-1</italic> and <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA regulation is also observed when many components of germ granules are mutated as indicated by changes in 22G RNA upon loss of the embryonic P granule components MEG-3/-4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), the PRG-1 interactor DEPS-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), or the Z granule component ZSP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>; also known as PID-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>In addition to the above studies, pioneering studies that used microarrays identified <italic>sdg-1</italic> as upregulated in animals lacking the germ granule component DEPS-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) and in animals lacking the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>; second-most upregulated in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>), which recruits dsRNA imported through SID-1 and other intracellular dsRNA for processing and eventual gene silencing. Animals that lack RDE-4 show a ∼47.5-fold increase in <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. A reduction in RDE-4 activity could also contribute to the ∼11.6-fold increase in <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA seen in <italic>deps-1(-)</italic> animals because these animals also show a ∼3.2-fold decrease in <italic>rde-4</italic> RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup> (one of 13 downregulated genes). These observations support the idea that appropriate regulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA requires both piRNA-mediated processes that act via germ granule components such as DEPS-1 and dsRNA-mediated processes that use SID-1 and RDE-4.</p>
<p>In summary, the levels of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA are detectably regulated by the dsRNA-selective importer SID-1, the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4, and the piRNA-binding Argonaute PRG-1. Presence of dsRNA-mediated regulation or loss of piRNA-mediated regulation enhances MUT-16-dependent production of secondary small RNAs that bind the secondary Argonaute HRDE-1/WAGO-9. Consistent with downregulation of these <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent transcripts by SID-1, disruption of many components of germ granules results in opposite effects on these transcripts and <italic>sid-1</italic> RNA. Intriguingly, a search of protein interaction studies revealed that the SDG-1 protein is among the interactors of two germ granule components: PID-2 by immunoprecipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> (also known as ZSP-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>) and DEPS-1 by proximity labeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Thus, one possibility suggested by these observations is that reduction of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA via SID-1 alters the amount of SDG-1 protein, which could interact with components of germ granules to mediate RNA regulation within the germline of wild-type animals.</p>

<title>Regulation of <italic>sdg-1</italic> RNA is susceptible to epigenetic changes that last for many generations</title>
<p>SDG-1 is encoded by a gene located within a retrotransposon (Extended Data Fig. 8a) that is within a duplicated ∼40 kb region and has two recognizable paralogs (Extended Data Fig. 8b). To facilitate analysis of SDG-1 expression, we tagged both loci that encode SDG-1 with <italic>mCherry</italic> coding sequences lacking piRNA-binding sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<italic>mCherryΔpi</italic>) (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d). This tagging resulted in the expression of <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic> mRNA being ∼16-fold higher than <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA (Extended Data Fig. 8e), potentially because of the reduction in the overall density of piRNA-binding sites per transcript, the additional introns included in <italic>mCherryΔpi</italic> (based on refs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>), and/or other unknown factors. Fluorescence from SDG-1::mCherry was observed in the germline of adult animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). However, animals showed variation in SDG-1::mCherry expression between their two gonad arms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, <italic>middle</italic> shows bright anterior (20% of animals) and <italic>right</italic> shows bright posterior (6% of animals)). A contributing feature for the observed stochasticity could be the location of <italic>sdg-1</italic> within a duplicated region (Extended Data Fig. 8a), as suggested by similar stochastic RNA silencing of multi-copy transgenes but not single-copy transgenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Despite this variation, unbiased passaging of self-progeny for more than 18 generations continuously preserved SDG-1::mCherry expression in an otherwise wild-type background (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). In contrast, mating, which can perturb RNA regulation within the germline in cross progeny<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, caused dramatic changes in <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression that persisted in descendants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). Mating animals that express SDG-1::mCherry with wild-type animals resulted in heritable changes along lineages that express <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic> mRNA or that express <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 9a). This discovery of mating-induced perturbation in gene expression raises caution in interpreting past studies (summarized in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>) where changes in multiple independent isolates were not examined. Nevertheless, when we used genetic crosses to determine the impact of mutations on <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression, we observed reduced SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence in mutants predicted to have reduced levels of intracellular dsRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>, <italic>sid-2(-)</italic>, <italic>sid-5(-)</italic>) or reduced processing of intracellular dsRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>, <italic>eri-1(-)</italic>). In contrast, we observed an increase in SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence in animals lacking MUT-16 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Finally, animals lacking RME-2, which lack the ability to import many maternal factors (e.g., lipids, proteins, RNAs, etc.), also showed an increase in SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>

<p>To avoid mating-induced perturbations of RNA regulation within the germline, we used Cas9-mediated genome editing to introduce mutations into animals that express SDG-1::mCherry in an otherwise wild-type background. Use of this approach to mutate a control gene with no known roles in RNA regulation within the germline resulted in similar levels of SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence in multiple isolates of animals with and without the mutation (Extended Data Fig. 9b). In contrast, mutating <italic>sid-1</italic> using Cas9-mediated genome editing caused a range of expression levels in different isolates when compared with <italic>sid-1(+)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref> - 6 isolates lower, 2 isolates comparable, and 1 isolate higher), which differs from the increase in <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA observed upon SID-1 loss in the single isolate examined earlier (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). One explanation for these observations is that in the absence of SID-1, the levels of SDG-1 vary in different isolates because the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene becomes prone to heritable epigenetic changes, resulting in either high or low expression states being stabilized in different isolates. Alternatively, it is possible that the ∼16-fold overexpression of <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic> mRNA perturbs RNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, potentially indicative of a role for the SDG-1 protein in such regulation. Mutating <italic>sid-3</italic> also lowered the levels of SDG-1::mCherry in one isolate, but caused no detectable change in another (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). While both isolates with loss of RDE-1 showed lower levels of SDG-1::mCherry, both isolates with loss of the germ granule component DEPS-1 showed higher levels of SDG-1::mCherry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref>). These experiments also reveal that in most isolates of animals expected to have reduced levels of intracellular dsRNA (<italic>sid-3(-)</italic>, <italic>sid-1(-)</italic>) or reduced processing of intracellular dsRNA (<italic>rde-1(-)</italic>), SDG-1::mCherry fluorescence is reduced. In contrast, isolates lacking DEPS-1 showed increased expression of SDG-1::mCherry.</p>
<p>Collectively, the observations on SDG-1 expression using mutants suggest that the uptake and processing of intracellular dsRNA (mediated by SID-1, SID-2, SID-3, SID-5, RDE-1, and ERI-1) and the function of germ granules (mediated by MUT-16 and DEPS-1) are both necessary to maintain intermediate levels of SDG-1 expression across generations. Once the levels of SDG-1::mCherry were reduced upon loss of SID-1, downregulation persisted across generations even after restoration of wild-type SID-1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>), just as the upregulation of untagged <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA also persisted (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Despite &gt;100 generations of such persistent silencing, the expression of SDG-1::mCherry could be restored by mutating <italic>deps-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref>), implicating small RNA-based regulation and germ granules in the maintenance of new epigenetic states established upon loss of SID-1.</p>

<title>SID-1-dependent genes, including SDG-1, could alter RNA-mediated regulation in the germline</title>
<p>Since SDG-1 interacts with regulators of RNA silencing (ZSP-1/PID-2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> and DEPS-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>), loss of SID-1 could both block the entry of extracellular dsRNA into the cytosol and change intracellular RNA regulation through SID-1-dependent genes such as SDG-1. In support of this possibility, intracellular delivery of dsRNA through injection into the syncytial germline of <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals showed a weak defect in silencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>). To examine if changes in the levels of SDG-1 alone could account for such a defect in silencing by intracellular dsRNA in the germline, we exposed independently-generated <italic>sdg-1</italic> deletion animals and animals that overexpress <italic>sdg-1</italic> (i.e., with <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic>) to dsRNA matching the germline gene <italic>pos-1</italic> for ∼16 hours. This short exposure to <italic>pos-1</italic>-dsRNA caused intermediate levels of silencing in wild-type animals and comparable intermediate silencing in <italic>sdg-1</italic> mutant and <italic>sdg-1</italic> overexpressing animals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>), suggesting that changes in <italic>sdg-1</italic> levels alone are not sufficient to cause a defect in silencing by dsRNA that is detectable using this assay. Alternatively, the previously described defect in silencing by intracellular dsRNA in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> could be through the promotion of competing piRNA-mediated gene regulation in the absence of SID-1. This notion that dsRNA-mediated and piRNA-mediated gene regulation compete in the germline is supported by a study that demonstrated that loss of PRG-1 enhances heritable RNA silencing by dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. To test if loss of SID-1 or a <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent gene enhances piRNA-mediated silencing, we used an experimental system which initiates piRNA-mediated silencing of the two-gene operon described in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> through mating, independent of externally provided dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. We found that <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals exhibited enhanced mating-induced silencing (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref><italic>, top right</italic>: ∼50% off in <italic>sid-1(+)</italic> vs 100% off in <italic>sid-1(qt9[nonsense])</italic>), while animals lacking <italic>sdg-1</italic> showed a small reduction in mating-induced silencing that was not statistically significant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref><italic>, bottom right</italic>, ∼40% off in <italic>sdg-1(+)</italic> vs ∼30% off in <italic>sdg-1(jam232[deletion])</italic>). Taken together, these results support the model that loss of SID-1 weakly inhibits silencing by intracellular dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> but enhances silencing by piRNAs within the germline, potentially through the action of multiple altered SID-1-dependent genes that collectively promote piRNA-mediated gene regulation.</p>

SDG-1::mCherry was enriched in perinuclear foci in many animals (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, <italic>top</italic>; 7 of 9 animals) and these sites of enrichment colocalized with the Z-granule marker GFP::ZNFX-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>; 100% colocalized in 10 of 12 animals with enrichment). Time-course imaging revealed re-localization of SDG-1::mCherry into the nucleus from the cytoplasm in the -1 oocyte, which will be the first to be fertilized (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>, <italic>left</italic> and Extended Data Movie 1), along with subsequent exclusion from the nucleus before the maternal and paternal pronuclei meet (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>, <italic>right</italic> and Extended Data Movie 2). Such dynamic entry into the nucleus followed by exclusion from the nucleus also occurred during early cell divisions in the developing embryo (Extended Data Movies 3,4). The timing of nuclear entry of SDG-1::mCherry coincides with the nuclear envelope breakdown events that occur during fertilization and early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. The <italic>sdg-1</italic> coding sequence was required for regulated nuclear entry because deletion of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> open reading frame in <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic> animals resulted in mCherry expression throughout the germline in both the cytoplasm and nuclei (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7e</xref>). Nuclear localization of the SDG-1 protein in the -1 oocyte is like that of the essential Argonaute CSR-1b<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>, thought to play a role in protecting transcripts from silencing. Exposure to ingested dsRNA did not alter the expression of <italic>sdg-1p::mCherryΔpi[sdg-1(Δ)]::sdg-1 3’ UTR</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7f</xref>) but loss of <italic>rde-4</italic> perturbed expression such that one isolate showed loss of expression while the other showed enhanced expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7g</xref>). These results suggest that while the <italic>sdg-1</italic> open reading frame is required for exclusion from germline nuclei, it is not required for the response of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene to changes in intracellular dsRNA. Together, these observations on the levels and localizations of SDG-1 raise the possibility that this protein is actively regulated by extracellular and intracellular dsRNA with a role in heritable RNA silencing, potentially with Z granules, and additional cell-cycle coupled roles during early development, potentially through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analyses suggest a model for the impact of dsRNA from parental circulation on descendants (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>). Extracellular dsRNA can accumulate in parental circulation through regulated secretion from neurons (e.g., oxidative damage promotes accumulation) and potentially other tissues. Uptake into the germline is RME-2-dependent for some forms of dsRNA (blue in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>), but RME-2-independent for other forms of dsRNA (grey in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>). While all forms of dsRNA require SID-1 for the entry of dsRNA into the cytosol in progeny, RME-2-dependent dsRNA also require SID-5. Such dsRNA from parental circulation along with other intracellular dsRNA are processed with the help of the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 in progeny (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). This processing of dsRNA regulates the SID-1-dependent gene <italic>sdg-1</italic> by reducing variation between animals in the levels of <italic>sdg-1</italic> mRNA, although the dsRNA sequences likely need not match <italic>sdg-1</italic> because no such dsRNA was reported in the published dsRNAome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and because this regulation can occur in the absence of the <italic>sdg-1</italic> open reading frame. The <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene is located within a retrotransposon that is also targeted by heritable RNA silencing, but the SDG-1 protein colocalizes with perinuclear granules called Z granules, which are required for heritable RNA silencing. Consistent with the SDG-1 protein promoting heritable RNA silencing, the <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic> gene is highly susceptible to mating-induced silencing, potentially owing to the ∼16-fold higher levels of SDG-1::mCherry compared with that of SDG-1 in wild-type animals. In agreement with this proposal, SID-1 limits heritable RNA silencing because loss of SID-1 enhances mating-induced silencing (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). Since the <italic>sdg-1</italic> gene is located within a retrotransposon that is targeted by heritable RNA silencing, this mechanism for regulating the regulators of heritable RNA silencing such as SDG-1 (and potentially other SDGs) reveals a strategy for tuning an autoregulatory loop for heritable RNA silencing by using competing dsRNA processing. Intriguingly, SDG-1 becomes enriched within nuclei upon nuclear envelope breakdown during fertilization and during early cell divisions in embryos (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7h</xref>, bottom right) with active exclusion from nuclei after each reformation of the nuclear envelope, suggestive of additional roles for this retrotransposon-encoded protein.</p>
<p>While the physiological conditions that promote secretion of dsRNA are not known, the discovery that oxidative damage of neurons can enhance the secretion of dsRNA suggests that disruption of cell structures by oxidative damage (e.g., membrane integrity) or initiation of cellular processes that repair oxidative damage (e.g., through ejection of damaged macromolecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>) also promote the release of dsRNA. Pathologies of the central nervous system in humans, including cancer, stroke, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative disease, and brain injury, have been associated with extracellular RNAs detected in circulation (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>), although their origins and regulatory consequences, if any, remain unknown. The gene regulatory effects of neuronal dsRNA released upon oxidative damage of neurons provide convenient readouts that can be analyzed to understand neuronal damage and its consequences in animals.</p>
<p>The trafficking of extracellular dsRNA from parent to progeny has spatial specificity, as evidenced by more silencing within the proximal germline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), temporal specificity, as evidenced by the need for dsRNA beyond the fourth larval stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), and substrate specificity, as evidenced by the differential requirements for 50-bp dsRNA with 5’ OH versus a mix of longer dsRNAs with 5’ triphosphates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). One possible explanation for these constraints could be that proteins mediating dsRNA transport or subsequent silencing differ in their availability during development and in their affinities for different substrates. For example, SID-1, which was not detected in the developing larval germline but was detected in the adult germline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), has an extracellular domain that binds dsRNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup> and could prefer dsRNA molecules with 5’ phosphates and/or long dsRNA. Although the selectivity uncovered here could apply to all dsRNA delivered into the extracellular space of <italic>C. elegans</italic> from any source (see Extended Data Table 1 for constraints on intergenerational dsRNA transport), the chemistry of the delivered dsRNA could be modified by yet unidentified enzymes <italic>in vivo</italic> to overcome these requirements. Tracking labeled dsRNA with diverse chemistries from parental circulation to progeny could allow correlation of differences observed in progeny silencing to differences in intergenerational trafficking. The germline is a major site of dsRNA import in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as evidenced by three key observations: the expression of SID-1 in the germline (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), heritable misregulation of germline genes in <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), and accumulation of fluorescently-labeled dsRNA from the extracellular space in the germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. As a result, <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals could have a defect in the germline that is detectable only under conditions that promote dsRNA transport (e.g., oxidative damage). Multiple physiological defects in the germline and soma of <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals have been reported but have not been widely reproduced, have only been characterized within single generations, or have not been attributed to any specific <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent gene(s). These include defects in animals with some misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, in animals exiting the dauer stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, in animals exposed to pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>, in animals exposed to odor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, in intestinal cells that develop in the presence of a multi-copy transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>, and in animals that overexpress α-synuclein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. RNA-seq experiments in this study and comparisons to those of previous studies suggest that genetic background-dependent changes can obscure genuine <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent changes (see Extended Data Fig. 7 and <italic>Technical comments</italic> in Methods), raising caution in the interpretation of putative <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent defects. Comparing multiple <italic>sid-1</italic> mutants generated using genome editing with animals in which the mutated sequence has been reverted to wild-type sequence in the same genetic background could provide a firmer basis for the identification of additional <italic>sid-1</italic>-dependent processes.</p>
<p>Genes expressed within the germline are likely regulated by positive feedback loops that are required to continually produce factors for maintaining germline immortality and for preserving form and function across generations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Thus, germline genes could be particularly vulnerable to heritable epigenetic changes, where deviations in the expression levels of a gene that is regulated by or is part of such feedback loops has the potential to become permanent in descendants. Our analysis of <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression suggests that it is part of a regulatory architecture that is susceptible to heritable epigenetic changes through the perturbation of RNA regulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Such architectures within the germline could be exploited by ‘selfish’ genetic elements such as retrotransposons to persist across evolution if one of these elements also include genes encoding a regulator. In support of a wider use of such a strategy, a paralog of SDG-1, ZK262.8 (Extended Data Fig. 8b), is also encoded by a gene located within a retrotransposon and its loss along with that of the miRNA-associated Argonaute ALG-2 was reported to be synthetic lethal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. To buffer against heritable epigenetic changes, levels of gene expression would need to be maintained within a particular range for a certain regulatory context. Given the association of SDG-1 protein with germ granule components ZSP-1/PID-2 and DEPS-1, and the maintenance of heritable changes in <italic>sdg-1::mCherryΔpi</italic> expression by DEPS-1, buffering against changes in gene expression could involve both RNA- and protein-based regulation that tunes the function of perinuclear granules. We therefore speculate that one role for extracellular RNAs that enter germ cells in other systems (e.g., tRNA fragments in mammals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>) could be to similarly buffer against heritable changes in gene expression.</p>

<p>Datasets in 21 published studies were collected and compared based on the gene names to identify changes in <italic>sid-1</italic>, <italic>sdg-1</italic>, <italic>sdg-2</italic> and <italic>tbb-2</italic> (control), if reported (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). After standardizing the names across all datasets, the fold-changes reported, if available, were used to plot a heatmap. Cases where fold-changes were not available were set conservatively as log2(fold change) = 2. The R script used is available at AntonyJose-Lab/Shugarts_et_al_2023 on github.</p>

<title>Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Fisher Scientific) from 200 μl pellets of mixed-stage animals collected from 3-6 non-starved but crowded plates in biological triplicate for each strain. The aqueous phase was then washed with an equal amount of chloroform and precipitated overnight on ice with 100 μl of 3 M sodium acetate, 1 ml of 100% ethanol and 10 μg glycogen (Invitrogen). RNA pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 22 μl nuclease free water. RNA samples were then Dnase-treated in Dnase buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2) with 0.5 U Dnase I (New England BioLabs) at 37°C for 60 minutes followed by heat inactivation at 75°C for 10 minutes. RNA concentration was measured and 1 μg of total RNA was used as input for reverse transcription using 50 U SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) (+RT) or no reverse transcriptase as a negative control (-RT) (RT primers: <italic>tbb-2</italic> (P98), <italic>sid-1</italic> (P101), <italic>W09B7.2/F07B7.2</italic> (P104), <italic>Y102A5C.36</italic> (P107)). For qPCR, each +RT biological replicate was assayed in technical triplicate for each gene target, along with a single -RT sample for each corresponding biological replicate using 2 μl cDNA and a no template control (NTC) with the LightCycler® 480 SYBR Green I Master kit (Roche). Ct values were measured with the Bio-Rad C1000 CFX96 Real-Time System and Bio-Rad CFX Software (qPCR primers: <italic>tbb-2</italic> (P99 and P100), <italic>sid-1</italic> (P102 and P103), <italic>W09B7.2/F07B7.2</italic> (P105 and P106), <italic>Y102A5C.36</italic> (P108 and P109)). To calculate relative change in mRNA abundance compared to wild type, we calculated log2(2<sup>(-(gene Ct – tbb-2 Ct))</sup>) using the median of technical replicates for the biological triplicates of each genotype. Ct values were only used if they were lower than corresponding -RT and NTC Ct values. The median value of wild-type biological replicates was then subtracted from the value for each sample to plot calculated values with respect to wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 7e, Extended Data Fig. 8e and Extended Data Fig. 9a).</p>

<title>Making a <italic>sid-1</italic> translational reporter</title>
<p>Previous attempts at observing SID-1 localization relied on multi-copy transgenes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, which can become silenced within the germline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">112</xref></sup> and could produce a variety of tagged and untagged proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. When using multi-copy transgenes to express a SID-1 fusion protein tagged at the C-terminus with DsRed or GFP (Extended Data Fig. 10a) under the control of a promoter that drives expression within body-wall muscles, we observed intracellular localization of SID-1::DsRed or SID-1::GFP (Extended Data Fig. 10b) along with rescue of gene silencing by ingested dsRNA in body-wall muscles by both arrays (for SID-1::DsRed – silencing in wild type = 100% (n = 10), <italic>sid-1(qt9)</italic> = 0% (n = 11), <italic>sid-1(qt9); jamIs2[myo-3p::sid-1(+)::DsRed]</italic> = 100% (n = 6); for SID-1::GFP – silencing in wild type = 100% (n = 50), <italic>sid-1(qt9); jamEx193[myo-3p::sid-1(+)::gfp]</italic> = 100% (n = 60)). However, similar tagging to express SID-1 fusion proteins from either a single-copy transgene expressed in the germline (SID-1::DsRed) or the endogenous locus (SID-1::wrmScarlet) did not enable gene silencing by ingested dsRNA (for evaluating function of <italic>mex-5p::sid-1(+)::DsRed::sid-1 3’ UTR (jamSi12)</italic>: silencing of <italic>pos-1</italic> in wild-type = 100% (n = 7), <italic>sid-1(qt9)</italic> = 0% (n = 7), <italic>jamSi12; sid-1(qt9)</italic> = 0% (n = 15); for evaluating function of <italic>sid-1::wrmScarlet(jam117)</italic>: silencing of <italic>pos-1</italic> in wild-type = 100% (n = 8), <italic>sid-1(jam80)</italic> = 0% (n = 8), <italic>sid-1(jam117)</italic> = 0% (n = 8)), suggesting that the C-terminal fusions of SID-1 were likely non-functional and that apparent function when using multi-copy transgenes reflects production of untagged variants. In support of our rationale, a recent prediction of SID-1 structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">113</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">114</xref></sup> suggests that the C-terminus is sequestered (Extended Data Fig. 10c), a feature that may be disrupted by the addition of C-terminal fluorophores, potentially leading to misfolded proteins that are degraded. Consistently, we found that internal tagging of the <italic>sid-1</italic> gene using Cas9-mediated genome editing to express SID-1::mCherry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) resulted in a fusion protein with detectable function (percent <italic>unc-22</italic> silencing - wild type = 100% (n = 59), <italic>sid-1(jam195[sid-1::mCherryΔpi])</italic> = ∼98% (n = 52); percent <italic>bli-1</italic> silencing – wild type = ∼87% (n = 833), <italic>sid-1(jam195[sid-1::mCherryΔpi])</italic> = ∼0.01% (n = 634)).</p>

Strains with similar genotypes (<italic>sid-1(+)</italic> or <italic>sid-1(-)</italic>) did not cluster together when using principal component analysis (Extended Data Fig. 10e), suggesting that other differences (e.g., genetic background) obscure or misrepresent differences between <italic>sid-1(+)</italic> and <italic>sid-1(-)</italic> animals.</p>

<title>Rationale for inferences</title>
<sec id="s7s1">
<title>Prior models and assumptions</title>
<p>All dsRNA is trafficked similarly. Entry of dsRNA into the germline can initiate transgenerational RNA silencing of some but not all genes. No SID-1-dependent germline genes are known, suggesting that SID-1 could be used solely in response to viral infection by analogy with roles of other members of RNA interference pathways.</p>

<sec id="s7s2">
<title>Evidence supporting key conclusions</title>
<p>Temporal selectivity of dsRNA transport was probed using three approaches for delivery of dsRNA (damage-induced release from neurons, ingestion, and injection). Spatial selectivity of dsRNA import and/or subsequent silencing was inferred based on differences in the frequency of patterns of silencing within the germline. Substrate selectivity of dsRNA transport pathways was probed using genetic mutants and dsRNA of different lengths and 5’ chemistry. Diversity of dsRNAs made in bacteria and upon <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription was visualized using Northern blotting. Analysis of <italic>sid-1</italic> mutants generated from the same wild-type cohort and a revertant was used for better control of genetic background, aiding in the identification of <bold><italic>s</italic></bold><italic>id-1</italic>-<bold>d</bold>ependent <bold>g</bold>enes (<italic>sdg</italic>). Separate measurement of <italic>sdg-1</italic> expression in descendants of independently edited isolates, along different lineages after perturbations, and in different gonads within single animals demonstrated stochasticity in gene expression and revealed establishment of different heritable epigenetic states. Co-localization of SDG-1::mCherry in perinuclear foci with the Z-granule marker GFP::ZNFX-1, its reported association with the Z-granule component ZSP-1/PID-2 and DEPS-1, changes in its levels in response to loss of SID-1 or the dsRNA-binding protein RDE-4 and its dynamic nuclear localization similar to CSR-1b was used to propose that SDG-1 plays a role in small RNA regulation while also being modulated by the activity of SID-1 and RDE-4.</p>

<p>In this report, the authors present <bold>valuable</bold> findings identifying a novel worm-specific protein (sdg-1) that is induced upon loss of dsRNA import via SID-1, but is not required to mediate SID-1 RNA regulatory effects. The genetic and genomic approaches are well-executed. The existing data are <bold>solid</bold>, but the study would benefit from additional supporting evidence. The manuscript's central findings could also be refined to avoid overstating the results. These findings will be of interest to those working in the germline epigenetic inheritance field.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Intergenerational transport of double-stranded RNA limits heritable epigenetic changes&quot; Shugarts and colleagues investigate intergenerational dsRNA transport in the nematode C. elegans. They induce oxidative damage in worms, blocking dsRNA import into cells (and potentially affecting the worms in other ways). Oxidative stress inhibits dsRNA import and the associated heritable regulation of gene expression in the adult germline (Fig. 2). The authors identify a novel gene, sid-1-dependent gene-1 (sdg-1), which is induced upon inhibition of SID-1 (Fig. 3). Both transient inhibition and genetic depletion of SID-1 lead to the upregulation of sdg-1 and a second gene, sdg-2 (Fig. 5). The expression of SDG-1 is variable, potentially indicating buffering regulation. While the expression of Sdg-1 could be consistent with a role in intergenerational transport of dsRNA, neither its overexpression nor loss-of-function impacts dsRNA-mediated silencing (Fig. 7) in the germline. It would be interesting to test if sdg-2 functions redundantly.</p>
<p>In summary, the authors have identified a novel worm-specific protein (sdg-1) that is induced upon loss of dsRNA import via SID-1, but is not required to mediate SID-1 RNA regulatory effects.</p>
<p>Remaining Questions:</p>
<p>• The authors use an experimental system that induces oxidative damage specifically in neurons to release dsRNAs into the circulation. Would the same effect be observed if oxidative damage were induced in other cell types?</p>
<p>• Besides dsRNA, which other RNAs and cellular products (macromolecules and small signalling molecules) are released into the circulation that could affect the observed changes in germ cells?</p>
<p>• SID-1 modifies RNA regulation within the germline (Fig. 7) and upregulates sdg-1 and sdg-2 (Fig. 5). However, SID-1's effects do not appear to be mediated via sdg-1. Testing the role of sdg-2 would be intriguing.</p>
<p>• Are sdg-1 or sdg-2 conserved in other nematodes or potentially in other species? Sdg-1 appears to be encoded or captured by a retro-element in the C. elegans genome and exhibits stochastic expression in different isolates. Is this a recent adaptation in the C. elegans genome, or is it present in other nematodes? Does loss-of-function of sdg-1 or sdg-2 have any observable effect?</p>
<p>Clarification for Readability:</p>
<p>To enhance readability and avoid misunderstandings, it is crucial to specify the model organism and its specific dsRNA pathways that are not conserved in vertebrates:</p>
<p>• In the first sentence of the paragraph &quot;Here, we dissect the intergenerational transport of extracellular dsRNA ...&quot;, the authors should specify &quot;in the nematode C. elegans&quot;. Unlike vertebrates, which recognise dsRNA as a foreign threat, worms and other invertebrates pervasively use dsRNA for signalling. Additionally, worms, unlike vertebrates and insects, encode RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that generate dsRNA from ssRNA substrates, enabling amplification of small RNA production. Especially in dsRNA biology, specifying the model organism is essential to avoid confusion about potential effects in humans.</p>
<p>• Similarly, the authors should specify &quot;in C. elegans&quot; in the sentence &quot;Therefore, we propose that the import of extracellular dsRNA into the germline tunes intracellular pathways that cause heritable RNA silencing.&quot; This is important because C. elegans small RNA pathways differ significantly from those in other organisms, particularly in the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathways, which depend on dsRNA in C. elegans but uses ssRNA in vertebrates. Specification is crucial to prevent misinterpretation by the reader. It is well understood that mechanisms of transgenerational inheritance that operate in nematodes or plants are not conserved in mammals.</p>
<p>• The first sentence of the discussion, &quot;Our analyses suggest a model for ...&quot;, would also benefit from specifying &quot;in C. elegans&quot;. The same applies to the figure captions. Clarification of the model organism should be added to the first sentence, especially in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>RNAs can function across cell borders and animal generations as sources of epigenetic information for development and immunity. The specific mechanistic pathways how RNA travels between cells and progeny remains an open question. Here, Shugarts, et al. use molecular genetics, imaging, and genomics methods to dissect specific RNA transport and regulatory pathways in the C. elegans model system. Larvae ingesting double stranded RNA is noted to not cause continuous gene silencing throughout adulthood. Damage of neuronal cells expressing double stranded target RNA is observed to repress target gene expression in the germline. Exogenous supply of short or long double stranded RNA required different genes for entry into progeny. It was observed that the SID-1 double-stranded RNA transporter showed different expression over animal development. Removal of the sid-1 gene caused upregulation of two genes, the newly described sid-1-dependent gene sdg-1 and sdg-2. Both genes were observed to also be negatively regulated by other small RNA regulatory pathways. Strikingly, loss then gain of sid-1 through breeding still caused variability of sdg-1 expression for many, many generations. SDG-2 protein co-localizes with a Z-granule marker, an intracellular site for heritable RNA silencing machinery. Collectively, sdg-1 presents a model to study how extracellular RNAs can buffer gene expression in germ cells and other tissues.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Very clever molecular genetic methods and genomic analyses, paired with thorough genetics, were employed to discover insights into RNA transport, sdg-1 and sdg-2 as sid-1-dependent genes, and sdg-1's molecular phenotype.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript is well cited, and figures reasonably designed.</p>
<p>(3) The discovery of the sdg genes being responsive to the extracellular RNA cell import machinery provides a model to study how exogenous somatic RNA is used to regulate gene expression in progeny. The discovery of genes within retrotransposons stimulates tantalizing models how regulatory loops may actually permit the genetic survival of harmful elements.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) As presented, the manuscript is incredibly broad, making it challenging to read and consider the data presented. This concern is exemplified in the model figure, that requires two diagrams to summarize the claims made by the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) The large scope of the manuscript denies space to further probe some of the ideas proposed. The first part of the manuscript, particularly Figures 1 and 2, presents data that can be caused by multiple mechanisms, some of which the authors describe in the results but do not test further. Thus, portions of the results text come across as claims that are not supported by the data presented.</p>
<p>(3) The manuscript focuses on the genetics of SDGs but not the proteins themselves. Few descriptions of the SDGs functions are provided nor is it clarified why only SDG-1 was pursued in imaging and genetic experiments. Additionally, the SDG-1 imaging experiments could use additional localization controls.</p>
