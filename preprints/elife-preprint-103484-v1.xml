<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>SARS-CoV-2 continues to pose a threat to public health. Current therapeutics remain limited to direct acting antivirals that lack distinct mechanisms of action and are already showing signs of viral resistance. The virus encodes an ADP-ribosylhydrolase macrodomain (Mac1) that plays an important role in the coronaviral lifecycle by suppressing host innate immune responses. Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication <italic>in vivo</italic> by potentiating host innate immune responses. However, it is unknown whether this can be achieved by pharmacologic inhibition and can therefore be exploited therapeutically. Here we report a potent and selective lead small molecule, AVI-4206, that is effective in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cellular models indicate that AVI-4206 has high target engagement and can weakly inhibit viral replication in a gamma interferon- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner; a stronger antiviral effect for AVI-4206 is observed in human airway organoids. In an animal model of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, potentiates innate immune responses, and leads to a survival benefit. Our results provide pharmacological proof of concept that Mac1 is a valid therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could potentially synergize with existing therapies targeting distinct, essential aspects of the coronaviral life cycle. This approach could be more widely used to target other viral macrodomains to develop antiviral therapeutics beyond COVID-19.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to be a major threat to public health. Despite the approval of several biologic and small molecule therapeutics, there is an urgent need for new small molecule antivirals with distinct mechanisms of action to overcome potential resistance to existing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Li et al. 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">von Delft et al. 2023</xref>). While most antivirals target an essential aspect of viral entry or replication, a potential avenue for new antivirals with alternative mechanisms is to target viral proteins that act to blunt the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Minkoff and tenOever 2023</xref>). For example, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved multiple mechanisms to evade and counter interferon signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim and Shin 2021</xref>). The viral proteins involved in such evasion would be valuable drug targets if their inhibition renders the host immune response sufficient to control virus replication and reduce disease severity.</p>
<p>The macrodomain (Mac1) of <underline>n</underline>on-<underline>s</underline>tructural <underline>p</underline>rotein 3 (NSP3) in SARS-CoV-2 is one such target that plays an antagonistic role to the host interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schuller et al. 2023</xref>). Macrodomains are found across the tree of life and catalyze the hydrolysis of ADP-ribose covalent modifications on protein side chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dasovich and Leung 2023</xref>). Viral macrodomains are found in alphaviruses, hepatitis E virus, and many betacoronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Leung et al. 2022</xref>) and in some systems, like murine hepatitis virus (MHV), their activity can be essential for viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Voth et al. 2021</xref>). While SARS-CoV-2 bearing either catalytically inactivating point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>) or deletion of the Mac1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alhammad et al. 2023</xref>) have minor phenotypes in cell culture, their replication is profoundly attenuated in animal models. This discordance likely reflects the inability of cellular models to recapitulate the complex intercellular and systemic signaling required for proper viral-host immune interactions. The underlying mechanism of action results from the enzymatic activity of Mac1, which counters the wave of ADP-ribosylation that is catalyzed by poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) proteins during the interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Kerr et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kar et al. 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Parthasarathy et al. 2024</xref>). While the critical proteins and sites modified by interferon-induced PARPs are not fully characterized, the inhibition of Mac1 should allow ADP-ribosylation and the resulting downstream signaling to persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kar et al. 2024</xref>). Indeed, multiple interferon genes are down-regulated upon infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 relative to a Mac1 deficient mutant, consistent with the hypothesis that antiviral interferon signaling could be productively enhanced by Mac1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alhammad et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>).</p>
<p>We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schuller et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gahbauer et al. 2023</xref>), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">O’Connor et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Schuller et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wazir et al. 2024</xref>), have previously developed inhibitors of Mac1 with activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the therapeutic hypothesis that pharmacological Mac1 inhibition would restore host immune responses and lead to a survival benefit after SARS-CoV-2 infection has not yet been tested. Here, we build on our experimental fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Schuller et al. 2021</xref>) and virtual screening approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gahbauer et al. 2023</xref>) with medicinal chemistry, to develop a potent lead compound, AVI-4206, that engages Mac1 in cellular models and has suitable pharmacological properties to test antiviral efficacy <italic>in vivo</italic>. In an animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, AVI-4206 reduces viral replication, restores an interferon response, and leads to a survival benefit. Therefore, our results validate Mac1 as a therapeutic target via a novel immune-restoring mechanism that could synergize with existing therapies targeting essential aspects of viral replication. The approach could be more widely used to target other macrodomains in viruses beyond SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Optimization of <italic>in vitro</italic> potency against the SARS-CoV-2 Macrodomain</title>
<p>Previously, we described two novel Mac1 inhibitors, AVI-92 and AVI-219 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gahbauer et al. 2023</xref>), which evolved from fragment screening and virtual screening hits, respectively.heir potency was determined using an ADPr-conjugated peptide displacement-based homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The superposition of the Mac1 crystal structures in complex with both leads inspired a parallel approach to optimization, which was supported by additional high resolution X-ray structures of the complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>A,E</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). First, we generated a merged compound that used the urea function of AVI-92 in the more lead-like AVI-219 scaffold, thus avoiding the phenolic and carboxylate functionalities present in AVI-92. Indeed, the X-ray structure of the resulting complex between Mac1 and AVI-4051 shows that it preserves and favorably orients the two hydrogen bonding contacts with the carboxylate of Asp22 and exhibits a ∼four-fold lower IC<sub>50</sub> value as compared to AVI-219 in the HTRF assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>B,E</xref>). Further structure activity relationship (SAR) studies revealed a strong preference for urea (e.g., AVI-1500, IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼120 nM) over acetamide (AVI-1501) or carbamate (AVI-3367) in productively engaging Asp22 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>B,E</xref>).</p>

<p>Second, at the other end of the adenosine site, we observed that the pyrrolidinone carbonyl of AVI-219 could accept hydrogen bonds from the backbone amides of Phe156/Asp157 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>C,E</xref>). To improve contacts with non-polar residues in this sub-site, we next explored substitutions of the pyrrolidinone ring. While C-5 substituents as large as phenyl were tolerated (AVI-3762 and AVI-3763), these analogs showed reduced ligand efficiency compared to AVI-219. By contrast, a methyl group at C-5 in either stereochemical configuration (AVI-3764 and AVI-3765) improved potency and ligand efficiency. Introducing two methyl groups at C-5 afforded the achiral, gem-dimethyl pyrrolidinone AVI-4636 with an impressive five-fold improvement in potency (IC<sub>50</sub> of ∼200 nM) compared to AVI-219 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>C,E</xref>).</p>
<p>Ultimately, combining the ethyl urea side chain of AVI-1500 with the gem-dimethyl pyrrolidinone of AVI-4636 produced AVI-4206, the most potent Mac1 inhibitor identified from this series, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of ∼20 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>A,E</xref>). This potency approaches the floor of our HTRF assay, which uses 12 nM of enzyme, and indicates that AVI-4206 is at least ∼25-100-fold more potent than the AVI-92 and AVI-219 starting points, respectively. The high resolution co-crystal structure of AVI-4206 confirmed that the desired interaction elements and conformations were maintained from the separate optimization paths (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>e</xref>). To confirm that the high affinity binding of AVI-4206 was reflected in inhibition of Mac1 catalytic activity, we used auto ADP-ribosylated PARP10 and a coupled NudT5/AMP-Glo assay to measure ADP-ribose released by the enzymatic reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kasson et al. 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). This assay demonstrated AVI-4206 potently inhibits Mac1 with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 64 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 1</bold>D</xref>).</p>

<title>AVI-4206 engages Mac1 in cells with high specificity</title>
<p>Having discovered AVI-4206 as a potent inhibitor of Mac1, we next determined whether this compound could enter cells and bind to Mac1 in this context. Therefore, to assess cellular target engagement, we developed a nanoluciferase-based CEllular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA-nLuc) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martinez et al. 2018</xref>) to measure thermal stabilization of Mac1 upon compound binding. A549 cells transiently expressing a HiBiT- and FLAG-tagged Mac1 protein were treated with compounds for 1 hour and then incubated across a gradient of temperatures. After heat exposure, cells were lysed and incubated with LgBiT protein which binds to soluble HiBiT-Mac1 protein reconstituting nanoluciferase and producing a luminescent signal. We observed that the T<sub>agg</sub> (the temperature at which 50% of protein is soluble) shift for compounds at 10 µM mirrored the affinities measured by the HTRF assay, suggesting a dominant role for Mac1 affinity, rather than bioavailability, or another factor, in determining target engagement in cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>A</xref>). Furthermore, we observed a dose-dependent shift in T<sub>agg</sub> by AVI-4206, with a marked ∼10°C shift in cells treated with 10 µM of compound compared to DMSO-treated control cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>B</xref>). The observations were also validated by western blotting with a FLAG-specific antibody (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>After confirming Mac1 target engagement in cells, we next tested the selectivity of AVI-4206 for Mac1 over two human macrodomains, Targ1 and MacroD2. In an adapted HTRF assay, both human proteins bind to ADP-ribose in the same low-μM range as Mac1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>C</xref>), AVI-4206 does not bind appreciably to either protein in this assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>D</xref>). The selectivity of AVI-4206 for the active site of Mac1 can be rationalized by the presence of larger residues at key positions in the binding pocket in the human orthologs. In Targ1, Cys104 occupies the analogous position to Ala52 of Mac1, leading to a putative clash with the urea moiety (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>E</xref>). Similarly, in MacroD2, Arg122 occupies the analogous position to Leu 126; both the larger arginine side chain and accompanying backbone shift are predicted to clash with the gem-dimethyl of AVI-4206 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>E</xref>). Due to the shared adenosine motif in the substrates for macrodomains and kinases, and the therapeutic importance of protein kinases, we assessed AVI-4206 at 10 μM against a panel of diverse kinases and found no inhibition &gt;35% (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). Lastly, we used mass spectrometry-based thermal proteome profiling (TPP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Savitski et al. 2014</xref>) to evaluate the selectivity of AVI-4206 against a complex proteome We added 50 nM recombinant Mac1 protein into cellular lysates from A549 cells that were treated either with DMSO or with 100 µM of AVI-4206. We find that Mac1, but no native protein from the A459 lysate, displays a statistically significant shift in melting temperature (3.02°C, adjusted <italic>P</italic> value = 0.045) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that AVI-4206 can cross cellular membranes and engage with high specificity for Mac1.</p>

<title>AVI-4206 displays limited efficacy in cellular models</title>
<p>To determine whether AVI-4206 can inhibit viral replication in cellular models of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we treated IFN-deficient Vero cells stably expressing TMPRSS2 (Vero-TMPRSS2) and IFN-competent A549 cells stably expressing high levels of ACE2 (A549-ACE2<sup>h</sup>) with AVI-4206 and infected them with an mNeon reporter SARS-CoV-2 WA1 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Xie et al. 2020</xref>). We observed that treatment with AVI-4206 did not reduce viral replication in Vero-TMPRSS2 or A549-ACE2<sup>h</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>A,B</xref>), consistent with previous studies showing that Mac1 deficient SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in several cell lines ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alhammad et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>)). This result stands in contrast to a SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitor, nirmaltrevir, which potently inhibited replication in both cell lines (EC<sub>50</sub> 275 nM and 9.4 nM, respectively) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>A,B</xref>). Nonetheless, this experiment, together with a viability assay, indicated no direct cytotoxicity of AVI-4206 at concentrations as high as 100 μM (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5A,B</xref>). Next, we explored whether interferon pre-treatment could potentiate the response of AVI-4206 using SARS-CoV-2 replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Taha et al. 2023a</xref>) as we previously demonstrated for a Mac1 deficient SARS-CoV-2 replicon (WA1 N40D mutant) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alhammad et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>C</xref>). We did not observe a reduction in viral RNA replication of the Mac1 deficient replicon compared with the wild-type replicon in Vero cells stably expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 (VAT) or A549-ACE2<sup>h</sup> cells treated with or without AVI-4206 and 1000 IU/ml of IFN-gamma (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5C,D</xref>). However, there was a modest dose-dependent decrease in replication of the wild-type, but not Mac1 deficient, replicon in A549-ACE2<sup>h</sup> cells (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>). When the IFN-gamma dose was increased to 10000 IU/ml, we observed a small (∼1.6-fold) effect for the Mac1 deficient replicon relative to the wild-type replicon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>D</xref>). Treatment with highest dose (100 μM) of AVI-4206 led to a statistically significant, but small (∼1.7-fold), reduction in replication for the wild-type, but not Mac1-deficient, replicon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>D</xref>). From these experiments, we conclude that cellular models of SARS-CoV-2 infection give, at best, only a narrow window for assessing the efficacy of Mac1 inhibition and that high concentrations of AVI-4206 can achieve a limited anti-viral response without cytotoxicity in an IFN- and Mac1 catalytic activity-dependent manner.</p>

<p>To test AVI-4206 in a system that more closely replicates both the structural and functional characteristics of the human airway epithelium, we used human airway organoids (HAOs), which are derived from primary stem cells generated from human lungs and grow as complex three-dimensional structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sachs et al. 2019</xref>). These cells can be differentiated into the various cell types found in the airway epithelium, including ciliated, goblet, and basal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al. 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simoneau et al. 2024</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simoneau et al. 2024</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al. 2023a</xref>) have utilized differentiated HAOs as a more relevant infection model that encompasses more robust innate immune functions. We therefore sought to test the efficacy of AVI-4206 in HAOs infected with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>E</xref>). The Mac1 deficient virus (WA1 N40D mutant) showed no reduction, 10-fold reduction, and 1000-fold reduction in viral particle production at 24, 48, and 72 hours post-infection compared to the wild-type virus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>F</xref>). AVI-4206 treatment reduced viral particle production 10- and 100-fold at 48 and 72 hours post-infection, respectively, and 20 μM AVI-4206 reduced viral particle production by 10-fold at 72 hours post-infection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 3</bold>F</xref>). As we have observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alhammad et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>), the faster clearance of infection in AVI-4206 treated HAOs, similar to that seen with the Mac1 deficient virus, is likely due to a potent innate immune response rather than a direct effect of Mac1 on viral replication. While these cellular and organoid experiments gave some indication of an effect of AVI-4206, testing in animal models was required to establish whether this compound had significant activity in reducing viral pathogenesis.</p>

<title>AVI-4206 has favorable pharmacological properties</title>
<p>Prior to testing the efficacy of AVI-4206 in animal models, we assessed the pharmacological properties of the compound to predict a dosing regime that would provide sufficient target coverage to test efficacy. In parallel with optimizing compounds for potent inhibition of Mac1, as described above, we employed data from standard <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of metabolism, permeability, and physicochemical properties to drive our medicinal chemistry campaign. Thus, the series leading to AVI-4206 was optimized for stability in mouse liver microsomes and human hepatocytes, low plasma protein binding (good free fraction), and high aqueous solubility (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold>A</xref>). However, the introduction of the urea functionality in this series negatively impacted permeability in Caco-2 monolayers when compared to the parent AVI-219, predicting low oral bioavailability. Indeed, in mouse pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, AVI-4206 showed poor oral bioavailability (&lt;4%), while intrinsic clearance was moderate, about 60% of hepatic blood flow (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). Bioavailability via the intraperitoneal (IP) route however, was excellent and free drug concentrations ∼100-fold above the biochemical IC<sub>50</sub> were achieved for 8 hours following a single IP dose at 100 mg/kg (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold>B</xref>, <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). In a separate PK experiment employing a 10 mg/kg IP dose, total exposure of AVI-4206 in lung was higher than in plasma at later time points, (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold>C</xref>), suggesting its suitability for an <italic>in vivo</italic> infection model to validate Mac1 as an antiviral target Moreover, AVI-4206 showed minimal inhibition of common cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold>D</xref>) and a broader panel of potential off targets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 4</bold>E</xref>, <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref>), identified no significant liabilities among major channels, receptors, or enzymes. Overall, the biochemical potency and PK profile of AVI-4206 suggested the likelihood of sustained target engagement in mice with twice daily doses (BID) of 100 mg/kg by the IP route allowing us to test proof-of-concept.</p>

<title>AVI-4206 is effective in a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection</title>
<p>To assess the efficacy of AVI-4206 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used the K18-hACE2 mouse model, which mimics severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zheng et al. 2021</xref>). The K18-hACE2 mouse is a stringent model to test efficacy, as previous studies using potent protease inhibitors did not lead to full survival, unless combined with molnupiravir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Papini et al. 2024</xref>). In our experiment, animals were divided into three groups (wild-type WA1 virus with compound or vehicle treatment, and a Mac1 deficient mutant-infected positive control) with treatment (AVI-4206 at 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally, nirmatrelvir at 300 mg/kg orally, or vehicle control for each drug) initiated one day prior to infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>A</xref>). AVI-4206 or nirmatrelvir were administered twice daily until 5 days post-infection, during which the mice were closely monitored for disease parameters such as weight loss and hunched posture. Both vehicle-treated groups experienced weight loss starting at 3-4 days post-infection and continued losing weight until the end of the study at 7 days post-infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>B,C</xref>). The AVI-4206 and nirmatrelvir treated groups experienced weight loss starting at 4 days post-infection, but the extent of weight loss was about 5-10% lower on average at days 5-7 post-infection compared with their respective vehicle-treated groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>B,C</xref>). Consequently, ∼70% of AVI-4206 treated group and 40% of the nirmatrelvir treated group survived, whereas all mice in the vehicle treated groups died by the end of the study based on the humane endpoints of hunched posture or &gt;20% decrease in body weight (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>D,E</xref>).

We observed that AVI-4206 treatment reduced viral load in the lungs by ∼10-fold and ∼100-fold at 4 and 7 days post-infection, respectively, and reduced transmission to the brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>F</xref>). Although it is possible that AVI-4206 crosses the blood-brain barrier, it is more likely that the reduction of viral load in the brain is as a consequence of a reduction in overall systemic viral load. The prevention of virus localization to the brain is especially important in this model because human ACE2 overexpression allows virus replication and spread to brain tissue which ultimately leads to encephalitis and the death of infected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bao et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Oladunni et al. 2020</xref>). The faster clearance of viral load in the lungs for AVI-4206 treated and Mac1 deficient virus infected mice compared with the vehicle-treated mice, rather than an early antiviral effect post-infection, is consistent with an immune response mediated mechanism rather than a direct antiviral mechanism.</p>
<p>To further investigate the antiviral mechanism of AVI-4206, we measured the abundance of the antiviral cytokines IP-10, IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in lung tissue at 4 and 7 days post-infection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>G</xref>). We found that levels of all of these cytokines were elevated at 4 days post-infection. At 7 days post-infection, the AVI-4206 treated and Mac1 deficient virus infected mice maintained significantly higher levels of IP-10, IL-2, and IL-6 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to the vehicle treated group; TNF-α showed a similar trend but did not reach statistical significance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>G</xref>). The lower levels of cytokines in the vehicle-treated group at 7 days post-infection is likely mediated by the immune-suppressive capability of SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain. However, when the macrodomain is inactivated, either through AVI-4206 treatment or infection with Mac-1 defective variant, the antiviral response is enhanced, which blocks viral replication. The cumulative cytokine abundance (IP-10, IL-2, and IL-6) indicates an antiviral immune response, likely mediated through the activation of the NF-κB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Neufeldt et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Robertson et al. 2023</xref>). Finally, we tested the efficacy of AVI-4206 at a lower dosage of 30 mg/kg using the same experimental setup. Even at this lower dose, AVI-4206 enhanced survival and produced lower viral load at 7 days post-infection relative to vehicle (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>), but to a more modest degree than at the higher dose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Collectively, our observations of enhanced survival of mice, reduced viral load, and an increase in antiviral cytokines suggest that AVI-4206 is capable of potentiating the host immune response, thereby reducing disease severity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we provide strong pharmacological evidence validating Mac1 and de-ADP-ribosylation as a therapeutic target for SARS-CoV-2. AVI-4206 is a competitive inhibitor that blocks the ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity of Mac1. This activity antagonizes the PARP-mediated ADP-ribosylation that is part of the antiviral interferon response. Although mechanistic links are still emerging between specific post-translational modifications and an effective antiviral response, our pharmacologic studies add to the genetic and biochemical evidence of the importance of this signaling axis for viral replication <italic>in vivo (</italic>Alhammad et al. 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>). Our work also adds to the growing role of modulating ADP-ribosylation signaling in therapeutic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dasovich and Leung 2023</xref>). For example, inhibitors of PARP1, which catalyzes the addition of poly-ADP-ribose marks, have been developed for treating tumors with mutations in either <italic>BRCA1</italic> or <italic>BRCA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lord and Ashworth 2017</xref>) and inhibitors of PARG, which catalyzes the removal of α(1′′-2′) O-glycosidic linkages in PAR chains, are under investigation for a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Slade 2020</xref>). The presence of macrodomains and experimental evidence for them as interferon signaling antagonists in other diverse viruses, such as Chikungunya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McPherson et al. 2017</xref>), suggests that inhibiting this target class may be effective for treatment of other virally-induced diseases beyond COVID.</p>
<p>While AVI-4206 is protective in an animal model of infection, it was developed without many of the normal intermediate markers of improvement in cellular models. This discordance was expected based on the mechanism of action, as interferon-based antiviral activity likely requires intra- and inter-cellular and systemic communication between different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Platanias 2005</xref>). The limited replication defect difference between wild-type and Mac1 deficient viruses in cellular models renders them largely ineffective as a model to test the effects of macrodomain inhibition, which has led others to question the validity of Mac1 as target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lee et al. 2024</xref>). AVI-4206 did in fact demonstrate modest antiviral activity only in the presence of exogenous IFN in cells, which is consistent with most other studies that have examined Mac1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alhammad et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Taha et al. 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Kerr et al. 2024</xref>). While a larger replication defect is observed in HAOs likely due to their more relevant antiviral innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Simoneau et al. 2024</xref>), the highest dose of AVI-4206 does not achieve the magnitude of the replication defect of the Mac1 deficient virus. This may reflect an unoptimized prophylactic dosing schedule or the need to better tune the pharmacological properties of the inhibitor. Taken together, the concordance of <italic>in vitro</italic> (HTRF) and cellular target engagement assays (CETSA) stands out as particularly important in the development path of macrodomain inhibitors.</p>
<p>AVI-4206 blocks the viral enzymatic removal of post-translational modifications important for the immune response, which is an important mechanism for blocking virus replication and reducing disease severity. Notably, Mac1 represents a second pharmacologically validated enzymatic domain within Nsp3: a recently developed inhibitor of the papain-like protease (PLpro) domain also shows efficacy in animal models and acts by removing a distinct set of host post-translational modifications (ubiquitin and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tan et al. 2024</xref>). In summary, AVI-4206 provides proof-of-concept for the validation of a novel antiviral target, Mac1. By restoring the antiviral immune response, the novel mechanism of action of AVI-4206 could be synergistic or additive with orthogonally acting direct antivirals, such as protease and polymerase inhibitors, in combination therapies for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and beyond.</p>

Compounds prepared in DMSO (100 mM) were added to crystal drops using an Echo 650 acoustic dispenser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Collins et al. 2017</xref>) (final concentration of 10 mM). Crystals were incubated at room temperature for 2-4 hours prior to vitrification in liquid nitrogen without additional cryoprotection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source (ALS beamline 8.3.1) or the Stanford Synchrotron Light Source (SSRL beamline 9-2). Data were indexed, integrated and scaled with XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Kabsch 2010</xref>) and merged with Aimless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Evans and Murshudov 2013</xref>). The P4<sub>3</sub> Mac1 crystals contain two copies of the protein in the asymmetric unit (chains A and B). The active site of chain A is open, however chain B is blocked by a crystal contact. We previously observed that potent Mac1 inhibitors dissolve crystals, likely through the displacement of the B chain crystal contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gahbauer et al. 2023</xref>). In addition, crystal packing in the chain A active site restricts movement of the Ala129-Gly134 loop, leading to decreased occupancy for compounds with substituents on the pyrrolidinone. To aid modeling the resulting conformational and compositional disorder, we used the PanDDA method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pearce et al. 2017</xref>) to model ligands where the occupancy was low (&lt;25%, AVI-4051, AVI-3367, AVI-3763, AVI-3762, AVI-3765 and AVI-3764) or where there was substantial disorder (AVI-4636). After modeling ligands, structures were refined using phenix.refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Liebschner et al. 2019</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gahbauer et al. 2023</xref>). Data collection settings and statistics are reported in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>To achieve higher ligand occupancy for AVI-4206, we co-crystallized an alternative Mac1 construct previously reported to crystallize in P1, P2<sub>1</sub> and C2 (residues 2–170) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Michalska et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Correy et al. 2022</xref>). Crystals grew by sitting-drop vapor diffusion in 200 mM lithium acetate and 20% w/v PEG 3350 with 30 mg/ml Mac1 (1.6 mM) and 3.2 mM AVI-4206 (3.2% DMSO). Crystals were vitrified directly in liquid nitrogen and diffraction data to 0.8 Å were collected at the ALS (beamline 8.3.1). Data were reduced in P1 using the same pipeline as the P4<sub>3</sub> crystals. Solvent content analysis suggested that there were two chains in the asymmetric unit. Phases were obtained using Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">McCoy et al. 2007</xref>) and apo Mac1 coordinates (PDB code 7KQO, chain A). Structural refinementent was performed with phenix.refine following the previously described procedures for ultra-high resolution data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Correy et al. 2022</xref>). After several rounds of refinement, positive difference density was clear for a second, relatively low occupancy, conformation of the entire chain A and B, each representing a ∼3.1 Å translation relative to the major conformation. Modeling and inspection of the minor conformations suggested that they cannot be occupied simultaneously, therefore they were modeled with distinct alternative location identifiers (altlocs). The major conformation (protein, AVI-4206 and water) was modeled with altloc A and the minor conformations (protein, AVI-4206 and water) were modeled with altlocs C and D. In addition to the rigid body disorder, there was clear density for a third conformation of the residue 57-75 α-helix. In chain A, this was modeled with altloc B, while the density in chain B was too weak to allow modeling.

Purified Mac1 (P4<sub>3</sub> construct, 2 μl, 10 nM final concentration) and NUDT5 (2 μl, 100 nM final concentration) were added to wells and the plates were incubated for five minutes at room temperature. Mono-ADP-ribosylated PARP10 was added to wells (4 μl, 2 μM final concentration) and the plates were incubated at room temperature for an additional hour. The concentration of AMP was measured with an AMP-Glo assay kit (Promega, V5011) following the manufacturer’s instructions using a BioTek Synergy HTX plate reader. Percentage inhibition was calculated relative to control wells containing no inhibitor (DMSO only, 0% inhibition) or no Mac1 (100% inhibition) and IC<sub>50</sub> values were determined by fitting a four-parameter sigmoidal dose-response equation using GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.1), with the top and bottom constrained to 100 and 0% inhibition respectively.

TARG1 and MacroD2 binding were measured at 25nM and 12.5 nM, respectively. Assay reagents were dispensed manually into plates using an electronic multichannel pipette. Macrodomain protein and peptide were dispensed and preincubated for 30 min at room temperature before HTRF reagents were added. Fluorescence was measured after a 1 hour incubation at room temperature using a Perkin Elmer EnVision 2105-0010 Dual Detector Multimode microplate reader with dual emission protocol (A = excitation of 320 nm, emission of 665 nm, and B = excitation of 320 nm, emission of 620 nm).

<p>Cellular target engagement of compounds was assessed using a CETSA-nLuc or CETSA-WB assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martinez et al. 2018</xref>). The SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 macrodomain was cloned into pcDNA3.1 by Genscript with both an N-terminal 3XFLAG tag and a C-terminal HiBiT tag as listed in <xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 5</xref>. A 2A mKate was included to identify successfully transfected cells (e.g., pcDNA-3xFLAG-Mac1<sup>WT</sup>-nLuc-t2A-mKate2). Plasmids were reverse transfected into A549 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Thermo). After 48 h, cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended at 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in CETSA buffer (1× DPBS (with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 1 g/l glucose and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 5892970001). Cells were treated in microcentrifuge tubes with compound or DMSO and incubated at 37°C for 1 h.</p>
<p>For CETSA-nLuc experiments, 30 μl of suspended cells were dispensed into a 96-well PCR plate (Biorad) and heated for 3.5 min using a preheated gradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf). A Nano-Glo® HiBiT Lytic Detection System (Promega) was used to quantify HiBiT-tagged proteins in cell lysates. 30 μl of a mixture containing Lytic Buffer, LgBiT protein, HiBiT Lytic Substrate were added to the cell suspension, and luminescence intensity was measured using a Biotek Synergy H1. Luminescence values for each sample were normalized to the lowest temperature on the range and T<sub>agg</sub> (T-aggregate) values were determined by fitting data with a four-parameter sigmoidal dose-response equation using non-linear regression in GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.1). Delta values were calculated by subtracting the T<sub>agg</sub><sup>DMSO</sup> value from the T<sub>agg</sub> <sup>drug</sup> value. Data are presented as mean ± SD of two technical replicates.</p>
<p>For CETSA-WB experiments, 45 μl of suspended cells were dispensed into PCR strip tubes and heated for 3.5 min using a pre-heated gradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf). Samples were then placed in an aluminum PCR block on a dry ice/ethanol bath for 3 min, followed by incubating at 37°C for 3 min, and vortexing for 3 seconds. This freeze-thaw cycle was repeated three more times. Insoluble proteins were transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, separated by centrifugation (20,000<italic>g</italic>, 15 min, 4°C) and 40 μl of supernatant corresponding to soluble proteins was kept for WB. Samples were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, F1804, 1:1000 overnight), anti-mouse HRP antibody (CST, 7076S, 1:3000 for 1 hour). Images were captured using the Azure c600 Western Blot Imaging System, quantified using ImageJ and plotted as above.</p>

The next day, cells were pre-treated with compounds for 2 hours, followed by the removal of the compounds and infection with 50 µl of icSARS-CoV-2-mNG at a MOI 0.1 for 2 hours. Subsequently, virus inoculum was removed and fresh compounds diluted in DMEM (10% FBS, 1% L-Glutamine, 1× P/S, 1× NEAA, Incucyte® Cytotox Dye) were added. Infected cells were placed in an Incucyte S3 (Sartorius) and infection and cell death were measured over 48 hours at 1-hour intervals using a 10x objective, capturing 3 images per well at each time point under cell maintenance conditions (37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Infection and cell death were quantified as Total Green Object Integrated Intensity (300 ms acquisition time) and Red Object Integrated Intensity (400 ms acquisition time), respectively. After in-built software analysis, raw data was exported and antiviral efficacy was determined as the percentage of viral replication normalized to the vehicle control. Nirmatrelvir (HY-138687, MedChemExpress) and uninfected cells were used as intra-assay positive and negative controls, respectively.

<p>The differentiated HAOs were utilized to analyze the dose-dependent anti SARS-CoV-2 efficacy of AVI-4206. Briefly, 100,000 cells of differentiated HAOs were seeded in a V-bottom plate (Greiner Bio-One). The cells were pretreated for 2 hours prior to infection with various concentrations of AVI-4206 (0, 0.16 μM, 0.8 μM, 4 μM, 20 μM, 100 μM). After pretreatment, the HAOs were washed and infected with SARS-CoV-2 WA1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. A WA1-N40D mutant strain lacking the macrodomain activity was used as a positive control. Following 2 hours of infection, the HAOs were washed three times. Each washing step involved replacing the media with PBS and centrifuging the cells at 1000 rpm for 3 minutes. After three washes, the PBS was replaced with 100 μl of HAO differentiation medium, with or without varying concentrations of AVI-4206, and the plate was incubated for 72 hours at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Lysates + Mac1 were incubated with compound at a final concentration of 100 µM AVI-4206 or DMSO for 30 minutes at 25°C. Lysates (2 replicates per condition) were distributed into 10 aliquots (20 μl each) in PCR tubes. Samples were heated from 37°C to 64°C in 3°C increments on a BioRad C1000 Touch Thermal cycler, and held for four minutes at the specified temperature. Samples were held at room temperature for three minutes. Samples were then subjected to 2 cycles of flash freezing and thawing at 35°C. Aggregated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 20,000<italic>g</italic> for 60 minutes. 20 μl of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 100 mM Tris, pH ∼7.5) was added to each well and samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were reduced and alkylated by the addition of TCEP (100mM final) and 2-chloroacetamide (44mM final) followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 minutes. Urea concentration was diluted to 1 M by the addition of 100 mM tris (pH ∼7.5). Samples were digested overnight with LysC (Wako, 1:100 enzyme: protein ratio) and trypsin (Promega, 1:50 enzyme:protein ratio). Samples were desalted with a 96-well mini 20MG PROTO 300 C18 plate (HNS S18V, The Nest Group) according to manufacturer’s directions. Peptide concentration was determined by NanoDrop (Thermo).</p>
<p>Following digestion, peptides were injected onto a timsTOF SCP (Bruker) connected to either an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo) or VanquishNeo (Thermo). Peptides were separated on a PepSep reverse-phase C18 column (1.9 μm particles, 15 cm, 150 mm ID) (Bruker) with a gradient of 5-28% buffer B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) over buffer A (0.1% formic acid in water) over 20 minutes, an increase to 32% B in 3 minutes, and held at 95% B for 7 minutes. DIA-PASEF analyses were acquired from 100 to 1700 m/z over a 1/Kø of 0.70 to 1.30 Vs/cm<sup>2</sup>, with a ramp and accumulation time set to 75 ms. Library DDA PASEF runs were collected over the same m/z and 1/Kø range and a cycle time of 1.9 s.</p>

Default settings, including trypsin digestion, variable modifications of methionine oxidation and N-termini acetylation, and fixed modification of cysteine carbamidomethylation, were used. Missing values were imputed for each run using background intensity. Data was filtered to obtain a false discovery rate of 1% at the peptide spectrum match and protein level. Lysate experiments were normalized to the lowest temperature (37°C) and melting points were determined in R using the Inflect package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McCracken et al. 2021</xref>).</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work presents the development of a novel inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 that has potential utility both as an antiviral therapeutic and as a tool for probing the molecular mechanisms by which infection-induced ADP-ribosylation triggers robust host antiviral responses. The evidence supporting the claims is generally <bold>convincing</bold> but could be improved if the authors expanded the phenotypic characterization of the compound and its potential effects on both viral and host targets.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 encodes a macrodomain (Mac1) within the nsp3 protein that removes ADP-ribose groups from proteins. However, its role during infection is not well understood. Evidence suggests that Mac1 antagonizes the host interferon response by counteracting the wave of ADP ribosylation that occurs during infection. Indeed, several PARPs are interferon-stimulated genes. While multiple targets have been proposed, the mechanistic links between ADP ribosylation and a robust antiviral response remain unclear.</p>
<p>Genetic inactivation of Mac1 abrogates viral replication in vivo, suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors of Mac1 could be developed into antivirals to treat COVID-19 and other emerging coronaviruses. The authors report a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor targeting Mac1 (AVI-4206) that demonstrates efficacy in human airway organoids and animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. While these results are compelling and provide proof of concept for the therapeutic targeting of Mac1, I am particularly intrigued by the potential of this compound as a probe to elucidate the mechanistic connections between infection-induced ADP ribosylation and the host antiviral response.</p>
<p>The precise function of Mac1 remains unclear. Given its presence in multiple viruses, it likely acts on a fundamental host immune pathway(s). AVI-4206, while promising as a lead compound for the development of antivirals targeting coronaviruses, could also be a valuable tool for uncovering the function of the Mac1 domain. This may lead to fundamental insights into the host immune response to viral infection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe the development of a novel inhibitor (AVI-4206) for the first macrodomains of the nsp3 protein of SARS-CoV-2 (Mac1). This involves both medical chemical synthesis, structural work as well as biochemical characterisation. Subsequently, the authors present their findings of the efficacy of the inhibitor both on cell culture, as well as animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They find that despite high affinity for Mac1 and the known replicatory defects of catalytically inactive Mac1 only moderate beneficial effects can be observed in their chosen models.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ a variety of different assay to study the affinity, selectivity and potency of the novel inhibitor and thus the in vitro data are very compelling.</p>
<p>
Similarly, the authors use several cell culture and in vivo models to strengthen their findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(a) The selection of Targ1 and MacroD2 as off-target human macrodomains is poor as several studies have shown that the first macrodomains of PARP9 and PARP14 are much closer related to coronaviral macrodomains and both macrodomains are implicated in antiviral defence and immunity.</p>
<p>(b) The authors utilize only replication efficiency and general infection markers as read out for their Mac1 inhibitor. It would be good if they could show impact on the ADP-ribosylation of a known Mac1 target such as PARP14.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were trying to validate SARS-CoV-2 Mac1 as a drug discovery target and by extension other viral macrodomains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The medicinal chemistry and structure based optimization is exemplary. Macrodomains and ADPribosyl hydrolases have a reputation for being undruggable, yet the authors managed to optimize hits from a fragment screen using structure based approaches and fragment linking to make a 20nM inhibitor as a tool compound to validate the target.</p>
<p>
In addition, the in vivo work is also a strength. The ability to reduce the viral count at a rate comparable to nirmatrelvir is impressive. Tracking the cytokine expression levels also supports much of the genetic data and mechanism of action for macrodomains.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main compound AVI-4206, while being very potent and selective is not appreciably orally bioavailable. The fact that they have to use high doses of the compound IP to see in vivo effects may lead to questions regarding off target effects.</p>
<p>The cellular models are not as predictive of antiviral activity as one would expect. However, the authors had enough chutzpah to test the compound in vivo knowing that cellular models might not be an accurate representation of a living system with a fully functional immune system all of which is most likely needed in an antiviral response to test the importance of Mac1 as a target.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for their thoughtful assessment. We especially agree that AVI-4206 will be a valuable tool to help understand the host immune response to viral infection.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for their comments and will address PARP9/14 selectivity with in vitro experiments and alignments/modeling. For ADP-ribosylation of PARP14, we will attempt experiments patterned after Kar et al, EMBO Journal, 2024, but note that detection of ADPr by IF and western has been relatively inconsistent and detection-reagent dependent in our hands. Regardless of the outcome, we will expand the discussion of the prior literature on this point.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #3 for their comments, especially noting that we had the “chutzpah” to go for the in vivo experiment. We share the concern about potential off target effects, which is why we prioritized so many selectivity experiments prior to testing. Ongoing chemistry efforts are focused on developing next-generation inhibitors that are orally bioavailable, but this work is in its early stages.</p>
