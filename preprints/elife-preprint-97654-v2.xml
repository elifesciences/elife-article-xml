<abstract>
<p>Psoriasis is a multifactorial disorder mediated by IL-17-producing T cells, involving immune cells and skin-constituting cells. Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A), an immune semaphorin, is known to take part in T helper type 1/17 differentiation and activation. However, Sema4A is also crucial for maintaining peripheral tissue homeostasis and its involvement in skin remains unknown. Here, we revealed that while Sema4A expression was pronounced in psoriatic blood lymphocytes and monocytes, it was downregulated in the keratinocytes of both psoriatic lesions and non-lesions compared to controls. Imiquimod application induced more severe dermatitis in Sema4A knockout (KO) mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The naÃ¯ve skin of Sema4AKO mice showed increased T cell infiltration and IL-17A expression along with thicker epidermis and distinct cytokeratin expression compared to WT mice, which are hallmarks of psoriatic non-lesions. Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice suggested that Sema4A expression in keratinocytes plays a regulatory role in imiquimod-induced dermatitis. The epidermis of psoriatic non-lesion and Sema4AKO mice demonstrated mTOR complex 1 upregulation, and the application of mTOR inhibitors reversed the skewed expression of cytokeratins in Sema4AKO mice. Conclusively, Sema4A- mediated signaling cascades can be triggers for psoriasis and targets in the treatment and prevention of psoriasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>While the infiltration of immune cells into skin plays a critical role in the development of psoriasis, as evidenced by interleukin (IL) -23/IL-17 axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fitch, Harper, Skorcheva, Kurtz, &amp; Blauvelt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hawkes, Yan, Chan, &amp; Krueger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim &amp; Krueger, 2017</xref>), recent studies have revealed that cells constructing skin structure, such as keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, also play pivotal roles in the development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Heidenreich, RÃ¶cken, &amp; Ghoreschi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lowes, Russell, Martin, Towne, &amp; Krueger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Arasa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Francis et al., 2024</xref>; Q. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ma et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>) of psoriasis. Among these cells, keratinocytes function as a barrier and produce cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides against foreign stimuli, resulting in the activation of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ni &amp; Lai, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhou, Chen, Cui, Shi, &amp; Guo, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Semaphorins were initially identified as guidance cues in neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kolodkin, Matthes, &amp; Goodman, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pasterkamp &amp; Kolodkin, 2003</xref>) but are now regarded to play crucial roles in other physiological processes including angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Iragavarapu-Charyulu, Wojcikiewicz, &amp; Urdaneta, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Serini, Maione, Giraudo, &amp; Bussolino, 2009</xref>), tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hui, Tam, Jiao, &amp; Ong, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nakayama, Kusumoto, Nakahara, Fujiwara, &amp; Higashiyama, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Rajabinejad et al., 2020</xref>), and immune systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garcia, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kanth, Gairhe, &amp; Torabi-Parizi, 2021</xref>; M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Naito &amp; Kumanogoh, 2023</xref>). Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A), one of the immune semaphorins, plays both pathogenic and therapeutic roles in autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cavalcanti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">He et al., 2023</xref>), allergic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Maeda et al., 2019</xref>), and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Iyer &amp; Chapoval, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Naito et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pan, Wang, &amp; Ye, 2016</xref>). While Sema4A expression on T cells is essential for T helper type 1 differentiation in the murine <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>-induced inflammation model and delayed-type hypersensitivity model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kumanogoh et al., 2005</xref>), Sema4A amplifies only T helper type 17 (Th17)-mediated inflammation in the effector phase of murine experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koda et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, in multiple sclerosis, high serum Sema4A levels correlate with the elevated serum IL-17A, earlier disease onset, and increased disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nakatsuji et al., 2012</xref>). In anti-tumor immunity, research involving human samples and murine models suggests that Sema4A expressed in cancer cells and regulatory T cells promotes tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Delgoffe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Pan et al., 2016</xref>), while other reports reveal that Sema4A in cancer cells and dendritic cells bolsters anti-tumor immunity by enhancing CD8 T cell activity (Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Naito et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Suga et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to these roles in immune reactions, mice with a point mutation in Sema4A develop retinal degeneration, suggesting that Sema4A is also crucial for peripheral tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nojima et al., 2013</xref>). These reports suggest that the role of Sema4A can differ based on the disease, phase, and involved cells.</p>
<p>Herein, we investigated the roles of Sema4A in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by analyzing skin and blood specimens from psoriatic subjects and using a murine model.</p>

<title>Epidermal Sema4A expression is downregulated in psoriasis</title>
<p>The analysis of previously-published single-cell RNA-sequencing data from control (Ctl) and psoriatic lesional (L) skin specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2023</xref>) revealed detectable expression of <italic>SEMA4A</italic> in keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages in both Ctl and L. <italic>SEMA4A</italic> expression was low in neural crest-like cells, fibroblasts, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, NK cells, and plasma cells, making the comparison of expression levels impractical (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1A-C). Dendritic cells and macrophages showed comparable <italic>SEMA4A</italic> expression levels between Ctl and L (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>padj</italic>) for <italic>SEMA4A</italic> in keratinocytes between Ctl and L was 2.83Ã10<sup>-39</sup>, indicating a statistically significant difference despite not being visually prominent in the volcano plot, which shows comprehensive differential gene expression in keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 1D).</p>

<p>Immunohistochemistry of Ctl and psoriasis demonstrated Sema4A expression in keratinocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The staining intensity of Sema4A in epidermis was significantly lower in both non-lesions (NL) and L than in Ctl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Relative mRNA expression of <italic>SEMA4A</italic> was also decreased in the epidermis of NL and L compared to Ctl, while it remained comparable in the dermis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, the proportions of Sema4A-positive cells were significantly higher in blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, and monocytes in psoriasis compared to Ctl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement 2). Serum Sema4A levels, measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were comparable between Ctl and psoriasis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These findings demonstrate that the expression profile of Sema4A in psoriasis varies across cell types.</p>

<title>Psoriasis-like dermatitis is augmented in Sema4AKO mice</title>
<p>When psoriasis-like dermatitis was induced in wild-type (WT) mice and Sema4A knockout (KO) mice by imiquimod application on ears (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), ear swelling on day 4 was more pronounced in Sema4AKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) with upregulated <italic>Il17a</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis of cells isolated from the ears revealed increased proportions of VÎ³2<sup>+</sup> T cells, VÎ³2<sup>-</sup>VÎ³3<sup>-</sup> double- negative (DN) Î³Î´ T cells, and IL-17A-producing cells of those fractions in Sema4AKO epidermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 1). In Sema4AKO dermis, there was also an increase in the proportions of VÎ³2<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-17A-producing VÎ³2<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These results suggest that Sema4A deficiency in mice accelerates psoriatic profile. IL-17A-producing T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes (dLN) remained comparable between WT mice and Sema4AKO mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>

<p>Though the imiquimod model is well-established and valuable murine psoriatic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">van der Fits et al., 2009</xref>), the vehicle of imiquimod cream can activate skin inflammation that is independent of toll-like receptor 7, such as inflammasome activation, keratinocyte death and interleukin-1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Walter et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the imiquimod model involves complex pathway. Therefore, we subsequently induced IL-23-mediated psoriasis-like dermatitis (Figure2-figure supplement 2A), a much simpler murine psoriatic model, because IL-23 is thought to play a central role in psoriasis pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Krueger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Although ear swelling on day 4 was comparable between WT mice and Sema4AKO mice (Figure2-figure supplement 2B), the epidermis, but not the dermis, was significantly thicker in Sema4AKO mice compared to WT mice (Figure2-figure supplement 2C). We found that the proportion of CD4 T cells among T cells was significantly higher in Sema4A KO mice compared to WT mice, while the proportion of VÎ³2 and DNÎ³Î´ T cells among T cells was comparable between them (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement 2D). On the other hand, focusing on IL-17A-producing cells, the proportion of IL-17A-producing VÎ³2 and DNÎ³Î´ T cells in CD3 fraction in the epidermis was significantly higher in Sema4A KO mice, consistent with the results from imiquimod- induced psoriasis-like dermatitis.

<title>Sema4A in keratinocytes may play a role in preventing murine psoriasis-like dermatitis</title>
<p>To investigate the cells responsible for the augmented ear swelling in Sema4AKO mice, bone marrow chimeric mice were next analyzed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Since it has already been reported that bone marrow cells contain keratinocyte stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Harris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wu, Zhao, &amp; Tredget, 2010</xref>), we confirmed that epidermis of mice deficient in non-hematopoietic Sema4A (WTâKO) showed no obvious detection of <italic>Sema4a</italic>, thereby ruling out the impact of donor-derived keratinocyte stem cells infiltrating the host epidermis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1A). WTâKO mice displayed more pronounced ear swelling than mice with intact Sema4A expression (WTâWT) following imiquimod application (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Similarly, mice with a systemic deficiency of Sema4A (KOâKO) showed severe ear swelling compared to mice deficient in hematopoietic Sema4A (KOâWT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Ear swelling was comparable between WTâWT mice and KOâWT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Flow cytometry analysis revealed increased infiltration of IL-17A-producing DNÎ³Î´ T cells in the epidermis, as well as VÎ³2<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-17A-producing VÎ³2<sup>+</sup> T cells in the dermis, in WTâKO mice compared to WTâWT mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement 1B). These findings suggest that non-hematopoietic cells, possibly keratinocytes, are primarily responsible for the increased imiquimod-induced Sema4AKO mice ear swelling.</p>

<p>Even without imiquimod application, Sema4AKO ears turned out to be slightly but significantly thicker than WT ears on week 8 while their appearance remained normal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

These differences were not observed in dermis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1A). Flow cytometry analysis revealed increased infiltration of Î³Î´ T cells in Sema4AKO ear (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1B). These cells predominantly expressed resident memory T cell (T<sub>RM</sub>)-characteristic molecules, CD69 and CD103 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1B). Sema4AKO skin also had a higher number of T<sub>RM</sub> in both CD4 and CD8 T cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 1B). The percentages of VÎ³2<sup>+</sup> T cells, DNÎ³Î´ T cells, and CD8 T cells in epidermis were higher in Sema4AKO mice than in WT mice, which was not the case in dermis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 2A). The proportion of VÎ³3<sup>+</sup> dendritic epidermal T cells was comparable between WT mice and Sema4AKO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 2A).

Conversely, the frequency of IL-17A- producing T cells from dLN was comparable (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The production of IL-17A and IFNÎ³ from splenic T cells under T17-polarizing conditions remained consistent between WT mice and Sema4AKO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>-figure supplement 3).</p>
<p>Taken together, it is suggested that T17 cells are specifically upregulated in epidermis, indicating that the epidermal microenvironment plays a pivotal role in facilitating the increased T cell infiltration observed in naÃ¯ve Sema4AKO mice.</p>

<title>mTOR signaling is upregulated in the epidermis of psoriatic NL and Sema4AKO mice</title>
<p>Previous reports have shown that mTOR pathway plays a critical role in maintaining epidermal homeostasis, as evidenced by mice with keratinocyte-specific deficiencies in Mtor, Raptor, or Rictor, which exhibit a hypoplastic epidermis with impaired differentiation and barrier formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Asrani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ding et al., 2020</xref>). We thus investigated mTOR pathway in both human and murine epidermis.</p>
<p>Immunohistochemical analyses highlighted the increase in phospho-S6 (p-S6), indicating the upregulation of mTOR complex (C) 1 signaling, in the epidermal upper layers of both L and NL compared to Ctl (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). The activation of mTORC2 in the epidermis, inferred from phospho-Akt (p-Akt), was scarcely detectable in L, NL, and Ctl (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). In the epidermis of WT mice and Sema4AKO mice, the upregulation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling was observed in Sema4AKO epidermis by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Western blot analysis showed upregulated mTORC1 signaling in Sema4AKO epidermis compared to WT epidermis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).

<title>Inhibition of mTOR signaling modulates cytokeratin expression in Sema4AKO mice</title>
<p>To investigate the contribution of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in the development of psoriatic features in the Sema4AKO epidermis, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin and mTORC2 inhibitor JR-AB2-011 were intraperitoneally applied to Sema4AKO mice for 14 days. Although epidermal thickness remained unchanged by the inhibitors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A and B</xref>), relative gene expression of <italic>Krt5</italic> was significantly upregulated and that of <italic>Krt16</italic> was significantly downregulated after rapamycin application (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). While the upregulation of <italic>Il17a</italic> in Sema4AKO epidermis was not clearly modified by rapamycin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), immunofluorescence revealed the decrease in the number of CD3 T cells in Sema4AKO epidermis by rapamycin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). We additionally conducted topical application of rapamycin gel and vehicle gel on the left and right ears of Sema4AKO mice, respectively. Although there were no detectable changes in epidermal thickness and epidermal T cell counts, the upregulation of <italic>Krt5</italic> and downregulation of <italic>Krt16</italic> was observed again (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 1). Conversely, the application of JR-AB2-011 resulted in decreased expression of <italic>Krt5</italic>, <italic>Krt10</italic>, and <italic>Krt14</italic> with a trend towards increased <italic>Krt16</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). JR- AB2-011 did not influence the number of infiltrating T cells in the epidermis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Next, we investigated whether intraperitoneal rapamycin treatment effectively downregulates inflammation in the IMQ-induced murine model of psoriasis in Sema4AKO mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 2A). Rapamycin significantly reduced epidermal thickness compared to vehicle treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 2B). Additionally, rapamycin treatment downregulated the expression of <italic>Krt10</italic>, <italic>Krt14</italic>, and <italic>Krt16</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 2C). While the upregulation of <italic>Il17a</italic> in the Sema4AKO epidermis in IMQ model was not clearly modified by rapamycin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 2C), immunofluorescence revealed a decrease in the number of CD3 T cells in Sema4AKO epidermis by rapamycin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>-figure supplement 2D). In the naive states, mTORC1 primarily regulates keratinocyte proliferation, whereas mTORC2 mainly involved in the keratinocyte differentiation through Sema4A-related signaling pathways. Conversely, in the psoriatic dermatitis state, rapamycin downregulated both keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation markers.

<p>Recent studies have highlighted the significance of IL-17A-producing T<sub>RM</sub> in psoriatic NL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cheuk et al., 2014</xref>; Gallais <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">SÃ©rÃ©zal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vu, Koguchi-Yoshioka, &amp; Watanabe, 2021</xref>). This condition is also characterized by epidermal thickening with elevated CCL20 expression (Gallais <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">SÃ©rÃ©zal et al., 2019</xref>) and a distinct cytokeratin expression pattern, marked by increased levels of Krt5, Krt14, and Krt16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tsoi et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Here, we identified that murine Sema4A deficiency could induce these features of psoriatic NL.</p>
<p>Sema4A expression in epidermis, but not in dermis, was diminished in psoriatic L and NL compared to Ctl. While Sema4A expression on blood immune cells was upregulated in psoriasis, its serum levels were comparable between Ctl and psoriasis. Despite the reported involvement of increased Sema4A expression on immune cells in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nakatsuji et al., 2012</xref>), our results suggest that the diminished expression of Sema4A in skin-constructing cells plays a more prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis than its increased expression on immune cells.</p>
<p>In our murine model, regardless of imiquimod application, IL-17A-producing T cells were increased in Sema4AKO skin although their frequency was comparable in dLN of WT mice and Sema4AKO mice. Additionally, the potential for <italic>in vitro</italic> T17 differentiation did not differ between T cells from WT mice and Sema4AKO mice. These findings suggest that the absence of Sema4A in the skin microenvironment plays a crucial role in the localized upregulation of IL-17A-producing T cells in Sema4AKO mice.</p>
<p>It is well-documented that upregulated mTORC1 signaling promotes the pathogenesis of psoriasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Buerger, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Karagianni, Pavlidis, Malakou, Piperi, &amp; Papadavid, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ruf, Andreoli, Itin, Pluschke, &amp; Schmid, 2014</xref>), and that rapamycin can partially ameliorate the disease activity in psoriatic subjects and murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">BÃ¼rger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gao &amp; Si, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Reitamo et al., 2001</xref>). Our results using Sema4AKO mice revealed that inhibition of mTORC1 leads to the downregulation of <italic>Krt16</italic>, and inhibition of mTORC2 leads to the downregulation of undifferentiated keratinocytes, while the Sema4AKO epidermal thickening and the upregulated IL-17A signaling are not reversed by mTOR blockade in the naÃ¯ve state. It is plausible that the downregulation of Sema4A can lead to the upregulation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in keratinocytes, and the augmented signaling leads to the psoriatic profile of proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, which is part of the psoriatic NL disposition.</p>
<p>This study has limitations. Sema4A expression in skin cells other than keratinocytes was not thoroughly investigated. However, since single-cell RNA- sequencing has shown that Sema4A is predominantly expressed in keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, with a notable reduction in keratinocytes in psoriasis, we infer that keratinocytes are the primary cells responsible for the psoriatic features resulting from Sema4A downregulation. We were not able to determine whether Sema4A functions as a ligand or a receptor in epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ito &amp; Kumanogoh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kumanogoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) in this study, either. We were not able to reveal how Sema4A expression is regulated. Although we showed that downregulation of Sema4A is related to the abnormal cytokeratin expression observed in psoriasis, we could not determine the relationships between Sema4A expression and the essential molecules upregulated in psoriatic keratinocytes. While both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signals are upregulated in Sema4AKO epidermis, we were not able to confirm mTORC2 signaling from human skin due to technical limitation and sample limitation, while the results from augmented mTORC2 signal in Sema4AKO mice and the normalization of <italic>Krt5</italic> and <italic>Krt14</italic> by mTORC2 inhibitor imply the involvement of mTORC2 signal in psoriatic epidermis. The role of Sema4A other than mTOR signaling, which may be involved in the regulation of T17 induction in skin, is not discussed, either. These limitations should be overcome in the near future.</p>
<p>In summary, epidermal Sema4A downregulation can reflect the psoriatic non- lesional features. Thus, targeting the downregulated Sema4A and upregulated mTOR signaling in psoriatic epidermis can be a promising strategy for psoriasis therapy and modification of psoriatic diathesis in NL for the prevention of disease development.</p>

<title>Human sample collection</title>
<p>Psoriatic L and NL skin specimens were acquired from 17 psoriasis patients. Ctl specimens were obtained from 19 subjects who underwent tumor resection or reconstructive surgery. For epidermal-dermal separation, specimens were incubated overnight at 4â with 2.5 mg/mL dispase â¡ (Wako, Osaka, Japan) in IMDM (Wako). Blood samples were collected from 73 psoriasis and 33 Ctl. In addition to ELISA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Nakatsuji et al., 2012</xref>), peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Ficoll- Paque PLUS density gradient media (Cytiva, Tokyo, Japan). Patient details are provided in Supplemental Table 1.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>Mice</title>
<p>C57BL/6J WT mice were procured from CLEA Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Sema4AKO mice with C57BL/6J background were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kumanogoh et al., 2005</xref>). We examined female mice in order to reduce the result variation. Neonatal mice and female mice aged 8 to 12 weeks, maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions, were used.</p>
<p>To develop psoriasis-like dermatitis, 10 mg of 5% imiquimod cream (Mochida, Tokyo, Japan) was applied to both ears for 4 consecutive days. To induce IL-23- mediated psoriasis-like dermatitis, 20 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 ng of recombinant mouse IL-23 (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) was injected intradermally into both ears of anesthetized mice using a 29-gauge needle for 4 consecutive days. Ear thickness was measured using a thickness gauge (Peacock, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
<p>For bone marrow reconstitution, 2 Ã 10<sup>5</sup> bone marrow cells obtained from the indicated strains were intravenously transferred to recipient mice that had received a single 10 Gy irradiation. The reconstituted mice were subjected to the experiments in 8 weeks.</p>
<p>In the specified experiments, skin specimens were separated into epidermis and dermis by 5 mg/mL dispase (Wako) in IMDM for 30 minutes at 37â.</p>
<p>Transepidermal water loss measurements were performed on the back skin of mice at week 8 using a Tewameter (Courage and Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany), according to the manufacturerâs instructions.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer solution (Wako), embedded in paraffin, and sliced into 3-Î¼m thickness on glass slides. After deparaffinization and rehydration, antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (pH 6.0, Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) or TE buffer (pH 9.0, Nacalai tesque).</p>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, samples were incubated with 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Wako) for 5 minutes. After blocking (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), the specimens were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies under specified conditions (Supplemental Table 2). The specimens were applied with the Dako REAL EnVision Detection System, Peroxidase/DAB, Rabbit/Mouse, HRP kit (Agilent) and counterstained with hematoxylin (Wako). For immunofluorescence, the blocked specimens were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies followed by the secondary antibodies (Table E4). Mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used. Slides were observed using a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X700, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). The staining intensity was measured using Fiji software (ImageJ, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) over lengths of 200 Î¼m in human samples and 100 Î¼m in murine samples. This measurement was taken from five areas of each specimen, and the average score is presented. The average thickness of epidermis and dermis from 10 spots is presented. The number of epidermal cells positive for the indicated cytokeratins was counted per 100 Î¼m width, with the average number from 5 areas being presented. Additionally, the numbers of CD3-positive cells in murine ears were counted across 10 fields of 400 Î¼m width, with the total sum being presented.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry analysis</title>
<p>Single-cell suspensions from murine skin-dLN and spleen were prepared by grinding, filtering, and lysing red blood cells (BioLegend). Skin specimens were minced and digested with 3 mg/mL collagenase type III (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ) in RPMI 1640 medium (Wako) at 37â for 10 minutes for epidermis, and 30 minutes for dermis or whole skin. Cells were surface-stained with directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Supplemental Table 4). Dead cells were identified using LIVE/DEAD<sup>TM</sup> Fixable Dead Cell Stain Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To evaluate cytokine production, cells were stimulated with Phorbol 12-Myristate 13- Acetate (PMA; 50 ng/mL, Wako) and ionomycin (1000 ng/mL, Wako), plus BD Golgiplug<sup>TM</sup> (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 4 hours before surface staining. Fixation, permeabilization, and intracellular cytokine staining were performed using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm<sup>TM</sup> Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturerâs protocol. In specified experiments, the numbers of each cell subset per ear were estimated using CountBright<sup>TM</sup> Absolute Counting Beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

<p>Rapamycin (4 mg/kg, Sanxin Chempharma, Hebei, China), JR-AB2-011 (400 Î¼g/kg, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ) and vehicle were applied intraperitoneally to mice once daily for 14 consecutive days. Rapamycin and JR-AB2- 011 were dissolved in 100% DMSO and diluted with 40% Polyethylene Glycol 300 (Wako), 5% Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and 45% saline in sequence. For topical application, 0.2% rapamycin gel and vehicle gel were prepared by the pharmaceutical department as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wataya-Kaneda et al., 2017</xref>). Rapamycin gel was applied to the left ear, and vehicle gel to the right ear (10mg/ear) of Sema4AKO, once daily for 14 consecutive days. To analyze the preventive effectiveness of rapamycin in an IMQ-induced murine model of psoriatic dermatitis, Sema4AKO mice were administered either vehicle or rapamycin intraperitoneally from Day 0 to Day 17, and IMQ was topically applied to both ears for 4 days starting on Day 14.

<title>Data processing of single-cell RNA-sequencing and bulk RNA-sequencing</title>
<p>The raw count matrix data from the previously reported single-cell RNA- sequencing data from GSE220116 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kim et al., 2023</xref>) were imported into Scanpy (1.9.6) using Python for further analyses. For each sample, cells and genes meeting the following criteria were excluded: cells expressing over 200 genes (sc.pp.filter_cells), cells with a high proportion of mitochondrial genes (&gt; 5%), and genes expressed in fewer than 3 cells (sc.pp.filter_genes). Counts were normalized using sc.pp.normalize_per_cell, logarithmized (sc.pp.log1p), and scaled (sc.pp.scale). Highly variable genes were selected using sc.pp.filter_genes_dispersion with the options min_mean = 0.0125, max_mean = 2.5, and min_disp = 0.7.</p>
<p>Principal Component analysis was conducted with sc.pp.pca, selecting the 1st to 50th Principal Components for embedding and clustering. Neighbors were calculated with batch effect correction by BBKNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">PolaÅski et al., 2020</xref>). Embedding was performed by sc.tl.umap, and cells were clustered using sc.tl.leiden. Some cells were further subclassified in a similar manner. The data was integrated into an h5ad file, which can be visualized in Cellxgene VIP (K. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al., 2022</xref>). We then performed differential analysis between two groups of cells to identify differential expressed genes using Welchâs t-test. Multiple comparisons were controlled using the Benjamini- Hochberg procedure, with the false discovery rate set at 0.05 and significance defined as <italic>padj</italic> &lt; 0.05.</p>
<p>Bulk RNA-sequencing data from GSE121212 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tsoi et al., 2019</xref>) were re- analyzed using RaNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Prieto &amp; Barrios, 2019</xref>) for differential expression in Ctl versus psoriatic NL. Our analysis included normalization, differential gene expression (defining significance as <italic>padj</italic> &lt; 0.05), and focused on Gene Ontology biological process analysis. The gene expression was calculated with the transcripts per million values.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Kume et al examined the role of the protein Semaphorin 4a in steady state skin homeostasis and how this relates to skin changes seen in human psoriasis and imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like disease in mice. The authors found that human psoriatic skin has reduced expression of Sema4a in the epidermis. While Sema4a has been shown to drive inflammatory activation in different immune populations, this finding suggested Sema4a might be important for negatively regulating Th17 inflammation in the skin. The authors go on to show that Sema4a knockout mice have skin changes in key keratinocyte genes, increased gdT cells, and increased IL-17 similar to differences seen in non-lesional psoriatic skin, and that bone marrow chimera mice with WT immune cells and Sema4a KO stromal cells develop worse IMQ-induced psoriasis-like disease, further linking expression of Sema4a in the skin to maintaining skin homeostasis. The authors next studied downstream pathways that might mediate the homeostatic effects of Sema4a, focusing on mTOR given its known role in keratinocyte function. Like for the immune phenotypes, Sema4a KO mice had increased mTOR activation in the epidermis in a similar pattern to mTOR activation noted in non-lesional psoriatic skin. The authors next targeted the mTOR pathway and showed rapamycin could reverse some of the psoriasis-like skin changes in Sema4a KO mice, confirming the role of increased mTOR in contributing to the observed skin phenotype.</p>
<p>In the revised manuscript, the authors expand on the potential relevance to psoriasis by demonstrating similar findings in an IL-23-diriven model of skin inflammation, which is an orthogonal model of psoriasis to their original IMQ model. They also show that in addition to reversing steady state differences in skin thickness between Sema4a KO mice and WT mice, rapamycin improves metrics of disease in the IMQ model of psoriasis. These additional studies further bolster their conclusions that Sema4a may play a protective role in by preventing over-activation of mTOR in the skin in psoriasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The most interesting finding is the tissue-specific role for Sema4a, where it has previously been considered to play a mostly pro-inflammatory role in immune cells, this study shows that when expressed by keratinocytes, Sema4a plays a homeostatic role that when missing leads to development of psoriasis-like skin changes. This has important implications in terms of targeting Sema4a pharmacologically. It also may yield a novel mouse model to study mechanisms of psoriasis development in mice separate from the commonly used IMQ model. The included experiments are well-controlled and executed rigorously.</p>
<p>The new experiments provide additional data to support the conclusions through an orthogonal model of psoriasis and demonstrating rapamycin-induced reversal of changes in the IMQ disease model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the main weakness of these studies, lack of tissue-specific Sema4a knockout mice (e.g. in keratinocytes only), remains, generating these mice and performing the necessary experiments is beyond the scope of completing these particular studies. Similarly, it is understandable that additional bone marrow chimeras would be costly and labor intensive without adding much more in the absence of tissue-specific knockouts.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Kume et al. found for the first time that Semaphorin 4A (Sema4A) was downregulated in both mRNA and protein levels in L and NL keratinocytes of psoriasis patients compared to control keratinocytes. In peripheral blood, they found that Sema4A is not only expressed in keratinocytes but is also upregulated in hematopoietic cells such as lymphocytes and monocytes in the blood of psoriasis patients. They investigated how the down-regulation of Sema4A expression in psoriatic epidermal cells affects the immunological inflammation of psoriasis by using a psoriasis mice model in which Sema4A KO mice were treated with IMQ. Kume et al. hypothesized that down-regulation of Sema4A expression in keratinocytes might be responsible for the augmentation of psoriasis inflammation. Using bone marrow chimeric mice, Kume et al. showed that KO of Sema4A in non-hematopoietic cells was responsible for the enhanced inflammation in psoriasis. The expression of CCL20, TNF, IL-17, and mTOR was upregulated in the Sema4AKO epidermis compared to the WT epidermis, and the infiltration of IL-17-producing T cells was also enhanced.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Decreased Sema4A expression may be involved in psoriasis exacerbation through epidermal proliferation and enhanced infiltration of Th17 cells, which helps understand psoriasis immunopathogenesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanism of decreased Sema4A expression in psoriasis is not clear, although this does not affect the strength of this research.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Kume et al examined the role of the protein Semaphorin 4a in steady-state skin homeostasis and how this relates to skin changes seen in human psoriasis and imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like disease in mice.

The authors next studied downstream pathways that might mediate the homeostatic effects of Sema4a, focusing on mTOR given its known role in keratinocyte function. As with the immune phenotypes, Sema4a KO mice had increased mTOR activation in the epidermis in a similar pattern to mTOR activation noted in non-lesional psoriatic skin. The authors next targeted the mTOR pathway and showed rapamycin could reverse some of the psoriasis-like skin changes in Sema4a KO mice, confirming the role of increased mTOR in contributing to the observed skin phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The most interesting finding is the tissue-specific role for Sema4a, where it has previously been considered to play a mostly pro-inflammatory role in immune cells, this study shows that when expressed by keratinocytes, Sema4a plays a homeostatic role that when missing leads to the development of psoriasis-like skin changes. This has important implications in terms of targeting Sema4a pharmacologically. It also may yield a novel mouse model to study mechanisms of psoriasis development in mice separate from the commonly used IMQ model. The included experiments are well-controlled and executed rigorously.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A weakness of the study is the lack of tissue-specific Sema4a knockout mice (e.g. in keratinocytes only). The authors did use bone marrow chimeras, but only in one experiment. This work implies that psoriasis may represent a Sema4a-deficient state in the epidermal cells, while the same might not be true for immune cells. Indeed, in their analysis of non-lesional psoriasis skin, Sema4a was not significantly decreased compared to control skin, possibly due to compensatory increased Sema4a from other cell types. Unbiased RNA-seq of Sema4a KO mouse skin for comparison to non-lesional skin might identify other similarities besides mTOR signaling. Indeed, targeting mTOR with rapamycin reveres some of the skin changes in Sema4a KO mice, but not skin thickness, so other pathways impacted by Sema4a may be better targets if they could be identified. Utilizing WTâKO chimeras in addition to global KO mice in the experiments in Figures 6-8 would more strongly implicate the separate role of Sema4a in skin vs immune cell populations and might more closely mimic non-lesional psoriasis skin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate your summary and for pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of our study. Although we were unfortunately unable to perform all these experiments due to limitations in our resources, we fully agree with the importance of studying tissue-specific Sema4A KO mice. As an alternative, we compared the IL-17A-producing potential of skin T cells between WTâKO mice and KOâKO mice following 4 consecutive days of IMQ treatment using flow cytometry. The results were comparable between the two groups. Additionally, we performed RNA-seq on the epidermis of WT and Sema4A KO mice. While we did not find similarities between Sema4A KO skin and non-lesional psoriasis except for <italic>S100a8</italic> expression, we will further try to seek for the mechanisms how Sema4A KO skin mimics non-lesional psoriasis skin as a future project.</p>
<p>Although targeting mTOR with rapamycin did not reverse the epidermal thickness in Sema4A KO mice, rapamycin was effective in reducing epidermal thickness in a murine psoriasis model induced by IMQ in Sema4A KO mice. These results suggest potential clinical relevance for treating active, lesional psoriatic skin changes, which would be of interest to clinicians. Thank you once again for your valuable insights.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate your summary and thoughtful feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of our study. In response, we have included the results of additional experiments on IL-23-mediated psoriasis-like dermatitis, which showed that epidermal thickness was significantly greater in KO mice compared to WT mice. When we analyzed the T cells infiltrating the ears using flow cytometry, the proportion of IL-17A producing VÎ³2 and DNÎ³Î´ T cells within the CD3 fraction of the epidermis was significantly higher in Sema4A KO mice, consistent with the results from IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis. Furthermore, we examined STAT3 expression in the epidermis of WT and Sema4A KO mice using Western blot analysis, and the results were comparable between the two groups. However, the mechanism by which decreased Sema4A expression may exacerbate psoriasis remains unclear. We have added some explanations and presumptions to the limitations section. Thank you once again for your valuable insights.</p>

<p>What statistics were used? The supplemental notes adjusted the P value, what correction for multiple comparisons was utilized? Could the authors instead show logFC for the DEGs between Ctl and L in each cluster? This might be best demonstrated with a volcano plot, highlighting SEMA4A, and other genes known to be DE in psoriasis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for not including the detailed analysis methods in the original manuscript submission. We analyzed the scRNA-seq data using Cellxgene VIP with Welchâs t-test. Multiple comparisons were performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, setting the false discovery rate (FDR) at 0.05. These details are now explained in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section of the resubmitted manuscript. We also added a log2FC-log10 <italic>p</italic>-value graph for the DEGs in keratinocytes between Ctl and L to Figure 1-figure supplement 1D. The log2FC values in keratinocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages were -0.07, 0.00, and -0.05, respectively. Although the log2FC is low in keratinocytes, the adjusted p-value (<italic>padj</italic>) for Sema4A is 2.83Ã10-39, indicating a statistically significant difference.</p>

<p><italic>The results narrative notes WT-&gt;WT is comparable to KO-&gt;WT. No statistics are given for this comparison. It appears the difference is less than the other comparisons, but still may be significant. Also, in the supplemental for Figure 2B, there appear to be missing columns for the 4 BM chimera groups (columns for WT and KO, but not 4 columns for each donor: recipient pair).</italic></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely apologize for any confusion. We presented the results of the chimeric mice in Figure 3, and Figure 3-source data 1 shows the 4 BM chimera groups. In Figure 3B, the <italic>p</italic>-value for the comparison between WT-&gt;WT mice and KO-&gt;WT mice was 0.7988, as indicated in Figure 3-source data 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 3B</p>
<p>While ear skin is not easily obtainable at day 0 for comparison, why not also include back skin at Wk 8? If the back skin epidermis is thicker like the ear skin, it supports the ear skin conclusion and adds a more consistent comparison. If the back skin epidermis is not thicker, what would be the author's explanation as to the why only ear skin epidermis is thicker in KO mice at 8 weeks?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate and completely agree with the reviewerâs insightful comment. We have added images and dot plots of the back skin at Week 8 in Figure 4B. Since the back skin epidermis is thicker, similar to the ear skin, these results support the conclusion drawn from the ear skin data. Regarding Figure 4C, which shows the expression of Sema4a in the epidermis and dermis of 8-week-old WT mouse ear, we have modified the sentence in the manuscript to âthe epidermis of WT ear at Week 8â for clarification.</p>
<p>Page 12 Line 180 in the resubmitted manuscript:</p>
<p>âWhile epidermal thickness of back skin was comparable at birth (Figure 4B), on week 8, epidermis of Sema4AKO back and ear skin was notably thicker than that of WT mice (Figure 4B), suggesting that acanthosis in Sema4AKO mice is accentuated post-birth.â</p>

<p>Figures 3C&amp;D, Figures 4 D-F</p>
<p>The figures might be easier to read if some of the data is moved to supplemental, especially in Figure 4, which has 36 panels just in D-F. Conversely, the dLN data is important in establishing the skin microenvironment as important in the accumulation of Î³Î´ cells and IL-17 production in the setting of Sema4a KO, so this might be more impactful if moved to the main figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate and agree with your comments. As recommended, we have moved data from Figure 3C and 4D-F to the supplemental section. The dLN data have been moved to the main figure as Figure 4E. This has improved the readability of the figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 5 and Figure 6 might work better if combined. The differences in keratinocytes in psoriasis are well-known, so the novelty is how Sema4a KO skin appears to share similar differences. This would be easier to see if compared side-by-side in the same figure. Also, there is an opportunity to show this more rigorously by performing RNA-seq on WT vs Sema4a KO skin. Showing a larger set of DEGs that trend similarly between Ctl/NL psoriasis and WT/Sema4a KO skin in a heatmap would bolster the conclusion that Sema4a deficiency contributes to a psoriasis-like skin defect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your valuable suggestion. Following your recommendation, we have combined Figures 5 and 6 to facilitate a side-by-side comparison. This highlights the similarities between Sema4AKO skin and psoriasis, making it easier to observe differences in keratinocytes. Additionally, we performed RNA-seq on WT and Sema4a KO epidermis (<italic>n</italic> = 3 per group). We analyzed the raw count data using iDEP 2.0 (Ge S.X., <italic>BMC Bioinformatics</italic>, 2018), setting the minimal counts per million to 0.5 in at least one library. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using DEseq2, with an FDR cutoff of 0.1 and a minimum fold change of 2. As a result, we identified 46 upregulated and 70 downregulated genes in Sema4AKO mice compared to WT mice (see the volcano plot and heat map). However, except for <italic>S100a8</italic>, we did not observe significant expression changes in non-lesional psoriasis-related genes between WT and Sema4AKO mice. In the future, we aim to identify subtle stimuli that could cause gene expression changes between these groups and we would like to perform additional RNA-seq experiments.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>SEMA4A is not significantly DE between Ctl and NL in the psoriasis RNA-seq data. If a lower expression of SEMA4A in psoriasis skin is a driving part of the phenotype, why is this not observed in the RNA-seq data? Presumably, this could be explained by infiltration of immune cells with increased SEMA4A expression, like in the scRNA-seq data in Figure 1. If so, might it be useful to analyze WT-&gt;KO chimera mice similarly to global KO mice in Figures 6-8? This might more accurately reflect what is happening in psoriasis, if epidermal SEMA4A expression is low, but immune expression is not. The KO data on their own nicely show a skin phenotype, but these additional experiments might more closely mimic psoriatic disease and increase the rigor and impact of the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate your insightful comments. Due to the limitations of the animal experimentation facility, we regret that we are unable to create additional chimeric mice. Although our analysis is limited, we compared IL-17A production from T cells of WTâKO mice and KOâKO mice following 4 consecutive days of IMQ treatment using flow cytometry (see Author response image 3 below; <italic>n</italic> = 6 for WTâKO, <italic>n</italic> = 4 for KOâKO). This comparison revealed that IL-17A production from T cells was comparable, regardless of whether they were derived from WT or Sema4AKO mice, when the skin constituent cells were derived from Sema4AKO. We appreciate the value of your advice, and agree that investigating keratinocyte differentiation and mTOR signaling in the epidermis, using either WTâKO chimeric mice or keratinocyte-specific Sema4A-deficient mice, is a crucial next step in our research.</p>

<p>Figure 8</p>
<p>Rapamycin was able to partially reverse the psoriasis-like skin phenotype in Sema4a KO mice. Would rapamycin also be effective in the more severe disease induced by IMQ in Sema4a KO mice? While partially reducing the effect of Sema4a KO on steady-state skin with rapamycin strengthens the link to mTOR dysregulation, it did not change skin thickness. It's unclear if this would be useful clinically for patients with well-controlled psoriasis (NL skin). Would it be useful to reverse active, lesional psoriatic skin changes? Testing this might yield results more relevant to clinicians and patients.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for your valuable feedback. Rapamycin showed effectiveness in reducing epidermal thickness in a murine psoriasis model induced by IMQ in Sema4AKO mice. Rapamycin treatment downregulated the expression of <italic>Krt10</italic>, <italic>Krt14</italic>, and <italic>Krt16</italic>. We included these results to Figure 7-figure supplement 2. These results suggest potential clinical relevance for treating active, lesional psoriatic skin changes and may be of interest to clinicians and patients.</p>
<p>Page 17 Line 269 in the resubmitted manuscript:</p>
<p>âNext, we investigated whether intraperitoneal rapamycin treatment effectively downregulates inflammation in the IMQ-induced murine model of psoriasis in Sema4AKO mice (Figure 7-figure supplement 2A). Rapamycin significantly reduced epidermal thickness compared to vehicle treatment (Figure 7-figure supplement 2B). Additionally, rapamycin treatment downregulated the expression of <italic>Krt10</italic>, <italic>Krt14</italic>, and <italic>Krt16</italic> (Figure 7-figure supplement 2C). While the upregulation of <italic>Il17a</italic> in the Sema4AKO epidermis in IMQ model was not clearly modified by rapamycin (Figure 7-figure supplement 2C), immunofluorescence revealed a decrease in the number of CD3 T cells in Sema4AKO epidermis by rapamycin (Figure 7-figure supplement 2D). In the naive states, mTORC1 primarily regulates keratinocyte proliferation, whereas mTORC2 mainly involved in the keratinocyte differentiation through Sema4A-related signaling pathways. Conversely, in the psoriatic dermatitis state, rapamycin downregulated both keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation markers. The observed similarities in <italic>Il17a</italic> expression following treatment with rapamycin and JR-AB2-011, regardless of additional IMQ treatment, suggest that <italic>Il17a</italic> production is not significantly dependent on Sema4A-related mTOR signaling.â</p>
<p>Page 29 Line 461 in the resubmitted manuscript: In the âInhibition of mTORâ section.</p>

<p>(1) To know whether the decrease of Sema4A in the epidermis of psoriasis patients is a result or a cause of psoriasis, it is necessary to show how the expression of Sema4A in epidermal cells is regulated. Shouldn't the degree of change in the expression of essential molecules (which is the cause of psoriasis) be more pronounced in L than in NL?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We surveyed transcription factors of human Sema4A using GeneCards and found that NF-ÎºB is the transcription factor most frequently associated with psoriasis. Wang et al. (<italic>Arthritis Res Ther.</italic> 2015) indicated NF-ÎºB-dependent modulation of Sema4A expression in synovial fibroblasts of rheumatoid arthritis. However, since NF-ÎºB expression is reportedly upregulated in psoriasis lesions, other transcription factors may function as key modulators of Sema4A expression in the epidermis.</p>
<p>Although the molecules causing psoriasis remain to be elucidated, we investigated the correlation between the expression of psoriasis-related essential molecules in keratinocytesâsuch as <italic>S100A7A, S100A7</italic>, <italic>S100A8</italic>, <italic>S100A9</italic>, and <italic>S100A12</italic>âand <italic>SEMA4A</italic> expression in L and NL samples using qRT-PCR. We could not identify a correlation between these molecules and <italic>SEMA4A</italic> expression. We added a note to the limitations section to acknowledge that we were not able to reveal how Sema4A expression is regulated and that we could not determine the relationships between Sema4A expression and the essential molecules upregulated in psoriatic keratinocytes.</p>

<p>(2) Using bone marrow chimeric mice, it has already been reported that hematopoietic cells contain keratinocyte stem cells. Therefore, their interpretation is not supported by the results of their bone marrow chimeric mice experiment, and it is essential to generate keratinocyte-specific Sema4A knockout mice and perform similar experiments to support their interpretation.</p>

<p>We value the reviewerâs insightful comment. We have assessed the expression of <italic>Sema4a</italic> in the epidermis of WTâKO chimeric mice using qRT-PCR. Our findings indicate that <italic>Sema4a</italic> expression levels in the epidermis of these mice are minimal (cycle threshold values of <italic>Sema4a</italic> ranged from 31.9 to not detected in WTâKO chimeric mice, whereas they ranged from 24.5 to 26.2 in WTâ WT mice). Consequently, we believe that the impact of keratinocyte stem cells derived from WT-hematopoietic cells is limited in this model. We appreciate this opportunity to clarify our results and will consider the generation of keratinocyte-specific Sema4A knockout mice for future experiments to further substantiate our interpretation.</p>

<p>âSince it has already been reported that bone marrow cells contain keratinocyte stem cells (Harris et al., 2004; Wu, Zhao, &amp; Tredget, 2010), we confirmed that epidermis of mice deficient in non-hematopoietic Sema4A (WTâKO) showed no obvious detection of <italic>Sema4a</italic>, thereby ruling out the impact of donor-derived keratinocyte stem cells infiltrating the host epidermis (Figure 3-figure supplement 1A).â</p>

<p>(3) Since Sema4A KO mice already have immunological and epidermal cell characteristics similar to psoriasis, albeit weak, it is possible that the nonspecific stimulus of simply topical IMQ may have appeared to exacerbate psoriasis. It is advisable to confirm whether a more psoriasis-specific stimulus, IL-23 administration, would produce similar results.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. Following your advice, we have analyzed IL-23-mediated psoriasis-like dermatitis. To induce the model, 20 Î¼l of phosphate-buffered saline containing 500 ng of recombinant mouse IL-23 was injected intradermally into both ears for 4 consecutive days. Unlike with the application of IMQ, there was no significant difference in ear thickness. However, H&amp;E staining revealed that the epidermal thickness was significantly greater in KO mice compared to WT mice. Although a longer period of IL-23 induction might result in more pronounced ear swelling, we conducted this experiment over the same duration as the IMQ application experiment to maintain consistency. When we analyzed the T cells infiltrating the ears using flow cytometry, the proportion of IL-17A producing VÎ³2 and DNÎ³Î´ T cells in CD3 fraction in the epidermis was significantly higher in Sema4A KO mice, consistent with the results from IMQ-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis.</p>
<p>The lack of significant difference in ear thickness changes with IL-23 administration might be due to IL-23 administration not reflecting upstream events of IL-23 production.</p>
<p>We consider that in psoriasis, the expression of Sema4A in keratinocytes is likely more important than in T cells. Therefore, it makes sense that the phenotype difference was more pronounced with IMQ, which likely has a greater effect on keratinocytes compared to IL-23.</p>

<p>âThough the imiquimod model is well-established and valuable murine psoriatic model (van der Fits et al., 2009), the vehicle of imiquimod cream can activate skin inflammation that is independent of toll-like receptor 7, such as inflammasome activation, keratinocyte death and interleukin-1 production (Walter et al., 2013). This suggests that the imiquimod model involves complex pathway. Therefore, we subsequently induced IL-23-mediated psoriasis-like dermatitis (Figure2-figure supplement 2A), a much simpler murine psoriatic model, because IL-23 is thought to play a central role in psoriasis pathogenesis (Krueger et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2004). Although ear swelling on day 4 was comparable between WT mice and Sema4AKO mice (Figure2-figure supplement 2B), the epidermis, but not the dermis, was significantly thicker in Sema4AKO mice compared to WT mice (Figure2-figure supplement 2C). We found that the proportion of CD4 T cells among T cells was significantly higher in Sema4A KO mice compared to WT mice, while the proportion of VÎ³2 and DNÎ³Î´ T cells among T cells was comparable between them (Figure 2-figure supplement 2D). On the other hand, focusing on IL-17A-producing cells, the proportion of IL-17A-producing VÎ³2 and DNÎ³Î´ T cells in CD3 fraction in the epidermis was significantly higher in Sema4A KO mice, consistent with the results from imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis.

<p>(4) How is STAT3 expression in the epidermis crucial in the pathogenesis of psoriasis in Sem4AKO mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comment. In our study, given the established role of activated STAT3 in psoriasis, we investigated both total STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) levels in the naive epidermis of WT and Sema4AKO mice (See the figure below). Our findings indicate that STAT3 activation does not occur in the epidermis of Sema4AKO mice. Therefore, we speculated that the hyperkeratosis observed in Sema4AKO mice is due to aberrant mTOR signaling rather than STAT3 activation. STAT3 may be relevant to other pathways independent of Sema4A signaling, or it may function as a complex with other molecules in the Sema4A signaling.</p>
