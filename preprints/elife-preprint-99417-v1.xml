<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Upon sperm and oocyte fertilization, drastic histone modification reprograming occurs during preimplantation development. However, the global H3K4me2 landscape and its dynamics reprogramming in this period remains largely unknown. Herein we investigate the erasure and re-establishment of H3K4me2 in mouse GV, MII and embryos using an improved approach called Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN) for histone modification with high-throughput sequencing. We find H3K4me2 extensively exists as a non-canonical pattern in mouse GV oocytes and early embryos. Interestingly, H3K4me2 is erased in MII oocyte and re-established in late 2-cell stage. Importantly, mouse embryos acquire widespread H3K4me2 in CpG-rich and hypomethylated regulatory regions in 4-cell stage, as well as 8-cell stage, but drastic changes happen upon ICM, these CpG-rich H3K4me2 regulatory regions then resolve to either active or repressed states. In summary, our study not only unveil that H3K4me2 transition from parental to zygote, but also provide a H3K4me2 profile during early embryo development, and this will enhance our comprehension to epigenetic reprogramming during mouse early development and in vitro fertilization.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Drastic Epigenome reprogramming occurred during early mammalian embryo development, epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications have been revealed play important roles in the epigenome reprogramming process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The epigenome reprogramming during preimplantation embryo development erases the oocyte and sperm’s epigenetic memory and allows the zygote to establish a new epigenome landscape which is relevant for early development and is essential for maternal zygotic transition (MZT) and differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Deficiencies in reconstructing of the epigenomes can result in developmental defects, such as embryonic arrest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Histone modifications are fundamental epigenetic regulators that control gene expression and many key cellular processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Different types of histone modifications deposited in specific genomic regions and perform distinct functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Most histones modifications largely accumulated around TSSs in the embryos, this feature is shared by somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. this feature is commonly found in many species and cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, so this distribution pattern called as the ‘canonical’ pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It had been reported that highly pervasive H3K27me3 is found in regions depleted of transcription and DNA methylation in oocytes, while extensive loss of promoter H3K27me3 at <italic>Hox</italic> and other developmental genes upon fertilization accompanied by global erasure of sperm H3K27me3 but inheritance of distal H3K27me3 from oocytes, both H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent promoter marks are restored at developmental genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The K-residues at N-terminus of histone H3 exhibit mono-(H3K4me1), di-(H3K4me2), or tri-methylated (H3K4me3) catalyzed by a family of proteins that contain a SET domain, the methylation of different number of methyl groups added represent different chromatin status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The different number and kinds of histone modification marks associated with different gene expression states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, it is well known that H3K4me3 usually enriched nearby transcription start sites(TSS) region associated with the activation of nearby genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and H3K4me1 as an global marker of enhancers, both the regions enriched H3K4me1 and H3K27ac identified as super enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. It is reported that H3K4me1/H3K4me2/H3K4me3 is enriched on both sides of the TSS, play diverse and important roles in regulating gene expression in mammalians<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Previous studies revealed that the H3K4me2 distribution pattern is like the H3K4me3 in plant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. While how the H3K4me2 reprogramming in mammalians early development is still unknown.</p>
<p>H3K4me2 has been proved in coordinating the recovery of protein biosynthesis and homeostasis following DNA damage required for developmental growth and longevity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Unlike in animals, H3K4me2 enrichment is negatively correlated with gene transcript level in plant, H3K4me2 in rice and Arabidopsis specifically distributes over the gene body region and functions as a repressive epigenetic mark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. H3K4me2 was found to be a key epigenetic factor in chicken PGC cell lineage determination and narrow domain activated PGC-specific expression genes and signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. H3K4me2 can be acquired as early as the embryonic stem cell stage, and its distribution is dynamic and progressive throughout mouse brain differentiation and tissue development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it is reported that 90% of the transcription factor binding regions (TFBRs) overlap with the H3K4me2-enriched regions, and together with the H3K27ac-enriched regions can greatly reduce false positive predictions of the TFBRs, moreover, the stronger signals of H3K4me2 enrichment more likely overlap with the TFBRs than those with weaker signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. It had been reported that a subgroup of genes enriched with high levels of H3K4me2 within their gene body linked to T cell functions, different from the TSS centered enrichment of housekeeping genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. And it had reported that many regions of the sperm epigenome bearing H3K4me2 are already present in spermatogonia, suggesting an early established of H3K4me2 in spermatogenesis and highly conserved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we aimed to reveal how the H3K4me2 reprogramming in mammalian early development. To address this question, we optimized the Cleavage Under Target and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> methods using H3K4me2 antibody to as few as 50 cells and revealed that unique H3K4me2 modifications pattern and epigenetic reprogramming modes during the parental-to-zygotic transition in mouse.</p>

<title>Mouse gametes and early embryos collection</title>
<p>Overall, the mouse oocytes were collected from 4-5-week-old C57BL/6N females’ mice (purchased from Charles River), In addition, the pre-implantation embryos were harvested from 4-5-week-old C57BL/6N females mated with DBA/2 males (8-week-old when purchased from Charles River). To be specific, the Germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes were obtained from 4-5-week-old C57BL/6N females 46-48 hours after injection of 10 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Solarbio). What’s more, 4–5-week-old C57BL/6N females were administered 10 IU of human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)intraperitoneally, 46–48 h after PMSG disposed, then mated with DBA/2 males. PN5 zygotes were collected at 28-32 h post-hCG injection, Early_2-, Late_2-, 4cell, 8cell embryos, morulas and blastocysts were harvested at 32-36 h, 45-48 h,54-58 h,60-64 h, 68-75h, 84-96 h post-hCG injection. The metaphase of second meiosis (MII) oocyte were got 12-14 hours after injection of 10 IU of hCG intraperitoneally, the zona pellucida of all oocytes and embryos was removed by glutathione (GSH Solarbio).</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>The samples (mouse oocytes or pre-implantation embryos) were washed twice in MII medium, 4% PFA was used as a fixation buffer (BOSTER, AR1068) to fix samples at room temperature about 60 mins. Next, samples were transferred by mouth pipette and washed by 1% BSA (Sigma, A1933) in 1 × PBS (Corning,21-040-CVR) for once. The samples were then permeabilized by 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8787) in 1 × PBS at room temperature for 20 mins, followed by washing with 1% BSA in 1 × PBS, and blocked by 1% BSA in 1 × PBS at room temperature for 1 hour. The blocked samples were incubated by H3K4me2 antibody (SigmaMillpore, 07030) in 1% BSA in 1 × PBS diluted at ratio of 1:500, at room temperature for 2 hours or at 4°C for overnight, followed with washing by 1% BSA in 1 × PBS of 3 mins for at least 5 times. The samples were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 conjugated Donkey anti Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, A10042) in 1% BSA in 1 × PBS diluted at ratio of 1:200, at room temperature for 50 mins without light, followed with washing by 1% BSA in 1 × PBS of 3 mins for 5 times. Finally, the samples were stained by ProLong<sup>@</sup> Gold Antifade Reagent with DAPI (Cell Signaling, 8961S), using 4-Chamber Glass Bottom Dish(100 per Case), 35mm Dish with 20mm Bottom Well (Cellvis, D35C4-20-1-N), putting the samples in room temperature for about 24 h in a dark environment. Images were acquired on Zeiss 700 confocal microscope. Raw images were projected along the Z-axis and processed using ZEN software (Zeiss) with brightness and contrast adjusted (The same parameters were used for each channel of all samples).</p>

<title>Zona pellucida removal and ICM/TE isolation</title>
<p>Before CUT&amp;RUN experiment, to guarantee the effect of permeation, the zona pellucida of all oocytes and embryos was chemically removed by the glutathione (GSH Solarbio), GSH were added dropwise to oocytes or embryos by mouth pipette which in MII medium (Sigma), the zona pellucida were removed after about 10-30 seconds. Then the sample were washed twice in PBS (Corning 21-040-CVR), and then washed once with wash buffer. The inner cell mass (ICM)s or TEs of day 4-5 blastocysts were isolated mechanically. Before directly addressed to CUT&amp;RUN, the separated cells were washed twice with PBS and once with wash buffer, then resuspended by wash buffer.</p>

<title>CUT&amp;RUN library construction and next-generation sequencing</title>
<p>CUT&amp;RUN was addressed following the previously published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> with modifications in antibody binding, adaptor ligation and DNA purification steps. To be specific, washing buffer and binding buffer were balanced to room temperature for about 30min in advance. Samples (mouse zygotes, embryos or ESCs with zona pellucida removed) were transferred into 0.2mL conventional, non-low-binding PCR tube (Axygen). The samples were resuspended by 60μL washing buffer (HEPES-KOH, pH = 7.5, 20mM; NaCl, 150mM; Spermidine, 0.5mM and with Roche complete protease inhibitor.). Concanavalin-coated magnetic beads (Polyscience, 86057) were gently washed thrice or four times and resuspended by binding buffer (HEPES-KOH, pH = 7.9, 20mM; KCl, 10mM; CaCl2, 1mM; MnCl2, 1mM) then adding Concanavalin-coated magnetic beads 10-15μL for each sample, The samples were then incubated at room temperature (about 25°C) at 450 rpm for 20 mins on Thermomixer (Eppendorf). Putting the samples on magnetic stand to facilitate removing supernatant, then resuspended by 50μL antibody buffer (washing buffer plus digitonin 1000:1, EDTA, pH = 8.0, 2mM) with H3K4me2 antibody (Sigma Millpore 07030) diluted at ratio of 1:100. The samples were incubated at room temperature (23-26 °C) for 2h at 450 rpm on Thermomixer, or incubated at 4°C for overnight(≥ 16h) at 450 rpm on Thermomixer.</p>
<p>Next, the samples were held at the magnetic stand and washed by 190μL dig washing buffer (washing buffer plus digitonin, freshly pre-heated, 0.005%~0.01%, tested for each batch) for once and 100μL for a second time. The samples were then resuspended by 50μL dig washing buffer with PA/G-MNase (to a final concentration of 700ng/mL), and incubated at room temperature (23-26°C) on Thermomixer for 1h, or incubated at 4°C on Thermomixer for 3 hours at 450 rpm. The samples were washed by 190μL dig washing buffer for twice and 100μL for a third time at the magnetic stand. Then adding 100μL dig washing buffer and balanced on ice for 3 mins. Targeted cleavage was performed on ice by adding 2μL 100mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> about 30 mins, and reaction was stopped by adding 100μL 2 × stop buffer (NaCl, 340mM; EDTA, pH = 8.0, 20mM; EGTA, pH = 8.0, 4mM; RNase A, 50μg/mL; glycogen, 100μg/mL; plus digitonin, preheated, 0.005%~0.01%, tested for each batch) and fully vortexed. The samples were then incubated at 37° C of 30 mins for fragment releasing. The total samples or supernatants were digested by adding 10ng carrier RNA (Qiagen, 1068337), 1μL 20% SDS and 2μL Proteinase K (Roche), and the reaction was addressed at 56°C for 45 mins and 72°C for 20 mins in PCR machine. DNA was purified by phenol chloroform followed by ethanol purification, 200ul Phenol chloroform was added, mixed and centrifuged at 20°C for 16000g for 5min.Then adding 200ul chloroform to each sample. After mixing, the samples were centrifuged at 20°C for 16000g for 5min and transferred to LO-binding 1.5ml tube, each sample was added 2ul glycogen, 20ul NaAC, 500ul 100% ethanol (precooled in minus 20 °C), mixed and centrifuged for 30min in a refrigerator at −20 °C, or incubated at −20°C for overnight. At the same time, the centrifuge was started for pre-cooling at 4ΰC, and 100% alcohol was treated in a refrigerator at −20°C for 1 hour.</p>
<p>The samples were centrifuged at 16000g at 4°C for 20min and remove the supernatant, 1ml of anhydrous ethanol was added to each sample, centrifuged at 4 degrees for 16000g for 10 min. Take out the sample to remove the supernatant and open the tube. After the liquid is naturally air-dried, Purified DNA was applied to Tru-Seq library construction using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, E7645S). For NEB kit, the DNA was resuspended in 25μL ddH2O, followed by end-repair/A-tailing with 3.5μL End Prep buffer and 1.5μL enzyme mix, the reaction was addressed at 20°C for 30 mins and 65°C for 30 mins in PCR machine. Then adding diluted 1.25μL adaptors (NEB Multiplex Oligos for Illumina, E7335S) and fully vortexed, 15μL Ligation master mix, 0.5μL Ligation enhancer, incubated at 16-20°C for 16-20min, or at 4°C for overnight. After the ligation reaction, the samples were treated with 1.5μL USERTM enzyme, the reaction was addressed at 37°C for 15 mins in PCR machine. The samples were purified by 1×AMPure beads. The PCR procedure was performed by adding 25μL 2 × KAPA HiFi HotStart Ready Mix (KAPA biosystems, KM2602) with 2.5ul primers of NEB Oligos kit and 2.5ul Illumina universal primers, with the program of 98°C for 45s, (98°C for 15s and 60°C for 10s) with 16-17 cycles and 72°C for 1 min. The final libraries were purified by 0.9-1 × AMPure beads and applied to next-generation sequencing.</p>

<title>CUT&amp;RUN data processing</title>
<p>The single-end CUT&amp;RUN data were to mapped mm9 genome by using Bowtie2 (Version 2.2.9) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> with the parameters −t −q −N 1 −L 25. The paired-end CUT&amp;RUN data were mapped with the parameters: −t −q −N 1 −L 25 −X 1000 --nomixed --no-discordant. All unmapped reads, non-uniquely mapped reads and PCR duplicates were removed. For downstream analysis, we normalized the read counts by calculating the numbers of reads per kilobase of bin per million of reads sequenced (RPKM) for 100-bp bins of the genome. RPKM values were further Z-score normalized for minimizing the batch effect.</p>

<title>Genome-wide profiling of H3K4me2 in mouse oocytes and early embryos</title>
<p>Epigenome underwent drastic reprogramming during early development. To ask how the H3K4me2 inherited from sperm and oocyte to the zygotic during early development, we sought to investigate H3K4me2 in mouse gametes and preimplantation embryos using CUT&amp;RUN methods. We optimized CUT&amp;RUN protocol (CUT&amp;RUN; Methods) using H3K4me2 antibody, at last, we acquired high-quality data using as few as 50 cells, most of the peaks could be retrieved using as few as 50 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1A, S1B</xref>). Then we collected GV oocytes, MII, PN5, early 2-cell, late 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and inner cell masses (ICMs) of mouse, and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) as control. We profiled H3K4me2 in oocytes and early embryos using CUT&amp;RUN and immunofluorescence (IF). All replicates’ results showed highly consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1C</xref>). We identified 57455, 25073, 110517, 126318, 62575, and 69154 H3K4me2 peaks in the GV oocytes, late 2-cell embryos, 4-cell embryos, 8-cell embryos, ICM and mESC, respectively, the H3K4me2 was erased from GV to MII during oocytes development, paternal H3K4me2 was also erased after fertilization, and may be re-established from late 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-B</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated the H3K4me2, ATAC-seq, mRNA expression of several developmental key genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, we found H3K4me2 positively correlated with H3K4me3 and chromatin accessibility in early embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1D-E</xref>). To our interest, the H3K4me2 genome-wide pattern of 4-cell embryos show strong association as 8-cell embryos: H3K4me2 of 4 and 8-cell embryos were in one cluster, and the correlation is high (R=0.93) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS1">Figure S1F-G</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct H3K4me2 pattern between sperm and oocyte</title>
<p>We sought to systematically characterize the epigenome of mouse gametes, we included previous published DNA methylation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, H3K4me3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and ATAC-seq data of early embryos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, as well as H3K4me2 data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> of sperm for analyses. It is reported that non-canonical pattern of H3K4me3, enriched broad domains in both promoters and distal regions, are present in mouse oocytes as broad domains in partially methylated domains (PMDs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Interestingly, H3K4me2 present as non-canonical pattern in GV oocytes and sperm in mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-B, 2E-F</xref>). Considering mature sperm and oocytes are in a state of inactive transcription <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, while it is reported that strong ChIP-Seq and CUT&amp;RUN signal enrichment of this marker were found which is related to transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. These results raise the possibility that H3K4me2 may be deposited during gametogenesis and retained in mature gametes. To further examine this surmise, we perform K-means cluster analysis for H3K4me2 in gametes. Interestingly, by comparing promoter H3K4me2 at the sperm and GV stages, we found that promoters can be divided into four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The first group (sperm-specific H3K4me2) are involved fertilization and germ cell development and these markers are erased at other stages lately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, 2C</xref>). On the contrary, the second group (GV-specific H3K4me2) are enriched for mitosis and gamete generation which are known to function in GV generation during oocyte development and they are reestablished in the lately stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, 2C</xref>). The third group (sperm-GV share H3K4me2) related to mRNA processing and translation, the signal of these regions underwent erase (MII, zygote and early 2-cell stage) and rebuild (from late 2-cell stage) during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, 2C</xref>).

<p>The H3K4me2 enrichment in these promoters in consistent with the dynamics changing of H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In particularly, promoters with high CpG density are preferentially marked by H3K4me2 in sperm-GV share group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we further investigated H3K4me2 marked distal region in gametes. Sperm specific group are involved gamete generation and GV specific distal H3K4me2 showed functions in cell differentiation and mitotic cell cycle, those were both erased after fertilization and not re-constructed during embryos development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,2D</xref>). While H3K4me3 signals did not occupied the sperm specific/GV specific H3K4me2 distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The GV-sperm share distal H3K4me2 regions is also marked by H3K4me3, those genes participate in system development, RNA processing and regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, 2D</xref>). Compared to GV, sperm H3K4me2 enriched in full methylated promoter but sperm distal H3K4me2 enriched in hypomethylated region the same as GV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">Figure S2A-D</xref>).

<p>Drastic epigenetic reprograming and chromosome remodeling associated with H3K4me3, H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K27ac during early mammalian development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, our previous data revealed epigenome reboot in human early development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Next, we asked how parental histone mark H3K4me2 at regulatory elements reprogrammed after fertilization. To our surprise, the GV and sperm H3K4me2 peaks were almost erased in MII oocytes, and reconstructed accompanying zygotic genome activation (ZGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>). This result is further confirmed by IF analysis, showed the re-establishment of H3K4me2 may start from late 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Coincidently, The H3K4me2 methyltransferase KDM1A is up-regulated at MII stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>). While the CUT&amp;RUN data which showed slightly H3K4me2 peaks (relate to other stages) re-appear at late-2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We concluded that the IF was not able to recognize the newly established weak H3K4me2 signal in the late 2-cell stage. Correlated with the activation of Prdm9 and Kmt2c at 4-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3A</xref>), H3K4me2 is enough to be detected at 4/8 cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>) using CUT&amp;RUN and IF. 4/8 cell H3K4me2 targets only partially overlap with those in sperm or oocytes and these overlap targets mainly enriched in development-associated pathway or process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, gametes specific H3K4me2 targets involved in gametes development and generation whereas 4/8-cell specific targets were associated with cell communication and metabolic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These data indicated that the resetting of H3K4me2 involves distinct sets of genes that closely related to embryos development from mouse gametes to early embryos. In particularly, about 1% 4/8 cell H3K4me2 occurs in hypomethylated region as early as late 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">Figure S3B-D</xref>). It implies that the resetting of H3K4me2 start from late 2-cell stage but largely re-establish at 4/8 cell stage.</p>

Our results showed that the H3K4me2 may be re-established in late 2-cell stage, and strong promoter H3K4me2 enrichment re-establishment is already finished in the 4-cell stage and maintained in 8-cell stage, furthermore, the H3K4me2 signals occupied broader regions than those at other stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In particularly, we identified stage-specifically expressed genes and examined their promoter H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4E</xref>). We found promoters with constantly high H3K4me2 that are preferentially CpG-rich, whereas promoters with constantly low H3K4me2 are generally CpG-poor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4E</xref>). Interestingly, a group of genes showed dynamic promoter H3K4me2 that correlates with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4E</xref>). These genes preferentially play roles in development, differentiation, and morphogenesis. Therefore, our data indicated that promoter H3K4me2 in early embryo development correlates with both gene activities and CpG density.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to investigate the distal H3K4me2, 4/8-cell embryos also showed widespread distal H3K4me2 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We firstly identified the distal H3K4me2 regions in mouse gametes and pre-implantation embryos. These regions are relatively CpG-rich (although lower than promoters) and hypo-methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">S4C</xref>). However, compared with promoters, distal H3K4me2 correlated with CpG density in a continuous and monotonic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4A</xref>).

We further identified stage specific distal regions and the accessibility in these distal peaks of H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Then, we identified the binding motifs for transcription factors (TFs) enriched in these distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS4">Figure S4D</xref>).

<p>The enhancers are DNA sequences that increase promoter activity and thus the frequency of gene transcription.

We compared histone modifications to H3K4me2 and H3K27ac and found no significant signal overlap between the two histone modifications at specific developmental stages in the distal region.

The H3K4me3 was inherited in pre-implantation embryos and was erased in the late two-cell embryos following canonical H3K4me3 starts to be established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, while the H3K4me2 mainly starts to be re-established in late 2-cell stage, and it exists as non-canonical pattern in the following stages. Emerging data reveal that in many species, including mouse, zebrafish and human, the parental epigenome undergoes dramatic reprogramming after terminally differentiated gamete fertilization followed by subsequent reestablishment of the embryo epigenome, leading to epigenetic “rebooting”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. We found H3K4me2 were erased in MII oocyte, but reserved in sperm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, while the paternal H3K4me2 was erased upon fertilization, and start to be re-established in late 2-cell stage, indicating the H3K4me2 participated the embryo epigenome rebooting process.</p>
<p>H3K4me3 is known as an active gene expression marker, mainly marks the gene promoter region. H3K4me1 and H3K4me2 mark both enhancer and promoter, were reported to have multiple functions for gene activation according to different enzymes and complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. It is reported that distinct pattern of H3K4me2 enrichment, spanning from the transcriptional start site (TSS) to the gene body, and marks a subset of tissue-specific genes, which indicated unique H3K4me2 profile mark tissue-specific gene regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Our results showed that non-canonical H3K4me2 in mammalian embryos and pervasive H3K4me2 in CpG-rich regulatory regions in mouse 4 and 8-cell embryos. We next interrogate whether the H3K4me2 associated active or repressed genes in embryo development, and our data revealed that promoter H3K4me2 in early mouse embryo development correlates with both gene activities and high CpG density, as expected, the promoter H3K4me2 is consistent with H3K4me3.</p>
<p>Histone modification and chromatin accessibility profiles are usually used to identify transcription factor binding regions and motifs, we previously found large scale chromatin accessibility in pre-ZGA human embryos, and these regions enriched lots of transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. It is reported about average 90% of the transcription factor binding regions overlap with the H3K4me2-enriched regions and the stronger signals of H3K4me2 enrichment, the more likely overlap with the transcription factor binding regions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Interesting, here in our study, we identified the binding motifs for transcription factors enriched in these distal regions, and CCAAT transcription factor (CTF) is specifically enriched in 8-cell embryos. And the GATA, KLF families are enriched in ICMs, GATA is critical regulators of primitive endoderm (PE), which is part of ICM <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, and KLF factors support the naive pluripotency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. Thus, these results showed stage-specific distal H3K4me2 involve transcription circuitry in mammalian embryonic development.</p>
<p>The state of chromatin influences DNA replication, DNA repair and gene expression. It has reported that accessible chromatin occupies regulatory sequences, such as promoters and enhancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. These elements interact with cell type-specific transcription factors to start transcriptional programs that determinate cell fate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Early animal embryos undergo extensive histone modification reprogramming and chromatin remodeling before terminally differentiated gametes develop into pluripotent cells. Previous study found that extensive overlaps of accessible promoters and enhancers at 4-cell stage in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This phenomenon indicated crosstalk function between histone modification and chromatin state. In our study, most of the H3K4me2 reestablished in chromatin accessible regions including promoters and distal regions at 4-cell stage. So, we infer that the H3K4me2 establishment may play an important shaping role in chromatin state. Therefore, our results furthermore support the crosstalk between accessible chromatin and histone modification. But how the chromatin state influences H3K4me2 deposition or the opposite need further investigation.</p>
<p>Dynamic histone modifications play important roles during mammalian Maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), ~22% of the oocyte genome associated with broad H3K4me3 are anti-correlated with DNA methylation and then become confined to transcriptional-start-site (TSS) regions in 2-cell embryos, concomitant with the onset of major ZGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, while H3K4me2 was erased in MII oocytes, the sperm H3K4me2 was erased after fertilization. The same as H3K4me3, the embryos’ H3K4me2 was also re-established accompanied with the onset of major ZGA. The ncH3K4me3 in oocytes overlaps almost exclusively with partially methylated DNA domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, the H3K4me2 was also enriched in both canonical gene promoters and partially methylated domains (PMDs).</p>
<p>Taken together, our investigation provided a genome-wide landscape of H3K4me2 modification in mammalian oocytes and pre-implantation embryos, facilitating further exploration of the epigenetic regulation network in mammalian early development.</p>

<p>By mapping H3K4me2 in mouse oocytes and pre-implantation embryos, the authors aim to elucidate how this histone modification is erased and re-established during the parental-to-zygotic transition, as well as how the reprogramming of H3K4me2 regulates gene expression and facilitates zygotic genome activation.</p>
<p>Employing an improved CUT&amp;RUN approach, the authors successfully generated H3K4me2 profiling data from a limited number of embryos. While the profiling experiments are very well executed, several weaknesses, particularly in data analysis, are apparent:</p>
<p>(1) The study emphasizes H3K4me2, which often serves as a precursor to H3K4me3, a well-studied modification during early development. Analyzing the new H3K4me2 dataset alongside published H3K4me3 data is crucial for comprehensively understanding epigenetic reprogramming post-fertilization and the interplay between histone modifications. However, the current analysis is preliminary and lacks depth.</p>
<p>(2) Tranylcypromine (TCP) is known as an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and LSD1. While the authors suggest TCP inhibits the expression of LSD2, this assertion is questionable. Given TCP's potential non-specific effects in cells, conclusions related to the experiments using TCP should be made with caution.</p>
<p>(3) Some batches of H3K4me2 antibody are known to cross-react with H3K4me3. Has the H3K4me2 antibody used in CUT&amp;RUN been tested for such cross-reactivity? Heatmaps in the figures indeed show similar distribution for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, further raising concerns about antibody specificity.</p>
<p>(4) Certain statements lack supporting references or figures (examples on page 9 can be found on line 245, line 254, and line 258).</p>
<p>(5) Extensive language editing is recommended to clarify ambiguous sentences. Additionally, caution should be taken to avoid overstatement - most analyses in this study only suggest correlation rather than causality.</p>

<p>Chong Wang et al. investigated the role of H3K4me2 during the reprogramming processes in mouse preimplantation embryos. The authors show that H3K4me2 is erased from GV to MII oocytes and re-established in the late 2-cell stage by performing Cut &amp; Run H3K4me2 and immunofluorescence staining. Erasure and re-establishment of H3K4me2 have not been studied well, and profiling of H3K4me2 in germ cells and preimplantation embryos is valuable to understanding the reprogramming process and epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that the Cut &amp; Run worked for MII oocytes, zygotes, and the 2-cell embryos. However, it is unclear if H3K4me2 is erased during the stage or if the Cut &amp; Run did not work for these samples. To support the hypothesis of the erasure of H3K4me2, the authors conducted immunofluorescence staining, and H3k4me2 was undetected in the MII oocyte, PN5, and 2-cell stage. However, the published papers showed strong staining of H3K4me2 at the zygote stage and 2-cell stage ((Ancelin et al., 2016; Shao et al., 2014)). The authors need to cite these papers and discuss the contradictory findings.</p>
<p>The authors used 165 MII oocytes and 190 GV oocytes for the Cut &amp; Run. The amount of DNA in MII oocytes is halved because of the emission of the first polar body. Would it be a reason that H3K4me2 has fewer H3K4me2 peaks in MII oocytes than GV oocytes?</p>
<p>In Figure 3C, 98% (13,183/13,428) of H3K4me2 marked genes in GV oocytes overlap with those in the 4-cell stage. Furthermore, 92% (14,049/15,112) of H3K4me2 marked genes in sperm overlap with those in the 4-cell stage. Therefore, most regions maintain germ line-derived H3K4me2 in the 4-cell stage. The authors need to clarify which regions of germ line-derived H3K4me2 are maintained or erased in preimplantation embryos. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate which regions show the parental allele-specific H3K4me2 in preimplantation embryos since the authors used hybrid preimplantation embryos (B6 x DBA).</p>
<p>(2) The authors claim that Kdm1a is rarely expressed during mouse embryonic development (Figure 4A). However, the published paper showed that KDM1a is present in the zygote and 2-cell stage using immunostaining and western blotting ((Ancelin et al., 2016)). Additionally, this paper showed that depletion of maternal KDM1A protein results in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage, and therefore, KDM1a is functionally important in early development. The authors should have cited the paper and described the role of KDM1a in early embryos.</p>
<p>(3) The authors used the published RNA data set and interpreted that KDM1B (LSD2) was highly expressed at the MII stage (Figure S3A). However, the heat map shows that KDM1B expression is high in growing oocytes but not at 8w_oocytes and MII oocytes. The authors need to interpret the data accurately.</p>
<p>(4) All embryos in the TCP group were arrested at the four-cell stage. Embryos generated from KDM1b KO females can survive until E10.5 (Ciccone et al., 2009); therefore, TCP-treated embryos show a more severe phenotype than oocyte-derived KDM1b deleted embryos. Depletion of maternal KDM1A protein results in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage ((Ancelin et al., 2016)). The authors need to examine whether TCP treatment affects KDM1a expression. Western blotting would be recommended to quantify the expression of KDM1A and KDM1B in the TCP-treated embryos.</p>
<p>(5) H3K4me2 is increased dramatically in the TCP-treated embryos in Figure 4 (the intensity is 1,000 times more than the control). However, the Cut &amp; Run H3K4me2 shows that the H3K4me2 signal is increased in 251 genes and decreased in 194 genes in the TCP-treated embryos (Fold changes &gt; 2, P &lt; 0.01). The authors need to explain why the gain of H3K4me2 is less evident in the Cut &amp; Run data set than in the immunofluorescence result.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study explores the dynamic reprogramming of histone modification H3K4me2 during the early stages of mammalian embryogenesis. Utilizing the advanced CUT&amp;RUN technique coupled with high-throughput sequencing, the authors investigate the erasure and re-establishment of H3K4me2 in mouse germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes, metaphase II (MII) oocytes, and early embryos.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings provide valuable insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of H3K4me2 and its potential role in zygotic genome activation (ZGA).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study primarily remains descriptive at this point. It would be advantageous to conduct further comprehensive functional validation and mechanistic exploration.</p>
<p>

<p>By mapping H3K4me2 in mouse oocytes and pre-implantation embryos, the authors aim to elucidate how this histone modification is erased and re-established during the parental-to-zygotic transition, as well as how the reprogramming of H3K4me2 regulates gene expression and facilitates zygotic genome activation.</p>
<p>Employing an improved CUT&amp;RUN approach, the authors successfully generated H3K4me2 profiling data from a limited number of embryos. While the profiling experiments are very well executed, several weaknesses, particularly in data analysis, are apparent:</p>
<p>(1) The study emphasizes H3K4me2, which often serves as a precursor to H3K4me3, a well-studied modification during early development. Analyzing the new H3K4me2 dataset alongside published H3K4me3 data is crucial for comprehensively understanding epigenetic reprogramming post-fertilization and the interplay between histone modifications. However, the current analysis is preliminary and lacks depth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions. The data of histone H3K4me3 in humans and mice has been published，and our previous data revealed the unique pattern of H3K4me3 during early human embryos and oocytes (Xia et al., 2019). So, this study mainly focuses on the localization of H3K4me2 in mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos, how it is erased and re-established during mammalian parental-to-zygote transition, and its function. The combined analysis of H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 is not our main work, but it is not ruled out that there may be new discoveries between these two histones. Previously, our data tended to show that the H3K4me2 not only acts as a precursor of H3K4me3, but also plays its role independently.</p>

<p>(2) Tranylcypromine (TCP) is known as an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and LSD1. While the authors suggest TCP inhibits the expression of LSD2, this assertion is questionable. Given TCP's potential non-specific effects in cells, conclusions related to the experiments using TCP should be made with caution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out, and we thank the reviewer again for the important suggestion. We found that the previous study indicated that TCP was a non-reversible inhibitor of LSD1 and LSD2, but according to our data, the content of LSD1 was very low in the early stages of mouse embryos, which mainly inhibited the function of LSD2. (Binda et al., 2010; Fang et al., 2010 )</p>

<p>(3) Some batches of H3K4me2 antibody are known to cross-react with H3K4me3. Has the H3K4me2 antibody used in CUT&amp;RUN been tested for such cross-reactivity? Heatmaps in the figures indeed show similar distribution for H3K4me2 and H3K4me3, further raising concerns about antibody specificity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comments. The H3K4me2 antibody was purchased from Millipore (cat. 07030). Figure 2A shows the specific enrichment area of H3K4me2 in promoter and distal region. Some batches of H3K4me2 antibody are known to cross-react with H3K4me3, but the H3K4me2 antibody we used in our CUT&amp;RUN seems to have Low cross-reactivity.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Chong Wang et al. investigated the role of H3K4me2 during the reprogramming processes in mouse preimplantation embryos. The authors show that H3K4me2 is erased from GV to MII oocytes and re-established in the late 2-cell stage by performing Cut &amp; Run H3K4me2 and immunofluorescence staining. Erasure and re-establishment of H3K4me2 have not been studied well, and profiling of H3K4me2 in germ cells and preimplantation embryos is valuable to understanding the reprogramming process and epigenetic inheritance.</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that the Cut &amp; Run worked for MII oocytes, zygotes, and the 2-cell embryos. However, it is unclear if H3K4me2 is erased during the stage or if the Cut &amp; Run did not work for these samples. To support the hypothesis of the erasure of H3K4me2, the authors conducted immunofluorescence staining, and H3k4me2 was undetected in the MII oocyte, PN5, and 2-cell stage. However, the published papers showed strong staining of H3K4me2 at the zygote stage and 2-cell stage ((Ancelin et al., 2016; Shao et al., 2014)). The authors need to cite these papers and discuss the contradictory findings.</p>
<p>The authors used 165 MII oocytes and 190 GV oocytes for the Cut &amp; Run. The amount of DNA in MII oocytes is halved because of the emission of the first polar body. Would it be a reason that H3K4me2 has fewer H3K4me2 peaks in MII oocytes than GV oocytes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>First of all, thank you for your valuable advice. The published papers showed strong staining of H3K4me2 at the zygote stage and 2-cell stage, which is interesting. I think we may have used different parameters in the confocal laser shooting process(Ancelin et al., 2016). We used the same parameter to continuously shoot the blastocyst stage from the GV stage. If we only shot the fertilized egg and the 2-cell stage, I think we may also see weak fluorescence at the 2-cell stage under different parameters. We will refer to this reference and discuss it in the resubmitted version.</p>
<p>Moreover, you mentioned the H3K4me2 has fewer H3K4me2 peaks in MII oocytes than GV oocytes, because the MII expelled the polar body. There is no problem with this logic. However, the first polar body expelled from the MII stage is still in the zona pellucida, and we also collected the polar body in the CUT&amp;RUN experiment; Therefore, compared to GV, the DNA content of MII samples is not halved. After further discussion, we believe that the reduction of H3K4me2 peaks in MII stage compared with GV stage may be closely related to oocyte maturation. It is the specific modification of histones in different forms at different times that affects the chromatin structure change appropriately with the different stages of meiosis. At present, it has been confirmed that H3K4me3 gradually decreases from GV to MII stage during the maturation of human oocytes. H3K27me3 did not change from GV to MII stage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3C, 98% (13,183/13,428) of H3K4me2 marked genes in GV oocytes overlap with those in the 4-cell stage. Furthermore, 92% (14,049/15,112) of H3K4me2 marked genes in sperm overlap with those in the 4-cell stage. Therefore, most regions maintain germ line-derived H3K4me2 in the 4-cell stage. The authors need to clarify which regions of germ line-derived H3K4me2 are maintained or erased in preimplantation embryos. Additionally, it would be interesting to investigate which regions show the parental allele-specific H3K4me2 in preimplantation embryos since the authors used hybrid preimplantation embryos (B6 x DBA).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestion. Further analysis of which regions show the parental allele-specific H3K4me2 in preimplantation embryos will make the study more interesting. We will discuss this in depth in resubmitted vision.</p>

<p>(2) The authors claim that Kdm1a is rarely expressed during mouse embryonic development (Figure 4A). However, the published paper showed that KDM1a is present in the zygote and 2-cell stage using immunostaining and western blotting ((Ancelin et al., 2016)). Additionally, this paper showed that depletion of maternal KDM1A protein results in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage, and therefore, KDM1a is functionally important in early development. The authors should have cited the paper and described the role of KDM1a in early embryos.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the analysis of this experiment, we believe that in the early embryonic development of mice, the expression of KDM1A is lower than that of KDM1B, which is relative. Similarly, the transcriptome data we cite also show that KDM1A is expressed at elevated levels during oocyte maturation and fertilization compared to immature oocytes. In addition, the effects of loss of maternal KDM1a on embryonic development were not discussed. We believe that the absence of maternal KDM1b blocks embryonic development, and we will cite and discus the references later.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors used the published RNA data set and interpreted that KDM1B (LSD2) was highly expressed at the MII stage (Figure S3A). However, the heat map shows that KDM1B expression is high in growing oocytes but not at 8w_oocytes and MII oocytes. The authors need to interpret the data accurately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>After re-checking the data, we found that there was a problem with the normalization method of our heat map, and we will re-make the heatmap and submit it in the modified version. With reference to Figure 4A, the content of Kdm1b is indeed higher than that of Kdm1a.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) All embryos in the TCP group were arrested at the four-cell stage. Embryos generated from KDM1b KO females can survive until E10.5 (Ciccone et al., 2009); therefore, TCP-treated embryos show a more severe phenotype than oocyte-derived KDM1b deleted embryos. Depletion of maternal KDM1A protein results in developmental arrest at the two-cell stage ((Ancelin et al., 2016)). The authors need to examine whether TCP treatment affects KDM1a expression. Western blotting would be recommended to quantify the expression of KDM1A and KDM1B in the TCP-treated embryos.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will further dig the transcriptome data to confirm the specificity of TCP to KDM1b. In addition, the intervention of TCP on the whole fertilized egg in this study increased the H3K4me2 content, and the embryo development retarding effect was more significant than that obtained by crossing with normal paternal lines after knocking down KDM1B from the mother.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) H3K4me2 is increased dramatically in the TCP-treated embryos in Figure 4 (the intensity is 1,000 times more than the control). However, the Cut &amp; Run H3K4me2 shows that the H3K4me2 signal is increased in 251 genes and decreased in 194 genes in the TCP-treated embryos (Fold changes &gt; 2, P &lt; 0.01). The authors need to explain why the gain of H3K4me2 is less evident in the Cut &amp; Run data set than in the immunofluorescence result.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks a lot for your question. In the experimental group, the fluorescence value of H3K4me2 in IF was increased by 1000 times (Figure 4E), and the expression of H3K4Me2-related genes in CR was up-regulated and down-regulated for a total of 445 changes (Figure 6A). In our opinion, as a semi-quantitative analysis, immunofluorescence cannot be compared with the quantitative analysis method of CR because of the different analysis models and threshold Settings.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The findings provide valuable insights into the temporal and spatial dynamics of H3K4me2 and its potential role in zygotic genome activation (ZGA).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study primarily remains descriptive at this point. It would be advantageous to conduct further comprehensive functional validation and mechanistic exploration.</p>
<p>Key areas for improvement include enhancing the innovation and novelty of the study, providing robust functional validation, establishing a clear model for H3K4me2's role, and addressing technical and presentation issues.
