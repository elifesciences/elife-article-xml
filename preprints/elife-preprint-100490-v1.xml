<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cell crowding is a common microenvironmental factor that affects various disease processes, but its impact on cell invasiveness into surrounding tissues is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction. We discovered that cell crowding enhanced the invasiveness of high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells, which experienced significant cell volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that cell crowding relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, a calcium-permeant ion channel, to the plasma membrane selectively in high-grade DCIS cells but not in less aggressive or normal cells. Cell crowding inhibited TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells, which led to decreased intracellular calcium levels and subsequent volume reduction. TRPV4 inhibition also prompted relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane. This relocation primed inactive TRPV4 for activation, effectively counterbalancing the calcium loss from crowding-induced channel inhibition. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues validated that TRPV4 selectively associated with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS but not in lower-grade DCIS or less aggressive pathologies. The extent of plasma membrane TRPV4 association scaled with cell volume reduction and increased cell invasiveness and motility, suggesting its utility as an active pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway indicator. Additionally, hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked the pro-invasive volume reduction observed under cell crowding, while TRPV4 activation reversed this effect by inducing cell volume increase. In summary, our study reveals a previously unrecognized pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway triggered by cell crowding, which is selective in high-grade DCIS cells. This discovery offers new biophysical perspectives on cell invasiveness, highlighting the critical role of a selective mechanotransduction mechanism in the progression of breast cancer cells that are considered non-invasive but associated with high risk.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The complex interplay between cellular mechanics and invasive behaviors is crucial to understanding various physiological and pathological processes, such as wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Numerous studies show that these processes are mediated by mechanotransduction, whereby cells translate mechanical stimuli into cellular activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. While mechanotransduction is traditionally studied concerning fluid stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, matrix stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and other biomechanical changes such as osmotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the role of cell crowding, characterized by increased cell density and spatial constraints, is relatively less explored. A recent report shows that cell crowding plays a role in facilitating wound closure and repair by enhancing cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As tissues develop, repair, or undergo pathological transformation, cell crowding becomes common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This challenges individual cells, forcing them to perceive and respond to the mechanical constraints of a crowded environment. Our study used human breast cell line model systems to describe a novel mechanotransduction pathway triggered by cell crowding that induces invasiveness into surrounding tissues. Interestingly, this pathway exhibited unique selectivity, as it specifically associated with a type of non-invasive cancer pathology and was not present in lower-grade or less aggressive pathologies. This suggests that not all cells possess the ability to translate mechanical stimuli, such as cell crowding, into cell invasiveness.</p>
<p>To assess the role of cell crowding in cell invasiveness, we chose in vitro cell lines linked to different pathological states that reflect cell crowding conditions in vivo, including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. ADH is an intraductal clonal epithelial cell proliferative lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and represents an intermediate step between normal breast tissue and in situ carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. ADH is associated with high risk as it is reported that an ADH diagnosis is associated with a five-fold increased risk of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. DCIS is non-invasive form of cancer characterized by proliferating malignant epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Unlike ADH, DCIS is considered a precursor to invasive breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of how DCIS transitions to invasive cancer is not well understood and therefore, there is currently no reliable and robust method to differentiate which DCIS cells are at high risk of becoming invasive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Both ADH and DCIS conditions can potentially expose cells to crowding in vivo. However, how ADH and DCIS cells respond to such changes in cell density remains unknown. Our study revealed that cell crowding selectively triggered a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program in a specific type of DCIS cell line associated with high-grade comedo-type pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The mechanotransduction program induced by cell crowding involved the inhibition of ion channels, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, a calcium-permeable ion channel, as identified from our mass spectrometry assay. This inhibition prompted the relocation of TRPV4 and other ion channels to the plasma membrane, leading to decreased intracellular calcium levels, subsequent induction of reduced cell volume and cortical stiffening, thereby promoting cell invasiveness.</p>
<p>We confirmed that inhibition of TRPV4 led to channel relocation to the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells using TRPV4-specific pharmacologic inhibitors under normal cell density conditions without crowding. Pharmacologically activating TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells under cell crowding conditions resulted in a significant calcium spike, reflecting that the majority (&gt;80%) of TRPV4 was located on the plasma membrane due to crowding. These data suggest that crowding-induced TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane via channel inhibition primed the inactive ion channel for activation, thereby counteracting decreased calcium levels. In contrast, activating TRPV4 under cell crowding conditions triggered channel uptake, indicating that TRPV4 trafficking depended on the channel’s activation status.</p>
<p>Remarkably, high-grade DCIS cells exhibited significant cell volume reduction under cell crowding conditions, indicating high cell volume plasticity. In contrast, ADH-mimicking cells showed largely unchanged cell volumes, reflecting low cell volume plasticity and a lack of mechanosensing capability. This high cell volume plasticity in high-grade DCIS cells was further evidenced by the dose-dependent cell volume changes observed with TRPV4 inhibitor and activator treatments, which correlated with the extent of plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4. Cell volume reduction induced by cell crowding or pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition increased cell invasiveness and motility. This increase strongly correlated with the greater association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells, highlighting a marked selectivity for this cell type.</p>
<p>Further analysis of patient samples indeed confirmed that the selective relationship between plasma membrane TRPV4 association and pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathway was exclusive to high-grade DCIS cells, which was not present in lower-grade DCIS or less aggressive pathologies including ADH. This underscored the selectivity of this mechanotransduction pathway. Additionally, our findings revealed a dichotomy in the pro-invasive mechanosensing capabilities of invasive breast cancer cells, with some lacking these abilities. Notably, this selective pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway was also activated by hyperosmotic stress, which led to ion channel relocation to the plasma membrane and osmotic cell volume reduction. The convergence of these endpoints resulted from distinct mechanical stimuli highlights the pivotal role of cell volume reduction in facilitating the invasion of high-grade DCIS cells, which are normally categorized as non-invasive but associated with high risk.</p>

<title>Cell Crowding Enhances Invasiveness in High-Grade DCIS Cells</title>
<p>Cell crowding reflects a common condition in tumor microenvironments for ADH and DCIS, arising from aberrant cell proliferation within spatially constrained intraductal spaces. We examined the influence of this prevalent environmental factor on the invasiveness of these cells in vitro. To conduct this investigation, we assembled a panel of cell lines derived from the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, including its H-RAS mutation-driven derivatives associated with various pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>: MCF10AT1, MCF10DCIS.com, and invasive cells MCF10CA1a. MCF10AT1 resembles ADH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, MCF10DCIS.com mimics high-grade DCIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and MCF10CA1a represents a malignant invasive cancer that was observed to form metastatic lesions in a mouse xenograft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The current classification of DCIS relies on histological factors such as cell growth patterns and cytonuclear features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Comedo-DCIS is a histologic subtype, which is characterized by apoptotic cell death, representing a high-grade DCIS with higher invasive potential than those of lower-grades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. MCF10DCIS.com forms comedo-type DCIS lesions that can spontaneously transition to invasive cancer when xenografted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To compare cell invasiveness under normal cell density and cell crowding conditions in vitro, we opted for a modified 2D matrix degradation assay. This approach allowed us to quantify overall cell invasiveness by normalizing it with the total cell number, thereby accounting for differences in cell densities. We chose this method over transwell, 3D Matrigel, or spheroid assays, where quantifying cell invasiveness as a function of cell density is challenging. By modifying an existing collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we could determine the invasive cell fraction out of the total cell population by fluorescence imaging of the invasion gel bed and cell nuclei through a low magnification (4X) imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; for a detailed procedure, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) when cells were at normal density versus under cell crowding conditions.</p>

<caption><title>Cell crowding selectively increases invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> We used a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay to assess the effect of cell crowding on invasiveness. Representative images show gelatin-Alexa488 conjugates, where dark areas indicate cell invasion through degradation (green; Gelatin488), and DAPI staining marks cell locations (blue; DAPI) in a two-day invasion assay of MCF10DCIS.com cells under normal density (ND; upper panel) and overconfluent (OC; lower panel) conditions. “Masked” images are thresholded to produce positive masks applied to the “DAPI” images. Individual cell locations detected in “DAPI” images are marked with purple circles in “Detected points” images. The total number of cells within the field of view is counted from these points. By overlaying the mask and DAPI images, “Masked DAPI” images are obtained, and invaded cells are detected and represented by purple circles in “Masked points” images. The invasive cell fraction is calculated by the ratio of the number of invaded cells to the total number of cells (0.24 for ND and 0.59 for OC MCF10DCIS.com cells). These data show that cell invasiveness is enhanced by cell crowding. Scale bar = 100 μm. <bold>(B)</bold> Comparison of “Gelatin488” images of MCF10A (normal breast epithelial cells), MCF10AT1 (ADH-mimicking cells), MCF10DCIS.com (high-grade DCIS mimic), and MCF10CA1a (invasive breast cancer cells) between ND and OC conditions. MCF10DCIS.comcell invasion is significantly higher under cell crowding than under ND conditions. <bold>(C)</bold> Invasive cell fractions of these cells between ND and OC conditions are compared, showing that cell crowding-induced increases in invasiveness are notable only in MCF10DCIS.comcells. We used the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, a nonparametric and unpaired statistical method, to compare differences between groups. ****: p &lt; 0.0001, ***: p &lt; 0.001, **: p &lt; 0.01, *: p &lt; 0.05, ns: p &gt; 0.05, throughout the manuscript.</p></caption>

<p>We observed alterations in live cell morphology and invasiveness as they progressed from normal density (ND: 40-70%) to full confluence (100%) and beyond. Our goal was to determine a distinct time window, termed overconfluence (OC), where cell crowding-induced changes level off. The OC time window was achieved as cells cultured for an additional 5-10 days after reaching 100% confluence, with the growth medium replaced twice per day to prevent acidification. The schematic of the timeline to achieve the OC conditions, and low-magnification (4X) bright-field images at different time points from the ND to OC conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2A-B</xref>. The time-dependent equilibration of cell invasiveness after the cells reached confluence is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2C-D</xref> using our quantifiable collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay. Cell crowding mechanosensing significantly increased the invasive cell fraction of MCF10DCIS.comcells from ∼24% (ND cells) to 59% (OC cells). In contrast, other cell types such as normal breast epithelial cells MCF10A and MCF10AT1, which mimic ADH conditions in vivo, did not display invasiveness in ND conditions or enhanced invasiveness in OC conditions, suggesting insensitivity to cell crowding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>
<p>The invasive cell fraction of ND MCF10CA1a cells was already ∼80%, and the additional increase in invasiveness due to cell crowding was not readily discernible, with a slight increase to ∼82% under crowded conditions. These data suggest a striking and selective mechanosensing effect of cell crowding on cell invasiveness in MCF10DCIS.comcells. To ensure that acidification did not affect the invasiveness of MCF10DCIS.com cells despite the frequent replacement of the cell growth medium, we incubated ND cells for two days with acidified medium from cultures of OC MCF10DCIS.comcells. We observed that medium acidity did not alter cell invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Suppl. Fig. 2E</xref>), reinforcing that the increased invasiveness under OC conditions was induced by cell crowding.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell crowding reduces cell volume and stiffens MCF10DCIS.comcells</title>
<p>As cells became crowded, we observed a reduction in cell size. Previous reports indicate an inverse relationship between cell volume and cortical stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, leading us to hypothesize that reduced cell volume would be accompanied by increased cortical stiffness. Research on glioma cell invasion underscores the critical role of hydrodynamic cell volume changes in penetration into surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that significant cell volume reduction facilitates cell invasion. Additionally, increased cortical stiffness is known to help cells overcome the physical barriers of the dense extracellular matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We thus investigated whether cell crowding selectively induces pro-invasive cell volume reduction and cell stiffening in MCF10DCIS.comcells, thereby priming them for invasion.</p>
<p>To measure the cell volume of individual cells, we used confocal microscopy with a 60X oil immersion objective to obtain z-stack images of live or fixed cells stably expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Using a nanoindenter attached to the confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Fig. 3A</xref>), we extracted Young’s modulus of live individual cells to assess changes in cortical stiffness. Cell crowding significantly reduced cell volume (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) and increased cortical stiffness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) in both MCF10DCIS.comand MCF10A cells. However, the changes in volume and stiffness between ND and OC conditions were more pronounced in MCF10DCIS.comcells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Fig. 3B, C</xref>). The cell crowding-induced alterations in cell volume and stiffness were negligible in MCF10AT1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, cell crowding led to an increase in stiffness, but a decrease in volume was not evident. This was expected because the cell volume was already too small to be accurately measured with the available resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The notable plasticity in cell volume and stiffness changes observed in MCF10DCIS.comcells in response to cell crowding potentially underscores the critical link between this plasticity and mechanosensitive increases in cell invasiveness. We assessed cell volume changes only as an effector event of cell crowding, without measuring cell stiffness, because cell volume reflects the mechanical properties of the entire cell, while Young’s modulus can vary depending on the location of indentations in the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The observed cell volume changes by cell crowding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) showed the same trend in the ND cell volume, with final volumes under crowded conditions being comparable across all cells. Consequently, the ND cell volume and the volume changes from ND to OC conditions exhibited an approximately linear relationship, with an <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Suppl. Fig. 3D</xref>), indicating a highly linear correlation. This finding suggests that the cell volume at ND could serve as an indicator of relative cell volume plasticity.</p>

<p>To validate the pro-invasive nature of cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.comcells, we examined the effect of hyperosmotic cell volume reduction in ND cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 for 15 minutes. The cell volume reduction effects of this treatment were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. PEG 300 effectively reduced ND MCF10DCIS.com cell volume in a dose-dependent manner, showing a greater reduction with 148.8 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 than with 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). To assess the impact of PEG-induced cell volume reduction on cell invasiveness, we used collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay and exposed cells to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 for 2 days. While treatment with 148.8 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 significantly reduced cell viability, cells treated with 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 remained viable for 2 days. Monitoring changes in cell invasiveness revealed that exposure of ND MCF10DCIS.com cells to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 increased cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), confirming the causal relationship between cell volume reduction and increased cell invasiveness.</p>

<title>Cell crowding induces TRPV4 relocation to plasma membrane in MCF10DCIS.com cells</title>
<p>Cell volume regulation typically depends on osmotic gradients that direct the movement of water across cell membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This process is facilitated by ion flux modulation, which is controlled by ion channels and ion transporters located on the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Given the observation that cells capable of attaining minimal cell volume can successfully penetrate neighboring tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, we speculated that the high cell volume plasticity observed in MCF10DCIS.com cells reflects this ability. For such efficient cell volume changes, we hypothesized that cell crowding mechanosensing in MCF10DCIS.com cells would alter the number of plasma membrane-associated ion channels or transporters.</p>
<p>To compare the plasma membrane associated proteins between ND and OC conditions, we employed mass spectrometry and profiled those proteins using the streptavidin-pulled surface-biotinylated cell lysates. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> depicts the relative protein densities on the plasma membrane between the ND (blue bars) and OC (red bars) conditions for the top 25 proteins showing over 5-fold increases (triangle plots) in protein expression on the plasma membrane in the OC condition compared to the ND condition in MCF10DCIS.com cells. The gene names of these 25 proteins are presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Suppl. Table 1</xref> provides the corresponding protein names along with the corresponding fold increases). Notably, TRPV4, a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels known for its mechanosensitive properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, showed a remarkable 153-fold increase in plasma membrane association in response to cell crowding, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. Additionally, we observed an increase in plasma membrane association of other ion channels, such as SCN11A (the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.9) with ∼42-fold enrichment, and KCNN4 (the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3 SK3) showing ∼6-fold increase, as shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>. To evaluate the relative plasma membrane association of proteins under OC versus ND conditions, we performed a comparable mass spectrometry analysis of cell-surface biotinylated cell lysates for MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and MCF10CA1a cells. The gene/protein names showing increased plasma membrane associations in these cells are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls2">Suppl. Table 2</xref>. Unlike in MCF10DCIS.com cases, there was no cell-crowding-induced relocation of ion channels and ion transporters to the plasma membrane in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells. However, in MCF10CA1a cells, ion transporters such as ATP2B4 showed a ∼37-fold greater plasma membrane association under crowding conditions. This suggests that plasma membrane relocations of these ion channels and ion transporters in response to cell crowding selectively occurred in MCF10DCIS.com cells and, to an extent, in invasive ductal cancer MCF10CA1a cells.</p>

<p>TRPV4 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the passage of calcium ions (Ca2+) and is integral in detecting various forms of mechanical stresses, including temperature fluctuations and osmotic pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Activation of TRPV4 channels elevates intracellular calcium levels, leading to cell volume increase via osmotic water influx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Nav1.9 primarily contributes to the generation and propagation of action potentials in sensory neurons and is associated with various pain disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. SK3 channels are activated by elevated intracellular calcium levels and serve diverse physiological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. However, unlike TRPV4, Nav1.9 and SK3 channels are not generally classified as mechanosensors. Consequently, we focused on TRPV4, the mechanosensor channel displaying the most significant increase in the plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, to further investigate its role in promoting pro-invasive cell volume reduction in MCF10DCIS.comcells.</p>
<p>To confirm the selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in OC MCF10DCIS.comcells suggested by mass spectrometry results, we conducted immunoblots on surface-biotinylated lysates from all four cell types under both conditions. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref> showed a notable association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in OC MCF10DCIS.comcells, which was absent in ND cells. This association was not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells under any conditions. Interestingly, in MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 associated with the plasma membrane under both conditions, with a slight increase in OC conditions. This increase suggests that these cells may also possess mechanosensing abilities, enabling them to respond to cell crowding. Additionally, immunoblots from whole-cell lysates showed consistent TRPV4 expression levels across different cell types and densities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Suppl. Fig. 4B</xref>), indicating that cell crowding influences ion channel trafficking without altering overall expression. This evidence strongly suggests that the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane is a mechanosensitive response to cell crowding.</p>
<p>To investigate the redistribution of TRPV4 in response to cell crowding, we performed IF imaging with confocal microscopy across all four cell types under both ND and OC conditions. The binding specificity of the TRPV4 antibody was confirmed through IF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Suppl. Fig. 5A</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Suppl. Fig. 5B</xref>) of MCF10DCIS.comcells treated with TRPV4 shRNA. As anticipated from the mass spectrometry results, TRPV4 (red) was significantly associated with the plasma membrane, selectively observed in OC MCF10DCIS.comcells in the IF images shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>. In MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 was already associated with plasma membrane under ND conditions, but cell crowding increased the association significantly. Plasma membrane associations were verified using the plasma membrane marker DiIC18(3), which we previously used to visualize the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. IF images showed that TRPV4 successfully colocalized with DiIC18(3) in OC MCF10DCIS.comand OC MCF10CA1a cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Suppl. Fig. 6A</xref>). However, the non-interacting protein transferrin receptor (TfR; green) remained similarly distributed in the OC cells compared to the ND cells, indicating that the protein trafficking changes induced by cell crowding are specific to TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether other ion channels identified through mass spectrometry and a well-known mechanosensory channel PIEZO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, exhibit similar behavior, we conducted IF imaging on ND and OC MCF10DCIS.comcells targeting KCNN4 and PIEZO1. Unfortunately, due to the absence of specific antibodies, we were unable to examine SCN11. In ND MCF10DCIS.comcells, KCNN4 was observed to be mostly cytosolic, while PIEZO1 was mildly but slightly more associated with the plasma membrane than TRPV4 under ND conditions. However, under OC conditions, both PIEZO1 and KCNN4 also relocated to the plasma membrane, albeit to a lesser extent than TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Suppl. Fig. 6B</xref>). The varying degrees of plasma membrane association of PIEZO1 and KCNN4 are quantified using line analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supple. Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, in ND MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and MCF10DCIS.comcells, TRPV4 was predominantly intracellular, with notable enrichment in the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). However, in OC MCF10DCIS.comcells, approximately 80% of TRPV4 was located in the plasma membrane based on line analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In contrast, in OC MCF10A and OC MCF10AT1 cells, TRPV4 remained cytosolic but migrated out of the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane was observed in both ND and OC MCF10CA1a cells, with an observable increase under OC conditions, further confirming the immunoprecipitation results shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>. Plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 was quantified using line analysis and plotted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>. Refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Suppl. Fig. 7A</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 associations with the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus between ND and OC conditions in all four cell types. These IF imaging results underscore the mechanosensitive plasma membrane relocation of ion channels in MCF10DCIS.co, and to an extent, in MCF10CA1a cells, contrasting with the observed insensitivity of MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells to cell crowding.</p>
<p>To assess the relationship between cell crowding-induced cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, we investigated whether hyperosmotic conditions, which reduce cell volume without cell crowding, would also result in TRPV4 relocation. We subjected ND cells to the same PEG 300 condition (74.4 mOsm/kg PEG for 15 minutes) used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> to induce cell volume reduction. In ND MCF10DCIS.comcells, such hyperosmotic cell volume reduction prompted plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, a response not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells, but seen in MCF10CA1a cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Quantitative line analysis confirmed these findings by assessing the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus). This finding underscores the relationship between mechanosensitive cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, highlighting that both cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress lead to the same effect, particularly pronounced in MCF10DCIS.comcells.</p>

<title>Patient tissue analysis shows selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells</title>
<p>MCF10DCIS.comcells represent a basal cell model for high-grade DCIS cells driven by HRAS mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, the majority of patient-derived DCIS cells originate from the luminal cell population and lack the HRAS mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Moreover, there are limited options for patient-derived DCIS cell line models that have not linked to well-defined pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Thus, to seek generality of our finding about the selective association between plasma membrane relocation and high-grade DCIS pathology, we examined 39 breast cancer patient tissue blocks to assess the selectivity in vivo. We designed an early-stage retrospective study by selecting various breast tissue pathologies that range from benign to invasive cancer. Those pathologies include usual ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, columnar changes, ADH, low-to high-grade DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We also incorporated normal regions for comparison. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to visualize tissue sections from each patient, excluding samples with prior cancer diagnoses or drug treatments. In total, 97 regions of interest (ROIs) from H&amp;E-stained sections of 39 patient tissue blocks were selected. Two pathologists independently assessed TRPV4 distribution patterns at the single-cell level in corresponding ROIs in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). A detailed methodology is described in the Methods section and more example images are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref>. High-grade DCIS cells, as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, clearly demonstrated plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, a feature absent in lower-grade DCIS cells (intermediate- and low-grade). This distinction sets them apart not only from cells with ADH and benign pathologies but also from lower-grade DCIS cells. As demonstrated by the IF images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> for MCF10CA1a (invasive cell mimic), IDC cells exhibited notable plasma membrane TRPV4, suggesting that they possess a similar pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability to high-grade DCIS cells.</p>
<p>We found that the sensitivity and specificity for plasma membrane TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells were 0.75 ± 0.19 (15/20) and 0.98 ± 0.03 (61/62) respectively (95% confidence interval) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). It is important to note that the specificity calculation excluded IDC cases. Notably, even in less aggressive pathologies, a significant amount of TRPV4 was localized in the nuclei, as shown for MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells in the IF images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>. This underscores our interpretation from the in vitro results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref> that increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells results from changes in protein localization through trafficking alterations, rather than differences in expression levels. These initial in vivo results clearly demonstrate the selective and specific association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. Notably, this association is absent in lower-grade DCIS, ADH, benign, and normal cells, thereby confirming our in vitro findings using MCF10A cell derivatives. These results suggest a potentially critical role for TRPV4 in the progression of high-grade DCIS.</p>

<title>Cell crowding inhibits ion channels and triggers their plasma membrane relocations</title>
<p>A calcium-permeant ion channel like TRPV4 is known to influence intracellular calcium dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. While activation of TRPV4 typically elevates calcium levels and this potentially increases cell volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, the impact of its inhibition is less clear, given the multifaceted nature of calcium signaling in cell volume control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. This complexity is compounded by compensatory cellular mechanisms and the involvement of other ion channels in response to altered calcium homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Considering these factors, we hypothesized that cell crowding might inhibit calcium-permeant ion channels, including TRPV4, which would then lower intracellular calcium levels and subsequently reduce cell volume via osmotic water movement. To test this, we employed the Fluo-4 calcium assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> to compare relative intracellular calcium levels of MCF10DCIS.comcells between ND and confluent (Con) conditions through 4X confocal microscopy imaging with 488 nm excitation. For this calcium assay, we opted for confluent conditions instead of OC conditions to collect the Fluo-4 signal from confluent monolayers of MCF10DCIS cells, which demonstrates comparable cell-crowding induced TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Suppl. Fig. 9A</xref>) as observed in the OC condition. This choice was made because more than one layer of cells was occasionally observed in OC conditions, which would yield overestimation of crowding-dependent intracellular calcium levels. The intracellular Fluo-4 signal under Con conditions was significantly lower than that under ND conditions, as shown in the fluorescence images of ND versus Con cells in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. Time-dependent Fluo-4 images were acquired over 25 minutes. For ND cell images, the average Fluo-4 intensity values were calculated from 10-15 selected cells (highlighted in the white box in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). For Con cell images, intensity values were derived from all cells within the entire 50 μm by 50 μm field of view, as depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. After background subtraction, the intensity values were plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. The temporal Fluo-4 intensity profiles from both ND and Con cells remained largely constant over the measured 20-minute period. However, Con cells exhibited significantly lower Fluo-4 intensity compared to ND cells, indicating reduced intracellular calcium levels. Lower Fluo-4 intensity in Con cells than in ND cells was not due to limited Fluo-4 reagent in Con samples. Within cell clusters, cells experiencing crowding exhibited notably lower Fluo-4 levels compared to those at the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Suppl. Fig. 9B</xref>), suggesting that cell crowding had resulted in a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, likely due to the mechanosensitive inhibition of calcium-permeable channels like TRPV4.</p>

GSK101 treatment also leads to a dose-dependent increase in the spike magnitude with higher GSK101 concentrations (0.05 pM: 101L; 0.2 pM: 101H), which is strikingly high in Con MCF10DCIS.comcells. <bold>(N-Q)</bold> TRPV4 activation status-dependent intracellular localization changes. <bold>(N)</bold> IF images of TRPV4 (red) and TfR (green) in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells show that GSK101 does not increase plasma membrane association of TRPV4.

<p>To investigate whether TRPV4 inhibition was involved in decreased intracellular calcium levels and subsequent relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane, we employed TRPV4-specific pharmacological agents to alter TRPV4 activity and modulate calcium concentrations in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells without applying cell crowding conditions. To inhibit TRPV4 activity, we used TRPV4 inhibitor (GSK2193874; GSK219)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> at 0.2 and 1 nM, which we confirmed to have insignificant effects on cell viability in both ND and OC conditions for two days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Suppl. Fig. 10A</xref>). This allowed us to use these conditions for the invasion assays described below.</p>
<p>GSK219 treatments immediately reduced the Fluo-4 signal, followed by a recovery, indicating cellular homeostatic activity. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> shows Fluo-4 images before and at the signal dip after applying 1 nM GSK219. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> presents the temporal profile of Fluo-4 intensity, marking two time points: <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> (baseline) and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> (dip). Although the Fluo-4 dip at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> was not visibly apparent in the image of ND MCF10DCIS.comcells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), the temporal profile (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>) clearly showed TRPV4 inhibition by GSK219. The extent of inhibition was reflected in the calcium depletion, ΔCa (vertical dashed line between the dip and baseline), followed by homeostatic recovery.</p>
<p>In Con cells, 1 nM GSK219 led to a very small dip in Fluo-4 intensity with no changes afterward, likely due to the already low intracellular calcium levels caused by cell crowding. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> shows the baseline and dip Fluo-4 images, while <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> presents the temporal Fluo-4 intensity profile, highlighting the two time points. The reduction in Fluo-4 intensity induced by GSK219 was smaller in Con MCF10DCIS.comcells (mean ΔCa ∼ −39 ± 9) compared to ND cells (mean ΔCa ∼ −49 ± 18), as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>. This smaller reduction in calcium in Con cells may also be due to less active TRPV4 channels, resulting from cell crowding-induced TRPV4 inhibition. The dose-dependent (0.2 nM and 1 nM GSK219, labeled 219L and 219H) and cell density-dependent (ND and Con) Fluo-4 signal reductions were reflected in the ΔCa values plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>. The results show the most significant TRPV4 inhibition in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells at 1 nM GSK219. These data suggest that a significant portion of TRPV4 that relocated to the plasma membrane in response to cell crowding was in an inactive state.</p>
<p>Administering a TRPV4 activator (GSK1016790A; GSK101)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> immediately caused a notably greater spike in Fluo-4 signal in Con cells than in ND cells, evidencing that a large number of inactive TRPV4 channels were indeed associated with the plasma membrane in Con cells. In Con cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 led to a Fluo-4 signal spike with ΔCa ∼ +2,348 ± 597, while in ND cells, ΔCa was ∼ +324 ± 130. This difference is clearly depicted in the Fluo-4 images (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref> for ND and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> for Con) and the time-dependent Fluo-4 intensity plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref> for ND and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref> for Con). The dose (101L and 101H representing 0.05 pM and 0.2 pM GSK101) and cell-density (ND and Con) dependent Fluo-4 signal spikes are reflected in the ΔCa values, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>. The results show the most significant TRPV4 activation in Con MCF10DCIS.comcells at 0.2 pM GSK101, confirming a large number of primed inactive TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane in Con cell.</p>
<p>Based on the differing effects of GSK219 and GSK101 on immediate calcium responses, we hypothesized that cell crowding induced TRPV4 inhibition and subsequent calcium depletion, which triggered the plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4 to compensate for the loss of calcium. We examined GSK219 and GSK101 dose-dependent relocation in both ND and OC MCF10DCIS.comcells via IF imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref> for higher GSK101/219 concentrations and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Suppl. Fig. 10B</xref> for both concentrations). Treating ND cells with GSK219 for 1 hour confirmed plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4 (∼53 ± 7%) at 0.2 nM and more (∼62 ± 7%) at 1 nM, significantly higher than in control ND cells (∼15 ± 6%), as shown by the line analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>). These data indicate that TRPV4 inhibition triggered its strategic relocation to the plasma membrane, preparing it for rapid activation to offset the channel inhibition effects.</p>
<p>Following the trend of GSK101-induced small Fluo-4 spikes in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>), the plasma membrane associated TRPV4 remained similarly with GSK101 to the control condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4P</xref>). However, in Con cells, GSK101 diminished the plasma membrane associated TRPV4 channels in a dose-dependent manner through internalization (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Q</xref>), consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These data suggest that plasma membrane TRPV4 levels were largely regulated by the channel activity status. Specifically, channel activation led to the internalization of TRPV4, while channel inhibition promoted the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane. However, we observed that GSK219 treatment in Con cells results in a slight reduction of TRPV4 from the plasma membrane, rather than an expected increase via additional plasma membrane relocation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Q</xref>). Considering that nuclear TRPV4 levels increase with higher doses of GSK219 in Con cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Suppl. Fig. 10B</xref>), as opposed to the cytoplasmic TRPV4 levels, we postulate that a distinct trafficking alteration occurs when TRPV4 is further inhibited under crowding conditions, where the channels are largely inactive.</p>
<p>Given the role of TRPV4 in osmoregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup> and its significant relocation to the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic conditions (∼55% plasma membrane association by line analysis; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4P</xref>) in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells, we explored the potential involvement of TRPV4 inhibition during this relocation. Using the Fluo-4 assay, we observed an initial calcium spike following 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells due to osmotic water outflow, which was followed by a homeostatic relaxation aimed at restoring calcium levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Suppl. Fig. 11A</xref>). This relaxation likely involved the inhibition of ion channels like TRPV4 and other ion transporters, followed by their relocations to the plasma membrane. Indeed, we confirmed the relocation of other ion channels that responded to cell crowding, including KCNN4 and PIEZO1, to the plasma membrane following the same PEG 300 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Suppl. Fig. 11B</xref> for IF images and line analysis results). The data suggest that the increased association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic stress may reflect an adaptive inhibition response to water outflow.</p>

<title>Cell crowding-induced inactive TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane indicates inhibition-mediated volume reduction and enhanced invasiveness and motility</title>
<p>We next investigated whether the inhibition-driven plasma membrane relocation of inactive TRPV4 precedes the reduction in cell volume and the enhancement of cell invasiveness observed in response to cell crowding (as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <bold>2B</bold>). To explore these relationships, we examined the effects of 2-day treatments with GSK101 and GSK219 on the cell volumes of ND and OC MCF10DCIS.comcells. This duration was selected to correlate the treatments with changes in cell volume and invasiveness.</p>
<p>Under ND conditions, activating TRPV4 with GSK101 (0.05 or 0.2 pM for 2 days), which caused minor calcium spikes and left TRPV4 distribution largely unaltered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Suppl. Fig. 6A</xref>), did not significantly alter cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Conversely, TRPV4 inhibition by GSK219 treatment (1 nM for 2 days) that induced greater calcium changes (dips rather than spikes) and a significant plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, led to a noticeable cell volume reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). 0.2 nM GSK219 treatment had a negligible impact on ND cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The GSK219 effect in ND MCF10DCIS.comcells was similar to that observed under hyperosmotic conditions by 74.7 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, under OC conditions, GSK101, which triggered dose-dependent calcium spikes, led to corresponding increases in cell volume. In contrast, GSK219, which had a minimal impact on intracellular calcium levels and did not significantly alter TRPV4 distribution at the plasma membrane, resulted in no significant change in cell volume. The effect of GSK219 on cell volume reduction in OC conditions was similar to that of PEG 300 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As expected, a significant linear correlation was observed between the plasma membrane association of TRPV4 and changes in cell volume (<italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.59) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). This finding confirms that the channel inhibition-driven relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane in response to cell crowding, and the subsequent decrease in intracellular calcium, are associated with a reduction in cell volume in MCF10DCIS.comcells.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the overall connections between TRPV4 activity, its plasma membrane association, cell volume changes, and cell invasiveness. Thus, we evaluated changes in invasiveness following 2-day treatments with GSK101 or GSK219 using collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay used in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. In ND MCF10DCIS.comcells, 0.2 pM GSK101 led to only a mild suppression of cell invasiveness, and 0.05 pM GSK101 did not alter cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, under ND conditions, GSK219 caused a dose-dependent increase in the invasive cell fraction, mirroring the patterns for Fluo-4 signal changes and plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Under OC conditions, GSK101 increased cell volume and suppressed cell invasiveness in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Conversely, both GSK219 and PEG 300, which reduced cell volume, led to increased cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). The treatment dependent invasion results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Suppl. Fig. 12A</xref>. This solidified the relationship between TRPV4 activity, plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, cell volume, and cell invasiveness. There were significant linear correlations between plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 and cell invasiveness changes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.69), and between cell volume and cell invasiveness changes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.89).</p>
<p>Cell invasiveness refers to the ability of cells to penetrate and move within their surrounding tissues or environments. As expected from the increased cortical stiffness of OC MCF10DCIS.comcells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), we observed that OC MCF10DCIS.comcells underwent cytoskeletal rearrangements, including the formation of stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs12">Suppl. Fig. 12B</xref>), which likely enhanced cell motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. To assess how TRPV4 inhibition and activation, which reduced and increased cell volume, respectively, affected the motility of ND MCF10DCIS.comcells and the role of these motility changes on cell invasiveness, we conducted single-cell tracking experiments similar to single molecule tracking methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We utilized wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as a nuclear marker, which stained the cell nucleus within 1 hour of incubation with cells. We then analyzed the diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) and directionality (<italic>v</italic>) of single cell movements. We tracked overall single-cell trajectories for 3 hr with 1 min intervals, marking cell displacement over each interval in different colors, ranging from navy for the slowest to red for the fastest (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Consistent with the trend in cell invasiveness, TRPV4 activation with 1 pM GSK101 significantly reduced single-cell movements, while inhibition with 0.2 nM GSK219 and 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 notably increased these movements. Interestingly, while GSK219 and hyperosmotic conditions promoted increased cell movement (<italic>D</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), they also reduced cell directionality (<italic>v</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>). This reduction in directionality suggests that while the cells become more mobile, their movements are less targeted, potentially indicating a more random or exploratory behavior under mechanical stress. Remarkably, cell movement increased in proportion to the amount of TRPV4 at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.73) and decreased with increased cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.89). Cell movement and invasiveness showed a strong linear correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.85), suggesting that these behaviors are governed by the same underlying mechanisms.</p>

<title>Mechanosensitive TRPV4 relocation to plasma membrane indicates enhanced invasiveness</title>
<p>We investigated whether the mechanosensitive relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane can reliably predict a cell’s ability to undergo pro-invasive mechanosensitive cell volume reduction. To achieve this, we used changes in cell motility as markers for overall shifts in cell invasiveness, given the strong correlation observed between cell motility and invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). Our hypothesis is that cells with such mechanotransduction capability, like MCF10DCIS.comcells, should show increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 when inhibited with GSK219 or under hyperosmotic conditions, evidenced by increased cell motility (<italic>D</italic>) while demonstrating the opposite effect with GSK101 treatment.</p>
<p>For comparison, we employed three uncharacterized cell types: MDA-MB-231, a triple-negative invasive breast cancer cell line, and two recently developed patient-derived DCIS cell lines, ETCC-06 and ETCC-10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>, which have not yet been histologically classified by grade.

<p>MCF10CA1a cells showed plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4 in response to TRPV4 inhibition (1 nM GSK219; ND 219H), PEG 300 (74.4 mOsm/kg; ND PEG300), and OC conditions.

This response was similar to that observed in MCF10DCIS.comcells under OC conditions. The plasma membrane associations of TRPV4 were quantified by line analysis, showing an increase under mechanical stresses (PEG and OC) and TRPV4 inhibition with GSK219, as plotted in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>. As expected, based on the differences in plasma membrane TRPV4 association, MCF10CA1a cells exhibited increased motility (<italic>D</italic>) in response to TRPV4 inhibition (GSK219) and hyperosmotic conditions (PEG). Additionally, their movement became more directional (<italic>v</italic>) with TRPV4 activation (GSK101), similar to the observations in MCF10DCIS.comcells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative control MCF10AT1 cells did not exhibit mechanical stress and TRPV4 activity-dependent plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, as shown by IF images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs13">Suppl.

Moreover, movement directionality (<italic>v</italic>) remained unchanged under all treatment conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>).</p>
<p>The three test group cells, MDA-MB-231 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>), ETCC-06 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6K</xref>), and ETCC-10 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6N</xref>), failed to relocate TRPV4 to the plasma membrane in response to mechanical stresses (PEG and OC), as shown by IF images and quantification. This suggests that these cells lack the pro-invasive mechanosensitive cell volume reduction capability observed in MCF10DCIS.comcells. Consistently, none of these cells showed increased motility (<italic>D</italic>) under hyperosmotic conditions or TRPV4 inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6L</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6O</xref>).</p>
<p>We plotted these results to show cell diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) scaling with varying plasma membrane associations of TRPV4, where MCF10DCIS.com(green hexagon) and MCF10CA1a (red hexagon) exhibited a positive scaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5P</xref>). However, the changes in plasma membrane TRPV4 occurred over a narrower range (31 – 79%) for MCF10CA1a compared to MCF10DCIS.comcells (16 - 75%), reflecting the larger mechanosensitive cell volume plasticity of MCF10DCIS.comcells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231, ETCC-6, and ETCC-10 cells did not show this scaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Q</xref>). Like MCF10AT1 cells, plasma membrane TRPV4 associations in these cells remained at similar percentages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5Q</xref>).</p>
<p>This dichotomy in the presence of a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program is evident in the plots of diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) increase versus plasma membrane TRPV4 relocation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5R</xref>), where only MCF10CA1a and MCF10DCIS.comcells show a significant increase in both parameters. Furthermore, the relationship between plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 and <italic>D</italic> increase with GSK219 versus GSK101 can be used to assess the presence of a pro-invasive, mechanosensitive cell volume reduction program. Most non-mechanotransducing cells remained close to the baseline value of 1, while mechanotransducing cells showed a significant increase in <italic>D</italic> with GSK219 treatment.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study explored how cell crowding, a common condition in diseases and development, impacts cell invasiveness. We employed novel assays to quantify cell invasion and single-cell motility in cells with breast tissue pathologies, including DCIS and ADH, which experience cell crowding due to abnormal proliferation in confined ducts. Our results revealed a novel mechanotransduction pathway activated by crowding in high-grade DCIS cells, establishing a direct link between crowding and invasiveness. This pathway highlights the intricate interplay between mechanical stimuli, ion channel activation, trafficking changes, cell volume reduction, stiffening, and invasiveness (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). It distinguishes high-grade DCIS cells from normal, hyperplastic, or lower-grade DCIS cells, supporting previous findings that minimal cell volume reduction enables efficient invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<caption><title>Cell crowding triggers the activation of a pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells but not in less aggressive or normal cells.</title>
<p>This pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway involves cell volume reduction and cortical stiffening driven by ion channel inhibition. Ion channel inhibition leads to the relocation of ion channels to the plasma membrane (PM). Under ND conditions, ion channels are mainly cytoplasmic in both high-grade DCIS and less aggressive/normal cells. However, high-grade DCIS cells have a larger cell volume under ND conditions. Cell crowding induces ion channel inhibition, leading to decreased intracellular calcium and subsequent cell volume reduction, which correlates with increased invasiveness. In contrast, less aggressive and normal cells do not exhibit this response. The inset image shows that mechanosensitive plasma membrane relocation of ion channels (orange) scales with increased invasiveness due to the activation of the cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway, while the absence of relocation indicates no mechanosensitive invasive increase.</p></caption>

<p>The correlation between cell volume reduction and increased invasiveness highlights the specialized mechanotransduction abilities of high-grade DCIS cells. Using mass spectrometry, we identified TRPV4 as a crucial component of this pathway, providing insights into how non-invasive breast cancer cells may evolve into invasive phenotypes. By employing Fluo-4 assays and TRPV4 activators and inhibitors, we found that cell crowding triggered TRPV4 inhibition, leading to reduced intracellular calcium and subsequent cell volume reduction. Notably, TRPV4 inhibition prompted its relocation to the plasma membrane, priming it for activation under suitable signaling conditions, thereby maintaining cellular homeostasis. In high-grade DCIS cells, TRPV4 inhibition by cell crowding increased invasiveness and motility, while TRPV4 activation had the opposite effect. This phenomenon differed from other invasive breast cancer cell lines, where TRPV4 inhibition typically suppresses invasiveness, and activation enhances it. However, the modest mechanotransduction capability observed in MCF10CA1a cells suggests heterogeneity in invasive cancer progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our discovery of the selective mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells was further validated by analyzing patient-derived breast cancer tissues. We found that TRPV4 was predominantly associated with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS lesions, but not in lower-grade DCIS or less aggressive pathologies. This selective relocation reinforces TRPV4’s crucial role in the pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway unique to high-grade DCIS cells. The association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane may serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying high-grade DCIS lesions.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that ion channels beyond TRPV4 may contribute to pro-invasive mechanotransduction. Notably, SCN11A and KCNN4 showed increased plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, suggesting their roles in modulating ion flux and cell volume and thus contributing to the mechanotransduction response. Although Piezo1 is known to respond to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, its lesser plasma membrane relocation compared to TRPV4 under cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions suggests a lesser role in promoting invasiveness in this case. Further comparisons are needed to determine the dominant ion channel driving mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells. However, it is evident that cell crowding-induced pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathway involves the coordinated action of multiple ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We made the intriguing discovery that hyperosmotic conditions, which reduced’ cell volume through osmotic water outflow, mimic the effects of cell crowding by inducing similar pro-invasive cell volume reduction. Treatment with hyperosmotic agents like PEG 300 led to TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane and increased cell invasiveness, highlighting TRPV4’s mechanosensitive role in response to external mechanical stimuli. This suggests that the convergence of mechanical stresses, including cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress, is a crucial trigger for pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathways, leading to a unified mechanotransduction signaling cascade.</p>
<p>The study’s insights have far-reaching implications, unlocking new research paths in cancer and biological sciences. By elucidating mechanosensitive responses to cell crowding, we can shed light on tissue development, wound healing, and physiological processes involving cell density changes. The parallels between cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions in driving pro-invasive behaviors warrant further investigation into the intricate mechanisms of cytoskeleton reorganization, ion channel and transporter relocation, and enhanced cell invasiveness and motility. Moreover, our findings pave the way for developing diagnostic and prognostic strategies that leverage the selective intracellular localization patterns of TRPV4 and other mechanosensitive ion channels, potentially guiding clinical decisions for patients with high-grade DCIS and other cancers where cell crowding plays a crucial role.</p>

<title>Line analysis</title>
<p>IF images of ion channels (TRPV4, PIEZO1, or KCNN4), DiIC18(3), and DAPI were opened in ImageJ. These images were concatenated so that a line crossing a cell in all three images could be used to measure approximate percentage protein localization in the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus. Background was subtracted from all images. DiIC18(3) signal was used as a guide for plasma membrane location (between 50% of the peak intensity) and DAPI signal (between 50% of the peak intensity) for nuclear locations. The cytosol location was defined as the region between the 50% peak intensity points of the DiIC18(3) and DAPI signals. The ion channel signal in each window along the line was then averaged. The percentage of protein localization in the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus for a cell was calculated by dividing the average intensity of each location by the sum of intensities in all three locations.</p>

<caption><p>Various ion channels are relocated to the plasma membrane under cell crowding conditions. (A) We used the plasma membrane marker DiIC18(3) to confirm the association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in MCF10DCIS.comand MCF10CA1a cells under OC conditions. As described in the Methods section, we stained DiIC18(3) in live cells and co-stained TRPV4 and DAPI in fixed and permeabilized cells. The IF images show TRPV4 (red), DiIC18(3) (DiI, green), and DAPI (blue). The line profile plots on the right demonstrate colocalization of TRPV4 with DiIC18(3) at the plasma membrane (PM), marked by the green DiIC18(3) signal, which overlaps with the red TRPV4 signal. The nucleus location (NUC) is indicated by the blue DAPI signal. Scale bar = 20 μm. (B) We examined the relocation of KCNN4 and PIEZO1 to the plasma membrane in response to cell crowding. Mass spectrometry showed a slight increase in KCNN4 at the plasma membrane under OC conditions. In ND MCF10DCIS.comcells, KCNN4 was predominantly cytosolic, whereas PIEZO1 showed some plasma membrane association. Under OC conditions, both KCNN4 and PIEZO1 showed a modest relocation to the plasma membrane. (C) Line analysis confirmed a slight increase in plasma membrane association for both KCNN4 and PIEZO1 under OC conditions compared to ND conditions. Scale bar = 20 μm. For the statistical analysis, we employed a nonparametric approach using the Mann-Whitney test with a two-tailed p-value.

<p>In this <bold>important</bold> study, Bu et al investigate how cell overcrowding triggers a mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, focusing on high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells. The authors show that cell crowding in these malignant cells leads to a reduction in cell volume and promotes a pro-invasive phenotype through calcium homeostasis and TRPV4 channel trafficking to the plasma membrane; this phenomenon is specific to invasive cell lines like MCF10CA and DCIS and is corroborated by patient tissue samples. The work suggests the role of TRPV4 in cell motility and mechanical sensing, offering potential therapeutic insights for targeting cancer metastasis. While the study presents robust and <bold>convincing</bold> data, the absence of TRPV4 genetic ablation is a critical limitation, which would further confirm its role in these processes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bu et al examined the dynamics of TRPV4 channel in cell overcrowding in carcinoma conditions. They investigated how cell crowding (or high cell confluence) triggers a mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells that leads to large cell volume reduction (or cell volume plasticity) and pro-invasive phenotype.</p>
<p>In vitro, this pathway is highly selective for highly malignant invasive cell lines derived from a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF10A) compared to the parent cell line, but not present in another triple-negative invasive breast epithelial cell line (MDA-MB-231). The authors convincingly showed that enhanced TRPV4 plasma membrane localization correlates with high-grade DCIS cells in patient tissue samples.</p>
<p>
Specifically in non-invasive MCF10DCIS.com cells, they showed that overcrowding or over-confluence leads to a decrease in cell volume and intracellular calcium levels. This condition also triggers the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores (nucleus and potentially endosomes), to the plasma membrane (PM). When these over-confluent cells are incubated with a TRPV4 activator, there is an acute and substantial influx of calcium, attesting to the fact that there are a high number of TRPV4 channels present on the PM. Long-term incubation of these over-confluent cells with the TRPV4 activator results in the internalization of the PM-localized TRPV4 channels.</p>
<p>In contrast, cells plated at lower confluence primarily have TRPV4 channels localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Long-term incubation of these cells at lower confluence with a TRPV4 inhibitor leads to the relocation of TRPV4 channels to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores and a subsequent reduction in cell volume. Similarly, incubation of these cells at low confluence with PEG 3000 (a hyperosmotic agent) promotes the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is elegantly designed and the findings are novel. Their findings on this mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, calcium homeostasis, cell volume plasticity, motility, and invasiveness will have a great impact in the cancer field and are potentially applicable to other fields as well. Experiments are well-planned and executed, and the data is convincing. The authors investigated TRVP4 dynamics using multiple different strategies- overcrowding, hyperosmotic stress, and pharmacological means, and showed a good correlation between different phenomena.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A major emphasis in the study is on pharmacological means to relate TRPV4 channel function to the phenotype. I believe the use of genetic means would greatly enhance the impact and provide compelling proof for the involvement of TRPV4 channels in the associated phenotype. In this regard, I wonder if siRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPV4 in over-confluent cells (or knockout) would lead to an increase in cell volume and normalize the intracellular calcium levels back to normal, thus ultimately leading to a decrease in cell invasiveness.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The metastasis poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment. During the transition from non-invasive cells to invasive metastasis cells, cancer cells usually experience mechanical stress due to a crowded cellular environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying mechanical signaling during this transition remain largely elusive. In this work, the authors utilize an in vitro cell culture system and advanced imaging techniques to investigate how non-invasive and invasive cells respond to cell crowding, respectively.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The results clearly show that pre-malignant cells exhibit a more pronounced reduction in cell volume and are more prone to spreading compared to non-invasive cells. Furthermore, the study identifies that TRPV4, a calcium channel, relocates to the plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo (patient samples). Activation and inhibition of the TRPV4 channel can modulate the cell volume and cell mobility. These results unveil a novel mechanism of mechanical sensing in cancer cells, potentially offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metastasis by modulating TRPV4 activity. This is a very comprehensive study, and the data presented in the paper are clear and convincing. The study represents a very important advance in our understanding of the mechanical biology of cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, I do think that there are several additional experiments that could strengthen the conclusions of this work. A critical limitation is the absence of genetic ablation of the TRPV4 gene to confirm its essential role in the response to cell crowding.</p>

<p>In response to the comment regarding siRNA-mediated knockdown or knockout of TRPV4, we fully agree that this would further substantiate our findings. We will use shRNA targeting TRPV4 approaches to further explore the functional effects of TRPV4 knockdown on cell volume plasticity, intracellular calcium level changes, and invasiveness phenotypes through motility assays at the single cell level under cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress and will include these results in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the positive assessment of our study and the acknowledgment of the impact of our findings on the understanding of mechanical signaling in cancer progression. We also appreciate the suggestion to include genetic ablation experiments to confirm the role of TRPV4 in cell crowding responses. As noted in our response to reviewer #1, we plan to use shRNA TRPV4 to examine the functional effects of TRPV4 knockdown on cell volume plasticity, changes in intracellular calcium levels, and invasive phenotypes through motility assays at the single-cell level under conditions of cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress. We will include these results in our revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Once again, we thank the reviewers for their valuable feedback, which will help us further improve our manuscript.</p>
