<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The type II class of RAF inhibitors currently in clinical trials paradoxically activate BRAF at subsaturating concentrations. Activation is mediated by induction of BRAF dimers, but why activation rather than inhibition occurs remains unclear. Using biophysical methods tracking BRAF dimerization and conformation we built an allosteric model of inhibitor-induced dimerization that resolves the allosteric contributions of inhibitor binding to the two active sites of the dimer, revealing key differences between type I and type II RAF inhibitors. For type II inhibitors the allosteric coupling between inhibitor binding and BRAF dimerization is distributed asymmetrically across the two dimer binding sites, with binding to the first site dominating the allostery. This asymmetry results in efficient and selective induction of dimers with one inhibited and one catalytically active subunit. Our allosteric models quantitatively account for paradoxical activation data measured for 11 RAF inhibitors. Unlike type II inhibitors, type I inhibitors lack allosteric asymmetry and do not activate BRAF homodimers. Finally, NMR data reveal that BRAF homodimers are dynamically asymmetric with only one of the subunits locked in the active αC-in state. This provides a structural mechanism for how binding of only a single αC-in inhibitor molecule can induce potent BRAF dimerization and activation.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>In this revised manuscript, we have incorporated a substantial body of new data in order to provide a more clear and comprehensive model of paradoxical activation by aC-in RAF inhibitors. Firstly, we expanded our data set on in vitro BRAF activation to include a wider variety of RAF inhibitors which has allowed for a more quantitative comparison to the allosteric models of inhibitor-induced dimerization (Fig 2). From this new data we were able to determine the catalytic activity of partially occupied BBD dimers to be approximately 70% of the activity of fully activated drug-free BRAF dimers measured by the Sudhamsu group (Liau et al., Biochemistry 2020) (Fig 2e). This new observation provides key insight that is crucial to explaining how these BBD dimers are able to drive paradoxical activation. Next, we have now validated the model of paradoxical activation by aC-in inhibitors in a cellular context by showing MAPK activation in SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells using phospho-flow cytometry (Fig 3d). These results show that the allosteric models for type II inhibitors predict the concentration regime where paradoxical activation occurs in cells and helped uncover fundamental differences in the paradoxical activation mechanisms between type I and type II aC-in inhibitors that are now discussed at length in the revised manuscript. In addition, we present a more comprehensive model of paradoxical activation that integrates the results from the inhibitor-induced dimerization experiments and global fitting analysis with the dynamic heterogeneity identified in the BRAF dimer by 19F NMR (Fig 4d). This unified model now presents a more coherent understanding of the mechanism underlying paradoxical activation by aC-in RAF inhibitors. Finally, as part of our effort to improve the overall clarity of the manuscript, we have omitted the V600E data.</p></fn>

<title>Main</title>
<p>The protein kinase BRAF is a central component of the MAPK (RAF-MEK-ERK) signaling pathway and plays a critical role in the regulation of eukaryotic cell growth, proliferation, and survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In quiescent cells, BRAF exists in the cytosol as an autoinhibited monomer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Upon initiation of growth factor signaling, BRAF monomers are recruited to the plasma membrane by RAS-GTP and activated by homodimerization or by heterodimerization with the additional isoforms ARAF and CRAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Dimerization allosterically activates BRAF by triggering a conformational change of the regulatory αC-helix from an inactive αC-out state to an active αC-in state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Activated BRAF dimers initiate a phosphorylation cascade in which MEK and ERK are sequentially activated by successive phosphorylation events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mutations in BRAF play a major role in driving human cancers, most notably in approximately half of melanoma cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The most prevalent BRAF mutation is V600E<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, which confers constitutive kinase activity on BRAF by disrupting critical autoinhibitory interactions, allowing monomeric V600E BRAF to phosphorylate its substrate MEK independently of upstream signaling and dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The FDA-approved inhibitors vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and encorafenib show remarkable initial responses in V600E-driven metastatic melanoma patients due to their effective inhibition of V600E BRAF monomers. However, clinical resistance emerges rapidly and is driven by the formation of mutant BRAF dimers, which these drugs fail to inhibit <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Consequently, mechanisms that promote BRAF dimerization, including receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) upregulation, activating RAS mutations, and BRAF splice variants, confer resistance to these inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In fact, these inhibitors can paradoxically activate BRAF dimers, leading to elevated MAPK signaling in cells containing dimeric BRAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. This paradoxical activation triggers the emergence of secondary cutaneous carcinomas in many patients treated with these inhibitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The failure of the FDA-approved BRAF inhibitors to block BRAF dimers is attributed to negative allostery, in which inhibitors preferentially bind the inactive αC-out state of BRAF and are unable to bind to the active αC-in state adopted by BRAF dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This discovery prompted the development of a new class of inhibitors that recognize the αC-in state and bypass this negative allostery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Remarkably, despite binding to both subunits of the BRAF dimer in x-ray structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and being reportedly equipotent for both subunits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, these αC-in inhibitors still induce paradoxical activation of MAPK/ERK signaling in cells<sup>16,29,31-34</sup>. Paradoxical activation by αC-in inhibitors is linked to their ability to induce BRAF dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, but the molecular mechanisms triggering this activation remain elusive. Addressing this question could shed light on the shortcomings of numerous drugs currently undergoing clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and inspire the development of new RAF inhibitors that do not induce paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway.</p>
<p>Here we use biophysical techniques tracking BRAF dimerization, activation, and structural changes in solution, to develop a comprehensive model highlighting the allosteric and thermodynamic mechanisms that underpin paradoxical activation by αC-in RAF inhibitors. We demonstrate that all αC-in inhibitors are allosterically coupled to BRAF dimerization to a remarkable degree, and further highlight fundamental distinctions in the coupling mechanisms between type I and type II αC-in inhibitors that explain key differences in how they induce paradoxical activation.</p>

<title>Type II inhibitors drive BRAF dimerization through asymmetric allosteric coupling</title>
<p>We used intermolecular FRET to quantify inhibitor-induced BRAF dimerization in vitro. A previously-validated construct of the BRAF kinase domain containing 16 solubilizing mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (hereafter referred to as “BRAF”) was covalently labeled on K547C with donor (Alexa Fluor 488) or acceptor (Alexa Fluor 568) fluorophores, mixed at equal molar ratios and dispensed into multiwell plates (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 1</bold>). We recorded donor and acceptor emission spectra on a fluorescence plate reader<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and utilized spectral deconvolution to obtain accurate values for the acceptor/donor (A/D) ratio, from which dimerization was inferred (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>). In control experiments without drug, the baseline dimerization affinity of apo BRAF (K<sub>D</sub><sup>dimer</sup>) was found to be 62.4 ± 2.9 µM, in agreement with previously reported values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2a,b</bold>). We then examined BRAF dimerization in the presence of a diverse set of 11 αC-in (3 type I, 8 type II) and 3 αC-out RAF inhibitors (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>). All αC-in inhibitors induced large increases in the A/D ratio, consistent with inhibitor-induced BRAF dimerization (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Fig. 3</bold>). The change in A/D ratio with BRAF concentration observed at saturating inhibitor concentrations indicated that inhibitor-bound BRAF dimerizes with nanomolar affinity, representing several orders of magnitude enhancement over baseline dimerization.</p>

<p>With the dimerization affinity of apo BRAF (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><sup><italic>dimer</italic></sup>) constrained to a value of 62.4 µM (see above), global fitting produced well-constrained values for all other dissociation constants in the model (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref></bold> and <bold>Supplementary Fig. 2b,c and Supplementary Fig. 4</bold>). Importantly, because of the explicit separation of inhibitor-driven dimerization into two steps, the energetic contributions of the first and second inhibitor molecules to dimerization can be resolved and are represented by the allosteric coupling parameters α and β, respectively.

<p>The αC-in RAF inhibitors can be divided into two classes based on binding mode. While both promote the αC-in state, type II inhibitors reach further into the active site than type I inhibitors and trigger an additional conformational change of the catalytic DFG-motif, in which the aspartate and phenylalanine DFG residues swap positions (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1c</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. For both type I and type II inhibitors our results showed that the total enhancement in BRAF dimerization from inhibitor binding, represented by the product αβ, is remarkably strong, ranging from 3-5 orders of magnitude (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). Surprisingly, for the type II inhibitors, including the clinical drugs ponatinib, belvarafenib, and tovorafenib, our global fitting analysis revealed that this allosteric coupling is not evenly distributed across the two drug binding sites of the dimer. Rather, these drugs are coupled to BRAF dimerization in a highly asymmetric manner, with the large majority of dimer promotion provided by the binding of the first inhibitor molecule (α values as large as 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>), and the contributions from the second inhibitor molecule being orders of magnitude smaller (β values no larger than 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>,<bold>g and Supplementary Fig. 5</bold>). In contrast, the allosteric coupling for the type I inhibitors is symmetrical <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref>)</bold>, with the α and β values being approximately equal (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5</bold>).</p>
<p>Because of the cyclic paths in the model, the pattern of allosteric coupling described above for dimerization affinities also applies to inhibitor affinities. Due to type II inhibitors having large α values and small β values, their binding affinity for apo BRAF dimers <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is greatly enhanced compared to their binding affinity to BRAF monomers (<italic>KD</italic><sup><italic>drug</italic></sup>), whereas binding to the second subunit of a partially occupied dimer <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is only modestly enhanced (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 5</bold>).</p>
<p>For many of the type II inhibitors the large α values boost affinities for the first dimer subunit into the picomolar range while the affinities for the second subunit are substantially weaker. In contrast, type I inhibitors, which have similar α and β values, bind the first and second subunits of the dimer with comparable affinity (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 5</bold>).</p>
<p>In our FRET experiments inhibitor binding to BRAF monomers is not observed directly, and its weak affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><sup><italic>drug</italic></sup>) emerges as a prediction from the global fit analysis due to cyclic path constraints within the model. To support this prediction and confirm that our model is correctly parameterized, we performed control experiments with an intramolecular FRET sensor that directly detects inhibitor binding by measuring inhibitor-induced movements of the αC-helix (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 6a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>). Using a mutant construct (BRAF<sup>DB</sup>) that cannot dimerize, we were able to uncouple inhibitor binding from BRAF dimerization and independently confirm the weak inhibitor affinity for BRAF monomers predicted by the allosteric model (see Methods, <bold>Supplementary Fig. 6c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>).</p>
<p>To independently verify that dimerization by type II inhibitors is driven predominately by α, we performed additional FRET experiments where the effects of β were eliminated by exploiting the inhibitor-blocking A481F mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 7a</bold>). In control experiments with BRAF<sup>A481F</sup> labeled with both donor and acceptor, inhibitor-induced dimerization was either not observed or was greatly weakened, confirming that the mutation effectively blocks inhibitor binding (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 7b</bold>). Acceptor-labeled BRAF<sup>A481F</sup> and donor-labeled wild-type BRAF were mixed at equal molar ratios. Under these conditions, fully-occupied wild-type BRAF dimers (BBDD) do not contribute to the FRET signal, and only the BRAF<sup>A481F</sup>:BRAF heterodimers, which can bind only one inhibitor molecule (BBD) and are thus driven only by α, lead to observable FRET changes (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 7a</bold>). In these experiments, type II inhibitors triggered increases in the A/D ratios similar in magnitude to those observed in a donor-matched BRAF:BRAF experiment, indicating a similar extent of dimer induction (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 8a</bold>). Furthermore, dimerization affinities at saturating inhibitor concentrations were in the low nanomolar range, corresponding to a fold-increase over baseline dimerization of between 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, in good agreement with our measured α values for the type II inhibitors (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 8b</bold>). The type I inhibitor GDC0879, which possesses a far more modest α value (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>), failed to induce BRAF<sup>A481F</sup>:BRAF heterodimers in this experiment. These results are consistent with the coupling between inhibitor binding and dimerization being highly asymmetric for type II inhibitors, where α is the dominant value, and more symmetric for type I inhibitors where α is smaller and similar in magnitude to β.</p>
<p>We also tested the effects of the αC-out inhibitors vemurafenib, dabrafenib and encorafenib on BRAF dimerization. All three disrupted dimerization to such an extent that no dimerization signal was observed at saturating inhibitor concentrations, preventing the global fit analysis from converging to a constrained solution. To circumvent this, we used the oncogenic mutation E586K (BRAF<sup>E586K</sup>) in the dimer interface to enhance dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, allowing us to obtain constrained α and β values for each αC-out inhibitor (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>,<bold>h and Supplementary Fig. 9</bold>). This analysis showed that dimer disruption by αC-out inhibitors is weaker than dimer promotion by αC-in inhibitors, with total decreases in dimerization affinity of 1-2 orders of magnitude (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 5</bold>). Additionally, dimer disruption is not distributed equally between α and β, with the former dominating for vemurafenib and the latter for dabrafenib and encorafenib (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that our approach can quantify a wide range of inhibitor-induced dimerization effects including dimer promotion and disruption. Despite opposite effects on dimerization, both αC-in and αC-out RAF inhibitors can exhibit asymmetric allosteric coupling, suggesting that they are influenced by an asymmetry that is intrinsic to the BRAF kinase domain.</p>

<title>Allosteric asymmetry drives accumulation of partially occupied BRAF dimers</title>
<p>To understand the functional consequences of asymmetric inhibitor-induced dimerization, we used our parameterized allosteric models to simulate the abundance of each BRAF biochemical species in solution (B, BD, BB, BBD, BBDD) as a function of inhibitor concentration (see Methods). For all αC-in inhibitors, simulations predict a bell-shaped curve for the induction of partially occupied BBD dimers that increases with inhibitor concentration and peaks at approximately a 1:2 molar ratio of inhibitor to BRAF, before decreasing at higher concentrations due to the formation of dimers saturated with inhibitor (BBDD) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 10</bold>). The BBD induction amplitudes varied for type II inhibitors from 11-78% of total BRAF protein, but as a group were substantially higher than the amplitudes associated with the type I inhibitors which ranged from 4-11% (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 11a</bold>)</p>
<p>To determine how induction of BBD dimers is controlled by the α and β parameters, we used our allosteric model to simulate BBD formation over a wide range of α and β parameter space, while keeping apo dimerization affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><sup><italic>dimer</italic></sup>) and inhibitor affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><sup><italic>drug</italic></sup>) constant. The resulting BBD induction landscape is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>. This analysis revealed that the amplitude of BBD induction is primarily dictated by the ratio between α and β, or the degree of asymmetry in the allosteric model, following a hyperbolic relationship with respect to α/β (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>), rather than by the total magnitude of dimer enhancement (αβ). This hyperbolic relationship was also observed with the experimentally parameterized models for the type I and type II inhibitors (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). In fact, different α/β ratios fully account both for the differences between type I and type II inhibitors and for the variability within the type II class. For instance, among the clinically relevant type II drugs in our set, belvarafenib and ponatinib have the largest α/β ratios (&gt;10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>) and induce BBD dimers strongly, tovorafenib has a moderate α/β ratio (10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) and induces dimers moderately well and sorafenib has the lowest α/β ratio (30) and is only marginally superior to the type I inhibitors at inducing BBD dimers (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>). These observations establish that greater allosteric coupling asymmetry translates into greater induction of partially occupied BBD dimers.</p>
<p>Comparing the inhibitors in our dataset in terms of their respective α and β values on the simulated BBD induction landscape clarifies that they occupy three distinct regions. Notably, the type I and type II inhibitors are resolved into separate groups (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). The type II inhibitors are distributed in this space along an axis of increasing α/β ratio and approximately at right angles to an axis of increasing αβ, further highlighting the central role of allosteric asymmetry in determining the amplitude of BBD dimer induction. The αC-out inhibitors occupy a region of the landscape where both α and β are unfavorable, corresponding to dimer disruption rather than dimer promotion. This underscores that paradoxical activation by αC-out inhibitors is not driven by the dimer-induction mechanism of αC-in inhibitors, but by alternative mechanisms including negative allostery, RAS priming and transactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Induction of partially occupied dimers quantitatively accounts for paradoxical activation in vitro</title>
<p>To test how the induction of BBD dimers translates into BRAF kinase activity, we used a fluorescence-based kinase assay to directly measure the phosphorylation of recombinant MEK by BRAF. In this assay, type II inhibitors induced strong dosedependent increases in BRAF activity up to 19-fold above the no-inhibitor control that agreed strikingly well with simulated BBD induction curves (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 11b</bold>). In contrast, the type I inhibitors induced only relatively minor increases in BRAF activity (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Fig. 11b</bold>), consistent with their weak ability to induce BBD dimers, and the αC-out inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib failed to trigger any discernable activation (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 10</bold>).</p>
<p>Comparing the measured amplitudes of kinase activation with the BBD induction amplitudes predicted by the parameterized allosteric models for each inhibitor revealed an impressive linear correlation (R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> = 0.93) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>). The slope of the linear fit yielded a value for the catalytic turnover per BBD dimer of (3.2 ± 0.3) x 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. This value is in excellent agreement with the turnover value of 4.5 x 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> for drug-free BRAF dimers bound to 14-3-3 reported by Sudhamsu and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. This observation shows that partially occupied BRAF dimers are highly active and minimally impacted by the presence of one αC-in inhibitor molecule, and that the amplitude of paradoxical activation is directly determined by the concentration of this dimer species. The close correspondence between these independent experiments highlights the capability of our allosteric models to accurately predict how RAF inhibitors with a wide range of allosteric effects modulate the concentrations of different BRAF biochemical species to drive paradoxical activation. We conclude that paradoxical activation of BRAF homodimers by type II inhibitors occurs due to asymmetric allosteric coupling that selectively induces catalytically active BBD dimers, rather than fully inhibited BBDD dimers. Because the type I inhibitors lack allosteric asymmetry they cannot activate BRAF by this mechanism (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, e</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>We reasoned that the distinct allosteric coupling of type I and type II inhibitors may be due to the induction of different kinase conformations. Although both type I and II inhibitors are thought to promote the canonical αC-in state, the type II inhibitor ponatinib has been proposed to stabilize an intermediate “αC-center” conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Analysis of x-ray structures of BRAF in complex with several other type II inhibitors in our dataset, including AZ628<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, LY3009120<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and TAK632<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, also suggested induction of intermediate αC-helix conformations, although crystal packing interactions might contribute to the differences (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 12a</bold>). To test whether type I and type II inhibitors induce distinct αC-helix conformations in solution, we performed double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on BRAF by incorporating one nitroxide spin label onto the αC-helix (Q493C) and one onto the αG-helix (Q664C). This labeling arrangement yields shorter spin-spin distances for the αC-in state and longer distances for the αC-out state (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 12b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>). Distance distributions derived from fitting of the DEER data (see Methods) confirmed that all αC-in inhibitors tested induced shorter spin-spin distances relative to apo BRAF, consistent with promotion of the αC-in state. However, the type I inhibitor GDC0879 induced a shorter average spin-spin distance than the type II inhibitors AZ628, LY3009120, and TAK632, which yielded distance distributions that were intermediate between those observed with GDC0879 and with apo BRAF (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 12d</bold>). These data confirm that the different binding modes of type I and type II inhibitors are associated with distinct αC-helix conformations. Since the conformation of the αC-helix is coupled to the N-lobe-to-C-lobe orientation of the kinase, which has been shown to modulate BRAF dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, these differences likely contribute to the distinct allosteric coupling patterns of type I and type II inhibitors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Allosteric asymmetry creates a concentration window for paradoxical activation in cells</title>
<p>A key feature of our allosteric coupling models is that the asymmetry, represented by the α,β values, generates differences in the affinities for the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and second inhibitor <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> molecules. We hypothesized that these differences would dictate the inhibitor concentration ranges at which paradoxical activation occurs in cells. To test this prediction, we assessed RAF-induced MAPK-pathway activation in SK-MEL-2 melanoma cells expressing wild-type BRAF and a gain-of-function variant of N-RAS (Q61R). Inhibitor-induced activation of MAPK signaling by RAF kinases was measured by flow cytometry, using intracellular staining with antibodies specific for phosphorylated (p)MEK1/2 and pERK1/2 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The type II inhibitors in our dataset all induced dose-dependent increases of pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 indicating activation of the MAPK signaling pathway (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 13</bold>)<sup>16,26,29,31,35</sup>. Several predictions from our in vitro allosteric model of paradoxical activation by αC-in RAF inhibitors are indeed reinforced by these experiments. First, many type II inhibitors activate the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway at inhibitor concentrations below 1 nM, consistent with ultrapotent inhibitor binding to the first site on the dimer that arises from the extreme allosteric coupling between this interaction and BRAF dimerization (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 13</bold>). Second, the concentrations at which activation and inhibition occur differ by several orders of magnitude. These broad activation windows are consistent with the allosteric model, which predicts that the most asymmetric type II inhibitors including LY3009120, AZ628, ponatinib and belvarafenib will have the largest activation windows (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> left panel, Supplementary Fig. 13</bold>). Indeed, plotting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> onto the activation curves shows that the allosteric models provide reasonable bounds on the concentration regime in which paradoxical activation is observed in cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 13</bold>).</p>
<p>Because of the symmetric allosteric coupling of the type I inhibitors the predicted affinities for each BRAF dimer subunit are comparable, indicating that there should be almost no activation window for these inhibitors. Nonetheless, we observed MAPK pathway activation by the type I inhibitors GDC0879, SB590885 and L779450 in SK-MEL-2 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> right panel, Supplementary Fig. 13</bold>) across a wide concentration range, as seen with the type II inhibitors. This discrepancy suggests that MAPK activation by type I inhibitors is not mediated by BRAF homodimers but instead by BRAF:CRAF heterodimers. In support of this, activation by GDC0879 depends on the presence of CRAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and both GDC0879 and SB590885 promote BRAF:CRAF heterodimers to a greater extent than the type II inhibitors AZ628 and sorafenib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Furthermore, type I inhibitors are less effective at inhibiting CRAF than type II inhibitors, preventing them from fully inhibiting the BRAF:CRAF heterodimers they induce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We have confirmed by immunoblot that SK-MEL-2 cells express all RAF isoforms at comparable levels, indicating that activation through BRAF:CRAF heterodimers is a plausible model for these inhibitors (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 15</bold>). These observations suggest that type I inhibitors activate by a distinct but related dimer-induction mechanism compared to the type II inhibitors, where differential drug binding to the two dimer subunits is achieved not by allosteric asymmetry but by the drugs having inherently different affinities for the BRAF and CRAF subunits.</p>

<title>The BRAF dimer is not locked in the αC-in state but dynamically samples multiple conformations</title>
<p>To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying asymmetric allosteric coupling, we used <sup>19</sup>F NMR to study the conformational dynamics of the BRAF αC-helix by incorporating a cysteine-reactive trifluoromethyl NMR probe 3-Bromo-1,1,1-trifluoroacetone (BTFA) on the αC-helix (Q493C). Spectra of labeled apo BRAF showed two well-resolved resonances at -84.29 ppm and -84.42 ppm (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). Resonance assignment was achieved by adding saturating concentrations of ATP and AZ628, known to induce αC-out and αC-in states, respectively. From this, the upfield resonance was defined as the αC-out (monomeric) state and the downfield resonance as the αC-in (dimeric) state (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14a</bold>). Increasing the concentration of BRAF led to an increase in the αC-in peak area and a relative decrease in the αC-out peak area that fit to a monomer-dimer equilibrium with a KD of 32.2 ± 9.4 µM, in reasonable agreement with the FRET experiments (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14b</bold>).</p>
<p>Spectral deconvolution of the apo BRAF data revealed an additional resonance underneath the αC-in peak (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). This second αC-in resonance, referred to as “αC-in<sup>broad</sup>”, is substantially exchange-broadened, with a fitted linewidth approximately five times that of the narrower overlapping αC-in resonance, hereafter referred to as “αC-in<sup>narrow</sup>” (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14d</bold>). The presence of the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> state was independently confirmed in transverse relaxation (T<sub>2</sub>) experiments, where the peak intensity of the αC-in resonance was measured as a function of the transverse magnetization evolution time and fit to an exponential decay model (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14e</bold>). A double exponential fit was necessary to adequately describe these data (extra sum-of-squares F-test; p&lt;0.0001), demonstrating the presence of two overlapping species with distinct relaxation times. Spectral deconvolution of these relaxation data produced an estimate of the relaxation times (T<sub>2</sub>) for each peak that were in good agreement with calculated relaxation times (T<sub>2</sub>*) derived from the observed line widths (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). The short relaxation time of the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> resonance (&lt;5 ms) is consistent with chemical exchange arising from the conformational dynamics of the αC-helix.</p>
<p>Four independent observations indicate that the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> resonance arises from a dimeric species: 1) the chemical shift of this species was similar to that of the αC-in<sup>narrow</sup> resonance (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>), 2) spectral deconvolution revealed a concentration dependence for the area of the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> peak that fits to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model closely agreeing with independent measurements (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14b</bold>), 3) the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> resonance was not observed in BRAF samples with dimer-disrupting interface mutations (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14c</bold>), 4) D2O exchange experiments revealed large and nearly identical isotope shifts for the αC-in<sup>narrow</sup> and αC-in<sup>broad</sup> resonances (0.047 versus 0.050 ppm), indicating a similar degree of solvent exposure of the probe, compared to a relatively small shift for the αC-out monomer peak (0.019 ppm) (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14f</bold>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the experimental temperature was raised from 2°C to 34°C, the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> peak width decreased, consistent with faster exchange kinetics arising from increased conformational dynamics (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>,<bold>d</bold>). At the same time, the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> peak area decreased and the αC-in<sup>narrow</sup> peak area increased in a reciprocal manner, indicating a shifting equilibrium between the two dimeric states (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>). The equilibrium constant for this process, derived from the ratio of the integrated areas of the αC-in<sup>broad</sup> and αC-in<sup>narrow</sup> resonances, showed a linear dependence on temperature (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 14g</bold>).</p>
<p>Based on these results, we propose the following model (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref></bold>): The individual subunits of the BRAF dimer transition between two states with strikingly different dynamics. In one state, the subunit is locked in the αC-in conformation, with the αC-helix relatively static (αC-in<sup>narrow</sup>). In the other, more dynamic state, the αC-helix undergoes transitions between conformational substates (αC-in<sup>broad</sup>). Although our results do not define exactly how the two subunits of the dimer sample these different states, the dynamic αC-in state is populated under all experimental conditions. This indicates that BRAF dimers are not constrained in a symmetrical αC-in/αC-in configuration, as structural models suggest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, but rather that one subunit is free to explore other conformations. This explains how the binding of a single type II inhibitor molecule, which pays the energetic penalty for locking one BRAF subunit in the αC-in state, can dramatically increase BRAF dimerization, since the BRAF dimer only requires one and not both subunits to adopt the locked αC-in conformation. Equivalently, compared to the affinity for BRAF monomers, the drug affinity for dimers is greatly enhanced for one subunit and not for both because dimer formation only pays the energetic penalty of locking one subunit in the αC-in state. Thus, the dynamic heterogeneity of the BRAF dimer revealed by NMR may form the foundation for the asymmetric allosteric coupling that gives rise to paradoxical activation of BRAF by type II inhibitors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The FDA-approved αC-out RAF inhibitors and the newer αC-in RAF inhibitors currently under development represent fundamentally different classes of drug that have opposite effects on RAF conformation and dimerization. Nonetheless, both drug classes trigger paradoxical activation of BRAF. Activation by the αC-out inhibitors is attributed in part to negative allostery, where dimer-disrupting allosteric effects prevent full occupancy of intact dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. This model of negative allostery does not provide an adequate explanation for paradoxical activation by αC-in inhibitors, which are positively coupled to dimerization and have been thought to bind both subunits of the dimer with equal potency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we use a series of spectroscopic approaches paired with thermodynamic modeling and global fitting to quantify how inhibitor binding to each subunit of the BRAF dimer is coupled to BRAF dimerization. By explicitly separating inhibitor-induced dimerization into two steps, the allosteric effects from the binding of each inhibitor molecule, along with their respective binding affinities for each BRAF dimer subunit, are resolved. This analysis confirms that, unlike the dimerdisrupting αC-out inhibitors, the αC-in inhibitors dramatically increase BRAF dimerization affinity. Remarkably, for type II inhibitors this favorable allostery is not evenly distributed between both binding sites of the dimer, as previously proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and instead occurs through an asymmetric coupling mechanism in which the binding of the first inhibitor molecule promotes dimerization much more strongly than binding of the second inhibitor molecule. This allosteric coupling also causes these inhibitors to have higher affinity for the first subunit of the dimer than for the second subunit. We demonstrate that this allosteric asymmetry triggers selective induction of BRAF dimers with only one subunit bound to inhibitor, with larger degrees of asymmetry leading to greater induction of these partially occupied dimers.</p>
<p>By combining our allosteric models of inhibitor-induced dimer induction with measurements of BRAF catalytic activity, we show that partially occupied BRAF dimers possess activity equivalent to fully activated inhibitor-free BRAF dimers, explaining their potent activating potential. Indeed, the degree of induction of partially occupied dimers fully accounts for both the concentration dependence and amplitude of BRAF activation measured in vitro for 11 different αC-in inhibitors. These results form the basis of a quantitative model for paradoxical activation of BRAF homodimers by αC-in inhibitors, where the apparent symmetry afforded by a dimer composed of identical subunits can be broken by asymmetric allosteric coupling between inhibitor binding and dimerization. The predictions of this model for the type II inhibitors are borne out in melanoma cells where the difference in affinities of the first and second inhibitor molecules for the dimer, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, equivalent to the allosteric asymmetry α/β, is reflected in a wide concentration gap between where MAPK activation and inhibition are observed.</p>
<p>Comparing our mechanistic biophysical data with activation patterns observed in cells allowed us to uncover a key distinction between type I and type II inhibitors. While type II inhibitors are asymmetrically coupled and strongly activate BRAF homodimers, type I inhibitors lack sufficient allosteric coupling asymmetry to induce paradoxical activation through this mechanism. We demonstrate, however, that type I inhibitors induce MAPK pathway activation in melanoma cells, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. These observations point to type I inhibitors inducing paradoxical activation through BRAF:CRAF heterodimers, rather than BRAF homodimers, a hypothesis that is consistent with a large body of published work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Because type I inhibitors bind less tightly to CRAF than BRAF, the subunits of a heterodimer will have inherently different drug affinities, providing a window for paradoxical activation in the absence of allosteric asymmetry. Such a mechanism potentially applies to any dimer-promoting inhibitor with differing affinities for ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF, and would be expected to supplement asymmetry arising from the allosteric coupling mechanism we have uncovered. In particular, the emergence of clinical resistance to belvarafenib and another type II inhibitor, naporafenib, can be mediated by induction of ARAF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Since both belvarafenib and naporafenib bind ARAF less potently than BRAF, the disparity in drug affinities for the first and second subunits of ARAF/BRAF heterodimers is likely further boosted over that arising from asymmetric allosteric coupling alone, sustaining activation at higher drug concentrations and conferring resistance.</p>
<p>Exactly why type II inhibitors are more asymmetrically coupled to BRAF dimerization than type I inhibitors is not entirely clear. It is established that the conformational changes of the αC-helix induced by αC-in inhibitors also alter the relative orientations of the N-lobe and C-lobe of the kinase, improving the surface complementarity at the dimer interface and enhancing dimerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We show that type I and type II inhibitors stabilize distinct αC-helix conformations in solution.</p>
<p>In addition, type II inhibitors trigger a structural change of the catalytic DFG motif and activation loop of BRAF that is not accomplished by type I inhibitors. It is likely that these collective differences unlock the allosteric coupling asymmetry that defines the activating potential of type II inhibitors, but additional biophysical characterization is needed to confirm this.</p>
<p>Our data reveal that the subunits of the BRAF dimer are not symmetrically locked in the αC-in state, as suggested by static structural models, but rather exist in an equilibrium between a rigid αC-in state and a dynamic state in which the αC-helix conformation fluctuates on the µs-ms timescale. We interpret this as an indication that the BRAF dimer requires only one subunit to adopt the αC-in state, providing a straightforward explanation for why the binding of only one αC-in inhibitor molecule can dramatically increase dimerization affinity. The recent cryo-EM structure of dimeric BRAF in complex with the scaffolding protein 14-3-3, determined in the absence of inhibitors, shows an asymmetric arrangement of the BRAF dimer with respect to 14-3-3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. This arrangement permits the C-terminal tail of one subunit to bind to and block the active site of the opposite subunit, while the reciprocal interaction is prevented. This further underscores the nonequivalence of the two subunits of the BRAF dimer and suggests that the dynamic asymmetry we observed in our NMR experiments may be an indication of broader functional asymmetry in BRAF signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider the preclinical and clinical experience with type II RAF inhibitors in light of our results. Several type II inhibitors studied here including belvarafenib (NCT04835805) and LY3009120 (NCT02014116) have entered clinical trials or could be repurposed like the FDA-approved chronic myeloid leukemia drug ponatinib. It is claimed that these molecules show minimal paradoxical activation compared to vemurafenib<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. However, paradoxical activation by these type II inhibitors has been observed in cell lines both with and without elevated RAS activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and demonstrated to trigger expression of ERK target genes and increased cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. We along with others show that ponatinib can activate ERK in RAS-mutant cells at concentrations as low as 1 nM, and that this activation is only suppressed at concentrations above 1 µM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, higher than the plasma level achievable in patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Similarly, while belvarafenib has shown promising activity in preclinical and clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, it increases MAPK signaling over a concentration range similar to other type II inhibitors like LY3009120, which has shown an unexpected lack of clinical efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> despite favorable preclinical results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Ultimately, whether paradoxical activation contributes to clinical outcomes for a particular inhibitor may depend on where the achievable dose lies with respect to the activation and inhibition sides of the paradoxical activation curves.</p>

<title>FRET experiments tracking BRAF dimerization</title>
<p>We used the K547C site on the αD/αE-loop of BRAF to incorporate FRET dyes (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1a</bold>). BRAF FRET samples were prepared by covalently labeling two separate pools of BRAF at 25 μM on K547C with either donor (Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide, Thermo Fisher) or acceptor (Alexa Fluor 568 C5 maleimide, Thermo Fisher) at 0.8:1 molar ratio of fluorophore to protein, on ice. Labeling reactions were quenched at 1 hr with 1 mM DTT. Stopped-flow fluorescence anisotropy experiments showed that the labeling kinetics of BRAF<sup>K547C</sup> were approximately two orders of magnitude faster than those of BRAF (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 1b</bold>), indicating that the K547C site can be selectively labeled without removing endogenous cysteines (C532, C685, C696). Mass spectrometry was used to confirm that only one cysteine was labeled with only one donor or acceptor fluorophore (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 17a</bold>). Donor-labeled and acceptor-labeled BRAF were then mixed at equal molar ratios and diluted into FRET buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 2% DMSO). BRAF FRET sensor (49 μL) was then added to 384-well inhibitor titration plates containing 1 μL of inhibitor in DMSO prepared using a mosquito liquid handling robot (ttp Labtech) and incubated at room temperature for 90 min to ensure the reactions were at equilibrium. Dimerization experiments consisted of inhibitor titrations containing 12 concentrations including a DMSO-only control. Experiments for each inhibitor were done in duplicate at six different BRAF concentrations. Fluorescence data were recorded with a custom-built fluorescence plate reader<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> (Fluorescence Innovations) and contributions from the donor and acceptor fluorescence emission intensities (FRET A/D) were quantified by spectral unmixing using three basis functions for AF488 emission, AF568 emission, and Raman scattering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>

The equilibrium dissociation constants were allowed to float in global fitting by locking the association rate constant to an arbitrarily high value beyond the diffusion limit (k1 = 1000 nM<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) and allowing k-1 to vary as described in the KinTek Explorer manual. The dimerization affinity of apo BRAF (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><sup><italic>dimer</italic></sup>) was determined to be 62.4 ± 2.9 µM in separate experiments using high concentrations of BRAF to maximize the dimerization signal (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2</bold>). This value was then used to constrain <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub><sup><italic>dimer</italic></sup> in the fitting of other datasets, allowing lower concentrations of BRAF to be used. For BRAF concentrations above 2 µM an additional linear scale factor accounting for the secondary inner filter effect was required to fit the data. In the initial round of global fitting, the BRAF concentrations in the model, [BRAF]1-6, were locked to their experimentally determined values. This fitting procedure yielded strongly asymmetric allosteric models for the type II inhibitors, and more symmetric models for the type I inhibitors. All parameters were constrained in these fits as determined by one-dimensional error surface analysis using chi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> thresholds calculated as previously described (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Two-dimensional error surface analysis further confirmed that the pairs of equilibrium constants from which the α and β values are derived (e.g. <italic>K</italic> <sup><italic>dimer</italic></sup> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="536450v2_inline15b.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> are well constrained with respect to one another (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 4c</bold>). To investigate the effects of errors in protein concentration, a second round of global fitting was performed in which the [BRAF]1-6 values were included as floating parameters in the fit, and one- and twodimensional error surfaces used to confirm that the fits remained constrained despite the increased number of parameters (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 2</bold> and <bold>Supplementary Fig. 4d</bold>). For a subset of type II datasets, this procedure led to the appearance of double minima in the error surfaces, with one minimum corresponding to a highly asymmetric model and the other to a more symmetric model (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 16</bold>). To verify that the asymmetric models correspond to the correct solution, as indicated by the first round of fitting, inhibitor-induced BBD induction was simulated using the parameter values associated with both alternative models (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 16b</bold>) and compared to independently measured inhibitor-induced kinase activity (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 16c</bold>) to calculate a putative turnover number for the BBD dimer for each model solution (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 16d</bold>). Comparison with the catalytic turnover reported for 14-3-3-bound BRAF dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup> (<bold>Supplementary Fig. 16d</bold>) showed that the asymmetric models were consistent with these published data (slightly lower activity than fully active BRAF dimers consistent with partial inhibition), whereas the symmetric models would require unrealistically high kinase activity for the BBD dimer (5-fold higher activity than fully active BRAF dimers despite partial inhibition). The results reported in the manuscript correspond to the values from the second round of global fitting.</p>

The time dependence of the component amplitudes is shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>.</p>

<title>Mass spectrometry analysis of commercial kinase inhibitors</title>
<p>Commercially available RAF kinase inhibitors were purchased from Selleckchem and TargetMol. High resolution mass spectrometry data were collected on a Bruker BioTOF II instrument with an infusion electrospray ionizer. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 mM. Stocks were diluted 100x with MeOH and injected at a rate of 10 µL/min. Mass spectrometry was run and analyzed in positive-ion mode with either a PEG 600 or PEG 400 internal standard. Data were analyzed using Bruker Data Analysis Software.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript uses FRET, 19F-NMR, and DEER/EPR solution measurements to examine the allosteric effects of a panel of BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi). These include first-generation aC-out BRAFi, and more recent Type I and Type II aC-in inhibitors. Intermolecular FRET measurements quantify Kd for BRAF dimerization and inhibitor binding to the first and second subunits. Distinct patterns are found between aC-in BRAFi, where Type I BRAFi binds equally well to the first and second subunits within dimeric BRAF. In contrast, Type II BRAFi shows stronger affinity for the first subunit and weaker affinity for the second subunit, an effect named &quot;allosteric asymmetry&quot;. Allosteric asymmetry has the potential for Type II inhibitors to promote dimerization while favoring occupancy of only one subunit (BBD form), leading to the enrichment of an active dimer.</p>
<p>Measurements of in vitro BRAF kinase activity correlate amazingly well with the calculated amounts of the half-site-inhibited BBD forms with Type II inhibitors. This suggests that the allosteric asymmetry mechanism explains paradoxical activation by this class of inhibitors. DEER/EPR measurements further examine the positioning of helix aC. They show systematic outward movement of aC with Type II inhibitors, relative to the aC-in state with Type I inhibitors, and further show that helix aC adopts multiple states and is therefore dynamic in apo BRAF. This makes a strong case that negative cooperativity between sites in the BRAF dimer can account for paradoxical kinase activation by Type II inhibitors by creating a half-site-occupied homodimer, BBD. In contrast, Type I inhibitors and aC-out inhibitors do not fit this model, and are therefore proposed to be explained by previously proposed models involving negative allostery between subunits in BRAF-CRAF heterodimers, RAS priming, and transactivation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study integrates orthogonal spectroscopic and kinetic strategies to characterize BRAF dynamics and determine how it impacts inhibitor allostery. The unique combination of approaches presented in this study represents a road map for future work in the important area of protein kinase dynamics. The work represents a worthy contribution not only to the field of BRAF regulation but to protein kinases in general.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some questions remain regarding the proposed model for Type II inhibitors and its comparison to Type I and aC-out inhibitors that would be useful to clarify. Specifically, it would be helpful to address whether the activation of BRAF by Type II inhibitors, while strongly correlated with BBD model predictions in vitro, also depends on CRAF via BRAF-CRAF in cells and therefore overlaps with the mechanisms of paradoxical activation by Type I and aC-out inhibitors.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. We note that both reviews are strongly supportive with comments including, “a biophysical tour de force” (rev #1), “the study is exemplary” (rev #2), and “represents a roadmap for future work” (rev #2). Below we respond to each reviewer comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1</bold></p>
<p>This study provides a detailed and quantitative description of the allosteric mechanisms resulting in the paradoxical activation of BRAF kinase dimers by certain kinase inhibitors. The findings provide a much needed quantiative basis for this phenomenon and may lay the foundation for future drug development efforts aimed at the important cancer target BRAF. The study builds on very evidence obtained by multiple independent biophysical methods.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors quantitatively describe the complex binding equilibria of BRAF and its inhibitors resulting in some cases in the paradoxical activation of BRAF dimer when bound to ATP competitive inhibitors. The authors use a biophysical tour de force involving FRET binding assays, NMR, kinase activity assays and DEER spectroscopy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are gratified by the reviewer’s supportive summary.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the study are the beautifully conducted assays that allow for a thorough characterization of the allostery in this complex system. Additionally, the use of F-NMR and DEER spectroscopy provide important insights into the details of the process.
The resulting model for binding of inhibitors and dimerization (Fig.4) is very helpful.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This is a complex system and its communication is inherently challenging. It might be of interest to the broader readership to understand the implications of the model for drug development and therapy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a complicated system. With regard to inhibitor development, a key insight is that designing aC-in state inhibitors that avoid paradoxical activation may be non-trivial because these molecules not only induce dimers but also tend to bind the second dimer subunit more weakly than the first, due to allosteric asymmetry and/or inherently different affinities for each RAF isoform. We feel the full implications for future therapeutic development are an extensive topic that is beyond the scope of our work, which is focused on the properties of current inhibitors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Recommendations for the author:</p>
<p>The experimental work, analysis and resulting model are excellent. I had some difficulty following the complex model in some instances and it may be useful to review the description of the model and see whether it can be made more palatable to the broader readership.
I think it would be useful to discuss the model presented in reference 40 (Kholodenko) and to compare it to the presented model here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We regret any confusion with regards to the nature of the model. Our analysis was built upon the model developed by Boris Kholodenko as reported in his 2015 Cell Reports paper. This formed the theoretical framework that combined with our experimental data allowed us to parameterize this model to obtain experimental values for the equilibrium constants and allosteric coupling factors.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript combines elegant biophysical solution measurements to address paradoxical kinase activation by Type II BRAF inhibitors. The novel findings challenge prevailing models, through experiments that are rigorous and carefully controlled. The study is exemplary in the breadth of strategies it uses to address protein kinase dynamics and inhibitor allostery.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that this is a worthy question to be pursued. However, given the substantial experimental effort required for such an endeavor, and the highly supportive nature of the reviewer comments, including that “This is a strong manuscript that I feel is well above the bar for publication”, we believe this effort is more appropriate for a future study.</p>

<p>This is a strong manuscript that I feel is well above the bar for publication. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the authors consider addressing the following points in order to support their major conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) Fig 3D shows similar effects of Type II and Type I inhibitors in the biphasic increase of cellular pMEK/pERK. From this, the authors argue that Type II inhibitors are explained by negative allostery in the BRAF homodimer (based on Fig 2E), while Type I inhibitors are not. But it seems possible that despite the terrific correlation between BBD and BRAF kinase activities measured in vitro, CRAF is still important to explain pathway activation in cells. It also seems conceivable that the calculated %BBD between different Type II inhibitors may not correlate as well with their effects on pathway activation in cells. These possibilities should be addressed.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that it is likely that CRAF contributes to paradoxical activation by type II inhibitors in cells. It is also likely that other cellular factors such as RAS-priming and membrane recruitment play a role in activation. However, we note that for the type II inhibitors there is good agreement between the biophysical predictions and the concentration regimes in which activation is observed in cells, suggesting that these predictions are capturing a key part of the activation process that occurs in cells.</p>

<p>(2) In Fig 2A, is it possible to report the activity of dimeric BRAF-WT in the absence of inhibitor? This would help confirm that the maximal activity measured after titrating inhibitor is indeed consistent with the predicted %BBD population, which would be expected to have half of the specific activity of BB.</p>

<p>In principle, it is possible to determine the catalytic activity of apo dimers (BB) by combining our model predictions for the concentration of BB dimers and our activity measurements. However, because the activity assays are performed at nanomolar kinase concentrations, whereas the baseline dimerization affinity of BRAF is in the micromolar range, the observed activity of apo BRAF arises from a small subpopulation of dimers (on the order of 4 percent under the conditions of our experiments) and is therefore difficult to define accurately. As a result, we deemed it more suitable to compare our results to published activity measurements derived from 14-3-3-activated dimers which should represent fully dimerized BRAF. This analysis, as reported in Figure 2E, suggests that the BBD activity is approximately half of that of BB.</p>

<p>(3) The 19F-NMR experiments make a good case for broadening of the helix aC signal in the BRAF dimer. From this, the study proposes that after inhibitor binds one subunit, the second unoccupied subunit retains dynamics. It would be useful to address this experimentally, if possible. For example, can the 19F-NMR signal be measured in the presence of inhibitor, to support the prediction that the unoccupied subunit is indeed dynamic and samples multiple conformations as in apo BRAF?</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to determine the dynamic response of BRAF to inhibitor binding. However, this is a challenging undertaking due to the biochemical heterogeneity that occurs at sub saturating inhibitor concentrations. For example, at any given inhibitor concentration, BRAF exists as a mixture of monomers, apo dimers, dimers with one inhibitor molecule, and dimers with two inhibitor molecules bound. This makes it challenging to relate the 19F NMR signal to a single biochemical state. Addressing this would require a substantial experimental effort that we feel is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
