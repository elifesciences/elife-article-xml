<title>Abstract</title><p>The prevailing opinion emphasizes fronto-parietal network (FPN) is key in mediating general fluid intelligence (gF). Meanwhile, recent studies show that human MT complex (hMT+), located at the occipito-temporal border and involved in 3D perception processing, also plays a key role in gF. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear, yet. To investigate this issue, our study targets visuo-spatial intelligence, which is considered to have high loading on gF. We use ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure GABA/glutamate concentrations in hMT+ combining resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC), behavioral examinations including hMT+ perception suppression test and gF subtest in visuo- spatial component. Our findings show that both GABA in hMT+ and frontal-hMT+ functional connectivity significantly correlate with the performance of visuo-spatial intelligence. Further, serial mediation model demonstrates that the effect of hMT+ GABA on visuo-spatial <italic>g</italic>F is fully mediated by the hMT+ frontal FC. Together our findings highlight the importance in integrating sensory and frontal cortices in mediating the visuospatial component of general fluid intelligence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>General fluid intelligence (gF) is a current problem-solving ability, which shows high inter-individual differences in humans(Cattell &amp; Raymond, 1963). At the beginning of the last century, Spearman(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Spearman, 1904</xref>) proposed that some general or g factor contributes to our gF. One key component of gF is visuo-spatial intelligence, usually tested by visual materials, shows high g-loading(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Colom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jung &amp; Haier, 2007</xref>). The exact neural mechanisms of the interplay of visuo spatial intelligence with gF remain yet unclear, though.</p>
<p>Theâneuro-efficiencyâ hypothesis is one explanation for individual differences in gF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Haier et al., 1988</xref>). This hypothesis puts forward that the human brainâs ability to suppress irrelevant information leads to more efficient cognitive processing. Correspondingly, using a well-known visual motion paradigm (center-surround antagonism)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>), Melnick et al found a strong link between suppression index (SI) of motion perception and the scores of the block design test (BDT, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), which measures the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>). Motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of human extrastriate cortical region, middle temporal complex (hMT+), aligns closely with this regionâs activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gautama &amp; Van Hulle, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, hMT+ is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cumming &amp; DeAngelis, 2001</xref>). These findings suggest that hMT+ potentially plays a significant role in 3D visuo-spatial gF by facilitating the efficient processing of 3D visual information and suppressing irrelevant information. However, more evidence is needed to uncover how the hMT+ functions as a core region for 3D visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>
<p>Frontal cortex is usually recognized as the cognitive core region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gray et al., 2003</xref>). Strong connectivity between the cognitive regions suggests a mechanism for large-scale information exchange and integration in the brain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barbey, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Cole et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the potential conjunctive coding may overlap with the inhibition and/or excitation mechanism of hMT+. Taken together, we hypothesized that 3D visuo-spatial intelligence (as measured by BDT) might be predicted by the inhibitory and/or excitation mechanisms in hMT+ and the integrative functions connecting hMT+ with frontal cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Hypothesis and experimental design. (<bold>a)</bold> Schematic of hypothesis. The inhibition mechanism centered on MT+ GABA, including the molecular level: the GABAergic inhibition in MT+ (green circle), brain connectivity level: hMT+ - frontal functional connectivity (blue circle), and behavior level: hMT+ specific surround suppression of visual motion ( red circle), contributes to the visuo-spatial component of gF (3D domain, yellow circle). (<bold>b)</bold> Schematic of experimental design. Session 1 (rectangle box of short line) was the functional MRI and MRS scanning at resting state. Session 2 (rectangle box of solid line) was another region of MRS acquisition. In the two sessions, the order of MRS scanning regions (hMT+ and EVC (primarily in V1)) was counter balanced across participants. There was a structure MRI scanning before each MRS data acquisition. The interval between the two sessions was used for behavioral measurement (rectangle box of dotted line): block design task (BDT) and psychophysical task - motion discrimination.

<p>To investigate our hypothesis, this work conducted multi-level examination including biochemical (Glutamatergic - GABAergic in hMT+), regional-systemic (brain connectivity with hMT+ - based), and behavioral (visual motion function in hMT+) levels to reveal if hMT+ contributes to the 3D visuo-spatial component of gF. We employ ultra-high field (7T) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology to reliably resolve GABA and Glu concentrations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ende, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Song et al., 2021</xref>). To verify the specificity of hMT+, we used early visual cortex (EVC, primarily in V1) - based GABA/Glu as control as it mediates the 2D rather than 3D visual domain(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cumming &amp; DeAngelis, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings first demonstrate that GABAergic inhibition mechanisms (but not excitatory Glu) in hMT+ region relate to 3D visuo-spatial ability. Further, analysis of functional brain connectivity at rest reveals that the network (between MT+ and frontal cortex) relating to MT+ GABA and perceptual suppression contribute the visuo-spatial intelligence. Our results provide direct evidence that inhibitory mechanisms centered on GABA levels in MT+ region (a sensory cortex) mediate multi-level visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF thus drawing a direct connection of biochemistry, brain connectivity, and behavior.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To determine whether the function of hMT+ cortex contributes to visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF, we adopted the experimental design depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>. Thirty-six healthy subjects participated in this study. Participants underwent two MRI sessions: the first encompassing resting-state fMRI and magnetic resonance spectra (MRS), and the second solely involving MRS. A 30-minute interval separated these sessions, during which participants performed motion discrimination tasks (using center-surround antagonism stimuli)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>) and the block design test (BDT), which assesses the visuo-spatial ability (3D domain) of gF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>). In the motion discrimination tasks, a grating of either large or small size was randomly presented at the center of the screen. The grating drifted either leftward or rightward, and participants were asked to judge the perceived moving direction. While in the Block design test, participants were asked to rebuild the figural pattern within a specified time limit using a set of red and white blocks. Both the volume-of-interests (VOIs) of MRS scanning in the left hMT+ (targeted brain area) and the left EVC (primarily in V1, control brain area) had dimensions of 2Ã2Ã2 cm<sup>3</sup>, and the MRS scanning sequences were randomized across the two sessions. The hMT+ MRS VOIs were demarcated using an anatomical landmark(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>). For 14 subjects, we also utilized fMRI to functionally pinpoint the hMT+ to validate the placement of the VOI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>, b). The EVC (primarily in V1) MRS VOIs (figure supplement 1) were anatomically defined (Methods). Here, MRS data after extensive quality control (31/36 in hMT+, and 28/36 in EVC (primarily in V1)) were taken for further analysis (Methods).</p>

<title>GABA and Glu concentrations in hMT+ and EVC (primarily in V1) and their relation to SI and BDT</title>
<p>An example of a MRS voxel located in hMT+ is shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>. LCModel fittings for GABA spectra from all subjects in hMT+ (<italic>n</italic> = 31) and EVC (primarily in V1) (<italic>n</italic> = 28) are illustrated in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> (color scale presents the BDT scores). We discerned a significant association between the inter-subjectsâ BDT scores and the GABA levels in hMT+ voxels, but not in EVC (primarily in V1) voxels. Quantitative analysis displayed that BDT significantly correlates with GABA concentrations in hMT+ voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.39, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). After using partial correlation to control for the effect of age, the relationship remains significant (<italic>r</italic>partial = 0.426 <italic>P</italic> = 0.02, 1 participant excluded due to the age greater than mean + 2.5SD) In contrast, there was no obvious correlation between BDT and GABA levels in EVC (primarily in V1) voxels (figure supplement 2a). We show that SI significantly correlates with GABA levels in hMT+ voxels (<italic>r</italic> = 0.44, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 31, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref>). In contrast, no significant correlation between SI and GABA concentrations in EVC (primarily in V1) voxels was observed (figure supplement 2b). This finding is in line with prior results, which indicates that motion perception is associated with neural activity in hMT+ area, but not in EVC (primarily in V1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>).

<p>To address the question whether spatial suppression plays a role, we correlated hMT+ - based global FCs with SI. Though spatial suppression during motion perception (quantified by SI) is considered to be the function of area hMT+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gautama &amp; Van Hulle, 2001</xref>), the top-down modulation from the frontal cortex can increase surround suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Our functional connectivity-SI analysis in the frontal regions (a priori search space) displayed 3 brain regions in which FCs strength significantly correlated with SI: right BA4/6, left BA6, and right BA46 (summarized in Table supplement 2, and shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). Across the whole brain search, we identified total 7 brain regions in which FCs strength significantly correlated with SI, and 3 of these were in the frontal cortex. This is consistent with the results obtained by the functional connectivity-SI analysis in a priori search space (frontal cortex) (Table supplement 3 and figure supplement 6b).</p>
<p>We also did the V1 functional connectivity-BDT correlations as control analysis (figure supplement 7). Only positive correlations in the frontal area were detected, suggesting that in the 3D visuo-spatial intelligence task, V1 plays a role in feedforward information processing. However, hMT+, which showed specific negative correlations in the frontal, be suggested involving in the inhibition mechanism. These results further emphasize the de-redundancy function of hMT+ in 3D visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>

<title>Local hMT+ GABA acts on SI and BDT via global hMT-frontal connectivity</title>
<p>To determine whether local neurotransmitter levels (such as GABA and Glu) in the hMT+ region mediate the broader 3D visuo-spatial ability of BDT, which as a component of gF, is linked to the frontal cortex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>), we correlated the significant FCs of hMT â frontal in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref> (also shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with the GABA and Glu levels in hMT+ region.

<p>Taken together, our results displayed that the overlap FCs from the analyses of connectivity - behavior (BDT and SI) -GABA are the hMT+ - BA 46 and hMT+ - BA 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b). These results suggest that the coupling of FCs of hMT+ - frontal regions (BA 46 and BA 6) coupling with local hMT+ GABA provides the neural basis for both the simple motion perception (quantified by SI) and the complex 3D visuo- spatial ability (quantified by BDT).</p>
<p>In order to fully investigate the potential roles of the multiples variables contributing to BDT scores, serial mediation analyses(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hayes, 2013</xref>) were applied to both the MR and behavioral data. Following our hypothesis, the independent variable (X) is hMT+ GABA, the dependent variable (Y) is BDT scores, the covariate is the age, and the mediators are FC (M1) and SI (M2). We used the overlap clusters from the analyses of connectivity-BDT-GABA and connectivity-SI-GABA to compute the FC of hMT+ - BA46, 1 participant was excluded due to his age greater than mean + 2.5SD. The serial mediation model is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>. GABA levels in hMT+ significantly negatively correlated with the FC of hMT+ - BA46 (Î² = - 0.32, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0009), which in turn significantly negatively correlated with SI (Î² = - 0.19, <italic>P</italic> = 0.035), and consequently, significantly positively correlated with BDT (Î² = 38.5, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009). Critically, bootstrapped analyses revealed that our hypothesized indirect effect (i.e., hMT+ GABA â FC of hMT+ - BA46 â SI â BDT) was significant (Î² = 2.28, SE = 1.54, 95% CI = [0.03, 5.94]). The model accounted for 34% of the variance in BDT. However, when considering the hMT-BA6 FC as the mediator M1, the serial model does not show a significant indirect effect. Consequently, we explored a mediation model, which revealed that the hMT-BA6 FC totally mediates the relationship between GABA and BDS. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5d</xref>). For sensitivity purposes, we tested the alternative models, in which the order of the mediators was reversed. The pathway that hMT+ GABA was predicted to be associated with SI, followed by the FC of hMT+ - BA 46, and then BDT, did not yield the chained mediation effects on BDT (figure supplement 8).</p>
<p>To summarize (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), the results from the serial mediation analyses are consistent with our hypothesis. That is, higher GABAergic inhibition in hMT+ relates to stronger negative FC between hMT+ and BA46, leading to enhanced ability for surround suppression (filtering out irrelevant information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin, 2015</xref>), which ultimately resulting in more efficient visual 3D processing as key component of gF (the higher BDT scores).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we provide evidence that hMT+ inhibitory mechanisms mediate processing in the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF on multiple levels, that is, from molecular over brain connectivity to behavior. First, this study found that higher hMT+ inhibitory GABA levels (but not excitatory Glu) relate to FC between hMT+ and BA 46 that contribute to both SI and BDT. Our serial mediation analyses indicate that the inhibitory mechanisms related to hMT+ and its GABA levels in hMT+ (but not Glu), FCs of hMT+ - BA46 coupling with hMT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu), and behavior (SI indexing perceptual suppression in hMT+) predict the inter-subject variance in the 3D gF task (BDT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>). Second, we demonstrate discrete GABAergic inhibition mechanisms in hMT+ that mediate the strong FCs between hMT+ - frontal regions (BA46 and BA6): significant negative correlation with the FC of hMT+ - BA 46 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), whereas there is significant positive correlation with the FC of hMT+ - BA 6 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). This indicates that different frontal regions, DLPFC (BA 46) and premotor cortex (BA6), contribute uniquely to gF through hMT+ - based inhibitory mechanisms.</p>
<p>The goal of our research is to reveal that the inhibitory (not excitatory) mechanism in hMT+ contributes to multi-level processing in 3D visuo-spatial ability (BDT). Monkey electrophysiological experiments revealed that selective attention gates the visual cortex, including area MT, effectively suppressing the irrelevant information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Everling et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Treue &amp; Maunsell, 1996</xref>). These findings align with the âneural efficiencyâ hypothesis of intelligence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Haier et al., 1988</xref>), which puts forward the human brainâs ability to suppress the repetition of information. Neural suppression is associated with the balance between excitation and inhibition (EIB), usually represented by covariation between Glutamate and GABA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>). Here, this study exploited the high spectral resolution afforded by ultrahigh field (7T) MRS to reliably resolve GABA measurement, to adequately discriminate the glutamate and glutamine signals, and to resolve the high accuracy Glu measurement(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ende, 2015</xref>). This work implemented the MRS scanning in hMT+ (3D visual domain) and EVC (primarily in V1) (2D visual domain) regions and found that hMT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu) significantly correlated with BDT, i.e., the higher GABA levels in hMT+ (rather than excitatory Glu) relate to higher visual 3D processing (BDT) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref>). Basically, this study contains the data of SI, BDT, GABA in MT+ and EVC (primarily in V1), Glu in MT+ and EVC (primarily in V1)-all 6 measurements. we made a correlation matrix to reporting all values in figure supplementary 9.</p>
<p>We searched the global hMT+ - based FCs with the connectivity-BDT analyses (in priori search space and whole brain search to valid), and then, correlated these significant FCs with the GABA and Glu concentrations in hMT+. We found two FCs (hMT+ - BA46 and hMT+ - BA6) significantly correlating with hMT+ inhibitory GABA (whereas no FC significantly correlated with hMT+ excitatory Glu). Accordingly, our results emphasize the importance of hMT+ inhibitory GABA (but not excitatory Glu) in processing the 3D visual-spatial intelligence (BDT).</p>
<p>Our recent human study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Song et al., 2021</xref>) and other studyâs animal experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ozeki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sato et al., 2016</xref>) demonstrated that the conjoint action of inhibition (GABA) and excitation (Glu) underlies visual spatial suppression. In this work, our novel data show the chained mediation effects from local hMT+ GABA to more global BDT: hMT+ GABA â FC (hMT+ and BA46) â SI â BDT. Thereby, our data indicate that inhibitory mechanisms in hMT+, from the biochemical level of GABA over FC to the behavioral level, can predict the inter-subject variance in the 3D gF task (BDT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c</xref>).</p>
<p>Another interesting finding reveal that GABAergic inhibition in hMT+ coupling with distinct functional connectivity patterns between BA 46-hMT+ and BA6-hMT+. A previous human fMRI experiment found that the positive and negative correlations between BDT and the activation of frontal regions appeared at different reasoning phases (validation or integration phases during reasoning)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fangmeier et al., 2006</xref>). On the one hand, a monkey electrophysiological experiment reported the delayed modulation from PFC (especially in DLPFC (BA 46))) to area MT during a visual motion task(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zaksas &amp; Pasternak, 2006</xref>). Computational models converged with empirical data of awake monkey experiments slowing temporal modulation from PFC to MT/MST(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, human MEG studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Donner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wilming et al., 2020</xref>) reported that the gamma-band activity in the visual cortex (including area MT) exhibited high coherence with the activity in (pre-) motor regions (BA 4/6). These results suggest that the relation of long-range FC and local inhibitory mechanism (hMT+ GABA) support our findings that inhibition in hMT+ contributes to efficient long-range integration and coordination in distant brain areas like the prefrontal and premotor cortex.</p>
<p>How does hMT+ assemble into the MD system as an intellectual hub rather than a simple input module? The results in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b showed that the overlap brain regions from the analyses of connectivity-BDT-GABA/connectivity-SI-GABA are the hMT+ - BA 46. This overlap couples with local visual suppression (SI) and consequently plays an important role in intelligence (BDT). The direction discrimination task in this work (the visual motion paradigm of center-surround antagonism) was previously considered a mainly local function of hMT+(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>). However, our results with connectivity-SI analyses revealed that both local (FC within BA 18) and global brain connectivity (FC between hMT+ and frontal regions) contribute to SI (Table supplement 3). In human psychophysical experiments(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>) the brief stimulus duration (â¼100 ms) in motion discrimination precludes most top-down attentional effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zaksas &amp; Pasternak, 2006</xref>), while, attention, which predicted the performance of the motion discrimination task, was sustained throughout the stimulus intervals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Siegel et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, animal experiments have revealed that the local circuits in the visual cortex combining with top-down modulation and intracortical horizontal connection mediate the visual-spatial suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Angelucci et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Keller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results (shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b, right) present the intrinsic binding of local GABAergic inhibition in hMT+, which suppressing redundancy of visual motion processing (SI), and the activity of brain connectivity between hMT+ and frontal regions. These individually inherent traits may contribute to the individual difference in 3D visuo-spatial ability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>, b, left). A candidate divisive normalization model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carandini &amp; Heeger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Reynolds &amp; Heeger, 2009</xref>) can explain how such reverberation affects the process of suppressing the irrelevant information, from perception to intelligence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melnick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tadin, 2015</xref>). We summarize a framework (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>) to indicate and visualize our findings.</p>
<p>Recently, Duncan et al. demonstrated coding of general fluid intelligence (gF) in distributed regions, defining them as part of multi-demand (MD) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Assem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Duncan et al., 2020</xref>). The MD system encompasses a range of cognitive domains, including working memory, mathematics, language, and relational reasoning. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melnick et al. (2013)</xref>, motion surround suppression (SI) and time thresholds for small and large gratings, which reflect hMT+ functionality, are correlated with Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed indicators. Additionally, Fedorenko et al. identified multi-demand activation regions around the occipito-temporal areas, potentially overlapping with hMT+ (Fedorenko et al., 2013). As a key region in the representation of sensory flows (including optic, and auditory flows)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fetsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Gu et al., 2006</xref>), hMT+ shows potential to be central to the MD system. Future research could focus on multi-task paradigms to further investigate the mechanisms of hMT+ and its relationship with broader cognitive functions.</p>
<p>Together, this study offers a comprehensive insight into how the information exchange and integration between the sensory cortex (hMT+) and cognition core of BA 46, coupling with the hMT+ GABA, can predict the performance of 3D visuo-spatial ability (BDT). Our results provide direct evidence that a sensory cortex area (hMT+), its GABA biochemistry, functional connectivity, and cognition behavior levels, can assemble into complex cognition as an intellectual hub.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Thirty-six healthy subjects (18 female, mean age: 23.6 yearsÂ±2.1, range: 20 to 29 years) participated in this study, they were recruited from Zhejiang University. All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. In addition, they reported no psychotropic medication use, no illicit drug use within the past month, no alcohol use within 3 days prior to scanning, and right-handed. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Zhejiang University and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All participants signed informed consent forms prior to the start of the study and were compensated for their time. All subjects participated in the motion spatial suppression psychophysical, resting-state fMRI and MRS (hMT+ and EVC (primarily in V1) regions, in random sequence) experiments, but only part of the MRS data (31/36 in hMT+ region and 28/36 in EVC (primarily in V1) region) survived quality control (see the part of MRS date processing). The sample size is determined by the statistic requirement (30 sample for Person correlation statistical analysis).</p>

<title>Motion surrounding suppression measurement</title>
<p>All stimuli were generated using Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA) with Psychophysics Toolbox(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brainard, 1997</xref>), and were shown on a linearized monitor (1920Ã1080 resolution, 100-Hz refresh rate, Cambridge Research System, Kent, UK). The viewing distance was 72 cm from the screen, with the head stabilized by a chinrest. Stimuli were drawn against a gray (56 cd per m<sup>-2</sup>) background.</p>
<p>A schematic of the stimuli and trial sequences is shown in our recent study(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Song et al., 2021</xref>). The stimulus was a vertical drifting sinusoidal grating (contrast, 50%; spatial frequency, 1 cycle/Â°; speed, 4Â°/s) of either small (diameter of 2Â°) or large (diameter of 10Â°) size. The edge of the grating was blurred with a raised cosine function (width, 0.3Â°). A cross was presented in the center of the screen at the beginning of each trial for 500ms, and participants were instructed to fixate at the cross and to keep fixating at the cross throughout the trial. In each trial, a grating of either large or small size was randomly presented at the center of the screen. The grating drifted either leftward or rightward, and participants were asked to judge the perceived moving direction by a key press. Response time was not limited. The grating was ramped on and off with a Gaussian temporal envelope, and the grating duration was defined as 1 SD of the Gaussian function. The duration was adaptively adjusted in each trial, and duration thresholds were estimated by a staircase procedure. Thresholds for large and small gratings were obtained from a 160-trial block that contained four interleaved 3-down/1-up staircases. For each participant, we computed the correct rate for different stimulus durations separately for each stimulus size. These values were then fitted to a cumulative Gaussian function, and the duration threshold corresponding to the 75% correct point on the psychometric function was estimated for each stimulus size.</p>
<p>Stimulus demonstration and practice trials were presented before the first run. Auditory feedback was provided for each wrong response. To quantify the spatial suppression strength, we calculated the spatial suppression index (SI), defined as the difference of log10 thresholds for large versus small stimuli(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Tadin et al., 2003</xref>):

<title>Block design task measurement</title>
<p>The block design task was administered in accordance with the WAIS-IV manual(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wechsler, 2008</xref>). Specifically, participants were asked to rebuild the figural pattern within a specified time limit using a set of red and white blocks. The time limits were set as 30 s to 120 s according to different levels of difficulty. The patters were presented in ascending order of difficulty, and the test stopped if two consecutive patterns were not constructed in the allotted time. The score was determined by the accomplishment of the pattern and the time taken. A time bonus was awarded for rapid performance in the last six patterns. The score ranges between 0 and 66 points, with higher scores indicating better perceptual reasoning.</p>

<title>MR experimental procedure</title>
<p>MR experiments were performed in a 7T whole body MR system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany) with a Nova Medical 32 channel array head coil. Sessions included resting-state functional MRI, fMRI localizer scan, structural image scanning, and MRS scan. Resting-state scans were acquired with 1.5-mm isotropic resolution (transverse orientation, TR/TE = 2000/20.6 ms, 160 volumes, slice number = 90, flip angle = 70Â°, eyes closed). Structural images were acquired using a MP2RAGE sequence (TR/ TI1/ TI2 = 5000/901/3200 ms) with 0.7-mm isotropic resolution. MRS data were collected within two regions (hMT+ and EVC (primarily in V1)) for each subject, and we divided them into two sessions to avoid discomfort caused by long scanning. The order of MRS VOIs (hMT+ and EVC (primarily in V1)) in the two sessions was counterbalanced across participants. Interval between two sessions was used for block design and motion discrimination tasks. One session included fMRI localizer scan, structural image scanning, and MRS scan for the hMT+ region; the other session included structural image scan, and MRS scan for the EVC (primarily in V1) region. Spectroscopy data were acquired using a <sup>1</sup>H-MRS single-voxel short-TE STEAM (Stimulated Echo Acquisition Mode) sequence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Frahm et al., 1989</xref>) (TE/TM/TR = 6/32/7100ms) with 4096 sampling points, 4-kHz bandwidth, 16 averages, 8 repetitions, 20Ã20Ã20 mm<sup>3</sup> VOI size, and VAPOR (variable power and optimized relaxation delays) water suppression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">TkÃ¡Ä et al., 1999</xref>). Prior to acquisition, first- and second-order shims were adjusted using FASTMAP (fast, automatic shimming technique by mapping along projections(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gruetter, 1993</xref>). Two non-suppressed water spectra were also acquired: one for phase and eddy current correction (only RF pulse, 4 averages) and another for metabolite quantification (VAPOR none, 4 averages). Voxels were positioned based on anatomical landmarks using a structural image scan collected in the same session, while avoiding contamination by CSF, bone, and fat. The hMT+ VOIs were placed in the ventrolateral occipital lobe, which was based on anatomical landmarks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schallmo et al., 2018</xref>). We did not distinguish between the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas in these hMT+ VOIs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Huk et al., 2002</xref>). For 14 subjects, we also functionally identified hMT+ as a check on the placement of the VOI. A protocol was used with a drifting grating (15% contrast) alternated with a static grating across blocks (10 s block duration, 160 TRs total). Using fMRI BOLD signals, these localizer data were processed online to identify the hMT+ voxels in the lateral occipital cortex, which responded more strongly to moving vs. static gratings. In addition, we only used the left hMT+ as the target region to scan, which was motivated by studies showing that left hMT+ was more effective at causing perceptual effects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>). For EVC (primarily in V1) region, the VOI was positioned on each subjectâs calcarine sulcus on the left side(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tadin et al., 2011</xref>) based on anatomical landmarks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boucard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dumoulin et al., 2000</xref>)</p>

Third, the absolute concentrations of each metabolite were quantitatively estimated via the Water- Scaling method. For partial-volume correction, the tissue water content was computed as follows(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ernst et al., 1993</xref>):

Spherical ROI with a radius of 6mm was placed in left MT. The coordinate for left MT (-46, -72, -4, in MNI space) was obtained by our localizer fMRI experiment.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of human intelligence has been the focus of cognitive neuroscience research, and finding some objective behavioral or neural indicators of intelligence has been an ongoing problem for scientists for many years. Melnick et al, 2013 found for the first time that the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception predicts an individual's IQ score. This is because IQ is likely associated with the ability to suppress irrelevant information. In this study, a high-resolution MRS approach was used to test this theory. In this paper, the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception was found to be correlated with the visuo-spatial subtest of gF, while both variables were also correlated with the GABA concentration of MT+ in the human brain. In addition, there was no significant relationship with the excitatory transmitter Glu. At the same time, SI was also associated with MT+ and several frontal cortex FCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) 7T high-resolution MRS is used</p>
<p>
(2) This study combines the behavioral tests, MRS, and fMRI.</p>
<p>Major</p>
<p>
I have no further comments. The approach and experiment are sound. The only overall drawback is the relatively low sample size.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
(1) Line 138, &quot;This finding supports the hypothesis that motion perception is associated with neural activity in MT+ area&quot;. This sentence is strange because it is a well-established finding in numerous human fMRI papers. I think the authors should be more specific about what this finding implies.</p>
<p>Response: We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised it to:&quot; This finding is in line with prior results, which indicates that motion perception is associated with neural activity in hMT+ area, but not in EVC (primarily in V1)&quot; (lines 156-158)</p>
<p>Reply: This argument should be refined. Numerous studies have shown the key role of V1 in motion perception. V1 contains a vast proportion of direction selective neurons. I am asking how your results here are related to existing literature. This argument is incorrect and too rough. Can you please revise this?</p>
<p>(9) Line 213, as far as I know, the study (Melnick et al., 2013) is a psychophysical study and did not provide evidence that the spatial suppression effect is associated with MT+.</p>
<p>Response: We thank reviewer for pointing this out. It was a mistake to use this reference, and we have revised it accordingly. (line 242)</p>
<p>Reply: Thanks. New citation is good. But that paper is a modeling study. The direct empirical evidence on humans should be as follow:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study aims to understand the role of GABA-ergic inhibition in the human MT+ region in predicting visuo-spatial intelligence through a combination of behavioral measures, fMRI (for functional connectivity measurement), and MRS (for GABA/glutamate concentration measurement). It provides useful evidence that GABA levels in the sensory cortex, such as in the human MT+, are associated with visuo-spatial ability, thus highlighting the importance of GABA-ergic inhibition in complex cognition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Comprehensive Approach: The study adopts a multi-level approach, i.e., neurochemical analysis of GABA levels, functional connectivity, and behavioral measures to provide a holistic understanding of the relationship between GABA-ergic inhibition and visuo-spatial intelligence.</p>
<p>
(2) Sophisticated Techniques: The use of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technology for measuring GABA and glutamate concentrations in the MT+ region is a recent development.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have carefully addressed the major weaknesses previously mentioned.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study of human intelligence has been the focus of cognitive neuroscience research, and finding some objective behavioral or neural indicators of intelligence has been an ongoing problem for scientists for many years. Melnick et al, 2013 found for the first time that the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception predicts an individual's IQ score. This is because IQ is likely associated with the ability to suppress irrelevant information. In this study, a high-resolution MRS approach was used to test this theory. In this paper, the phenomenon of spatial suppression in motion perception was found to be correlated with the visuo-spatial subtest of gF, while both variables were also correlated with the GABA concentration of MT+ in the human brain. In addition, there was no significant relationship with the excitatory transmitter Glu. At the same time, SI was also associated with MT+ and several frontal cortex FCs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) 7T high-resolution MRS is used.</p>
<p>(2) This study combines the behavioral tests, MRS, and fMRI.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>In Melnick (2013) IQ scores were measured by the full set of WAIS-III, including all subtests. However, this study only used visual spatial domain of gF. I wonder why only the visuo-spatial subtest was used not the full WAIS-III? I am wondering whether other subtests were conducted and, if so, please include the results as well to have comprehensive comparisons with Melnick (2013).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The decision was informed by Melnickâs findings which indicated high correlations between Surround suppression (SI) and the Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Reasoning, Working Memory, and Processing Speed Indexes, with correlation coefficients of 0.69, 0.47, 0.49, and 0.50, respectively. It is well-established that the hMT+ region of the brain is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D perception). Furthermore, motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of hMT+, aligns closely with this region's activities. Given this context, the Perception Reasoning sub-ability was deemed to have the clearest mechanism for further exploration. Consequently, we selected the most representative subtest of Perception Reasoningâthe Block Design Testâwhich primarily assesses 3D visual intelligence.â For further clarification, due to these reasons, we conducted only the visuo-spatial subtest.</p>

<p>Minor:</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>In the first revised version, we addressed the following recommendations in the 'Author response' file titled 'Recommendation for the authors.' It seems our response may not have reached you successfully. We would like to share and expand upon our response here:</p>
<p>(1) Table 1 and Table supplementary 1-3 contain many correlation results. But what are the main points of these values? Which values do the authors want to highlight? Why are only p-values shown with significance symbols in Table supplementary 2??</p>
<p>(1.1) What are the main points of these values?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for pointing this out. These correlations represent the relationship between behavior task (SI/BDT) and resting-state functional connectivity. It indicates that left hMT+ is involved in the efficient information integration network when it comes to BDT task. In addition, left hMT+âs surround suppression is involved in several hMT+ - frontal connectivity. Furthermore, the overlap regions between two task indicates the underlying mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) Which values do the authors want to highlight?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Table 1 and Table Supplementary 1-3 present the preliminary analysis results for Table 2 and Table Supplementary 4-6. So, we generally report all value. Conversely, in the Table 2 and Table Supplementary 4-6, we highlight the value which support our main conclusion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.3) Why are only p-values shown with significance symbols in Table Supplementary 2?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out, it is a mistake. We have revised it and delete the significance symbols.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 27, it is unclear to me what is &quot;the canonical theory&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised âthe canonical theory&quot; to âthe prevailing opinionâ (line 27)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Throughout the paper, the authors use &quot;MT+&quot;, I would suggest using &quot;hMT+&quot; to indicate the human MT complex, and to be consistent with the human fMRI literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised them.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) At the beginning of the results section, I suggest including the total number of subjects. It is confusing what &quot;31/36 in MT+, and 28/36 in V1&quot; means.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have included the total number of subjects in the beginning of result section. (line 110, line 128)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Line 138, &quot;This finding supports the hypothesis that motion perception is associated with neural activity in MT+ area&quot;. This sentence is strange because it is a well-established finding in numerous human fMRI papers. I think the authors should be more specific about what this finding implies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised it to:â This finding is in line with prior results, which indicates that motion perception is associated with neural activity in hMT+ area, but not in EVC (primarily in V1)â (lines 156-158)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) There are no unit labels for all x- and y-axies in Figure 1. I only see the unit for Conc is mmol per kg wet weight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. Figure 1 is a schematic and workflow chart, so labels for x- and y-axes are not needed. I believe this confusion might pertain to Figure 3. In Figures 3a and 3b, the MRS spectrum does not have a standard y-axis unit as it varies based on the individual physical conditions of the scanner; it is widely accepted that no y-axis unit is used. While the x-axis unit is ppm, which indicate the chemical shift of different metabolites. In Figure 3c, the BDT represents IQ scores, which do not have a standard unit. Similarly, in Figures 3d and 3e, the Suppression Index does not have a standard unit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Although the correlations are not significant in Figure Supplement 2&amp;3, please also include the correlation line, 95% confidence interval, and report the r values and p values (i.e., similar format as in Figure 1C).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised them and include the correlation line, 95% confidence interval, r values and p values.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) There is no need to separate different correlation figures into Figure Supplementary 1-4. They can be combined into the same figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for the suggestion. However, each correlation figure in the supplementary figures has its own specific topic and conclusion. Please notes that in the revised version, we have added a figure showing the EVC (primarily in V1) MRS scanning ROI as Supplementary Figure 1. Therefore, the figures the reviewer is concerned about are Supplementary Figure 2-5. The correlation figures in Supplementary Figure 2 indicate that GABA in EVC (primarily in V1) does not show any correlation with BDT and SI, illustrating that inhibition in EVC (primarily in V1) is unrelated to both 3D visuo-spatial intelligence and motion suppression processing. The correlations in Supplementary Figure 3 indicate that the excitation mechanism, represented by Glutamate concentration, does not contribute to 3D visuo-spatial intelligence in either hMT+ or EVC (primarily in V1). Supplementary Figure 4 validates our MRS measurements. Supplementary Figure 5 addresses potential concerns regarding the impact of outliers on correlation significance. Even after excluding two âoutliersâ from Figures 3d and 3e, the correlation results remain stable.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Line 213, as far as I know, the study (Melnick et al., 2013) is a psychophysical study and did not provide evidence that the spatial suppression effect is associated with MT+.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Throughout the manuscript, hMT+ connectivity with the frontal cortex has been treated as an a priori hypothesis/space. However, there is no such motivation or background literature mentioned in the Introduction. Can the authors clarify the necessity of functional connectivity? In other words, can BOLD activity of hMT+ in the localizer task substitute for functional connectivity between hMT+ and the frontal cortex?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank reviewer for pointing this out. We offered additional motivation and background literature in the introduction: âFrontal cortex is usually recognized as the cognitive core region (Duncan et al., 2000; Gray et al., 2003). Strong connectivity between the cognitive regions suggests a mechanism for large-scale information exchange and integration in the brain (Barbey, 2018; Cole et al., 2012).  Therefore, the potential conjunctive coding may overlap with the inhibition and/or excitation mechanism of hMT+. Taken together, we hypothesized that 3D visuo-spatial intelligence (as measured by BDT) might be predicted by the inhibitory and/or excitation mechanisms in hMT+ and the integrative functions connecting hMT+ with frontal cortex (Figure 1a).â (lines 67-74). Additionally, we have included a whole-brain analysis for validation. Functional connectivity reveals the information exchange relationships across regions, enhancing our understanding of how hMT+ and the frontal cortex collaborate when solving visual-spatial intelligence tasks.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1.2) In other words, can BOLD activity of hMT+ in the localizer task substitute for functional connectivity between hMT+ and the frontal cortex?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question. The localizer task was used solely for defining the hMT+ MRS scanning area. Functional connectivity was measured using resting-state fMRI. Research has shown that resting-state functional connectivity between the frontal cortex and other ROIs can further reveal the neural mechanisms underlying intelligence tasks (Song et al., 2008).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There is an obvious mismatch between the in-text description and the content of the figure:</p>
<p>
&quot;In contrast, there was no correlation between BDT and GABA levels in V1 voxels (figure supplement 1a). Further, we show that SI significantly correlates with GABA levels in hMT+ voxels (r = 0.44, P = 0.01, n = 31, Figure 3d). In contrast, no significant correlation between SI and GABA concentrations in V1 voxels was observed (figure supplement 1b).&quot;</p>

<p>(3) The authors' response to my previous round of review indicated that the &quot;V1 ROIs&quot; covered a substantial amount of V3 (32%). Therefore, it would no longer be appropriate to call these &quot;V1 ROIs&quot;. I'd suggest renaming them as &quot;Early Visual Cortex (EVC) ROIs&quot; to be more accurate. Can the authors justify why choosing the left hemisphere for visual intelligence task, which is typically believed to be right lateralized?</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised our description of the MRS scanning ROIs to Early Visual Cortex (EVC). Since the majority of our EVC ROIs are in V1 (around 70%) and almost no V2 was included, we decided to mark the EVC ROIs with the explanation &quot;primarily in V1&quot; for better clarification. This terminology has been widely used to better emphasize the V1-based experimental design.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3.2) Can the authors justify why choosing the left hemisphere for visual intelligence task, which is typically believed to be right lateralized?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The use of the left MT/V5 as a target was motivated by studies demonstrating that left MT+/V5 TMS is more effective at causing perceptual effects (Tadin et al., 2011). Therefore, we chose to use the left hMT+ as our MRS ROI and maintain consistency across different models' ROIs. Additionally, our results support the notion that the visual intelligence task is right lateralized in the frontal cortex. At the resting-fMRI level, we found that significant ROIs, where functional connectivity is highly correlated with BDT scores, are in the right frontal cortex (Figure 5a, b).</p>

<p>(4) &quot;Small threshold&quot; and &quot;large threshold&quot; are neither standard descriptions, and it is unclear what &quot;small threshold&quot; refers to in the following figure caption. Additionally, the unit (ms) is confusing. Does it refer to timing?</p>
<p>
&quot;(f) Peason's correlation showing significant negative correlations between BDT and small threshold.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out; we agree with your suggestion. We have revised the terms âsmall thresholdâ and âlarge thresholdâ to âduration threshold of small gratingâ and âduration threshold of large gratingâ, respectively. The unit (ms) refers to timing. The details are described in the methods section: âThe duration was adaptively adjusted in each trial, and duration thresholds were estimated using a staircase procedure. Thresholds for large and small gratings were obtained from a 160-trial block that contained four interleaved 3-down/1-up staircases. For each participant, we computed the correct rate for different stimulus durations separately for each stimulus size. These values were then fitted to a cumulative Gaussian function, and the duration threshold corresponding to the 75% correct point on the psychometric function was estimated for each stimulus sizeâ.</p>

<p>(5) In the response letter, the authors mentioned incorporating the neural efficiency hypothesis in the Introduction, but the revised Introduction does not contain such information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. In our revised version, the second paragraph of the introduction addresses the neural efficiency hypothesis: âThe âneuro-efficiencyâ hypothesis is one explanation for individual differences in gF (Haier et al., 1988). This hypothesis puts forward that the human brainâs ability to suppress irrelevant information leads to more efficient cognitive processing. Correspondingly, using a well-known visual motion paradigm (center-surround antagonism) (Liu et al., 2016; Tadin et al., 2003), Melnick et al found a strong link between suppression index (SI) of motion perception and the scores of the block design test (BDT, a subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), which measures the visuo-spatial component (3D domain) of gF (Melnick et al., 2013). Motion surround suppression (SI), a specific function of human extrastriate cortical region, middle temporal complex (hMT+), aligns closely with this region's activities (Gautama &amp; Van Hulle, 2001). Furthermore, hMT+ is a sensory cortex involved in visual perception processing (3D domain) (Cumming &amp; DeAngelis, 2001). These findings suggest that hMT+ potentially plays a significant role in 3D visuo-spatial intelligence by facilitating the efficient processing of 3D visual information and suppressing irrelevant information. However, more evidence is needed to uncover how the hMT+ functions as a core region for 3D visuo-spatial intelligence.â (lines 51-66)</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In the Code availability, it states that &quot;this paper does not report original code&quot;. It seems weird because at least the code to reproduce the figures from the data should be provided.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Almost all figures were created using software such as DPABI, BrainNet, and GraphPad Prism 9.5, which are manually operated and do not require code adjustments. However, for the MRS fitting curve, we can provide our MATLAB code for redrawing the <italic>MRS fitting. The code has been uploaded to GitHub.</italic></p>
