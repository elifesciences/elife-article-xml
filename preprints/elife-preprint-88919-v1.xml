<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Anesthesia is a major confounding factor in preclinical stroke research as stroke rarely occurs in sedated patients. Moreover, anesthesia affects both brain functions and the stroke outcome acting as neurotoxic or protective agent. So far, no approaches were well suited to induce stroke while imaging hemodynamics along with simultaneous large-scale recording of brain functions in awake animals. For this reason, the first critical hours following the stroke insult and associated functional alteration remain poorly understood. Here, we present a strategy to investigate both stroke hemodynamics and stroke-induced functional alterations without the confounding effect of anesthesia, i.e., under awake condition. Functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging was used to continuously monitor variations in cerebral blood volume (CBV) in +65 brain regions/hemisphere for up to 3hrs after stroke onset. The focal cortical ischemia was induced using a chemo-thrombotic agent suited for permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in awake rats, and followed by ipsi- and contralesional whiskers stimulation to investigate on the dynamic of the thalamo-cortical functions. Early (0-3hrs) and delayed (day 5) fUS recording enabled to characterize the features of the ischemia (location, CBV loss), spreading depolarizations (occurrence, amplitude) and functional alteration of the somatosensory thalamo-cortical circuits. Post-stroke thalamo-cortical functions were affected not only early after the stroke onset but were also altered secondarly and remotely from the initial insult. Overall, our procedure enables early, continuous, and chronic evaluations of hemodynamics and brain functions which, combined to stroke or other pathologies, aims to better understand physiopathologies toward the development of clinically relevant therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Stroke is a multifaceted and multiphasic pathology, complex to mimic under experimental conditions. Indeed, when compared to clinic, preclinical stroke models suffer from several limitations that narrow the experimental focus to few conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Among these limitations, one can highlight the complexity to combine (i) imaging stroke in conscious animal models, (ii) addressing post-stroke brain functions and (iii) recording of hyperacute stroke hemodynamics, all crucial to design timely effective therapeutic strategies.</p>
<p>As first limitation, the use of anesthesia in preclinical studies seems to hamper the transition from animal to patient as stroke rarely occurs in sedated patients. Moreover, anesthetics disrupt the brain functionality, alterates neurovascular coupling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and affects the stroke by acting as neurotoxic or neuroprotective agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To date, only a few groups succeeded in inducing a stroke in awake rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, post-stroke network and functional alterations have been addressed by few preclinical studies, providing evidence of functional network reorganization from minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> to days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> following stroke onset. However, these studies mostly focused on the cortical readouts and were unable to capture how deeper brain regions, like thalamic relays, were functionally and/or temporally affected remotely from the stroke insult (e.g., diaschisis)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these studies were always conducted using various anesthetics (e.g., ventilated with halothane or isoflurane; medetomidine, urethane) known to differentially impact brain functions, as mentioned above.</p>
<p>Until recently, live monitoring of the hyperacute stroke-induced hemodynamics was restricted to few methods but often focused to the brain surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. On the other hand, functional ultrasound (fUS), a recent neuroimaging modality measuring cerebral blood volume changes (CBV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, was successfully employed to measure brain functions of awake rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, to address early post-stroke functional reorganization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and to track stroke-induced hemodynamics at the brain-wide scale (i.e., ischemia and spreading depolarization)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, no study has further exploited such strategies to combine together stroke hemodynamics and brain-wide functional alteration in awake rodents.</p>
<p>In this study, we report on the stroke induction and the alteration of somatosensory brain functions in awake rats. Using the latest improvements toward imaging of awake rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> combined with chemo-thrombotic agent directly applied to the middle cerebral artery (MCA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we were able to induce MCA occlusion (MCAo) in awake rats while capturing continuous hemodynamic changes, including ischemia and spreading depolarization, in +65 brain regions for up to 3hrs after stroke onset. Finally, we investigated on how somatosensory thalamo-cortical functional reponses were progressively altered from early (0-3hrs) to late post-stroke (5d) timepoints.</p>

<p>The experimental procedures were approved by the Committee on Animal Care of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, following the national guidelines on the use of laboratory animals and the European Union Directive for animal experiments (2010/63/EU). The manuscript was written according to the ARRIVE Essential 10 checklist for reporting animal experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighed between 250–400g (n=9; Janvier Labs, France) were used. During habituation rats were housed two per cage kept in a 12-hr dark/light cycle at 23°C with <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to water and controlled access to food (15g/rat/day). After the initial surgical procedure, rats were housed alone.

<title>Surgical procedures</title>
<p>Cranial window over the MCA: Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (5% for induction, 2% for maintenance; Iso-Vet, 1000 mg/g, Dechra, Belgium) and fixed in a stereotaxic frame. The depth of anesthesia was confirmed by the absence of reflex during paw pinching. After scalp removal and tissue cleaning, a 1-mm<sup>2</sup> cranial window was performed at coordinates bregma +2mm and lateral 7mm, over the left distal branch of the MCA as reported in Brunner, Korostelev et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. A silicone plug (Body Double-Fast Set, Smooth-on, Inc., USA) was used to protect the window and ease the access to the MCA before the occlusion procedure. Then, a stainless-steel custom designed headpost was fixed with bone screws (19010-00, FST, Germany) and dental cement (Super-Bond C&amp;B, Sun Medical Co., Japan) to the animal skull (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>, left) as previously described by Brunner, Grillet et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Cranial window for imaging: After recovery and habituation to head-fixation, a second cranial window was performed between bregma -2 to -4mm and 6mm apart from the sagittal suture (same anesthesia settings as the first cranial window; see above) following the procedure described in Brunner, Grillet et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>, right). A silicone plug was also used to protect the window and a headshield was added to secure it<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For both cranial windows, the dura mater was kept intact. After each surgery, rats were placed in their home cage and monitored until they woke up. Rats were medicated with analgesic (Buprenorphine, 0.1mg/kg, Ceva, France), anti-inflammatory (Dexamethasone, 0.5mg/kg, Dechra, Belgium) drugs injected directly after the surgery, at 24hrs and 48hrs after the surgery. An antibiotic (Emdotrim, 5%, Ecuphar, The Netherland) was added to the water bottle.</p>

<title>Functional ultrasoung imaging acquisition</title>
<p>Coronal μDoppler images were acquired using a 15-MHz linear probe composed of 128 piezo-elements spaced by 100μm (L22-14Vx, Vermon, France) connected to a dedicated ultrasound scanner (Vantage 128, Verasonics, USA) and controlled by a high-performance computing workstation (fUSI-2, AUTC, Estonia). This configuration allowed to image the brain vasculature with a resolution of 100μm laterally, 110μm in depth, and 300μm in elevation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The ultrasound sequence generated by the software is the same as in Macé et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and Brunner, Grillet et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Briefly, the ultrafast scanner images the brain with 5 tilted plane-waves (−6°, -3°, +0.5°, +3°, +6°) at a 10-kHz frame rate. The 5 plane-wave images are added to create compound images at a frame rate of 500Hz. Each set of 250 compound images is filtered to extract the blood signal. Finally, the intensity of the filtered images is averaged to obtain a vascular image of the rat brain at a frame rate of 1.25Hz. Then, the acquired images are processed with a dedicated GPU architecture, displayed in real-time for data visualization, and stored for subsequent off-line analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Control sessions lasted between 2.5hrs (Rat#1) and 4hrs (Rat#5,8,9). Continuous imaging session combining pre-stroke, MCA occlusion and early post-stroke recording consisted in 4hrs recording (Rat#2-4, 6-9) and late post-stroke recordings were 2 sessions of 1hr (Rat#6,8) performed 5d after the stroke onset.

<title>Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV)</title>
<p>We used the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV, expressed in % as compared to baseline) to analyze ischemia, spreading depolarizations (SDs) and functional changes. rCBV is defined as the signal in each voxel compared to its average level during the baseline period.

Briefly the temporal traces were extracted by averaging the rCBV signal in the primary somatosensory barrel-field cortex (S1BF) for the ischemia and the retrosplenial granular cortex (RSGc) for detecting the SDs, both located in the left hemisphere. This procedure allowed to measure the occurrence of SDs over the recording period. Live recording of ischemia and spreading depolarizations can be visualized in <bold>Movie 1</bold>.</p>

<p>Pre- and post-stroke recordings are reshaped in shorter 40-s sessions, i.e., 50 frames, and averaged based on the whisker stimulation paradigm (left or right). In each voxel, we compared signals along the recording in a time window before the stimulus onset and a time window after stimulus onset using two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. We obtained the z-statistics of the test for each voxel, and consequently a z-score for the coronal cross-section. Mean activity maps for left or right whisker stimulation (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref></bold>) show z-score value calculated using a Fisher’s transform for all voxels across the coronal cross-section. Only voxels with a z-score&gt;1.6 were considered significantly activated (p&lt;0.05 for a one-tailed test).</p>

<title>Real-time imaging of stroke induction in awake rats</title>
<p>We first developed a dedicated procedure for real-time imaging of stroke induction and associated evoked functional deficits in awake head-fixed rats (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Each rat was subjected to two cranial windows accessing independently the distal branch of the left MCA (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>, Left) and the selected brain regions to image (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>, Right). The latter was performed between bregma -2 and -4mm allowing for jointly monitoring the bilateral thalamo-cortical circuits of the somatosensory whisker-to-barrel pathway, including the ventroposterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM) and the primary somatosensory barrel-field cortex (S1BF). Moreover, the selected coronal cross-section includes the posterior nucleus of the thalamus (Po), the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the ventral part of the zona incerta known for relaying information related to whiskers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, and also direct efferent projections from the S1BF to other cortical and subcortical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Prior to imaging sessions, rats were extensively trained to accept comfortable restraints in the experimental apparatus (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>), suitable for fUS recording of brain functions and stroke induction under awake conditions. After data acquisition, the coronal cross-section was registered and segmented on a custom-developed digital rat atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> to provide a dynamic view of the changes in perfusion induced either by the stroke or evoked activity.</p>
<p>To overcome the limitations of conventional stroke models, we occluded the distal branch of the MCA by the mean of a chemo-thrombotic ferric chloride solution (FeCl<sub>3</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> while performing fUS imaging in awake rats (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). It should be mentioned that the rats did not show any obvious signs of pain or discomfort (e.g., vocalization, aggressiveness) during the restrain period and occlusion procedure. The MCA occlusion (MCAo) was captured live with fUS and confirmed by the large drop of signal, i.e., ischemia, localized in the cortex of the left hemisphere (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, C</xref></bold> and <bold>Movie 1</bold>) as shown with μDoppler image taken 3hrs and 5d after the stroke onset (dashed outline, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, Top row). Bmode images accounting for the brain tissue echogenicity remain unchanged early after stroke onset (3hrs) while showing focal hyper-echogenicity (dashed outline, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>, Bottom row) lately after stroke onset (5d) as a marker of focal lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. The stroke-induced hemodynamic changes have been continuously recorded for up to 3hrs after stroke onset, registered and segmented into 69 regions (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref></bold>). We first extracted the average change in rCBV (ΔrCBV in %) in the S1BF cortex of the left hemisphere (blue region, <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>) and detected an abrupt drop of rCBV down to ∼40% of the baseline level after the occlusion of the MCA, followed by a progressive decrease of the rCBV to 30% of baseline level 3hrs after the stroke onset (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold> and <bold>Movie 1</bold>). Second, we extracted the average rCBV change from a cortical region supplied by the anterior cerebral artery directly after the MCAo. The signal extracted from the retrosplenial granular cortex (RSGc; purple and black regions in <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>) shows successive and transient increases of signal. It characterizes spreading depolarizations (SDs) in the left hemisphere (in purple; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold> and <bold>Movie 1</bold>) while resulting in a slight and stable oligemia in the right hemisphere (in black; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). SDs were observed in the peri-ischemic territory of all rats subjected to MCAo and occurred in an ostensibly random fashion (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>); however, SDs showed a similar bell shape and time-course across animals (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></bold>). On average, we detected 5 SDs per hour per rat. Finally, we stained brain slices 24hrs after MCAo and confirmed that FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced ischemia turned into tissue infarction (red delineation; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Stroke-induced alterations of the thalamo-cortical functions</title>
<p>One hour before and during 3hrs after the occlusion of the MCA, rats received mechanical stimulation of the whisker alternately delivered to the left and right pad using motorized combs (5-Hz sinusoidal deflection, 20° amplitude, 5-s duration; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>) to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of the functional circuit. Before stroke, the sensory-evoked stimulations elicited a robust and statistically significant functional response (z-score&gt;1.6, see Material and Methods) for both left and right stimulation (orange and green respectively; z-score maps; Pre-stroke panel, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold>Movie 2</bold>) with the activity spatially confined in the contralateral dorsal part of the VPM and S1BF. The temporal analysis of the somatosensory evoked responses in the contralateral hemisphere confirmed that VPM, Po, and S1BF regions were significantly activated and for both left and right stimuli (z-score, ****p&lt;0.0001, ***p&lt;0.001 and ****p&lt;0.0001 respectively; Left panel, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). We also detected significant increase of activity in S2, AuD, Ect (****p&lt;0.0001) and PRh (***p&lt;0.001) cortices and VPL nucleus (**p&lt;0.01; the list of acronyms is provided in <bold><xref rid="tblS2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref></bold>), brain regions receiving direct efferent projections from the S1BF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, VPM or Po nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. It is worth noted that no habituation or sensitzation due to the repetitiveness of whiskers stimulation was observed in cortical and subcortical regions over the pre-stroke sessions (<bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>After the stroke, the activity map from the left pad stimulation elicited a similar response pattern as pre-stroke; however, the right pad stimulation showed a total absence of functional response in the S1BF cortex and a significant reduction of the response in the VPM (z-score maps; Post-stroke panel, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold> and <bold>Movie 2</bold>). Over the 3hrs following stroke onset, functional responses to left whisker stimulation were still detected in the cortical and thalamic regions of the contralateral (right) hemisphere; however, functional responses to right whisker stimulation were only detected in subcortical nuclei (i.e., VPM, Po, VPL), while attenuated when compared with the responses from the pre-stroke period and from the other hemisphere (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref></bold>). Furthermore, no responses were detected at the cortical level (S1BF, S2, and AuD; right panel, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To better evaluate how the functional responses were affected by the stroke, we have divided the post-stroke recording period into 3 sections of 1hr each and compared them with the 1-hr pre-stroke period (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Temporal plots from the pre-stroke period showed robust increases in signal during the stimulus in S1BF, VPM, and Po regions and high consistency between left and right stimuli (black plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref></bold>); fitting well the hemodynamic response functions as previously observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Indeed, the hemodynamic responses were characterized by a quick increase in signal during whisker stimulation reaching a peak after 4.0s at 18.2±1.3% (4.0s, 18.6±1.2%) of baseline level for S1BF, 4.0s at 4.6±0.5% (3.2s, 5.8±0.7%) for VPM, and 2.4s at 2.9±0.7% (3.2s, 4.0±0.8%) for Po from the left stimulation (right, respectively; mean±95%CI) before slowly returning to baseline level (black plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>During the first hour following the stroke onset, functional responses in the left hemisphere (i.e., ipsilesional) were abolished in the S1BF, S2, and AuD (0-1hr Post-stroke, ****pvalue&lt;0.0001), significantly decreased in the VPM (0-1hr Post-stroke, ***pvalue&lt;0.001), and unchanged in Po and VPL (0-1hr Post-stroke, ns; <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>) when compared with the pre-stroke responses (Pre-stroke, black plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Over the two following hours (i.e., 1-2hr and 2-3hr Post-stroke), the hemodynamic responses captured in these regions remained similar as those detected during the first post-stroke hour (green plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Regarding the right hemisphere (i.e., contralesional), the functional responses of S1BF and VPM were conserved during the first hour after the stroke onset (ns, 0-1hr Post-stroke; orange plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). During the two following hours, signal changes in S1BF show a significant and progressive decrease of activity (1-2hr Post-stroke **pvalue&lt;0.01, 2-3hr Post-stroke ****pvalue&lt;0.0001; orange plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>; Similar observation were made for S2 and AuD) whereas responses in VPM remained stable during the second hour post-stroke (1-2hr, ns) before significantly decreasing during the third hour (2-3hr Post-stroke *pvalue&lt;0.05; orange plots, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Finally, the functional responses in VPM and Po remained unchanged over the 3hrs following the stroke onset (bottom panel, <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Second, we extracted and compared the temporal plots of the functional responses gathered 5d after the stroke with the one obtained from the same two animals at the pre-stroke and 3hrs post-stroke timepoints (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>). At this later time point, the functional responses in the left S1BF (dark green plot, left panel, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>. Similar observation were made for the S2 and AuD) remained abolished when compared with the pre-stroke period (black plot; ****pvalue&lt;0.0001), while slightly increased when compared with the 3hrs post-stroke timepoint (green plot; **pvalue&lt;0.01). The responses detected in the VPM 5d after the stroke onset (dark green plot, left panel, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>) were largely decreased not only when compared with the pre-stroke signal (black plot; ****pvalue&lt;0.0001) but also with the 3hrs post-stroke trace (green plot; ****pvalue&lt;0.0001). Interestingly, both the amplitude and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic response function were very similar to those from the early post-stroke signal (i.e., 3hrs post-stroke); however, the post-peak period was largely dampened in the 5d post-stroke signal. A similar alteration of the hemodynamic response function was also observed for the 5d post-stroke signal extracted from the Po nucleus when compared to the pre-stroke and 3hrs post-stroke signals (**pvalue&lt;0.01 and ***pvalue&lt;0.001, respectively; left panel, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>. Similar observation were made for the VPL).</p>
<p>Regarding the right hemisphere (i.e., non-ischemic; right panel, <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), the S1BF functional responses to left whisker stimulation were still significantly reduced when compared with pre-stroke responses (black plot, ****pvalue&lt;0.0001) but remained similar to the traces detected at 3-hr post-stroke (orange plot, non-significant). As for the left VPM, both the amplitude and time-to-peak of the hemodynamic responses from the right VPM responses were consistent with pre-stroke and 3hr post-stroke values but the post-peak signal was decreased (brown plot, *pvalue&lt;0.05 and **pvalue&lt;0.01 respectively). The functional responses extracted from the Po and VPL did not show significant changes when compared to pre-stroke and 3hrs post-stroke responses.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>With this proof-of-concept study, we document on the feasibility of the continuous brain hemodynamics recording of a focal cerebral ischemia after MCAo in conscious rats. Using functional ultrasound imaging, we were able to extract multiple parameters (i.e., ischemia, location and spreading depolarization), characteristic of such cortical stroke. Then, we report on how the functional sensorimotor thalamo-cortical circuit was altered at early and late post-stroke stages.</p>
<p>Compared to highly-invasive conventional strategies such as clipping or suturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, the FeCl<sub>3</sub> model used here, is well suited to study stroke under awake conditions. Indeed, the use of FeCl<sub>3</sub> requires less manipulation, allows to maintain the dura intact and strongly reduces the risk of hemorrhage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> and animal loss. Furthermore, the FeCl<sub>3</sub> model closely mimics key human stroke features including focal ischemia, creation of blood clot, possibility of vessel recanalization, and penumbral tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced MCAo showed an abrupt and massive drop of blood perfusion remaining constant during the entire recording period. The ischemia was confined within the cortical territory perfused by the MCA (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>), and the infarct (location and size; <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref></bold>) is in agreement with previous observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. We also detected transient hyperemic events associated with spreading depolarizations (SDs) within the peri-ischemic territory, with occurence, frequency and amplitude of the hemodynamic waves (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref></bold>) consistent with prior observation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Moreover, the spatiotemporal dynamic of the FeCl<sub>3</sub>-induced MCAo is consistent with previous fUS imaging reports on cortical ischemia with various stroke models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>On top of tracking large hemodynamic variation (i.e. ischemia, SDs), one asset of the fUS imaging technology relies on its ability to track subtle hemodynamic changes in sparse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, we have evaluated how evoked functional responses reorganize at early and late timepoints after stroke induction. Functional responses to mechanical whisker stimulation were detected in several regions relaying the information from the whisker to the cortex, including the VPM and Po nuclei of the thalamus, and S1BF, the somatosensory barrel-field cortex. Responses were also observed in the S2 cortex involved in the multisensory integration of the information<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, the auditory cortex as it receives direct efferent projection from S1BF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and the VPL nuclei of the thalamus connected via corticothalamic projections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Functional responses extracted in the left hemisphere affected by the focal ischemia (i.e., ipsilesionel) show a primary alteration of the whisker-to-barrel pathway within the first hour after the stroke onset. While the abrupt loss in S1BF responses was mainly driven by the focal ischemia, the immediate but partial drop in VPM responses (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>) might result from the direct the loss of the excitatory corticothalamic feedback to the VPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The absence of such cortical feedback suggests that the dampened functional responses might be driven by the intrinsic activity of the VPM in response to whisker stimulation. Five days after the initial injury, nuclei of the thalamus (VPM and Po) were subjected to a delayed and robust functional alteration (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref></bold>), probably associated with diaschisis, as previously characterised by tissue staining, reduction of metabolism, and perfusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Functional responses of the S1BF extracted from the right hemisphere (i.e., contralesionel) show a significant decrease shortly after the stroke onset (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>), and still detected at day 5, could be provoked by a loss of transcortical excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. The late drop in VPM responses might be explained by corticothalamic modulation of the projections toward VPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Further work will need to dissect the complex and long-lasting post-stroke alterations of the functional whisker-to-barrel pathway, including at the neuronal level, as fUS only reports on hemodynamics as a proxy of local neuronal activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Another limitation relies on the experimental condition as our brain imaging paradigm was constrained to a single cross-section, thus missing out-of-plane brain regions also affected by the stroke (e.g., ischemic size, infract extension, origin, and propagation pattern of SDs34) or involved in the whisker network (e.g., superior colliculus, striatum, amygdala and cerebellum)38. To overcome such limitation, one can extend the size of the cranial window to allow for larger scale imaging either by sequentially scanning the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, or by using the recently developed volumetric fUS which provides whole-brain imaging capabilities in anesthetized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> and awake rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond studying the whisker-to-barrel somatosensory circuit, the brain-wide capability of fUS opens the door to investigate on stroke-affected brain circuits and functions using transgenic lines combined with opto-/chemo-genetic strategies as the technology is fully mature for mice studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>The authors apply a new approach to monitor brain-wide changes in sensory-evoked hemodynamic activity after focal stroke in fully conscious rats. Using functional ultrasound (fUS), they report immediate and lasting (up to 5 days) depression of sensory-evoked responses in somatosensory thalamic and cortical regions.</p>
<p>Strengths: This a technically challenging and proof-of-concept study that employs new methods to study brain-wide changes in sensory-evoked neural activity, inferred from changes in cerebral blood flow. Despite the minor typos/grammatical errors and small sample size, the authors provide compelling images and rigorous analysis to support their conclusions. Overall, this was a very technically difficult study that was well executed. I believe that it will pave the way for more extensive studies using this methodological approach. Therefore I support this study and my recommendations to improve it are relatively minor in nature and should be simple for the authors to address.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: The primary weakness of this paper is the small sample sizes. Drawing conclusions based on the small sham control group (n=2) or 5-day stroke recovery group (n=2), is rather tenuous. One way to alleviate some uncertainty with regard to the conclusions would be to state in the discussion that the findings (ie. loss of thalamocortical function after stroke) are perfectly consistent with previous studies that examined thalamocortical function after stroke. The authors missed some of these supporting studies in their reference list (see PMID: 28643802, 1400649). A second issue that can easily be resolved is their analysis of the 69 brain regions. This seems like a very important part of the study and one of the primary advantages of employing efUS. As presented, I had difficulty seeing the data. I think it would be worthwhile to expand Fig 3 (especially 3C) into a full-page figure with an accompanying table in the Supplementary info section describing the % change in CBF for each brain region.</p>
<p>Other Recommendations for the authors:.</p>
<p>
- Since there is variability in spreading depolarizations, was there any trend in the relationship between # SD's and ischemic volume? I know there are few data points but a scatterplot might be of interest.</p>
<p>
- For statistical comparisons of 'response curves' in Fig 3 and 4, what exactly was the primary dependent measure: changes in peak amplitude (%) or area under the curve?</p>
<p>
- There are several typos and minor grammatical errors in the manuscript. Some editing is recommended.</p>

<p>Brunner et al. present a new and promising application of functional ultrasound (fUS) imaging to follow the evolution of perfusion and haemodynamics upon thrombotic stroke in awake rats. The authors leveraged a chemically induced occlusion of the rat Medial Cerebral Artery (MCA) with ferric chloride in awake rats, while imaging with fUS cerebral perfusion with high spatio and temporal resolution (100µm x 110µm x 300µm x 0.8s). The authors also measured evoked haemodynamic response at different timepoints following whisker stimulation.</p>
<p>As the fUS setup of the authors is limited to 2D imaging, Brunner and colleagues focused on a single coronal slice where they identified the primary Somatosensory Barrel Field of the Cortex (S1BF), directly perfused by the MCA and relay nuclei of the Thalamus: the Posterior (Po) and the Ventroposterior Medial (VPM) nuclei of the Thalamus. All these regions are involved in the sensory processing of whisker stimulation. By investigating these regions the authors present the hyper-acute effect of the stroke with these main results:</p>
<p>- MCA occlusion results in a fast and important loss of perfusion in the ipsilesional cortex.</p>
<p>
- Thrombolysis is followed by Spreading Depolarisation measured in the Retrosplenial cortex.</p>
<p>
- Stroke-induced hypo-perfusion is associated with a significant drop in ipsilesional cortical response to whisker stimulation, and a milder one in ipsilesional subcortical relays.</p>
<p>
- Contralesional hemisphere is almost not affected by stroke with the exception of the cortex which presents a mildly reduced response to the stimulation.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors demonstrate that their protocol allows to follow up stroke evolution up to five days post-induction. They further show that fUS can estimate the size of the infarcted volume with brilliance mode (B-mode), confirming the presence of the identified lesional tissue with post-mortem cresyl violet staining.</p>
<p>Upon measuring functional response to whisker stimulation 5 days after stroke induction, the authors report that:</p>
<p>
- The ipsilesional cortex presents no response to the stimulation</p>
<p>
- The ipsilesional thalamic relays are less activated than hyper acutely</p>
<p>
- The contralesional cortex and subcortical regions are also less activated 5d after the stroke.</p>
<p>These observations mainly validate the new method as a way to chronically image the longitudinal sequelae of stroke in awake animals. However, the potentially more intriguing results the authors describe in terms of functional reorganization of functional activity following stroke appear to be preliminary, and underpowered ( N = 5 animals were imaged to describe hyper-acute session, and N = 2 in a five day follow-up). While highly preliminary, the research model proposed by the author (where the loss of the infarcted cortex induces reduces activity in connected regions, whether by cortico-thalamic or cortico-cortical loss of excitatory drive), is interesting. This hypothesis would require a greatly expanded, sufficiently powered study to be validated (or disproven).</p>

<p>The authors set out to demonstrate the utility of functional ultrasound for evaluating changes in brain hemodynamics elicited acutely and subacutely by the middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke in awake rats.</p>
<p>Functional ultrasound affords a distinct set of tradeoffs relative to competing imaging modalities. Acclimatization of rats for awake imaging has proven difficult with most, and the high quality of presented data in awake rats is a major achievement. The major weakness of the approach is in its being restricted to single-slice acquisitions, which also complicates the registration of acquisition across multiple imaging sessions within the same animal. Establishing that awake imaging represents an advancement in relation to studies under anesthesia hinges upon the establishment of the level of stress experienced by the animals in the course of imaging, i.e., requires providing data on the assessment of stress over the course of these long imaging sessions. This is particularly significant given how significant a stressor physical restraint has been established to be in rodent models of stress. Furthermore, assessment of the robustness of these measurements is of particular significance for supporting the wide applicability of this approach to preclinical studies of brain injury: the individual animal data (effect sizes, activation areas, kinetics) should thus be displayed and the statistical analysis expanded. Both within-subject, within/across sessions, and across-subjects variability should be evaluated. Thoughtful comments on the relationship between power doppler signal and cerebral blood volume are important to include and facilitate comparisons to studies recording other blood volume-weighted signals. Finally, the contextualization of the observations with respect to other studies examining acute and subacute changes in brain hemodynamics post focal ischemic stroke in rats is needed. It is also quite helpful, for establishing the robustness of the approach, when the statistical parametric maps are shown in full (i.e. unmasked).</p>
