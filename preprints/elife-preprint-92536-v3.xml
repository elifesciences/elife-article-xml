<title>Abstract</title><p>In eukaryotes, protein kinase signaling is regulated by a diverse array of post-translational modifications (PTMs), including phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues and oxidation of cysteine (Cys) residues. While regulation by activation segment phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues is well understood, relatively little is known about how oxidation of cysteine residues modulate catalysis. In this study, we investigate redox regulation of the AMPK-related Brain-selective kinases (BRSK) 1 and 2, and detail how broad catalytic activity is directly regulated through reversible oxidation and reduction of evolutionarily conserved Cys residues within the catalytic domain. We show that redox-dependent control of BRSKs is a dynamic and multilayered process involving oxidative modifications of several Cys residues, including the formation of intra-molecular disulfide bonds involving a pair of Cys residues near the catalytic HRD motif and a highly conserved T-Loop Cys with a BRSK-specific Cys within an unusual CPE motif at the end of the activation segment. Consistently, mutation of the CPE-Cys increases catalytic activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and drives phosphorylation of the BRSK substrate Tau in cells. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that oxidation of the CPE-Cys destabilizes a conserved salt bridge network critical for allosteric activation. The occurrence of spatially proximal Cys amino acids in diverse Ser/Thr protein kinase families suggests that disulfide mediated control of catalytic activity may be a prevalent mechanism for regulation within the broader AMPK family.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein kinases are crucial components in cellular signaling networks, functioning as reversible molecular switches that orchestrate various biological processes. There are over 500 protein kinases encoded in the human genome that coordinate a wide range of cellular processes by catalyzing the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a hydroxyl group on the amino acid side chains of serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues in protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Manning et al. 2002</xref>). By catalyzing the reversible post-translational phosphorylation of Ser/Thr and Tyr residues of substrate proteins, protein kinases serve as signaling integrators that govern most aspects of eukaryotic life. Consequently, there exists a biological imperative to tightly control the catalytic activities of protein kinases, through cyclical phosphorylation of conserved amino acids, protein-protein interactions, and other regulatory post-translational modifications (PTMs). One essential mechanism governing kinase activity is the reversible phosphorylation of conserved amino acid residues within the activation loop, henceforth referred to as the T-Loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Nolen, Taylor, and Ghosh 2004</xref>). In the inactive, unphosphorylated state, the T-Loop adopts a wide range of conformations, including conformations that obstruct substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Engh and Bossemeyer 2001</xref>). Phosphorylation of the activation loop induces an active spatial conformation that is typically more amenable to both binding and enzymatic phosphorylation of protein substrates, and this modification is prevalent across the kinase superfamily (Faezov and Roland L. Dunbrack 2023). Conversely, the removal of phosphate groups in this region by phosphatases (dephosphorylation) usually reverts kinases to an inactive state, generating a reversible switch to turn “on” and “off” kinase-dependent signaling pathways. More recently we hypothesized that ∼10% of the Ser/Thr human kinome may also be subject to a conserved form of redox-dependent regulation, including key members of the CAMK, AGC, and AGC-like families of kinases through reversible oxidation of an evolutionarily conserved Cys residue, which lies adjacent to the critical regulatory phosphorylation site on the activation loop (T-loop +2 position) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying kinase regulation by redox-active Cys residues is fundamental as it appears to be widespread in signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Xiao et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Corcoran and Cotter 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cao et al. 2023</xref>) and provides new opportunities to develop specific covalent compounds for the targeted modulation of protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Weisner et al. 2015</xref>). Moreover, redox-active Cys are major sensors of <bold>R</bold>eactive <bold>O</bold>xygen <bold>S</bold>pecies (ROS), such as superoxide and peroxide, which function as endogenous secondary messengers to regulate various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Schieber and Chandel 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wani et al. 2011</xref>). In particular, the high cell permeability of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> relative to other ROS species allows it to be sensed intracellularly by reactive Cys, which can differentially impact protein function and cellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lennicke et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Rhee et al. 2005</xref>). Chemically accessible and reactive Cys residues can transition through several redox states, such as the transient sulfenic acid species (Cys-SOH) and higher order, ‘irreversible’, sulfinic and sulfonic forms (Cys-SO<sub>2</sub>H and Cys-SO<sub>3</sub>H) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Forman et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gupta and Carroll 2014</xref>). Importantly, in the context of allosteric protein redox regulation, the sulfenic oxidized Cys species can form disulfide linkages with other reactive Cys residues, whilst a sulfenic derivative has also been observed to be stabilized through the formation of a cyclic sulfenamide for tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">van Montfort et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Salmeen et al. 2003</xref>). The chemical reactivity, and thus biological susceptibility, of an individual Cys residue to oxidative modification is contingent on the intrinsic p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value (where <italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> is the acid dissociation constant), which in turn is influenced by networks of interacting amino acids (including phosphorylated amino acids), solvent accessibility, protein-protein interactions, and protein structural dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Poole 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Xiao et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Soylu and Marino 2016</xref>). Unlike phosphorylation, which allosterically communicates with distal sites through positively charged residues that coordinate the phosphate group, it is largely unclear how the redox state of a T-loop localized Cys residue may alter the catalytic activity of a kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Garrido Ruiz et al. 2022</xref>), although a change in the activation segment conformation is a likely outcome, as demonstrated by careful analysis of Ser/Thr kinases, notably members of the AGC-family kinase AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Su et al. 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The human AMPK-related kinase (ARK) family, consisting of 14 members (termed BRSK1-2, NUAK1-2, SIK1-3, MARK1-4, MELK, and AMPKα1 and AMPKα2) are fundamental regulators of cellular metabolism, growth, differentiation, and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shao et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shirwany and Zou 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zmijewski et al. 2010</xref>), and BRSK1/2 function upstream of redox-based signaling to the pleiotropic transcription factor Nrf2 (Tamir, Drewry, et al. 2020; Tamir, Bowman, et al. 2020). Like other ARK members, BRSK1/2 possess similar structural organization, consisting of an N-terminal serine/threonine catalytic (kinase) domain, which is followed by a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, a C-terminal spacer, and in some members, a kinase-associated (KA1) domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bright, Thornton, and Carling 2009</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). In addition to sharing structural homology, all ARKs (except for MELK) are known to be activated by phosphorylation on their T-Loop by the common upstream regulator LKB1, which is constitutively catalytically active in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lizcano et al. 2004</xref>). All of the ARKs contain an activation loop ‘T-loop + 2 Cys’ residue, which can be prognostic for redox regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>), and the catalytic activities of several members have been demonstrated experimentally to be modulated by ROS, including the nominative member, AMPKα, which is both directly and indirectly regulated by redox-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Auciello et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hinchy et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Choi et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shirwany and Zou 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shao et al. 2014</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms whereby various ARKs are regulated under redox conditions remain obscure and are likely to be context specific.</p>

<p>The Brain Specific Kinases (BRSKs, also termed Synapses of Amphids Defective [SAD] kinases), consist of two paralogs in vertebrates, termed BRSK1 and BRSK2, and are among the least well-studied of the ARK family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nie et al. 2012</xref>). However, like all other members of the ARK family, BRSKs are downstream signaling targets of the Ser/Thr kinase LKB1 and also have the potential to be regulated ‘upstream’ by CAMKII, PAK1, and PKA, suggesting signal-dependent phosphorylation as a central regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alessi, Sakamoto, and Bayascas 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lizcano et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nie et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bright, Carling, and Thornton 2008</xref>). BRSKs are highly expressed in the brain and central nervous system of model organisms, where they exhibit both distinct and redundant molecular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kishi et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nakanishi et al. 2019</xref>); furthermore, they are implicated in several human pathologies, in particular neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Saiyin et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Li et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deng et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In the current study, we identify a new dominant mechanism for regulation of BRSKs through oxidative modification of conserved Cys residues within the kinase domain. We demonstrate that the catalytic activities of both BRSK1 and BRSK2 are fine-tuned through oxidative modification of the T-Loop +2 Cys residue, which communicates with a BRSK-specific Cys residue in the APE motif (CPE in BRSKs) within the activation segment. We provide evidence that the T-Loop Cys forms disulfide bonds with the ‘CPE’ motif Cys and that mutating the CPE-Cys to an alanine increases BRSK activity relative to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Using a combination of biochemical analysis, structural modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify regulatory roles for these BRSK-conserved Cys residues and characterize novel intramolecular disulfide-links, providing new insights into BRSK1/2 regulation and the broader AMPK family regulation. Together, these findings highlight complex regulatory processes for BRSK1/2 that are dependent on both phosphorylation and Cys-redox modulation, with broad implications for the other dozen members of the ARK family.</p>

Recovery of BRSK activity from oxidative inhibition was assessed by incubating BRSKs with 1 mM hydrogen peroxide, followed by infusion of 2 mM DTT and substrate phosphorylation monitoring in real time. To account for potential variability in LKB1-dependent phosphorylation of BRSK proteins, rates of kinase activity (calculated as pmol phosphate incorporation per min) for each protein was normalized by densitometry to the activation site of phosphorylation signal (established with pThr<sup>172</sup> AMPKα antibodies and ImageJ software).</p>

<p>Full length BRSK kinases share similar domain architecture to other ARK family members, including a ubiquitin associate domain (UBA) and kinase associated domain (KA1) following their kinase domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Due to the absence of known endogenous substrates selectively phosphorylated by BRSK1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tamir et al. 2020</xref>), we utilized a EGFP-Tau overexpression system in HEK-293T cells to assess BRSK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Yoshida and Goedert 2012</xref>). BRSK1 and 2, when co-expressed with EGFP-Tau, induced substantial phosphorylation of Tau at Ser 262, a modification lost in kinase-dead (KD) mutants with the catalytic aspartate in the ‘HRD’ motif mutated to alanine (D146<sup>BRSK1</sup> or D141<sup>BRSK2</sup>), as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>. The catalytic output of purified full length human BRSK1 &amp; 2 purified from Sf21 cells was next monitored in real-time using a microfluidic kinase assays system and a generic ARK family substrate peptide AMARA (5-FAM-AMARAASAAALARRR-COOH), which is phosphorylated by BRSK1/2, but not the upstream kinase LKB1. In the absence of reducing agents (buffer alone), detectable peptide phosphorylation was extremely low for both kinases and ablated in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). In contrast, inclusion of DTT enhanced BRSK1 &amp; 2 activity by several orders of magnitude (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). Moreover, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent inhibition of catalysis could be reversed, and even increased relative to basal activity, with the subsequent addition of a bolus of the reducing agent DTT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1c</xref>). BRSK proteins were rapidly activated by DTT in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting an obligate requirement of an appropriate reducing environment in order to enable catalytic activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 2a-b</xref>).

At the highest concentrations of peroxide treatment, we detected a reduction in total BRSK protein levels, suggesting a potential loss of stability for both kinases. Chronic oxidative stress was next stimulated by supplementing culture medium with (2 U/mL) glucose oxidase to facilitate constitutive steady-state generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Askoxylakis et al. 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mueller et al. 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Truong et all, 2016</xref>).

The T-loop + 2 Cys corresponds to C191<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> in BRSK1 and 2 respectively. This residue is located within the canonical activation segment, in close proximity to the regulatory site of LKB1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, mapping of Cys residues across the human ARK family reveals several conserved Cys located throughout their kinase domains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a and b</xref>). However, these studies also reveal a distinguishing Cys residue that is unique to the catalytic domain of human BRSKs, which is located at the canonical alanine position of the “APE” motif, converting it to “CPE” (C198<sup>BRSK1</sup>/ C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). Of note, the unusual CPE Cys forms an intramolecular disulfide with the T-loop +2 Cys (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). Intramolecular dimers incorporating T-loop Cys have also been identified in MELK and AKT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cao et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huang et al. 2003</xref>). MELK is exceptional in that it possesses both a T-loop +1 as well as a T-loop +2 Cys, where the T-loop +1 Cys forms an intramolecular disulfide with a Cys proximal to the DFG motif and the T-loop +2 can form an intermolecular disulfide potentiating dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cao et al. 2013</xref>). In the case of AKT2, the T-loop +2 Cys forms an intramolecular disulfide with a Cys equivalent to that seen in MELK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huang et al. 2003</xref>). In addition to the T+2 Cys, most human ARK family members (with the exception of MELK) contain an additional conserved Cys positioned 7 residues upstream of the HRD motif (HRD-7 Cys) located in the E-helix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a and b</xref>). BRSKs share the HRD-7 Cys (C147<sup>BRSK1</sup>/ C132<sup>BRSK2</sup>), but further diverge from other ARK family members with the insertion of an additional potential disulfide bond-forming Cys residues preceding the HRD motif in the catalytic loop (CHRD-Cys, C153<sup>BRSK1</sup>/ C138<sup>BRSK2</sup> in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a and b</xref>).</p>

<title>Phylogenetic analysis of BRSK protein sequences</title>
<p>A sequence-based analysis reveals the emergence of an early BRSK1 variant, which we term ‘proto-BRSK1’ that distinguishes it from the closely related AMPKs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1a</xref>). This is followed by a subsequent expansion of BRSK1 and 2 sequences that coincides with the appearance of vertebrates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>). Sequence alignment of BRSK catalytic domains from a diverse array of organisms, including the ancestral paralog and invertebrate specific proto-BRSK1, confirmed general sequence similarity and tight conservation of T-loop and HRD proximal Cys ‘pairs’ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>). Interestingly, all BRSK domains also possess a Cys residue in the N-terminal β2-β3 loop (C54<sup>BRSK1</sup>/ C42<sup>BRSK2</sup>), and BRSK2 contains an additional residue at this site, C39<sup>BRSK2</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>). The diversification of BRSKs from AMPKs also correlates with an increase in the total number of Cys residues in the kinase domain (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1a</xref>). Analysis of 2805 ARK-related sequences confirmed significant conservation of the T-loop + 2 and HRD-7 Cys, which were found respectively in ∼18 % and ∼10 % of ePKs across diverse eukaryotic species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>). These Cys residues were invariant in vertebrate BRSK sequences, as were the BRSK specific CPE and HRD-1 Cys residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>). Unsurprisingly, substitution of the APE Ala (PKA position 206, found in ∼65 % of ePKs) with a Cys is extremely uncommon (∼1 %) in nearly all protein kinases, given the critical role of this motif in stabilizing the C-lobe and substrate interactions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1b</xref>). The distribution of amino acids at HRD-1 position is much more variable in ePKs, with Ile and Val being most commonly conserved (∼36 and 30 % respectively) and a Cys appearing with similar low frequency (∼ 2% (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 1b</xref>). The high degree of conservation observed for these Cys residues within vertebrate BRSKs indicates that they play critical functional or structural roles in these kinases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>). This further suggests that diversification of the BRSKs in metazoans correlated with the accumulation of close proximity Cys ‘pairs’ with the potential to form regulatory disulfide bonds.</p>

<title>Cysteine residues within the kinase domain fine-tune BRSK activity</title>
<p>To assess the role of BRSK domain Cys residues in modulating catalytic activity, we expressed and purified wild-type (WT) and Cys-to-Ala variants of the BRSK1 and 2 kinase domains in <italic>E. coli</italic>. These Cys-to-Ala variants included T-loop +2 Cys mutants (C191A<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C176A<sup>BRSK2</sup>), and T-loop CPE mutants (C198A<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C183A<sup>BRSK2</sup>), expressed either in a WT or mutant T-loop +2 Cys background (C191/198A<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C176/183A<sup>BRSK2</sup>). We also generated double mutants of the Cys residues upstream of the HRD motif (C147/153A<sup>BRSK1</sup> and BRSK2 C132/138A<sup>BRSK2</sup>), and the unique N-terminal Cys pair in BRSK2 (C39/42A<sup>BRSK2</sup>). All recombinant BRSK proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified without DTT. Crucially, we were able to detect intramolecular disulfide bonds (C191<sup>BRSK1</sup> <bold>-</bold> C198<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> <bold>-</bold> C183<sup>BRSK2</sup>) in the WT proteins by LC-MS/MS (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 3</xref>). Interestingly, we could only identify an HRD proximal disulfide bond (C147<sup>BRSK1</sup> <bold>-</bold> C153<sup>BRSK1</sup>) in BRSK1 under these specific experimental conditions (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 3</xref>). We next probed for mixed disulfide formation in the presence of glutathione, using an antibody that recognizes glutathionylated proteins. We detected robust glutathionylation of both BRSK1 and BRSK2 in the presence of either reduced (GSH) or oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, and the signal strength inversely correlated with the presence of DTT (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 4a</xref>). Of note, all of the BRSK Cys-to-Ala mutants studied here could be readily glutathionylated, which supports the existence of multiple reactive Cys residues within the kinase domains of BRSK1 and 2. To detect alterations in redox regulation, all BRSK proteins were first activated by incubation with LKB1, and T-loop phosphorylation was confirmed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 4b</xref>). The active BRSK1/2 kinases were then assayed using the specific AMARA peptide in the presence or absence of fixed concentrations of DTT, and kinase activity was normalized to pBRSK signal derived from <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 4b</xref>. In agreement with our previous findings with full-length BRSKs, DTT was strongly activating for WT variants of both kinases, and this effect was severely blunted for the T-loop +2 Cys-Ala mutants, which exhibited lower basal rates of peptide phosphorylation. This is entirely consistent with our previous observations for Cys-based mutants of analogous residues in a range of distinct Ser/Thr kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a and b</xref>). Of note, despite sharing ∼95% sequence identity within their kinase domain, LKB1-activated BRSK2 demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity compared to BRSK1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref> compared to a). Perhaps unsurprisingly, given their distant location on an N-lobe loop, mutation of the BRSK2 exclusive C39<sup>BRSK2</sup> and C42<sup>BRSK2</sup> residues had limited effect on the activity of BRSK2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). In contrast, tandem mutation of the HRD proximal Cys residues resulted in pronounced abrogation of kinase activity, regardless of assay conditions for both kinases (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a and b</xref>). Given the near absolute conservation of the HRD-7 Cys in the ARK family of protein kinases, it is possible that this residue (C147<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C132<sup>BRSK2</sup>) is functionally important for catalytic activity in some yet unidentified capacity. Interestingly, mutation of the CPE motif Cys (T-loop +9 Cys), and <italic>de facto</italic> restoration of the canonical APE motif, were insufficient to blunt DTT-dependent activation of either kinase. Moreover, this mutation, which would eliminate C191<sup>BRSK1</sup> <bold>-</bold> C198<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> <bold>-</bold> C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> disulfide bonds, increased basal (non-DTT stimulated) catalytic activity by 1.5-2-fold for both kinases. WT forms of BRSK2, and in particular BRSK1, were strongly inhibited by oxidative conditions, even when assays were preceded by DTT-dependent activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c and d</xref>). Unsurprisingly, the low levels of detectable C191A<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C176A<sup>BRSK2</sup> activity that could be measured following stimulation by DTT were completely abolished following the addition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, CPE mutants (C198A<sup>BRSK1</sup> and C183A<sup>BRSK2</sup>) were sharply activated by DTT but still exhibited further oxidative inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c and d</xref>), although to a lesser extent than their WT counterparts, particularly in the case of BRSK1.</p>

<p>To ensure that the observed variations in activity between variants of BRSK1/2 were not a consequence of structural impairment, we also performed differential scanning fluorometry (DSF) to assess protein folding and stability.

<title>Cellular analysis of BRSK Cys-based regulation</title>
<p>We next evaluated the relative contributions of the conserved T-loop Cys residues to BRSK redox sensitivity in a cellular context using our EGFP-Tau HEK-293T co-expression system and full length BRSK proteins. Mirroring our peptide-based kinase assays, loss of the T-loop +2 Cys residue evoked a marked decrease in BRSK-dependent Tau phosphorylation <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). In contrast, mutation of the CPE Cys to an alanine consistently increased overall Tau phosphorylation (∼1.5 and ∼1.2 fold increase relative to WT BRSK1 and BRSK2 respectively) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). Interestingly, the CPE mutations preserved BRSK redox sensitivity in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, and inclusion of GSH was sufficient to restore BRSK-dependent pTau signals. Finally, we extended our analysis to consider the BRSK1 and 2 HRD motif proximal cysteines, and the BRSK2 exclusive C39/C42 pair. As predicted, Tau phosphorylation by BRSK2 C39/42A (which closely matched the activity profile of WT BRSK2 in our <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>)) was comparable to that observed for WT (but still less than hyper-active BRSK2 C183A) and was also similarly inhibited by the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 4e</xref>). Using the AMARA peptide as a substrate, we previously demonstrated that BRSK1 C147/153A and BRSK2 C132/138A were catalytically compromised (in a manner resembling the respective T-loop + 2 Cys-Ala mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>)). It is consistent that BRSK2 C132/138A was unable to increase pTau signal above background levels (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 4e</xref>).

<title>Cysteine modifications alter critical structural interactions required for kinase allosteric regulation</title>
<p>We next sought to investigate the structural basis for redox-dependent regulation of BRSK activity using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis established that oxidative conditions inhibit the active, T-loop phosphorylated form of BRSKs, and so our simulations were performed on an ‘active’ conformation of BRSK2 generated using AlphaFold2 (see methods). Cysteine residues can undergo both reversible (sulfenic) and irreversible (sulfonic) oxidation, and so sulfenic acid or sulfonic acid forms of Cys were incorporated at the C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> and C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> positions. Additionally, the impact of a non-redox active ‘silent’ Ala residue was also modelled at these sites.</p>
<p>The T+2 C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> is in close proximity to threonine T174<sup>BRSK2</sup>, phosphorylation of which stabilizes the kinase domain in an active conformation through salt bridge interactions with charged residues in the catalytic loop (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6a</xref>). In particular, R140<sup>BRSK2</sup> in the canonical HRD motif coordinates with the phosphate group of pT174<sup>BRSK2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Nolen, Taylor, and Ghosh 2004</xref>). Simulations demonstrate that the R140<sup>BRSK2</sup>-pT174<sup>BRSK2</sup> salt bridge is preserved across the entire MD simulation, as demonstrated by the contact map (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6b</xref>). In the C176Ala<sup>BRSK2</sup> simulations, the coordination between R140<sup>BRSK2</sup> and pT174<sup>BRSK2</sup> is partially attenuated due to an increase in the flexibility of pT174<sup>BRSK2</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6c</xref>). This predicted increase in flexibility may explain the loss of BRSK2 catalytic activity for C176A<sup>BRSK2</sup> mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). However, oxidative modification of C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> did not result in a substantial disruption of the salt bridge interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6d,e</xref>).

<p>In contrast to C176<sup>BRSK2</sup>, C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> within the CPE motif is buried in the C-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, and the SH group of C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> is pointed toward a canonical salt bridge that forms between the glutamate (E185<sup>BRSK2</sup>) in the APE/CPE motif and R259<sup>BRSK2</sup> in the I-helix (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6f</xref>). The E185-R259 salt bridge is a eukaryotic protein kinase (EPK)-specific interaction that is critical for maintaining the EPK fold and for allosterically coupling the T-Loop to distal substrate binding and regulatory sites (Yang et al. 2012; Oruganty and Kannan 2012). The selective conservation of Cys in place of Ala in the APE motif represents an interesting divergence of BRSKs from other ARK family kinases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp fig 1</xref>). When C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> is in a reduced form or mutated to an alanine, the E185-R259 is maintained throughout the MD simulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6g</xref>/i) Remarkably, in simulations incorporating oxidative modification of C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> we observed the immediate breaking of the E185-R259 salt bridge, and this contact remains broken throughout the simulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6h,j</xref>). Oxidation of C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> to either sulfenic or sulfonic acid rewires this salt bridge, with R259<sup>BRSK2</sup> exclusively interacting with the oxidized C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> while E185<sup>BRSK2</sup> pivots outward and becomes more solvent-exposed. Thus, oxidized C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> mediated disruption of E185-R259 <sup>BRSK2</sup> salt bridge represents a unique inactive state in BRSKs which breaks the allosteric network that allows cross-communication between the T-loop and the C-Lobe.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, simulations incorporating intramolecular disulfide bonds identified in MS/MS experiments did not indicate any major changes in dynamics resulting from either the Cys132-138 or the Cys176-183 disulfide bond formation.

To evaluate the formation of intermolecular disulfides, we subjected purified kinase domains of BRSK1 and 2 isolated from <italic>E. coli</italic> to non-reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by western blotting to probe for higher order BRSK structures (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). This revealed multiple species of each kinases possessing drastically decreased electrophoretic mobility compared to the major BRSK1/2 monomer bands. These species increased in abundance in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and were absent when DTT was included. Of particular significance was the appearance of a prominent oxidation-dependent species at ∼70 kDa, the approximate molecular weight of a BRSK dimer. Consistently, all higher molecular weight species resolved into a single monomer band after reducing (+DTT) SDS-PAGE, which strongly implicates disulfide bond-dependent oligomerization. Curiously, mutation of the T+2 Cys had no discernable effect on the formation of BRSK oligomers, although this is consistent with our previous observation of multiple reactive Cys residues in BRSKs that may be capable of forming a broad variety of intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, it is noteworthy that even in the presence of peroxide, the majority of the BRSK1 and 2 proteins existed as a monomeric species, which suggests that oligomerization is unlikely to be the primary driver of oxidative inhibition that we detect in kinase-based peptide assays. Furthermore, we detected interactions between BRSK1 and BRSK2 (suggesting homo- and heterodimer formation) after co-immunoprecipitation of alternatively tagged variants of the full length proteins overexpressed in the HEK-293T system (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 6a</xref>).</p>

<p>Using SEC-MALS, we confirmed that BRSK1 and 2 (purified in the absence of DTT) were near-uniformly monomeric in solution, but possessed the potential to self-associate and form dimers. The molar mass points across the monomer peak indicates a high degree of homogeneity (weight-average molar mass <italic>M<sub>w</sub></italic> = ∼42 kDa ± 0.99 % and ∼43 kDa ± 0.25 %, respectively <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 6b and c</xref>). Interestingly, the BRSK2 spectra included a high molecular weight shoulder of an approximate dimer size (<italic>M<sub>w</sub></italic> = ∼75 kDa ± 2.1 %) that exhibited non-uniform molar mass points indicative of a heterogenous population (likely as a consequence of poor separation between the two peaks and higher order oligomers). SEC-MALS also confirmed the presence of a BRSK species of approximate dimer size (<italic>M<sub>w</sub></italic> = ∼80 kDa) for C183<sup>BRSK2</sup> that was noticeably absent for C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 6d and e</xref>). Although the major species observed for both mutants was a monomer, the inability to detect dimer-like peaks for C176<sup>BRSK2</sup> may suggest that the T-+2 Cys plays a role in dimerisation. Although we have searched for BRSK1/2 inter-molecular disulfide bonds in our LC-MS/MS data in an attempt to characterize the mechanism of dimer formation, we were unable to identify any inter-molecular linked peptides. This is likely due to the extremely low abundance of these dimeric species in this sample (thus yielding a very small proportion of inter-linked tryptic peptides) and/or because inter-molecular disulfide linked tryptic peptides are too large for identification using this analytical pipeline. Collectively these findings confirm that the isolated kinase domains of both BRSKs primarily occupy a largely monomeric conformation and can form limited higher order redox-sensitive oligomers via covalent S-S bonds <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, although reversible oxidation-based inactivation of BRSK1 and 2 is apparent in full-length BRSK1 and 2, it remains to be determined to what extent multimerization modulates BRSK catalytic activity (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) or how these mechanisms might contribute to signaling-based interactions in cells.</p>

<p>Redox regulation of kinases and other signaling molecules is a rapidly expanding field of research, which has recently extended far beyond the early observations of oxidative inhibition in protein tyrosine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brandes, Schmitt, and Jakob 2009</xref>). More recent enquiries have provided strong evidence for direct regulative oxidative modification of Met and Cys residues across divergent protein kinase families, providing temporal and spatial control of their catalytic outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Corcoran and Cotter 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Truong and Carroll 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jarvis, Hughes, and Ledgerwood 2012</xref>). However, despite the prevalence of this regulatory mechanism, the structural basis to explain how redox-active cysteines contribute to allosteric control of catalytic activity is still in its infancy. In this study, we demonstrate, for the first time, that two T-loop +2 Cys-containing members of the ARK family, BRSK1 and 2, are reversibly inactivated by oxidative-dependent mechanisms <italic>in vitro</italic> and in human cells. Moreover, we uncover a multifaceted redox-activity profile for human BRSKs, involving functional Cys-pairs that are conserved within the catalytic domains of these understudied enzymes. In contrast to Ser/Thr kinases such as Aurora A, where a single Cys residue is the dominant driver of redox-sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tsuchiya et al. 2020</xref>), BRSK1 and 2 possess multiple sulfenylation-prone Cys residues. Additionally, the close proximity of distinct Cys ‘pairs’ permits the formation of two intramolecular disulfide bonds: the first forming between two HRD-motif proximal sites, and the second bridging the conserved T-loop + 2 and unique ‘CPE’ motif Cys residues. We propose a model where disulfide bond formation can impose a steric block on kinase activity whilst structural perturbations, likely emanating from sulfenylation of conserved BRSK family Cys residues within critical kinase regulatory motifs, provides an additional layer of tunable regulation Validation of these reversibly oxidized Cys species is also of relevance as this may implicate a mechanistic role for ROS sensing in the largely obscure BRSK signaling pathways that operate in different cell types, including those that impact on canonical redox pathways that lead to NRF2 inactivation in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tamir et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Multilayered redox regulation of BRSKs</title>
<p>The strategic positioning of Cys residues near key regulatory elements in the T-Loop suggests an evolutionary adaptation for ROS-based sensing in protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beenstock, Mooshayef, and Engelberg 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pearce, Komander, and Alessi 2010</xref>). Full kinase activity typically requires T-Loop phosphorylation, a process further modulated by mechanisms like allosteric activation in Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eyers et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bayliss et al. 2003</xref>) and activation of CAMKs by CaM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rellos et al. 2010</xref>). ARK family kinases, such as BRSK1 and 2, are primed by phosphorylation in the T-loop of a single Thr residue by the master regulatory kinase LKB1. However, our findings suggest that oxidation (or reduction) of key reactive Cys residues in the kinase domains of BRSK1 /2 might provide a ‘dominant’ regulatory oversight of enzyme output whose function in cells is likely controlled by subcellular compartmentalization and/or partner protein interactions.</p>
<p>The ARK family of protein kinases (typified by AMPKα), share a conserved structure with a notable conserved T-loop + 2 Cys residue, which is crucial for redox regulation, as evidenced in AMPK and other ARKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>). Mutational analysis of the T+2 Cys position in BRSKs confirms its critical role in supporting kinase activity. Interestingly, a second Cys residue (HRD-7), co-conserved in most ARKs with the exception of MELK, appears to add another regulatory dimension, with alanine substitution at this site significantly reducing BRSK1 and 2 activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supp Fig 4d</xref>3d). This is paralleled by the redox-sensitive Cys 130 in AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shao et al. 2014</xref>). Moreover, the tendency of several ARKs to form disulfide bond-dependent dimers in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nayak et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marx et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cao et al. 2013</xref>) is corroborated by crystal structures of MELK, MARK2, MARK3, and BRSK2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8b</xref>), revealing asymmetric dimers linked by disulfide bridges at the T-loop + 2 Cys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Marx et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Marx et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Murphy et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cao et al. 2013</xref>)</p>

<title>BRSK-specific adaptations relevant to Cys-based signaling?</title>
<p>BRSKs are differentiated from other ARKs and ePKs through augmentation with two unique Cys residues at the HRD-1 and T-loop +9 positions, forming a novel distinguishing ‘CPE’ motif in place of the typical APE motif found in most human protein kinases. These Cys pairs facilitate intramolecular disulfide bond formation, influencing kinase activity and conformation. This mechanism is reminiscent of AKT and MELK, where intramolecular disulfide bonds regulate kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Murata et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huang et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beullens et al. 2005</xref>). Deletion of the T-loop Cys in the CPE motif partially reduces BRSK1 and 2 auto-inhibition, suggesting multiple functional roles for these cysteines, which is supported by our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</p>
<p>Comparative evolutionary analysis indicates that approximately 1.4% of all ePKs, including AKT and MELK, have cysteines at the DFG + 2 and T-loop + 2 positions capable of forming similar disulfide bridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Byrne et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cao et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Huang et al. 2003</xref>). MELK, despite lacking the typical HRD-7 Cys of ARKs, has compensatory activation loop Cys residues that form variable disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Beullens et al. 2005</xref>). A broader analysis across human protein kinases shows 273 unique Cys pairs capable of forming disulfide bonds, suggesting a widespread regulatory mechanism in the kinome (Supp. File 1). Our findings in BRSK1 and 2 highlight an extensive intramolecular disulfide network, serving as a reversible switch for kinase activity and interaction regulation. When considering the dominant regulative role of the T-loop available T+2 Cys, it is tempting to speculate that formation of intramolecular disulfides bonds with adjacent cysteines may be protective against deleterious hyper-oxidized species and enable rapid re-activation of the kinase after emergence from oxidative stress conditions by the disulfide reductase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Krishnan et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barrett et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chen et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The identification and characterization of unique reactive Cys residues within the kinase domains of BRSK1 and 2 reveals sites of covalent-oxidative modification that may also provide an underexploited opportunity to develop targeted therapeutic strategies for BRSK-associated pathologies. Furthermore, mapping the spatial distribution of Cys across the AMPK-related kinase family provides valuable insights into potential redox hotspots that may underpin a tunable modulation of catalytic outputs with wider implications for cellular signaling. As a master regulator of metabolic homeostasis, AMPK activity is central to appropriate redox balance within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Ren and Shen 2019</xref>;</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Choi et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hawley et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zmijewski et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hinchy et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Auciello et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Shao et al. 2014</xref>), but until recently evidence of crosstalk between BRSKs and redox signaling has been less clear. However, BRSKs can indirectly modulate the cellular antioxidant response by orchestrating suppression of the transcription factor (and master regulator/sensor of the antioxidant response), NRF2, in an mTOR-dependent manner in HEK-293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tamir et al. 2020</xref>). NRF2 is targeted for proteasomal degradation by its inhibitor partner, KEAP1, and under conditions of elevated ROS, oxidation of sensor Cys residues in KEAP1 allows NRF2 to escape ubiquitination and induce transcription of the antioxidant machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baird and Yamamoto 2020</xref>). Our discovery of redox regulation in BRSKs suggests that it may be part of a multi-protein Cys-based ‘relay’ network of ROS sensitive effectors upstream of NRF2, potentially constituting a new oxidative stress signaling mechanism. Uncoupling the specific role of BRSKs in this pathway will be critical in illuminating BRSK1 and 2 physiology and their roles in neuronal function and disease and may simultaneously provide an explanation for the appearance of two functional BRSK1/2 genes in vertebrates.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>fundamental</bold> new knowledge into the role of reversible cysteine oxidation and reduction in protein kinase regulation. The data provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that intra-molecular disulfide bonds serve a repressive regulatory role in the Brain Selective Kinases (BRSK) 1 &amp; 2; part of the as yet understudied 'dark kinome'. The findings will be of broad interest to biochemists, structural biologists, and those interested in the rational design and development of next-generation kinase inhibitors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Bendzunas, Byrne et al. explore two highly topical areas of protein kinase regulation in this manuscript. Firstly, the idea that Cys modification could regulate kinase activity. The senior authors have published some standout papers exploring this idea of late, and the current work adds to the picture of how active site Cys might have been favoured in evolution to serve critical regulatory functions. Second, BRSK1/2 are understudied kinases listed as part of the &quot;dark kinome&quot; so any knowledge of their underlying regulation is of critical importance to advancing the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>In this study, the author pinpoints highly-conserved, but BRSK-specific, Cys residues as key players in kinase regulation. There is a delicate balance between equating what happens in vitro with recombinant proteins relative to what the functional consequence of Cys mutation might be in cells or organisms, but the authors are very clear with the caveats relating to these connections in their descriptions and discussion. Accordingly, by extension, they present a very sound biochemical case for how Cys modification might influence kinase activity in cellular environs.</p>

<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed my concerns.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study by Bendzunas et al, the authors show that the formation of intra-molecular disulfide bonds involving a pair of Cys residues near the catalytic HRD motif and a highly conserved T-Loop Cys with a BRSK-specific Cys at an unusual CPE motif at the end of the activation segment function as repressive regulatory mechanisms in BSK1 and 2. They observed that mutation of the CPE-Cys only, contrary to the double mutation of the pair, increases catalytic activity in vitro and drives phosphorylation of the BRSK substrate Tau in cells. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that oxidation of the CPE-Cys destabilizes a conserved salt bridge network critical for allosteric activation. The occurrence of spatially proximal Cys amino acids in diverse Ser/Thr protein kinase families suggests that disulfide-mediated control of catalytic activity may be a prevalent mechanism for regulation within the broader AMPK family. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying kinase regulation by redox-active Cys residues is fundamental as it appears to be widespread in signaling proteins and provides new opportunities to develop specific covalent compounds for the targeted modulation of protein kinases.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that intramolecular cysteine disulfide bonding between conserved cysteines can function as a repressing mechanism as indicated by the effect of DTT and the consequent increase in activity by BSK-1 and -2 (WT). The cause-effect relationship of why mutation of the CPE-Cys only increases catalytic activity in vitro and drives phosphorylation of the BRSK substrate Tau in cells is not clear to me. The explanation given by the authors based on molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations is that oxidation of the CPE-Cys (that will favor disulfide bonding) destabilizes a conserved salt bridge network critical for allosteric activation. However, no functional evidence of the impact of the salt-bridge network is provided. If you mutated the two main Cys-pairs (aE-CHRD and A-loop T+2-CPE) you lose the effect of DTT, as the disulfide pairs cannot be formed, hence no repression mechanisms take place, however when looking at individual residues I do not understand why mutating the CPE only results in the opposite effect unless it is independent of its connection with the T+2residue on the A-loop.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an important and interesting study providing new knowledge in the protein kinase field with important therapeutic implications for the rationale design and development of next-generation inhibitors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed my concerns.</p>
<p>I suggest some minor edits, however. Line 747 does not mention MARK3 and neither does the figure 8 legend (just MARK2). It would be helpful if the authors could include references to the papers reporting the shown structures in the Figure 8 legend</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added MARK3 and related references in the revised Figure 8 legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>I would recommend that the catalog numbers from the different antibodies used in the study, mainly CST and Invitrogen are depicted in material and methods (see Methods/Recombinant proteins and general reagents).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. We have now added the antibody catalog numbers in the revised methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I have one remark related to question number 5 (my question was not clear enough). I meant if the authors did look at the functional relevance of the residues implicated in the identified salt-bridge network/tethers. What happens to the proteins functionally when you mutate those residues? (represented on Fig. 8).</p>
<p>Otherwise, the authors have satisfactorily addressed my concerns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we have analyzed the stability of the salt bridge interaction in the context of cysteine mutations, and our findings are described in the results section titled “Cysteine mutations alter critical structural interactions required for kinase allosteric regulation Figure 6)”. However, we have not performed mutational analysis of the salt bridge residues as we feel this would be beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
