<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Optimistically biased belief updating is essential for mental health and resilience in adversity. Here, we asked how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic affected optimism biases in updating beliefs about the future. One hundred and twenty-three participants estimated the risks of experiencing adverse future life events in the face of beliefdisconfirming evidence either outside the pandemic (n=58) or during the pandemic (n=65). While belief updating was optimistically biased and Reinforcement-learning-like outside the pandemic, the bias faded, and belief updating became more rational Bayesian-like during the pandemic. This malleability of anticipating the future during the COVID-19 pandemic was further underpinned by a lower integration of positive belief-disconfirming information, fewer but stronger negative estimations, and more confidence in base rates. The findings offer a window into the putative cognitive mechanisms of belief updating during the COVID-19 pandemic, driven more by quantifying the uncertainty of the future than by the motivational salience of optimistic outlooks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anticipating the future is an essential part of human thinking. These beliefs guide how we understand the world; updating them is vital for learning to make better predictions and to generalize across contexts. Interestingly, belief updating tends to be optimistically biased(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Even when confronted with negative information, humans often downplay its importance to maintain an optimistic view of the future. The underlying mechanism of optimistically biased belief updating involves an asymmetry in learning from positive and negative belief-disconfirming information(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This optimism bias can be formalized in two ways(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Reinforcement learning (RL) models assume that belief updating is proportional to the estimation error, which reflects a form of surprise when we face information that disconfirms our initial beliefs. For example, the positive surprise of learning that the risk of contracting a disease is lower than initially thought implies a motivational salience, guiding toward lowering the initial risk estimation and avoiding worsening beliefs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, many aspects of human reasoning, including belief updating, can be formalized using Bayes’ rule. Bayesian updating models assume that initial beliefs are prior probabilities or guesses that express how strongly a person predicts future life events within a finite set of possible outcomes before being presented evidence in line and at odds with this initial belief. Following Bayes’ rule, a belief is updated by combining the observed evidence for the initial belief with its likelihood ratio, which expresses the evidence’s diagnosticity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). For example, updating one’s risk for contracting a disease in a Bayesian way means quantifying the uncertainty of this event for oneself compared to others. This can be optimal and non-biased, which we refer to here as rational Bayesian. On the contrary, it can be optimistically biased, with more Bayesian beliefs updating when the odds against contracting a disease are favorable.</p>
<p>Although RL-like and Bayesian updating models make different assumptions about the updating strategy, they are complementary and powerful formalizations of human reasoning. Both models provide insight into hidden, latent variables of the updating process. Most notably, the learning rate indicates how quickly a person updates their beliefs. It comprises two free parameters: The scaling parameter weighs how much the estimation error is considered following an RL-like updating model or the product of the evidence for the prior and its diagnosticity following a Bayesian updating model. The asymmetry parameter expresses how much this scaling differs in the face of positive and negative belief-disconfirming evidence. Both the scaling and asymmetry parameters can vary between individuals and contexts and, through this variance, offer possible explanations for the idiosyncrasy in belief-updating behavior and its deviation from rationality.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic represented a chronic, adverse life context, drastically altering individual and social realities. The existing literature documenting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated changes in everyday life on mental health has shown that stress, anxiety, and depression have increased during the pandemic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that belief updating during reversal learning became more erratic and was linked to a rise in paranoia during the COVID-19 pandemic across the US(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, it is unknown how optimism biases in belief updating about the future and their underlying putative mechanisms changed during the experience of such an unprecedented, adverse life event. Our hypothesis was twofold. We argued that maintaining optimistically biased belief updating under lasting, adverse life conditions is adaptive. The optimism bias benefits exploratory behavior, reduces stress, and improves mental and physical health and well-being(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These benefits promote resilience, especially for fitness and survival during a pandemic(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, optimism biases can lead to suboptimal decision-making. Contextual factors such as acute stress, perceived threat, and depression have been shown to reduce or even reverse optimistically biased belief updating(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). These findings suggest that optimistically biased belief updating should be weaker when experiencing a pandemic.</p>
<p>We leveraged a belief-updating dataset from 123 participants tested between 2019 and 2022 to rule between these alternative hypotheses. Among them, fifty-eight participants were tested outside the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, either in October 2019, three months before the outbreak in France (n=30) or two years later in June 2022 (n=28), after the lift of the sanitary state of emergency. Their belief updating behavior was compared to sixty-five participants tested during the sanitary state of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak in France. This was either during the first very strict lockdown of social and economic life (e.g., schools closed, stay-at-home orders, shops, and museums closed) from March to April 2020 (n=34) or one year later in Mai 2021 (n=31), when lockdowns were less strict (e.g., schools open, museums and shops closed, part-time curfew), but the COVID-19 pandemic still unfolding. Belief updating was measured by a behavioral task that asked participants to estimate their risk of experiencing adverse future life events before and after receiving information about these events’ actual base rates. Observed belief updating behavior was fitted to an RL-like and a Bayesian updating model to gain insight into potential underlying strategies of belief updating. The learning rates were compared across groups for insight into how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic changed beliefs about the future and their updating in the face of belief-disconfirming evidence.</p>

<title>Experimental design</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, a first group of 30 participants (mean age = 33.73 ± 1.96, 18 females) was recruited in October 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak in France. These participants were tested in the laboratory. A second group of 34 participants (mean age = 42.24 ± 3.34, 25 females) was recruited for online testing during the first COVID-19-related lockdown of social and economic life, with schools closed from March to April 2020. A third group of 31 participants (mean age = 42.42 ± 3.35, 20 females) was recruited and tested online immediately after the last lockdown and still during the COVID-19 pandemic in Mai 2021. A fourth group of 30 participants (mean age = 34.66 ± 2.71, 16 females) was recruited at the lift of the COVID-19 pandemic-related state of emergency and tested in the laboratory in June 2022. This group was also used to rule out an eventual effect of task design. Half of them performed a one-run (n = 15) task design, and the other half performed a two-run (n = 15) task design (e.g., see in more detail the belief updating task description below). Note the 30 participants tested before the COVID-19 pandemic were recontacted during the first strict lockdown to re-perform the belief updating task online. This allowed us to check for the effects of experiencing a COVID-19-related lockdown within the same cohort of participants. Two of the thirty participants of this group did not respond. Therefore, the sample size for the within-group test-retest analyses was 28 participants.</p>

<title>Belief Updating Task</title>
<p>All participants performed a belief-updating task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). For in-person testing, stimulus presentation and response recording were done with the Psychophysics toolbox in MATLAB (R2018b, Update 6, version 9.5.0.1265761). The online testing was done using Qualtrics (Qualtrics Software, version March 2020 of Qualtrics, Copyright 2020 Qualtrics. Available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.qualtrics.com">https://www.qualtrics.com</ext-link>).</p>
<p>The task comprised 40 trials with 40 adverse lifetime events and base rates. In each trial, participants were asked to estimate the likelihood of experiencing an adverse event in the future for themselves and somebody else before and after receiving information about the likelihood of occurrence in the general population (i.e., the base rate). The adverse life events and their actual base rates were taken from previously published work in healthy controls(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The base rates were uniformly distributed and ranged between 10 and 70%. Participants were instructed to rate their estimates between 3% and 77%.</p>
<sec id="s2-1-5-1">
<title>The task design variations:</title>
<p>Fifty-eight participants underwent assessment outside the COVID-19 pandemic, with 45 performing a two-run task design (n=30 tested before the outbreak in October 2019; n = 15 tested at the end of the sanitary state of emergency in June 2022). The remaining 13 participants tested outside the pandemic performed the one-run task design like the 65 participants tested during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the two-run task design, participants performed a first run of 40 trials. Each trial started with the display of an adverse lifetime event. Participants were asked to estimate the risk of experiencing this event in the future for themselves (E1 rating) and for somebody else (eBR rating). At the end of each trial, they received information about the event’s base rates and rated their confidence. In a second run, they saw an adverse future life event and its base rate on each trial. They then re-estimated their risk (E2 rating) on a trial-bytrial basis. The one-run task design is displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and consists of one run of 40 trials. Within each trial, participants first estimated the risk of experiencing a future adverse lifetime event for themselves (E1 rating) and for somebody else (eBR rating), were presented with the base rate for this event (BR), rated their confidence in the base rate and re-estimated their risk of experiencing the event in the future (E2 rating). Note that all analyses were controlled for these differences in task design, which had non-significant effects on belief updating, confidence ratings, estimation error magnitude, and learning rates (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">SI tables 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">7</xref>).</p>

<title>The estimation error was further used to categorize trials into good or bad news trials:</title>

<p>A positive difference indicated that participants updated their beliefs about their lifetime risks of experiencing adverse life events more frequently following good news than bad news.</p>
<p>For each participant, trials that did not receive a response (on average of 0.44 trials per subject) and trials with an EE = 0 (on average of 0.63 trials per subject) were excluded from the analyses.</p>
<p>The distance measured the extent to which participants consider their probability of experiencing a given adverse event (E1) different from the lifetime risk of someone from a similar socio-economic background (eBR). If positive, it reflected an optimistic bias in initial estimates. The following, distance = eBR — E1, was calculated.</p>

<title>Model-free statistical analyses of observed belief updating behavior:</title>
<p>The main aim of this study was to assess how belief updating was affected by the context of experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>We, therefore, conducted between-context analyses, contrasting groups tested during (i.e., during the first lockdown in March/April 2020 and immediately after the last lockdown one year later in Mai 2021) and outside the pandemic context (i.e., before the outbreak in October 2019 and one year after the pandemic in June 2022). All statistical tests were conducted using the MATLAB Statistical Toolbox (MATLAB 2018b, MathWorks) and JASP (JASP 0.16.4).</p>

<p>The model included fixed effects for estimation error magnitude (|EE|), estimation error valence (EE<sub>valence</sub>, coded -1 for bad news trials and 1 for good news trials), context (coded 0 for outside and 1 for during the COVID-19 pandemic), task design (coded 1 for one-run, 2 for two-run design), age, gender (coded 0 for male, 1 for female participants), level of education, and the interaction of interest EE valence by context. The model also included random intercepts nested by subject number and random slopes for estimation error magnitude and valence.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the same Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model was applied again to the absolute belief update to explore the categorical effect of context in conjunction with EE valence. This allowed for a more specific comparison of the impact of EE valence between contexts (groups): those tested before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in October 2019 (baseline) compared to those tested during the initial COVID-19-related lockdown (context 1), those tested immediately after the last lockdown during the pandemic in Mai 2021 (context 2), and those tested one year post-pandemic in June 2022 (context 3), respectively.</p>

<p>For both types of trials, the learning rate was composed of two components that varied across participants. The scaling parameter (S) measured the extent to which a participant took the prediction error into account when updating beliefs. The asymmetry parameter (A) indicated to what extent the belief updating differed for positive and negative estimation errors. The priors for scaling and asymmetry were untransformed and unbound. The mean of the prior distribution for scaling was set to 1. Thus, a scaling of 1 meant that the updating magnitude equaled the estimation error magnitude. The mean of the prior distribution for the asymmetry parameter was set to zero. An asymmetry parameter value larger than zero meant positively biased updating, whereas an asymmetry parameter smaller than zero meant negatively biased belief updating.</p>

The procedure was the same as reported in Bottemanne et al. 2022(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). In short, to validate the accuracy of the fitting procedure in providing meaningful parameter values, simulated belief updating data was generated using the observed parameter values for both the optimistic RL model and the optimistic Bayesian updating model. Subsequently, we applied the fitting procedure to these simulated data to iteratively ‘recover’ the parameters. Thereby, the means of the parameters were set to correspond to the observed sample means (i.e., scaling = 0.37 ± 0.02, asymmetry = 0.06 ± 0.01 for the RL model; scaling = 0.40 ± 0.02, asymmetry = 0.04 ± 0.01 for the Bayesian model). This process was iterated to simulate 40 values of belief updates 123 times. The model was then inverted by fitting it to the simulated data, yielding a new set of recovered values for scaling and asymmetry. Finally, the recovered and estimated parameters were compared by assessing their correlation using Pearson’s correlation coefficients.</p>

<title>Effects of experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic on the optimism bias in belief updating</title>
<p>A linear mixed effects (LME) model was fitted to absolute belief updates to test whether belief updating was less or more biased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The model found a significant interaction estimation error valence by context (β = -5.54, SE = 1.69, t(232) = -3.28, p = 0.001, 95% CI [-8.87 – -2.21]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">SI table 2</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref>, the optimism bias in belief updating disappeared during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to participants tested outside the pandemic. More specifically, it was decreased among participants tested during the initial COVID-19-related strict lockdown in March and April 2020 (EEvalence by context 1: β = -7.39, SE = 2.29, t(228) = -3.32, p = 0.002, 95% CI [-11.91 – -2.86]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">SI table 3</xref>), as well as in Mai 2021 (EEvalence by context 2: β = -5.59, SE = 2.36, t(228) = -2.37, p = 0.02, 95% CI [-10.24 – -0.93]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">SI table 3</xref>), compared to those tested before the outbreak in October 2019, respectively. The bias re-emerged among participants tested one year later at the time of the lift of the sanitary state of emergency in June 2022, returning to levels akin to those observed before the pandemic in October 2019 (EEvalence by context 3: β = -2.11, SE = 2.46, t(228) = -0.86, p = 0.39, 95% CI [-6.95 – 2.73]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">SI table 3</xref>). The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on belief updating was driven by a significant decrease in belief updating following good news during the pandemic compared to participants tested outside the pandemic (t(121) = 2.66, p = 0.009, Cohen’s d = 0.48, two sampled, two-tailed t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). No contextual group difference was observed for belief updating following bad news (t(121) = -1.77, p = 0.08, Cohen’s d = -0.32, two sampled, two-tailed t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This effect could be reproduced when fitting an analogous LME to belief updates observed in a group of participants (n=28) who were tested both before and during the pandemic (EE valence by context interaction: β = -7.66, SE = 1.49, t(103) = -5.13, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-10.62 – 4.70]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">SI figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">SI table 4</xref>). Note that all effects were controlled for participant age, years of higher education, gender, confidence in the base rates, belief updating task design, and estimation error magnitude.</p>

<title>Effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on belief updating variables</title>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic influenced participants’ confidence in the base rates, with significantly lower confidence ratings observed among those tested outside the pandemic compared to those tested during it (β = 14.11, SE = 4.52, t(233) = 3.12, p = 0.002, 95% CI [5.19 – 23.02]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">SI Table 5</xref>). Moreover, a significant interaction of EE valence by context (β = 2.19, SE = 0.67, t(233) = 3.28, p = 0.001, 95% CI [0.88 – 3.51]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">SI Table 6</xref>) was found for absolute estimation error magnitude. This finding indicated that participants tested during the pandemic overestimated their risk of experiencing adverse future life events relative to base rates more largely than participants tested outside the pandemic (t(121) = -3.01, p = 0.003, Cohen’s d = -0.54, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). On the contrary, the two groups did not differ significantly in the magnitude of negative estimation errors (i.e., initial underestimations relative to base rates, t(121) = -0.49, p = 0.63, Cohen’s d = -0.09, two-sampled, two-tailed t-tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). This finding contrasts with the observed difference in how often they made positive estimation errors (i.e., the number of good news trials). Participants tested during the pandemic overestimated less frequently than participants tested outside the pandemic (t(121) = 2.40, p = 0.02, Cohen’s d = 0.43). No significant difference between groups was found for the frequency of underestimations (i.e., reflected by the number of bad news trials; t(121) = -1.85, p = 0.07, Cohen’s d = -0.33). These results indicated that participants held fewer but more negative future outlooks during the pandemic compared to those tested outside the pandemic.</p>

<title>Effects of COVID-19-related lockdown on putative mechanisms of belief updating.</title>
<p>We then sought to identify which putative strategy participants used to update their beliefs about the future during and outside the pandemic. To answer this question, we used computational modeling and model comparisons to rule between twelve alternative models. This approach revealed that belief updating outside the pandemic was more RL-like and optimistic (pxp = 1, Ef = 0.77), while during the pandemic, it was best explained by a rational Bayesian updating model (pxp = 0.90, Ef = 0.43; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a-c</xref>).

<title>Effects of the Covid-19-related lockdown on hidden, latent variables of belief updating</title>
<p>Next, we compared the effects of experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic on the learning rates and its components.</p>
<p>A linear mixed effects model (LME), analogous to the LME fitted to observed belief updates, was fitted to the learning rates and detected a main effect of EE valence (β = 0.09, SE = 0.01, t(236) = 7.14, p = 1.18e-11, 95% CI [0.06 – 0.11]), and a significant interaction EE valence by context (β = -0.03, SE = 0.02, t(236) = -2.11, p = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.07 – -0.002]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl8">SI table 7</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, all participants’ learning rates were lower in response to bad news than to good news. Still, the difference between good and bad news learning rates was significantly reduced for participants tested during the pandemic. In line with the observed belief updating after good and bad news, the effect of context on the learning rates was driven by a decrease in the learning rates from positive estimation errors in participants tested during the pandemic compared to participants tested outside the pandemic (t(121) = 2.17, p = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.39). Both groups did not differ in their learning rates from negative estimation errors (t(121) = 0.87, p = 0.39, Cohen’s d = 0.16, two sampled, two-tailed t-tests).</p>

<p>Parameter recovery was successful for the scaling and asymmetry components of the learning rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), which indicated that the model gave identifiable values for these parameters. We, therefore, were able to explore potential group differences in the learning rate components in more detail. Linear mixed effects modeling found a main effect of context for the asymmetry component (β = -0.04, SE = 0.02, t(117) = -2.32, p = 0.02, 95% CI [-0.07 – -0.01]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl10">SI table 9</xref>), but not for the scaling component (β = -0.07, SE = 0.05, t(117) = -1.54, p = 0.13, 95% CI [-0.16 – 0.02]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl11">SI table 10</xref>). The average asymmetry of learning rates was positive in both groups but significantly smaller in participants tested during the pandemic than those tested outside (t(121) = 2.00, p =0.048, Cohen’s d = 0.36, two-sampled, two-tailed t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). This result indicated that participants considered positive estimation errors more than negative ones but less when experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar results were found in the within-subject group (n = 28), with a significant main effect of context on asymmetry (β = -0.06, SE = 0.02, t(51) = -3.72, p = 0.001, 95% CI [-0.09 – -0.03]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl12">SI table 11</xref>), but not on alpha (β = -0.10, SE = 0.05, t(51) = -1.96, p = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.21 – 0.003]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl13">SI table 12</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the optimism bias in updating beliefs about the future. Belief updating was optimistically biased before the COVID-19 outbreak. It faded during the COVID-19 pandemic and reemerged after the pandemic. The lack of optimistically biased belief updating during the pandemic was related to three effects: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) a decreased sensitivity to positive belief-disconfirming information, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) fewer but stronger negative beliefs about the future, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>) more confidence in base rates. Computational modeling showed that a rational Bayesian model best-described belief updating during the pandemic.</p>
<p>In contrast, an optimistic RL-like model best approximated belief updating outside the pandemic. Both models showed that the attenuated optimism bias in belief updating during the pandemic was not due to a learning deficit. The groups were similar in how much they integrated overall evidence in favor or against initial beliefs. On the contrary, it was explained by a diminished learning asymmetry in considering positive belief-disconfirming evidence that paralleled the observed belief-updating behavior.</p>
<p>The finding that optimistically biased belief updating faded during the pandemic favors the hypothesis that experiencing an adverse life event such as a pandemic weakens optimistic outlooks. It further aligns with the body of research that has explored the malleability of the optimistically biased belief updating and information integration under acute threat and stress and mood disorders such as depression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). While our findings align with these previous findings, we also observed a difference. Notably, our sample tested during the pandemic considered positive, favorable information less while showing no change in negative, unfavorable information consideration. Differences in populations and task designs might explain these odds. However, it could also be specific to experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic, which involved an immediate, unpredictable, and global health threat with high uncertainty about its outcome and significant psychological repercussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Mental health assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic indicated that anxiety, stress, paranoia, and depression levels were more prevalent in the population(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the emergence of COVID-19 cases worldwide constitute a challenging situation that, in five months, has shifted from an elusive and distant threat to an immediate and drastic health and economic crisis. All citizens were confronted daily with alarming figures such as infection rates or mortality, and rather mundane everyday activities, from grocery shopping to jogging, became stressful and threatening situations during which one could catch a potentially fatal infection. Moreover, for many, the COVID-19-related lockdowns of social and economic life implied a physical cut-off from friends and relatives, and life plans, routines, and activities were severely disrupted. It also implied a substantial financial risk. Previous research has shown that economic uncertainties, particularly during marked economic inequality and epidemics, can contribute to beliefupdating fallacies reflected by the rise of conspiracy theories(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). We did not collect information about the COVID-19 infection status of participants, which precludes a direct exploration of the immediate effects of experiencing the infection on belief-updating behavior and the potential interaction with anxiety and stress levels. This limitation is noteworthy, as the impact of experiencing the pandemic on belief updating about the future could differ between those who directly experienced infection and those who remained uninfected. It is also important to acknowledge that our study was timely and geographically limited to the context of the COVID-19 outbreak in France. Cultural variations and differences in governmental responses to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 may have impacted the optimism biases differently.</p>
<p>The observed lack of optimistically biased belief updating may be interpreted as an adaptive response to the experience of an unprecedented level of uncertainty and chronic threat during a global crisis. Although we did not have access to anxiety and stress perceptions during and outside the pandemic, our computational modeling results corroborate to some extent this interpretation. Notably, belief updating was more optimistically biased RL-like outside the pandemic and more rational Bayesian-like during the pandemic. The biased RL-like updating behavior observed outside the pandemic indicated that participants relied on the motivational salience of positive estimation errors to teach them how to update their beliefs about the future by trial and error. This finding aligns with past work, showing that RL-like updating models best explain belief updating in non-threatening, non-stressful, and predictable laboratory contexts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). It further suggests that RL strategies are a computationally efficient way to guide decision-making and belief formation when the environment is stable and predictable(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). For instance, in environments with well-defined reward structures, the human brain has been shown to efficiently rely on RL and avoid a computational overhead associated with the Bayesianlike inference process(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>On the contrary, belief updating was more rational and Bayesian-like during the COVID-19 pandemic, indicating that participants weighed the uncertainty of evidence in favor of and against their prior beliefs. This finding aligns with research about Bayesian networks to model semantic knowledge processing under uncertainty ￼and with work that uses Bayes rules to understand how humans learn and choose under uncertainty(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>).</p>
<p>It is essential to acknowledge that computational modeling provides insight into potential mechanisms, but this excludes inferences on whether humans indeed update beliefs in the way the best-fitting model assumes. Other models, such as evidence accumulation models, may also work when humans update their beliefs about the future and their immediate surroundings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Unfortunately, we did not assess reaction times during belief updating, crucial for fitting evidence accumulation models such as drift-diffusion models to observed behavior. However, we can infer from our findings that the two model families employed to fit observed belief-updating behavior represented two different but complementary prediction strategies. These strategies were then used to function in the uncertainty of real-life conditions. We call for more studies investigating these computational models’ psychological and biological validity under certainty and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our results provide insight into the resilience and adaptability of beliefupdating processes during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. They demonstrate the malleability of the human ability to anticipate the future and how it can adapt to real-life conditions under which an overly optimistic view of future risks would be harmful.</p>

<p>Belief updating was compared within a group of participants (n=28), who were tested both before (October 2019) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (March-April 2020). A mixed effects linear regression analysis of belief updating showed a significant main effect of EE valence (ß = 4.05, SE = 1.22, t(103) = 3.31, p = 0.001, 95% CI [1.63 – 6.47]), as well as a significant effect of testing context (ß = -4.41, SE = 1.49, t(103) = -2.95, p = 0.004, 95% CI [-7.37 – -1.45]), and more importantly a significant EE valence by testing context interaction (ß = -7.66, SE = 1.49, t(103) = -5.13, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-10.62 – -4.70], SI <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">SI table 4</xref>). A significant main effect of gender was also found (ß = 3.53, SE = 1.64,t(103) = 2.15, p = 0.03, 95% CI [0.27 – 6.79]), with women updating their beliefs more than men. Post-hoc t-tests revealed that participants tested before the emergence of the pandemic updated their beliefs more after receiving good news (mean UPD<sub>good</sub> = 14.38 ± 1.14) than after receiving bad news (mean UPD<sub>bad</sub> = 6.23 ± 1.17; t(27) = 4.93, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.93, paired sample t-tests). This optimism bias in belief updating was not observed when the same 28 participants were tested during the first lockdown (mean UPD<sub>good</sub> = 2.25 ± 1.76; mean UPD<sub>bad</sub> = 9.30 ± 2.47; t(27) = -1.84, p = 0.08, Cohen’s d = -0.35, paired sample t-tests).</p>

<title>b. Sources of variance in belief updating.</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, participants tested during the COVID-19 pandemic showed more variance in belief updating in response to both good and bad news than those tested outside the pandemic. This variability might be because they ignored the base rates when updating their beliefs, possibly influenced by the shift to online testing during the pandemic.</p>
<p>If participants paid attention to the base rates, they were expected to update toward the base rate, yielding positive values for the update. On the contrary, ignoring the base rates can be reflected by updating away from the base rate, with second estimates (E2) that, in the case of good news trials, lay above the first estimate (E1; e.g., E1 = 60%, BR = 40 %, E2 = 70 %, UPD = E1 - E2 = -10 %). Likewise, in the case of bad news trials,second estimates may lay below the first estimate (e.g., E1 = 20 %, BR = 40 %, E2 = 10 %, UPD = E2 - E1 = -10%). We examined the number of trials with such paradoxical second estimates yielding negative values for the belief update. We found no significant difference (t(121) = 1.77, p = 0.08, Cohen’s d = 0.32) between the number of paradoxical trials in participants tested outside (6.09 ± 0.47 trials on average) and during (4.77 ± 0.56 trials on average) the pandemic. This suggests that participants tested online exhibited no greater propensity for paradoxical responses than those tested inperson.</p>
<p>Second, we tested if the observed variance in belief updating between the groups was due to second estimates that over- and undershot the base rates. For instance, individuals who undershot indicated second estimates below base rates signaling good news (e.g., E1 = 40 %, BR = 20 %, E2 = 10 %). In contrast, individuals who overshot indicated second estimates above the base rates, signaling bad news (e.g., E1 = 10%, BR = 20%, E2 = 40%). Undershooting might indicate an attuned sensitivity to good news, and overshooting an attuned sensitivity to bad news. We found that participants tested outside the COVID-19 pandemic undershot more often (on average 4.48 ± 0.46 trials) than they overshot (on average 2.38 ± 0.33 trials; t(57) = 3.76, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.49, paired-sample, two-tailed t-test). This propensity aligned with the bias to update beliefs more after good than after bad news in this group. Conversely, participants tested during the pandemic didn’t show a significant difference in the number of trials where they under- (2.00 ± 0.32 trials on average) or overshot (3.08 ± 0.73 trials on average;t(64) = -1.34, p = 0. 19, Cohen’s d = -0.17, paired-sample, two-tailed t-test), aligning with the absence of optimistically biased belief updating. Critically, when comparing the two groups, we found a significant positive interaction testing context by type of shooting (ß = 1.66, SE = 0.50, t(233) = 3.33, p = 0.001, 95% CI [0.68 – 2.65]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl15">SI table 14</xref>). Post-hoc t-tests showed that participants tested during the COVID-19 pandemic undershot more often than participants tested during the pandemic (t(121) = 4.48, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s d = 0.81, two-sample two-tailed t-test). No differences were observed between the groups regarding overshooting (t(121) = -0.84, p = 0.40, Cohen’s d = -0.15, two-sample two-tailed t-test). These findings indicated that participants tested outside the pandemic were more sensitive to good news, corroborating the findings of a more robust good news/bad news bias in belief updating found in this group.</p>

<p>Pour chacun d’entre eux, vous devrez indiquer :

<list-item><p>La probabilité qu’il se produise dans votre vie future (Pour vous: quelle est la probabilité estimée que cet évènement vous arrive)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>La probabilité que cela arrive à quelqu’un d’autre (Pour quelqu’un d’autre : selon vous, quelle est la probabilité que quelqu’un d’autre vive cet évènement) On vous montrera alors la probabilité officielle que cet évènement se produise pour une personne de votre groupe socio-démographique. Ensuite, on vous demandera de saisir :</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Votre niveau de confiance dans le taux officiel, si vous pensez qu’il est correct ou qu’il s’agit d’une erreur de sondage.</p></list-item>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study addresses the question of how large-scale events such as the COVID-19 pandemic can change peoples' beliefs and their updates. Using a well-validated task, the authors find that belief updating becomes less optimistically biased during COVID-19, compared to prior to it. While they have <bold>solid</bold> evidence for specific changes of positive learning rates in their RL model and should be commended for more extensive modeling of the task than many previous studies, comprehensive model confusion and recovery analyses could further strengthen their claims by clarifying the specificity of their findings. As with many manipulations outside the experimenters' control, it remains unclear which psychological factor impacted by the pandemic drives the group differences, and sample sizes are by necessity on the smaller side as data cannot readily be acquired.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript uses a well-validated behavioral estimation task to investigate the degree to which optimistic belief updating was attenuated during the 2020 global pandemic. Online participants recruited during and outside of the pandemic estimated how likely different negative life events were to happen to them in the future and were given statistics about these events happening. Belief updating (measured as the degree to which estimations changed after viewing the statistics) was less optimistically biased during the pandemic (compared to outside of it). This resulted from reduced updating from &quot;good news&quot; (better than expected information). Computational models were used to try to unpack how statistics were integrated and used to revise beliefs. Two families of models were compared - an RL set of models where &quot;estimation errors&quot; (analogous to prediction errors in classic RL models) predict belief change and a Bayesian set of models where an implied likelihood ratio was calculated (derived from participants estimations of their own risk and estimation of the base rate risk) and used to predict belief change. The authors found evidence that the former set of models accounted for updating better outside of the pandemic, but the latter accounted for updating during the pandemic. In addition, the RL model provides evidence that learning was asymmetrically positively biased outside of the pandemic but symmetric during it (as a result of reduced learning rates from good news estimation errors).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Understanding whether biases in learning are fixed modes of information processing or flexible and adapt in response to environmental shocks (like a global pandemic or economic recession) is an important area of research relevant to a wide range of fields, including cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and computational psychiatry. The study uses a well-validated task, and the authors conduct a power analysis to show that the sample sizes are appropriate. Furthermore, the authors test that their results hold in both a between-group analysis (the focus of the main paper) and a within-group analysis (mainly in the supplemental).</p>
<p>The finding that optimistic biases are reduced in response to acute stress, perceived threat, and depression has been shown before using this task both in the lab (social stress manipulation), in the real world (firefighters on duty), and clinical groups (patients with depression). However, the work does extend these findings here in important ways:</p>
<p>(1) Examining the effect of a new real-world adverse event (the pandemic).</p>
<p>
(2) The reduction in optimistic updating here arises due to reduced updating from positive information (previously, in the case of environmental threat, this reduction mainly arose from increased sensitivity to negative information).</p>
<p>
(3) Leveraging new RL-inspired computational approaches, demonstrating that the bias - and its attenuation - can be captured using trial-by-trial computational modeling with separate learning rates for positive and negative estimation errors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some interpretation and analysis (the computational modeling in particular) could be improved.</p>
<p>On the interpretation side, while the pandemic was an adverse experience and stressful for many people (including myself), the absence of any measures of stress/threat levels limits the conclusions one can draw. Past work that has used this task to examine belief updating in response to adverse environmental events took physiological (e.g., SCR, cortisol) and/or self-report (questionnaires) measures of mood. In SI Table 1, the authors possibly had some questionnaire measures along these lines, but this might be for the participants tested during the pandemic.</p>
<p>On the analysis side, it was unclear what the motivation was for the different sets of models tested. Both families of models test asymmetric vs symmetric learning (which is the main question here) and have similar parameters (scaling and asymmetry parameters) to quantify these different aspects of the learning process. Conceptually, the different behavioral patterns one could expect from the two families of models needed to be clarified. Do the &quot;winning&quot; models produce the main behavioral patterns in Figure 1, and are they in some way uniquely able to do so, for instance? How would updating look different for an optimistic RL learner versus an optimistic Bayesian RL learner? Would the asymmetry parameter in the former be correlated with the asymmetry parameter in the latter? Moreover, crucially, would one be able to reliably distinguish the models from one another under the model estimation and selection criteria that the authors have used here (presenting robust model recovery could help to show this)?</p>

<p>The authors investigated how experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic affected optimism bias in updating beliefs about the future. They ran a between-subjects design testing for participants on cognitive tasks before, during, and after lifting the sanitary state of emergence during the pandemic. The authors show that optimism bias varied depending on the context in which it was tested. Namely, it disappeared during COVID-19 and re-emerged at the time of lift of sanitary emergency measures. Through advanced computational modeling, they are able to thoroughly characterize the nature of such alternations, pinpointing specific mechanisms underlying the lack of optimistic bias during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Strengths pertain to the comprehensive assessment of the results via computational modeling and from a theoretical point of view to the notion that environmental factors can affect cognition. However, the relatively small sample size for each group is a limitation. A major impediment interpreting of the findings is the need for additional measures. While the information on for example, risk perception or the need for social interaction was collected from participants during the pandemic, the fact that these could not be included in the analysis hinders the interpretation of findings, which is now generally based on data collected during the pandemic, for example, reporting increased stress. While authors suggest an interpretation in terms of uncertainty of real-life conditions it is currently difficult to know if that factor drove the effect. Many concurrent elements might have accounted for the findings. This limits understanding of the underlying mechanisms related to changes in optimism bias</p>

<p><bold>To reviewer #1:</bold></p>
<p>We appreciate your advice on providing more conceptual motivations for comparing Bayesian and RL-like belief updating models. In short, both model families are complementary in capturing asymmetrical and symmetrical updating. They both consider that the magnitude of updating is weighed by two separate learning rates, one for positive and one for negative belief disconfirming evidence. If these two learning rates differ, updating is asymmetrical; if they are equal, updating is symmetrical.</p>
<p>However, the model families’ assumptions about the underlying updating process differ. In the RL-like belief updating model family, this process is assumed to be driven by comparing base rates and initial beliefs, also known as the prediction error (PE), weighed by the learning rates. On the contrary, the Bayesian updating model assumes that updating (i.e., the posterior belief) is driven by combining the base rate (i.e., the prior evidence) and how often the initial belief is represented in the estimated base rate (i.e., the likelihood ratio of all other alternative hypotheses, beliefs). Moreover, the two components of the posterior belief can differ in their respective contribution (i.e., precision or confidence), which might be more adaptive to external actual life conditions characterized by high uncertainty about the future.</p>
<p>For the revised manuscript, we will elaborate more on the conceptual and psychological meaning of these two proposed belief updating processes. So far, it is important to note that we do not have direct proof of humans reasoning in an RL-like or Bayesian way when updating their beliefs about the future. We, therefore, focus on the complementarity of both models to capture latent processes and variables in belief updating that can be leveraged to understand the sources of inter-individual differences and the impact of external contexts such as experiencing an actual adverse life event on human psychology.</p>
<p><bold>To reviewer #2:</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for recommending the exploration of potential differences between optimism biases in initial belief estimations (self versus other) during and outside the pandemic. We will also provide more details on the belief updating task and design.</p>
<p><bold>To both reviewers:</bold></p>
<p>We agree on the limitations arising from the lack of physiological and self-reported measures of stress. We collected some self-reports on risk perception, adoption of protective measures, need for social interactions, and mood, but solely in participants tested during the pandemic-related lockdowns (reported in the SI Table 1). For the revised manuscript, we propose exploring the correlational links between belief-updating biases and self-reports in this sample. The expected outcomes of such correlational analyses may identify the variables to target with interventions in future studies of human belief updating under real-world contexts. We also will add a relevant section to the discussion to elaborate on the limitation that hinders inferring plausible psychological causes of the differences observed in belief updating during and outside the pandemic.</p>
<p>Importantly, we will follow your recommendations to improve the computational modeling analyses. We will (1) add the confusion matrices from model recovery analyses to gain inferences on specificity, (2) provide evidence for the best-fitting model to reproduce the observed behavior shown in Figure 1, and (3) conduct model comparisons on the combined groups to justify the focus on the RL like updating model. In a few weeks, we plan to submit a revised manuscript alongside a point-by-point response to your concerns and recommendations.</p>
