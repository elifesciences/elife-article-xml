<abstract><p>As the resident tissue macrophage of the liver, Kupffer Cells (KC) play an important role in homeostasis and tissue support. However, current in-vitro liver models often ignore the contribution of these KCs toward the proper response and function of the tissue. This is especially relevant when we consider the implications of immune-mediated drug injuries. To address this issue, we developed an isogenic co-culture system utilizing iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) and hepatocytes (iHeps). Directly co-culturing iHeps with iMacs improved the differentiation and maturation of the iHeps, with significant downregulation of fetal hepatocyte markers as well as upregulation of cytochrome genes. Furthermore, the co-culture also imparted stronger KC identity to the iMacs in a contact-dependent manner, with iMacs cultured in iHep conditioned media alone showing weaker expression of key KC markers. Finally, challenging the iHep-iMac co-culture system with 7 paradigm hepatotoxic compounds showed dose-dependent cytokine response in the 5 compounds associated with immune-mediated liver injuries, while no significant changes were observed in the 2 compounds with no reported immune-dependent complications. This effect was also not recapitulated when the co-culture was instead performed with human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages, suggesting that iMacs are essential for liver toxicity response. Taken together, our study shows not only the importance of macrophages in tissue systems, but also that the source of macrophages is critical to the development of accurate in-vitro human models.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hepatic macrophages play key roles in immune-mediated hepatotoxicity, liver injury and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. They are impacted by autocrine and paracrine signals from hepatic cells, especially hepatocytes. They also release soluble stress signals in response to external stimuli from foreign particles, leading to macrophage activation and production of cell signalling and stress pathway modulators, including reactive oxygen species and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. In return, hepatic macrophage activation also regulates parenchymal and non-parenchymal cell death and the metabolic activity of hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. Such crosstalk between liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) and non-parenchymal modulators (hepatic macrophages) is critical in modelling liver injury, especially immune-mediated drug-induced responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Two major populations of hepatic macrophages have been reported: liver-resident Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMϕs) that infiltrate the liver upon insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. While MoMϕs have been well studied <italic>in vivo</italic> and applied in <italic>in vitro</italic> models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], in more recent years it has been revealed that KCs are derived from embryonic macrophages that seed the liver early on during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], and are only minimally replaced by circulating monocytes under steady state conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. This also implies that human peripheral blood monocytes, the conventional source of primary human macrophages, might not be able to fully recapitulate KC biology. However, it has been demonstrated that murine iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) more closely resembled embryonic macrophages than monocyte-derived macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>], suggesting that human iMacs might also serve as a suitable analogue for human embryonic macrophages. Based on these new insights, in our previous work, we differentiated iMacs into iPSC-derived KCs (iKCs) using primary hepatocyte conditioned media (PHCM) to drive iMacs towards iKC identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Although these iKCs partially resembled primary human KCs (PhKCs) based on the expression of KC specific markers and drug response, PHCM is not readily available and might exhibit differences depending on donor variability of primary hepatocytes. Most importantly, the direct cellular interactions between iMacs and hepatocytes and their potential to impart better reciprocal identity and functionality to each other has not been studied before.</p>
<p>We recently generated macrophage-sufficient brain organoids by coculturing brain organoids with iMacs generated from the same human iPSC line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In such cocultures, iMac differentiated into cells with microglia-like phenotypes and functions. Most importantly, iMac modulated neuronal progenitor cell (NPC) differentiation, limiting NPC proliferation and promoting axonogenesis, profoundly remodelling organoid physiology. Thus, in this study, we hypothesized that iMacs could be directly cultured with iPSC-derived hepatocytes (iHeps) from the same IPSC source to both improve iHep development and maturation as well as impart KC-like identify to the iMacs. Upon development of such a model, we tested its application in detecting immune-mediated responses of seven paradigm compounds. Concurrently, we also cultured iMacs in PHCM for 7 days in a similar way to our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], comparing the transcriptomic effect of direct contact against soluble factors in the context of hepatic macrophage specialisation. Our results showed improved <italic>in vivo</italic> correlation based on the effects on cytokine production when iMac-derived KCs were used. Altogether, this study highlights the effect of direct crosstalk between hepatocytes and macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> using iPSCs and provides a new human model to test drug-induced cytokine responses.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<label>2.1</label><title>Maintenance of iPSCs</title>
<p>Human IMR90-iPSCs were obtained from WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI). The cells were maintained under antibiotic-free conditions in mTESR media (StemCell Technologies, 85850) on Matrigel (Corning, 354234)-coated plates. Cells were passaged using ReLESR (StemCell Technologies, 05872) or Dispase (StemCell Technologies, 07913) as per manufacturer’s protocol whenever they reached 80% confluency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.2</label><title>Differentiation of iPSCs to iHeps</title>
<p>IMR90-iPSCs were differentiated into iPSC-hepatocytes (iHeps) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Briefly, the iPSCs were cultured to 80% confluency, then made into single cells using Cell Dissociation Buffer (Gibco, 13151014) and seeded at 1.5 x 10^5 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on the desired well plate format (i.e. 1.5 x 10^6 cells for a 6 well plate) and placed under hypoxic conditions (5% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). Growth factors and media used starting from the next day to day 20 are detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Media was changed every day and hypoxic conditions were used during days 5 to15 of differentiation. After 20 days of differentiation, iPSC-derived macrophages (iMacs) were either directly added to the iHeps as described in <xref rid="s2e" ref-type="sec">section 2.5</xref> or iHeps were harvested for seeding into smaller well formats for drug testing. The harvesting protocol has been previously optimized by us and has been detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<label>2.3</label><title>Differentiation of iPSCs to iMacs</title>
<p>IMR90-iPSCs were differentiated into iMacs as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Briefly, the iPSCs were cultured to 80% confluency, then passaged using ReLESR. As ReLESR releases the cells as small cell clumps, the passage conditions were optimised to result in roughly 1 x 10^5 cells in each well of a 6 well plate (Day-1). Starting from the next day (Day 0) to day 16, the cells were cultured in Stempro Media, consisting of Stempro-34 SFM (GIBCO, 10639-011), supplemented with 200 ug/mL Human Transferrin (Roche, 10-652-202-001), 1x L-Glut, 1x Pen/Strep, 0.5 mM Ascorbic Acid (Sigma, A4544) and 0.45mM MTG (Sigma, M6145). A full media change was done every other day for the next 16 days, supplemented with the following cytokines: Differentiation Day 0 (5 ng/mL BMP4, 50 ng/mL VEGF, and 2 uM CHIR99021), Differentiation Day 2 (5 ng/mL BMP4, 50 ng/mL VEGF, and 20 ng/mL FGF2), Differentiation Day 4 (15 ng/mL VEGF and 5 ng/mL FGF2), Differentiation Day 6 to 10 (10 ng/mL VEGF, 10 ng/mL FGF2, 50 ng/mL SCF, 30 ng/mL DKK-1 (RnD, 5439-DK), 10 ng/mL IL-6 (RnD, 206-IL), and 20 ng/mL IL-3), Differentiation Day 12 and 14 (10 ng/mL FGF2, 50 ng/mL SCF, 10 ng/mL IL-6, and 20 ng/mL IL-3). From day 16, the cells were cultured in 75% IMDM with Glutamax (GIBCO, 31980-030), 25% F12 (GIBCO, 11765-047), 1x N2 supplement (GIBCO, 17502-048), 1x B27 Supplement (GIBCO, 17504-001), 0.05% BSA (GE Healthcare, SH30574) and 1x Pen/Strep, supplemented with 50ng/ml of CSF-1 (RnD, 216-MC), with a full media change every 3 days. In addition, for the first 8 days of differentiation, the cells were kept in a hypoxic incubator (5% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), before being transferred to a standard cell culture incubator for the next 18 days. After transfer to a standard cell culture incubator, floating cells were collected every media change and resuspended back into the culture to retain the hematopoietic progenitors. After 26 days, the floating cells were collected, and the purity of the iMacs was determined by flow cytometry.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<label>2.4</label><title>Differentiation of human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) into monocyte-derived macrophages</title>
<p>Human PBMCs were purified from blood apheresis cones by ficoll gradient (Cytiva, 17-1440-02), before being magnetically sorted with CD14+ microbeads (Miltenyi, 130-050-021). 1 x 10^6 CD14+ cells were then seeded per well of a 6 well plate in RPMI 1640 (Hyclone, SH30027.01) with 10% FBS (Biowest, S1810-500), 1x Pen/Strep, 1x Sodium Pyruvate, 1x NEAA and 1x L-Glut with 50ng/ml CSF-1 and cultured for 7 days. The purity of the monocyte-derived macrophages was then determined by flow cytometry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<label>2.5</label><title>Co-culture of iMacs and monocyte-derived macrophages with iHeps</title>
<p>2 x 10^5 iMacs or monocyte-derived macrophages were added to 5 x 10^5 iHeps during a full media change (4ml) per well of a 6 well plate on Day 0. This media was comprised of Williams’ Medium E containing the following supplements: Penicillin/Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL / (10,000 μg/mL) – final conc = 1%, ITS+ - final conc= 2%, 4mM glutamax, 30mM HEPES buffer. The concentrations of the supplements were double that of standard conditions used due to the infrequent media change (please see <xref rid="s3a" ref-type="sec">section 3.1</xref> for more details). In addition, 50ng/ml of CSF-1 was added to each well. The cells were cultured for 7 days, with a half-media change (2ml) on Day 4 consisting of the same media as described above with 100ng/ml of CSF-1, resulting in a final concentration of 50ng/ml CSF-1 in the well. The cells were collected by digesting with Accutase (StemCell, 07920) for flow cytometry, RNAseq analysis and qPCR. For pharmacological testing, the number of iHeps and iMacs were downscaled to 96-well plates while maintaining the same iHep:iMac ratio (2.5:1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<label>2.6</label><title>Flow cytometry</title>
<p>Standard staining procedures were used to prepare the cells for flow cytometry analysis. Briefly, cells were dissociated into single cells using the different methods described above for the various tissues, before being incubated with 100ul of antibody containing FACS buffer (1% BSA and 4mM EDTA in PBS) per 5 million cells for 20 minutes at 4°C. The cell suspension was then washed with 5ml of FACS buffer, centrifuged at 400g, and the supernatant was removed. The cells were finally resuspended in PBS containing 3uM DAPI (Invitrogen, D1306). Data was acquired by LSRII (BD Bioscience) and analyzed by Flow Jo (Tree Star, Inc.). For cell sorting, cells were sorted using FACS Aria II (BD Bioscience) or FACS Aria III (BD Bioscience). The following antibodies were used: FITC-conjugated anti-human CD14 (Biolegend, 325604), APC/Cy7-conjugated anti-human CD45 (Biolegend, 368516), PE-conjugated anti-human CD163 (R&amp;D Systems, FAB1607P-100), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-human CX3CR1 (Biolegend, 341608, PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-human CD11b (eBioscience, 25-0118-42).</p>

<label>2.7</label><title>Bulk RNA-seq</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using Arcturus PicoPure RNA Isolation kit (Thermofisher, KIT0204) according to manufacturer’s protocol. All RNAs were analyzed on Labchip GX system (Perkin Elmer, United States) for quality assessment with median RNA Quality Score of 9.15. cDNA libraries were prepared using 2ng of total RNA and 1ul of a 1:50,000 dilution of Ambion ERCC RNA Spike-in Controls (Thermofisher, 4456740) using the SMARTSeq v2 protocol described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] with the following modifications: 1.

<label>3.1</label><title>Optimization of culture conditions allow survival and function of iHeps and iMacs</title>
<p>In order to investigate the effects of co-culturing iHeps with iMacs, we first established and optimized a co-culture system utilising IMR90 iPSC-derived iHeps and iMacs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To ensure survival and functionality of both cell types in our desired culture period (at least one week), certain key factors had to be accounted for: Hepatocytes are high in metabolically activity and often require frequent media change for replenishment of nutrients and removal of waste. On the other hand, it would be ideal to allow the iHeps and iMacs to interact through direct crosstalk as well as through secreted soluble factors without removing these factors from the system via media exchange. To assess the performance of hepatocytes with more infrequent media changes, expression of key hepatic markers was assessed when media was changed every other day, every two days or every three days and compared to a daily media change (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). To compensate for the lower frequency of media change, we tested the effects of 2X supplements; standard media volume (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) and 2X supplements with 2X standard culture volume (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Gene expression was compared as fold change to standard hepatocyte culture conditions (daily media change with 1X supplement and standard media volume). Increasing supplements alone could maintain the expression of ALB (albumin), AAT (alpha-1-antitrypsin), cytochrome P450 (CYP)-1A2, 3A4, 2B6 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A3, but not CYP2C19 (36 - 68% decrease), glutathione S-transferase (GST)A2 (35-66% decrease) and multidrug resistance protein-2 (MRP2; 7 to 18% decrease) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, combining the increase in supplements with increase in culture volume resulted in maintenance of all hepatic markers (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>). Albumin and urea production were also maintained to 1-1.4 pg/cell/48 hrs and 126-146 pg/cell/48 hrs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) which is in the range of albumin and urea production reported by us previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] and in the state-of-the-art [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Once iHep marker and functionality was confirmed, the cells in the co-culture system were sorted via flow cytometry on Day 3 and Day 7.

<label>3.2</label><title>Co-culture with iMacs improves iHep maturation and development</title>
<p>Cells sorted via flow cytometry on Day 3 and Day 7, and the co-cultured hepatocytes (co-iHeps) and co-cultured iMacs (co-iMacs) were then analysed by RNA sequencing in order to assess if such co-culture lead to transcriptomic changes reflecting improve differentiation and maturation. We also analysed Day 0 and Day 7 mono-culture controls, as well as iMacs cultured in PHCM for 7 days as control groups.</p>
<p>Principle component analysis (PCA) of the iHep samples revealed that that although the direction of change was the same for both the mono-cultured and co-cultured iHeps, there was a greater degree of change along the PC1 axis for co-iHeps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We hypothesised that this might be due to the iMacs promoting further maturation and development of the iHeps, and performed a Pearson correlation between the mono-cultured and co-cultured iHeps against <italic>in vivo</italic> fetal liver hepatocytes from a published dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], which revealed that the co-cultured iHeps were better correlated with the <italic>in vivo</italic> hepatocytes than the mono-cultured iHeps (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1E</xref>). Indeed, looking at the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the Day 7 iHeps and Day 7 co-iHeps revealed that the co-iHep upregulated genes associated with tissue morphogenesis and repair like Early Growth Response 1 (<italic>EGR1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], centrosome duplication such as the long non-coding RNA <italic>CCDC14</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>] and angiogenesis-related gene like Maternally Expressed Gene 9 (<italic>MEG9</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). On the other hand, iHeps cultured alone upregulated genes that inhibit proliferation and angiogenesis such as Histone Rich Glycoprotein (<italic>HRG</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] and Kinogen 1 (<italic>KNG1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>] (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). We then performed pathway analysis using Ingenuity and discovered that the top upregulated pathway in Day 7 iHeps was acute phase response signalling, with the associated genes mainly relating to protein production such as Transthyretin (<italic>TTR</italic>) and Serpin Family D Member 1 (<italic>SERPIND1</italic>) (Supplementary Table 2), while the top upregulated pathway in Day 7 co-iHeps was related to nitric oxide and reaction oxygen species production, consisting mainly of metabolic and phosphatase genes like <italic>c-FOS</italic> and Serine/Threonine protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B” beta (<italic>PPP2R3B</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). A closer look at the pathways upregulated in Day 7 iHeps and Day 7 co-iHeps also revealed that the Day 7 co-iHeps had a stronger tissue development and anabolic signature, upregulating pathways associated with tumor microenvironment, fibrosis and growth hormone signalling, while the Day 7 iHeps upregulated iron and cholesterol pathways.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the expression of key genes across all the iHep samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In line with our hypothesis that co-culturing iMacs with iHeps would improve the maturation of the iHeps, we found that alpha-fetoprotein (<italic>AFP</italic>), a marker that is upregulated during fetal development and then downregulated as hepatocytes mature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] followed a similar trend in our culture system, with lower expression in the Day 7 iHeps as compared to the Day 0 iHeps. Furthermore, the expression levels of <italic>AFP</italic> in Day 3 co-iHeps and Day 7 co-iHeps was even lower than that of Day 7 iHeps. Likewise Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4 (<italic>HNFA4</italic>), a transcription factor upregulated in hepatic progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], had reduced expression in the co-cultured iHeps. Insulin-like growth factor-2 (<italic>IGF-2</italic>), a key growth factor in fetal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], was upregulated in the co-cultured iHeps, with expression peaking 3 days after co-culture. Cytochrome P450 Family 2 Subunit C member 9 (<italic>CYP2C9</italic>), a cytochrome involved in drug metabolism was also upregulated in the co-iHeps, while Aldolase Fructose-Biphosphate B (<italic>ALDOB</italic>), an enzyme whose upregulation is associated with unregulated cell proliferation and poor cancer prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] was downregulated. Taken together, our data suggest that co-culturing the iHeps with iMacs increased their maturation and promotes improved hepatocyte development.</p>

<label>3.3</label><title>Co-culture with iHeps imparts KC-like identity to iMacs</title>
<p>Next, we turned our attention towards the iMacs within our co-culture system to test if they acquired KC features. PCA analysis showed that the co-iMacs clustered much tighter together, while iMacs that were cultured alone or in hepatocyte conditioned media (cond-iMac) were much more scattered (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). This suggests that co-culturing iMacs in direct contact with iHeps may help maintain the identity of the iMacs better, mirroring how <italic>ex vivo</italic> resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) rapidly lose their identity when removed from their tissue environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. DEG analysis of all the iMac groups showed that both the Day 7 iMacs and the Day 7 cond-iMacs shared an activated and inflammatory profile, upregulating genes such as TNFSF18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] and ACP5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). Day7 iMacs had a more migratory profile, uniquely expressing Chemokine Receptor 7 (<italic>CCR7</italic>) and Chemokine Ligand 5 (<italic>CCL5</italic>), while Day 7 cond-iMacs uniquely expressed Dishevelled Associated Activator of Morphogenesis 2 (<italic>DAAM2</italic>), a developmental regulator of the WNT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>].</p>

<p>As we were interested in how the presence of iHeps in such co-culture model might educate and impart KC-like identity to the iMacs, we looked at the DEGs between Day 0 iMac and Day 7 co-iMacs. Day 0 iMacs were more immunogenic, expressing Proteoglycan 2 Pro Eosinophil Major Basic Protein 2/3 (<italic>PRG2/PRG3</italic>) and Carboxypeptidase A3 (<italic>CPA3</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, Day 7 co-iMacs upregulated the angiogenic Angiopoietin-like 4 (<italic>ANGPTL4</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], matching the angiogenic signature observed in the Day 7 co-iHeps. Importantly, Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that the top pathway in Day 7 co-iMacs is the Liver X Receptor/Farnesoid X Receptor (LXR/RXR) signalling pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplementary Table 5), a key regulator of KC identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], while the top pathway in Day 0 iMacs is the axonal guidance pathway, consisting of chemokines like C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (<italic>CXCL12</italic>) and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4 (<italic>CXCR4</italic>), metalloproteases like ADAM Metallopeptidase with Thrombospondin Type 1 Motif 15 (<italic>ADAMTS15</italic>), and semaphorins like Semaphorin 3C (<italic>SEMA3C</italic>) (Supplementary Table 6). This suggests that co-culturing iMacs with iHeps initiated a KC-specific programme, while the Day 0 iMacs had a more general and unspecified identity lacking environmental cues. In addition, Day 7 co-iMacs also upregulated pathways associated with tissue repair and remodelling, as well as tissue growth factors, while migratory and immune signalling related pathways were upregulated in the Day 0 iMacs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest that co-culturing iMacs with iHeps is sufficient to impart a more tissue supportive and KC-like identity to the iMacs.</p>
<p>The use of conditioned media as a surrogate of the <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue microenvironment is a popular approach, and we wondered how different iMacs cultured in direct co-culture with iHeps would be from iMacs cultured in conditioned media from primary hepatocytes (PHCM). Comparing the DEGs between Day 7 cond-iMacs and Day 7 co-iMacs, the Day 7 cond-iMacs upregulated immune-related genes such as Toll-Like Receptor 4 (<italic>TLR4</italic>) and <italic>CPA3</italic>, while the Day 7 co-iMacs more highly expressed tissue residency-related Fc Gamma Receptor IIIa (<italic>FCGR3A</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Pathway analysis showed that the top upregulated pathway in the Day 7 cond-iMacs was autophagy, which might indicate that conditioned media alone was insufficient to maintain proper macrophage biology in the absence of contact with other cells, although some hepatic related pathways were also upregulated as well (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, Supplementary Table 7). On the other hand, the most highly upregulated pathway in the Day 7 co-iMacs was the FXR/RXR pathway, which along with the upregulation of other anabolic pathways related to hepatic health (Supplementary Table 8), suggest that co-culturing rather than conditioned media is superior at inducing KC-like identity in macrophages.</p>
<p>We then looked at the expression of selected key KC genes. Lymphatic Vessel Endothelial Hyaluronan Receptor 1 (<italic>LYVE1</italic>), DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-1 (<italic>ID1</italic>) and DNA-binding protein inhibitor ID-3 (<italic>ID3</italic>), which are important markers of KC identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. These were all upregulated in the co-iMacs but not in the cond-iMacs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Retinoid X Receptor Alpha (<italic>RXRA</italic>), the obligate binding partner of LXR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>], was also upregulated in only the co-iMacs. Interestingly, we also found that the co-iMacs upregulated the expression of Heparin Binding EGF Like Growth Factor (<italic>HBEGF</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and Oncostatin M (<italic>OSM</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], which are potent effectors of liver regeneration and development.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared the iMacs from our study with <italic>in vivo</italic> embryonic human liver monocytes and KCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Pearson correlation revealed that regardless of condition the <italic>in vitro</italic> derived iMacs were poorly correlated to the <italic>in vivo</italic> human liver monocyte/macrophages (Supplementary Figure 2A), suggesting that either the co-culture duration was insufficient to induce full KC commitment or that there might be missing cues from other cell types that were not present in our co-culture. However, pathway analysis on the DEGs between the embryonic human liver macrophages and either the Day 7 cond-iMacs (Supplementary Figure 2B, Supplementary Table 9) or Day 7 co-iMacs (Supplementary Figure 2C, Supplementary Table 10) revealed that pathways relating to cytokine production, sensory development and eye development were differentially regulated between the Day 7 cond-iMacs and embryonic liver macrophages, while there were no significant pathway differences between the Day 7 co-iMacs and embryonic liver macrophages. This suggests that direct co-culture might drive the macrophages to adopt a more tissue developmental or supportive phenotype.</p>
<p>Altogether, the data supports our hypothesis that co-culturing iMacs with iHeps induces a KC-like tissue supportive identity in the iMacs, which in turn promotes the maturation and development of the iHeps.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<label>3.4</label><title>Validation of the acquisition of KC-like identity by iMacs and maturation of iHeps in co-culture</title>
<p>We confirmed the observations from the RNA sequencing analysis by analysing gene expression of macrophage and KC-specific markers in Day 3 co-iMacs and Day 7 co-iMacs via RT-PCR. Macrophage markers <italic>CD68</italic>, <italic>CD163</italic>, <italic>CD11b</italic>, <italic>CD32</italic> and <italic>CD14</italic> were all upregulated at Day 3 and Day 7 by 1.8 to 7.6 fold compared to iMac mono-culture control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, KC-specific markers <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID3</italic> were upregulated by 3.8 fold and 3.9 fold respectively at Day 3 and by 6.3 fold and 6.5 fold respectively at Day 7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This suggests that macrophage phenotype is maintained during the 7 days of co-culture but KC-specific development increases in a time-dependent manner. When Day 7 co-iMacs were compared to iMacs cultured in PHCM (Day 7 cond-iMacs; without the presence of iHeps), macrophage marker upregulation compared to iMac mono-culture control were similar in both conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>) but KC-specific <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID3</italic> were upregulated to a lower extent in Day 7 cond-iMacs (2.6 fold and 2.5 fold respectively) compared to Day 7 co-iMacs (6.3 fold and 6.5 fold respectively; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we confirmed the RNA sequence analysis of iHep via RT-PCR. With the exception of Glutathione-S transferase1A2 (<italic>GST1A2</italic>) and Multidrug Resistance Associated Protein 2 (<italic>MRP2</italic>), co-culture with iMacs improved expression of several hepatic marker genes including <italic>ALB</italic>, a-1 antitrypsin (<italic>AAT</italic>), cytochrome P450 enzymes (<italic>CYP1A2</italic>, <italic>CYP3A4</italic>, <italic>CYP2C9</italic>, <italic>CYP2B6</italic>) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (<italic>UGT1A3</italic>) by 1.8-53.1 fold at Day 3 and Day 7 of co-culture (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Importantly, <italic>AFP</italic>, a marker that is expressed at high levels in fetal hepatocytes and increases with hepatocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], had 37% lower expression at Day 3 and 37% lower expression in Day 7 iHeps as compared to Day 0 iHeps (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).

<p>Drug-induced liver injury is a complex and critical clinical problem with an estimated incidence rate of up to 19 cases per 100000 people in western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>].

DIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], SLD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] and LFM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] have been reported to cause a decrease in interleukin-6 (IL-6); whereas AQ and LTG have been reported to cause an increase in IL-6 in patients with drug-induced liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. PEN and PZA were selected as negative controls as no immune-mediated effects of these drugs have been reported.</p>
<p>Our co-culture model could correctly recapitulate IL-6 decrease in DIC (48%, 45% and 18% at 15.7 mM, 50 mM and 150 mM respectively), SLD (46%, 11% and 8% at 67 mM, 200 mM and 600 mM respectively) and LFM (65%, 46%, 38% at 32.5 mM, 125 mM and 500 mM respectively). IL-6 increase upon AQ (157-200 fold) and LTG (155-322 fold) treatment was also correctly recapitulated. No changes in IL-6 level in PEN and PZA-treated samples were observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Importantly, when iMac-derived iKC-like cells were replaced with blood Monocytes/Macrophages, none of these cytokine changes were recapitulated with the exception of SLD treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This shows, from a functional/application perspective, how iMac-iKCs, but not MoMϕs, are indispensable for <italic>in vitro</italic> liver models that can detect immune-mediated changes of hepatotoxicants.</p>

<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, KCs have been known to release mediators that are early features of inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. They are activated in response to inflammatory stimuli such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that can damage the liver at large doses in a KC-dependent manner. At smaller doses, LPS activates KCs (without causing liver injury) but sensitizes the liver to a variety of other xenobiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. In our model, when the co-culture was co-treated with paradigm hepatotoxicants and LPS, drug-dose-dependent changes in cytokine production were observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the system can indeed mimic physiological responses, demonstrating the importance of liver-specific imprinting of macrophages in recapitulating responses in an <italic>in vitro</italic> liver model.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>IPSC-derived tissue cultures have tremendous potential in its ability to generate cells from all intra-embryonic lineages and have greatly expanded both our knowledge of mammalian tissue development and our technical toolbox for therapy and disease modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. However, a tissue is often more than the sum of its parts, and iPSC-derived tissue models have so far proven to be limited in their ability to effectively recapitulate the functionality and complexities of their presumed organs. In our study, we demonstrated how co-culturing iMacs with iHeps leads to not only acquisition of resident tissue characteristics within the iMac population, but also increased maturation of iHeps. We demonstrated that iPSC-derived Heps can directly impart hepatic macrophage-like identity to iMacs, giving them an iKC-like phenotype and genotype without the need for any additional soluble factors or components present in conditioned media. Application of this model was demonstrated by the ability of the system to mimic clinical IL-6 responses of 5 paradigm immune-mediated hepatotoxicants. Two additional hepatotoxicants with no known immune-mediated responses did not show any response in our model, demonstrating the specificity of the system. Finally, when the immune-mediated drug effects were tested in a system with iHeps and PBMC-derived macrophages, expected cytokine responses were not observed, indicating the importance of iKC-iHep co-culture in predicting drug mediated-immune responses.</p>
<p>Animal models have been used to model immune-mediated liver injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]; however, consistent liver injury was not observed upon treatment with drugs known to cause immune response in humans, even at high doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. In cases where injury was observed, the characteristics were different from humans and possibly manifested through different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Such interspecies variations, contradictory findings as well as cost and ethical issues have spurred the development of <italic>in vitro</italic> models to supplement <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models. <italic>In vitro</italic> models, possibly due to the lack of appropriate human immune cell sources, have focused on soluble factor-driven single hepatocyte cultures in combination with inflammatory mediators or animal cell co-cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. However, mono-cultures lack cell-cell interactions, and animal <italic>in vitro</italic> models often fail to recapitulate <italic>in vivo</italic> and clinical findings. <italic>In vitro</italic> hepatocyte-KC models have previously been used; however most of them have utilised animal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>] which often prove inadequate in recapitulating <italic>in vivo</italic> or clinical findings. In order to avoid interspecies variations and improve the predictivity of <italic>in vitro</italic> models, appropriate human models still need to be developed and characterized.</p>
<p>The main challenge in studying human KCs in <italic>in vitro</italic> models is the cell source. The source of commercial primary human KCs (PhKCs) is limited and costly and high donor-to-donor variability is often observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Alternative human cell sources include THP-1 cells and peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages; however their cytokine profiles are dramatically different from human KCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] and they lack liver-specific imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Even when human KCs were used, the work mostly focused on co-culture dependent improvement of hepatocyte function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], rather than interaction between the two cell-types and immune-mediated effect of drugs. Moreover, these models are often non-isogenic, which further confounds the inflammatory readouts. Hence, in our study, we aimed to first determine if the presence of hepatocytes could impart a tissue-resident-like phenotype to iMacs and drive them to be more Kupffer cell-like, then measured the systemic response to drug treatment compared to using monocyte-derived macrophages. While all tested drugs showed expected changes in cytokine production in the iMac-iHep co-culture (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), these changes were not recapitulated when the iMacs were replaced by MoMϕs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>) with the exception of SLD. Interestingly, expected IL-6 increase upon treatment with LFM could not be recapitulated in our previous model of iHep-iKCs co-culture where iKCs were generated using conditioned media from primary hepatocytes (data not shown). However, in our current model, LFM treatment resulted in the expected increase in IL-6, suggesting the potential importance of direct cellular cross-talk in iKCs differentiation and function.</p>
<p>Development of a suitable model system is further complicated by the understanding that KCs are derived from embryonic macrophages that seed the liver early on during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. This also implies that conventionally used human peripheral blood MoMϕs might not be able to fully mimic KC biology. Thankfully, iMacs more closely resemble embryonic macrophages than MoMϕs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>] and as demonstrated in our own experiments, were able to acquire features of KCs upon co-culture with iHeps. Soluble factors were only partially responsible for this tissue adaptation, as in contrast to the iMacs that were cultured in hepatocyte conditioned media, the co-cultured iMacs upregulated genes in the LXR/RXR pathway, which has been shown to be important for KC specification and identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], further emphasising the importance of cell-cell contact for the acquisition of RTM identity. Furthermore, we also observed that these co-cultured iMacs were upregulating pathways associated with tissue repair and development, which might explain the increased maturity of the iHeps within the co-culture system. This is particularly relevant not only for hepatic model systems, but for other iPSC-derived model systems in general, as one of the key limitations of these systems is the functional and phenotypic immaturity of the differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Co-culturing iMacs with these immature iPSC-derived tissue model systems might provide the missing developmental cues needed for more physiologically and functionally relevant patient and disease models as well.</p>

<p>This timely and <bold>fundamental</bold> study introduces a human iPSC-based co-culture system that models Kupffer cell-hepatocyte interactions and aims to recapitulate liver-specific immune-parenchymal dynamics.

This <bold>convincing</bold> in vitro model holds significant promise and is a leap forward; future experimental understanding will enhance its translational impact.</p>

<p>The manuscript presents a compelling new in vitro system based on isogenic co-cultures of human iPSC-derived hepatocytes and macrophages, enabling the modelling of hepatic immune responses with unprecedented physiological relevance. The authors show that co-culture leads to enhanced maturation of hepatocytes and tissue-resident macrophage identity, which cannot be achieved through conditioned media alone. Using this system, they functionally validate immune-driven hepatotoxic responses to a panel of drugs and compare the system's predictive power to that of monocyte-derived macrophages. The results underscore the necessity of macrophage-hepatocyte crosstalk for accurate modelling of liver inflammation and drug toxicity in vitro.</p>
<p>The manuscript is clearly written and addresses a key limitation in liver organoid systems: the lack of immune complexity and tissue-specific macrophage imprinting. Nevertheless, several conclusions would benefit from a more careful interpretation of the data, and some important controls or explanations are missing, particularly in the flow cytometry gating strategies, stress marker validation, and cluster interpretations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Novelty and Relevance: The study presents a highly innovative co-culture system based on isogenic human iPSCs, addressing an unmet need in modelling immune-mediated hepatotoxicity.</p>
<p>(2) Mechanistic Insight: The reciprocal reprogramming between iHeps and iMacs, including induction of KC-specific pathways and hepatocyte maturation markers, is convincingly demonstrated.</p>
<p>(3) Functional Readouts: The application of the model to detect IL-6 responses to hepatotoxic compounds enhances its translational relevance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Several key claims, particularly those derived from PCA plots and DEG analyses, are overinterpreted and require more conservative language or further validation.</p>
<p>(2) The purity of sorted hepatocytes and macrophages is not convincingly demonstrated; contamination across gates may confound transcriptomic readouts.</p>
<p>(3) Stress response genes and ER stress/apoptosis signatures are not properly assessed, despite being potentially activated in the system.</p>
<p>(4) Some figure panels and legends lack statistical annotations, and microscopy validation of morphological changes is missing.</p>
<p>(5) The co-culture model with monocyte-derived macrophages is not fully characterised, making comparisons less informative.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study builds on work by Glass and Guilliams showing that mouse Kupffer cells depend on the surrounding cells, including endothelium, hepatocytes, and stellate cells, for their identity. Herein, the authors extend the work to human systems. It nicely highlights why taking monocyte-derived macrophages and pretending they are Kupffer cells is simply misleading.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Many, including human cells, difficult culture assays, and important new data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This reviewer identified minor queries only, rather than 'weaknesses' as such.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors establish a human in vitro liver model by co-culturing induced hepatocyte-like cells (iHEPs) with induced macrophages (iMACs). Through flow cytometry-based sorting of cell populations at days 3 and 7 of co-culture, followed by bulk RNA sequencing, they demonstrate that bidirectional interactions between these two cell types drive functional maturation. Specifically, the presence of iMACs accelerates the hepatic maturation program of iHEPs, while contact-dependent cues from iHEPs enhance the acquisition of Kupffer cell identity in iMACs, indicating that direct cell-cell interactions are critical for establishing tissue-resident macrophage characteristics.</p>
<p>Functionally, the authors show that iMAC-derived Kupffer-like cells respond to pathological stimuli by producing interleukin-6 (IL-6), a hallmark cytokine of hepatic immune activation. When exposed to a panel of clinically relevant hepatotoxic drugs, the co-culture system exhibited concentration-dependent modulation of IL-6 secretion consistent with reported drug-induced liver injury (DILI) phenotypes. Notably, this response was absent when hepatocytes were co-cultured with monocyte-derived macrophages from peripheral blood, underscoring the liver-specific phenotype and functional relevance of the iMAC-derived Kupffer-like cells. Collectively, the study proposes this co-culture platform as a more physiologically relevant model for interrogating macrophage-hepatocyte crosstalk and assessing immune-mediated hepatotoxicity in vitro.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A major strength of this study lies in its systematic dissection of cell-cell interactions within the co-culture system. By isolating each cell type following co-culture and performing comprehensive transcriptomic analyses, the authors provide direct evidence of bidirectional crosstalk between iMACs and iHEPs. The comparison with single-culture controls is particularly valuable, as it clearly demonstrates how co-culture enhances functional maturation and lineage-specific gene expression in both cell types. This approach allows for a more mechanistic understanding of how hepatocyte-macrophage interactions contribute to the acquisition of tissue-specific phenotypes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Overreliance on bulk RNA-seq data:</p>
<p>The primary evidence supporting cell maturation is derived from bulk RNA sequencing, which has inherent limitations in resolving heterogeneous cellular states and functional maturation. The conclusions regarding hepatocyte maturation are based largely on increased expression of a subset of CYP genes and decreased AFP levels - markers that, while suggestive, are insufficient on their own to substantiate functional maturation. Additional phenotypic or functional assays (e.g., metabolic activity, protein-level validation) would significantly strengthen these claims.</p>
<p>(2) Insufficient characterization of input cell populations:</p>
<p>The manuscript lacks adequate validation of the cellular identities prior to co-culture. Although the authors reference previously published protocols for generating iHEPs and iMACs, it remains unclear whether the cells used in this study faithfully retain expected lineage characteristics. For example, hepatocyte preparations should be characterized by flow cytometry for ALB and AFP expression, while iMACs should be assessed for canonical macrophage markers such as CD45, CD11b, and CD14 before co-culture. Without these baseline data, it is difficult to interpret the magnitude or significance of any co-culture-induced changes.</p>
<p>(3) Quantitative assessment of IL-6 production is insufficient:</p>
<p>The analysis of drug-induced IL-6 responses is based primarily on relative changes compared to control conditions. However, percentage changes alone are inadequate to capture the biological relevance of these responses. Absolute cytokine production levels - particularly in response to LPS stimulation - should be reported and directly compared to PBMC-derived macrophages to determine whether iMAC-derived Kupffer-like cells exhibit enhanced cytokine output. Moreover, the Methods section should clearly describe how ELISA results were normalized or corrected to account for potential differences in cell number, viability, or culture conditions.</p>
<p>(4) Unclear mechanistic interpretation of IL-6 modulation:</p>
<p>The observed changes in IL-6 production upon drug treatment cannot be interpreted solely as evidence of Kupffer cell-specific functionality. For instance, IL-6 suppression by NSAIDs such as diclofenac is well known to result from altered prostaglandin synthesis due to COX inhibition, while leflunomide's effects are linked to metabolite-induced modulation of immune cell proliferation and broader cytokine networks. These mechanisms are distinct from Kupffer cell identity and may not directly reflect liver-specific macrophage function. Consequently, changes in IL-6 secretion alone - particularly without additional mechanistic evidence or analysis of other cytokines - are insufficient to conclude that co-culture with hepatocytes drives the acquisition of bona fide Kupffer cell maturity.</p>

<p>In line with the reviewer’s suggestions, we will be adjusting the text with more conservative language regarding the claims of maturation within the co-culture system, and emphasize that the conclusion is based on limited transcriptomic evidence. We acknowledge that the results from bulk RNA sequencing might contain contaminants across the gates, but would like to point out that the CD45+ CD14+ population is clear, and any resulting contamination would likely be small. We will be addressing this caveat clearly in a new limitations section, as suggested by reviewer 3 as well. We will also be taking the reviewer’s suggestion to look further into the stress response genes to further characterize the system. We apologise if we might have missed out any statistical annotations and will take care to include them in the updated version.</p>

<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concerns that the study was primarily focused on bulk RNA sequencing data and might not fully represent the complex metabolic and functional shifts, especially in a cell type like the hepatocyte , and will be addressing these concerns in a new limitations section in the revised manuscript. We also apologise if it was unclear in the manuscript that the iHeps and iMacs were characterised prior to coculturing, for example the iMacs are routinely assessed for CD45, CD14 and CD163 prior to the start of any experiment, and likewise the iHeps are tested by qPCR, which also served as the baseline of the fold expression changes in Fig 3. The primary aim of the IL-6 assays is to demonstrate that the hepatocyte co-culture systems behave differently based on the source of the macrophages, and that the use of primary macrophages might not be suitable in studying drug responses in-vitro. We will clarify in the revised manuscript that the overall effect might not be directly related to specific Kupffer cell identity.</p>
