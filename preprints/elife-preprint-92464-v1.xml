<title>Abstract</title><p>In mammals, 3D genome topology has been linked to transcriptional states yet whether this link holds for other eukaryotes is unclear. Here we show that in budding yeast, <italic>Heat Shock Response</italic> (<italic>HSR</italic>) genes under the control of Heat Shock Factor (Hsf1) rapidly reposition in cells exposed to acute ethanol stress and engage in concerted, Hsf1-dependent intergenic interactions. Accompanying 3D genome reconfiguration is equally rapid formation of Hsf1-containing condensates. However, in contrast to the transience of Hsf1-driven intergenic interactions that peak within 10 min and dissipate within 1 h, Hsf1 condensates are stably maintained for hours. Moreover, under the same conditions, Pol II occupancy of <italic>HSR</italic> genes and RNA expression are detectable only later in the response and peak much later (&gt;1 h). This contrasts with the coordinate response of <italic>HSR</italic> genes to thermal stress where Pol II occupancy, transcription, intergenic interactions, and formation of Hsf1 condensates are all rapid yet transient (peak within 2.5-10 min and dissipate within 1 h). Collectively, our data suggest that different stimuli drive distinct transcription, topologic, and phase-separation phenomena dependent on the same transcription factor and that transcription factor-containing condensates represent only part of the ensemble required for gene activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genomes of higher eukaryotes are organized into multiple hierarchical levels. Chromosomes are segregated within individual territories, and within chromosomal territories active and inactive regions are separated into topologically associated domains (TADs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wendt &amp; Grosveld, 2014</xref>). Within TADs, DNA loops are formed to permit the interaction between enhancers or silencers and the promoters of their target loci. Although this hierarchy suggests a static view of the genome, recent studies have revealed that the genome is dynamic, as multiple points of interaction form in response to developmental cues and other stimuli. This dynamic restructuring ranges from the interactions between co-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Fanucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Papantonis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Schoenfelder et al., 2010</xref>) to the convergence of enhancers dispersed across multiple chromosomes into a hub that regulates a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Monahan &amp; Lomvardas, 2015</xref>) to the reorganization of the genome that occurs in the zygote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schulz &amp; Harrison, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its evolutionary distance, the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> also possesses an organized genome. Centromeres are located in a cluster at the spindle pole body, while chromosomal arms are extended with telomeres and the nucleolus located at the opposite side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Duan et al., 2010</xref>), resulting in a Rabl-like configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Taddei &amp; Gasser, 2012</xref>). And as in higher eukaryotes, the budding yeast genome is organized into TAD-like structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Eser et al., 2017</xref>) subdivided into smaller loop domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hsieh et al., 2015</xref>). Also as is the case in mammalian cells, the yeast genome is not static. Genes, including <italic>INO1, GAL1</italic> and <italic>GAL10</italic>, have been observed to reposition from the nuclear interior to the nuclear periphery upon their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Brickner &amp; Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cabal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Casolari et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Dieppois et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Green et al., 2012</xref>). Even more dramatic are <italic>Heat Shock Response</italic> (<italic>HSR</italic>) genes under the regulation of Heat Shock Factor (Hsf1). Upon exposure to acute thermal stress (heat shock), <italic>HSR</italic> genes dispersed across multiple chromosomes transcriptionally activate and engage in novel <italic>cis-</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-intergenic interactions between one another, culminating in their coalescence into intranuclear foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2019</xref>). These stress-induced foci, comprised of Hsf1 and components of the transcriptional machinery, exhibit properties of liquid-liquid phase-separated condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). Hsf1 condensate formation elicited by heat shock, like that of <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence, parallels the kinetics of induction and attenuation of Hsf1-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The Hsf1-driven heat shock response is a fundamental, evolutionarily conserved transcriptional program characterized by the gene-specific transcription factor (TF) Hsf1, its DNA recognition element (heat shock element (HSE)) and a core set of target genes encoding molecular chaperones and co-chaperones (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>)). In absence of proteotoxic stress, yeast Hsf1 is bound by Hsp70 and its co-chaperone Sis1 in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Feder et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Krakowiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Peffer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Upon encountering stress, Hsp70 is titrated by unfolded proteins, particularly orphan ribosomal proteins located in the nucleolus and nascent polypeptides in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Albert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ali et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Tye et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Tye &amp; Churchman, 2021</xref>), resulting in the release of Hsf1 which then trimerizes and binds to HSEs located upstream of ∼50 genes whose activation is dependent on this factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Once proteostasis is reestablished, excess Hsp70 binds Hsf1, inactivating it, thereby closing the negative feedback loop that regulates Hsf1 transcriptional activity.</p>
<p>In addition to thermal stress, Hsf1 can be activated by chemical stressors such as ethanol. Ethanol is a metabolite of glucose breakdown that budding yeast cells secrete into their surroundings. Ethanol production helps yeast outcompete other microbes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Liti, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Piškur et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rozpedowska et al., 2011</xref>). Once glucose is depleted, ethanol serves as an alternative carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Piškur et al., 2006</xref>). Given this strategic use of ethanol, it is of fundamental importance for yeast to have a mechanism in place to respond to the stress that ethanol elicits. Similar to thermal stress, exposure to ethanol causes a large number of cellular perturbations including disruption of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Piper et al., 1994</xref>); disruption of the H<sup>+</sup> ATPase and intracellular acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Rosa &amp; Sá-Correia, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Triandafillou et al., 2020</xref>); production of reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bandas &amp; Zakharov, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>); depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Homoto &amp; Izawa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Tan et al., 2017</xref>); cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Johnston &amp; Singer, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>); disruption of mRNP transport to the daughter cell and formation of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Grouši et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kato et al., 2011</xref>); global inhibition of transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>); and formation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Piper, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Plesset et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Stanley et al., 2010</xref>). The cell counteracts many of these perturbations through the production of molecular chaperones.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate activation of the HSR in yeast exposed to ethanol stress (ES) and compare it to the response induced by heat shock (HS). We find that similar to HS, exposure to ES induces transcription of Hsf1-regulated genes and elicits concerted intergenic interactions between them (<italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence). In contrast to HS, however, intergenic interactions in ES-induced cells peak well before transcription. Likewise, in response to ES, Hsf1 condensate formation precedes transcriptional activation as its onset parallels that of <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence. Cytosolic protein aggregation exhibits similar rapid kinetics as <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and Hsf1 condensate formation. The delay in transcriptional induction may be linked to profound chromatin compaction that occurs upon exposure of cells to ethanol, a condition that correlates with suppressed displacement of histones during transcription. At longer times of ethanol exposure, <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcript accumulation continues to increase while <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence has already dissipated. Likewise, ES-induced Hsf1 condensates are present for ≥2.5 h, in contrast to HS-induced condensates that begin to dissipate within 30 min. Collectively, our data indicate that different stimuli drive distinct transcription, chromatin, topologic and phase-separation phenomena, yet all are dependent on Hsf1.</p>

<title>Ethanol stress induces transcriptional activation of Hsf1-dependent genes but with delayed kinetics and reduced expression versus thermal stress</title>
<p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in the wild metabolizes glucose and other sugars into ethanol, which the yeast secretes into the environment to suppress microbial competition. Therefore, it is likely that yeast has evolved mechanisms to contend with ethanol toxicity. Indeed, a common laboratory strain (W303) retains viability when cultivated in the presence of a relatively high concentration of ethanol (8.5%), although its ability to proliferate is diminished (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref></bold>). As assessed by the presence of Hsp104-containing foci (a measure of protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Liu et al., 2010</xref>)), the rate of cytosolic protein aggregation is similar in ethanol- and thermally stressed cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D,E</xref></bold>; see <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold> for experimental design). However, it is notable that the extent of Hsp104 foci, and by extension protein aggregation, is substantially higher in cells subjected to ethanol stress.</p>

<p>To gain insight into the mechanism by which <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> contends with ethanol-induced proteotoxicity, we assessed the kinetics of transcriptional activation of <italic>HSR</italic> genes in cells exposed to ethanol stress. Cells were cultivated to early log phase in rich YPD medium, then ethanol was added to a final concentration of 8.5% and cell aliquots were removed at 0, 10, 20 and 60 min. Transcription was terminated through addition of sodium azide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Lee &amp; Garrard, 1991</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). A parallel culture was exposed to an instantaneous 30° to 39°C heat shock and cells were removed at the corresponding time points. Transcription was terminated as above.</p>
<p>While cells exposed to heat shock displayed a rapid and substantial increase in <italic>HSR</italic> gene expression (typically &gt;10-fold increase in RNA levels within 10 min of thermal upshift), those exposed to ethanol stress only weakly induced the same cohort of genes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). However, while HS induced a transient increase in RNA expression, ES induced a sustained increase that was evident at all Hsf1-dependent genes tested (<bold>Figure 2–figure supplement 1</bold>). In the case of <italic>HSP12</italic>, whose transcription is under the dual regulation of Msn2 and Hsf1, exposure to heat shock resulted in a high level of induction as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>) yet exposure to 8.5% ethanol failed to cause detectable activation (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). Nonetheless, as described below, <italic>HSP12</italic> responds to ethanol stress but does so through its inducible and dramatic 3D genomic repositioning.</p>

<title>Pol II recruitment and histone eviction are likewise delayed in ethanol-stressed cells and this correlates with transient, widespread increase in nucleosome density</title>
<p>The delayed transcriptional response of <italic>HSR</italic> genes in ES-vs. HS-treated cells prompted us to investigate occupancy of Hsf1, RNA Pol II and histones at these genes over a time course. A possible explanation for the delay in activation in cells exposed to ethanol stress is reduced Hsf1 binding to the genes’ upstream regulatory regions. To explore this possibility, we exposed cells to either thermal or chemical stress and processed them for chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis. As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kim &amp; Gross, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Sekinger &amp; Gross, 2001</xref>), occupancy of Hsf1 at its target loci increases at least several-fold following a brief heat shock (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, left, dark red; see <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold> for location of primers). Factor occupancy typically declines after 60 min of continuous thermal stress and in the case of <italic>TMA10</italic>, dissociation begins much sooner. In response to ethanol stress, Hsf1 occupancy steadily increased, in most cases reaching maximal levels by 20 min and plateauing thereafter (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, left, black). These results suggest that ethanol stress induces binding of Hsf1 to HSEs to a degree similar to heat shock, yet such binding is more gradual. Moreover, Hsf1’s chromatin binding fails to elicit a corresponding transcriptional response given the results discussed above.</p>

</fig>
<p>In light of this disconnect between Hsf1 binding and <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA production, we evaluated abundance of the Rpb1 subunit of Pol II at representative genes over the same time course. In response to heat shock, Pol II is rapidly recruited to the promoters and coding regions of each <italic>HSR</italic> gene, peaking within 2.5 min and then gradually declining over the next ∼60 min (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, middle, red and pink traces). By contrast, Pol II occupancy is noticeably delayed in cells exposed to ethanol stress (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, middle, blue traces), consistent with reduced transcript levels (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</bold>). The increase in <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA in heat-shocked cells parallels, yet consistently lags, the abundance of Pol II within <italic>HSR</italic> gene coding regions (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</bold>). This delay in reaching peak accumulation may reflect contributions beyond RNA synthesis, such as transient enhanced stability of <italic>HSR</italic> transcripts during the acute phase of heat shock.</p>
<p>To obtain further insight into the chromatin landscape present during the two stresses, we assayed histone H3 abundance as a measure of nucleosome density. In response to heat shock, nucleosomes are rapidly displaced over the promoter, coding and 3’-flanking regions of strongly expressed <italic>HSR</italic> genes (<italic>HSP82, HSP104 and SSA4);</italic> a similar, albeit delayed, response is observed for <italic>TMA10</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>. Following this initial phase (∼20 min), nucleosomes reassemble over all four genes, often returning to their original density by 60 min (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, right, red and pink traces). This dramatic and dynamic remodeling has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Kremer &amp; Gross, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Zhao et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, ethanol stress elicits a transient increase in nucleosome density over all five genes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>, right, blue traces). This apparent increase in chromatin compaction is not restricted to <italic>HSR</italic> genes; a variety of unrelated loci, including a stress-responsive, Msn2-regulated gene (<italic>PGM2</italic>), two constitutively expressed genes (<italic>TUB1, ACT1</italic>), two genes assembled into <italic>SIR</italic>-dependent heterochromatin (<italic>HMLα1, YFR057w</italic>) and a non-transcribed region (<italic>ARS504</italic>) also exhibit a transient increase in nucleosome density in ethanol-exposed cells (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 2A</bold>). These data suggest that the increase in nucleosome density antagonizes Pol II recruitment and its subsequent release into the coding regions of <italic>HSR</italic> genes.</p>
<p>To provide an orthogonal line of evidence for increased chromatin compaction, we used a strain that expresses a histone H2A-mCherry fusion and measured the change in H2A-mCherry volume by live cell fluorescence microscopy. Consistent with ChIP, exposure to ethanol stress induced a sustained decrease in chromatin volume between 2.5 - 60 min (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 2B, 2C</bold>), suggesting that yeast responds to ethanol stress by compacting its genome. A similar but more transient decrease in chromatin volume is seen in cells exposed to acute thermal stress (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 2B, 2C</bold>), consistent with the transient increase in H3 abundance at loci such as <italic>TMA10</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Why H3 occupancy increases at <italic>TMA10</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic> yet not at other <italic>HSR</italic> genes could be related to their modest rate of transcription during the first few minutes of HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pincus et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, our ChIP data indicate that Hsf1 binds to its target enhancers less readily in ethanol-stressed than in thermally stressed cells. This impediment to Hsf1 occupancy is magnified by a corresponding, and more severe, hindrance to Pol II recruitment resulting in a pronounced delay in <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription.</p>

<title>Acute ethanol stress induces rapid and profound 3D genomic repositioning of <italic>HSR</italic> loci</title>
<p>An intriguing feature of <italic>HSR</italic> genes is the fact that they coalesce into discrete intranuclear foci in response to heat shock. Such interactions have been documented using both molecular (chromosome conformation capture (3C)) and imaging (fluorescence microscopy) approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2022</xref>). Intriguingly, physical interactions specifically involve Hsf1 targets irrespective of their location in the genome. Other loci, including adjacent, transcriptionally active genes, show little or no tendency to interact with Hsf1-dependent genes. Such <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-interactions involve regulatory as well as coding regions and are highly dynamic, typically peaking at 2.5 min and dissipating by 30-60 min. The kinetics of coalescence often, although not always, correlate with kinetics of transcriptional induction; they also parallel the formation of Hsf1 condensates as discussed further below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Given these previous observations, we wished to know if ethanol stress induced a similar 3D genome restructuring. It seemed unlikely that such topological changes would occur during the initial phase of ES since only weak Pol II occupancy and <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription are observed as described above (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>). However, as shown in <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>, ES triggered frequent intergenic interactions between Hsf1 targets during the first 10 min as revealed by TaqI-3C, a highly sensitive, quantitative version of 3C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Chowdhary et al., 2020</xref>) (see <bold>Figure 4 – figure supplement 1</bold> for location of 3C primers). Both intra-and interchromosomal interactions are present. Moreover, the interaction frequencies following this exposure in most cases equaled, and in some instances exceeded, those detected in cells heat-shocked for 2.5 min (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>), when peak 3C interactions occur in thermally stressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>). A detailed kinetic analysis revealed that intergenic interactions elicited by ethanol stress, similar to those elicited by thermal stress, are highly dynamic: detectable within 2.5 min, peak shortly thereafter (within 10 min) and largely attenuate by 60 min (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Chowdhary et al., 2017</xref>)).</p>

<p>To provide an orthogonal line of evidence for <italic>HSR</italic> gene interaction, we employed fluorescence microscopy to image live cells bearing <italic>LacO</italic>-tagged <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>TetO</italic>-tagged <italic>TMA10</italic> loci in cells expressing LacI-GFP and TetR-mCherry fusion proteins.

<p>Having confirmed the physical interaction of Hsf1-dependent genes under ethanol stress, we assessed the transcriptional status of coalesced genes. Our RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the increase in <italic>HSR</italic> mRNA levels in ES-induced cells is delayed compared to those in HS-induced cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold>). To obtain insight into <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription kinetics in single cells, we integrated a stem loop array (MS2×24) upstream of <italic>HSP104</italic>, allowing production of a chimeric transcript visualized upon binding of the MCP-mCherry fusion protein (schematically illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Haim et al., 2007</xref>). This strain also harbored <italic>LacO</italic>-tagged <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic> genes and expressed LacI-GFP. We were unable to detect an enhanced MCP-mCherry signal adjacent to <italic>HSP104</italic> under no stress conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>), consistent with very low <italic>HSP104</italic> basal transcript levels (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Heat shock induced rapid coalescence between <italic>HSP104</italic> and <italic>HSP12</italic>, as well as transcription from <italic>HSP104</italic>. These phenomena were detectable by 2.5 min as a merged signal of the chimeric transcript and two GFP-labeled genes (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>, middle). This visualization method allowed us to quantify the percentage of the population that is actively engaged in transcription, revealing that during heat shock, transcription and coalescence are positively correlated (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>, left). Consistent with this, after transcription declined (10 min HS), so did <italic>HSP104</italic>-<italic>HSP12</italic> coalescence.</p>
<p>A detailed single cell analysis supports the strong spatiotemporal correlation between <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and transcription in heat-shocked cells (<bold>Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</bold>). In contrast, under ethanol stress, <italic>HSP104</italic> RNA was not detected in most cases until 10 min even though <italic>HSP12</italic> and <italic>HSP104</italic> coalesced as early as 2.5 min (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref></bold>). Indeed, a detailed single cell analysis reveals clear temporal uncoupling between <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription in ethanol stressed cells (<bold>Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</bold>). Underscoring the disconnect between 3D genome repositioning and transcription is the fact that <italic>HSP12</italic> RNA was undetectable within ES-treated cells until 60 min (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and Figure 2 – figure supplement 1</bold>). Collectively, our RT-qPCR, 3C and imaging data argue that ethanol stress induces striking topological changes in <italic>HSR</italic> genes and that these are accompanied by minimal transcriptional output. This provides a strong contrast to the case in heat-shocked cells where there exists a strong temporal correlation between <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription and <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning.</p>

<title>Ethanol stress induces rapid formation of long-lived Hsf1 condensates</title>
<p>Recently, TF condensates have been proposed as a mechanism for transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hnisz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nair et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>). Heat shock-activated Hsf1 phase separates in both human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>) and budding yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>), forming biomolecular condensates that correlate with <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcriptional activity. The tendency of yeast Hsf1 to phase separate may be linked to its extensive intrinsically disordered structure (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>), a feature proposed to be critical in the <italic>in vivo</italic> phase separation of other proteins (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>)). Given the link between Hsf1 condensation and transcription established in heat-shocked yeast cells, we anticipated that the appearance of Hsf1 condensates in ethanol-stressed cells would be delayed relative to the heat shock case, coinciding instead with the transcriptional induction of Hsf1-dependent genes. However, ethanol stress induced formation of Hsf1-GFP condensates as rapidly as heat shock. These were visible in virtually all cells as early as 2.5 min, paralleling the rapid appearance of Hsf1-GFP condensates in HS cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref></bold>; see <bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold> for representative images). An independent analysis of Hsf1 tagged with a monomeric GFP derivative (mNeonGreen) gave virtually identical results; a large majority of cells exhibited Hsf1 puncta as early as 2.5 min exposure to 8.5% ethanol (<bold>Figure 7 – figure supplement 1</bold>). However, in contrast to the rapid dissolution of condensates in HS cells, those formed in ES cells appeared to be irreversible, as they showed no evidence of dissipating even after 150 min of continuous exposure to ethanol (<bold>Figure 7 – figure supplement 1</bold>). Indeed, Hsf1-GFP condensates were visible in cells exposed to 8.5% ethanol for at least 5.5 h (data not shown). Therefore, in ethanol-stressed cells, formation of Hsf1 condensates is uncoupled from <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription and their maintenance is uncoupled from <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning. An important implication is that although condensates may initiate or promote <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning, they cannot maintain the 3D restructured state of the genome.</p>

<title>Hsf1 and Pol II are required for <italic>HSR</italic> gene interactions in response to both heat shock and ethanol stress</title>

Together with the kinetic uncoupling of Pol II recruitment/transcription from <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning and the relative permanence of Hsf1 condensates under ES stress described above, these observations raise the possibility that ES-induced Hsf1 condensates are compositionally different from those formed in response to HS and drive <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription in a mechanistically distinct way.</p>

<title>Ethanol stress induces <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription, <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and <italic>HSR</italic> condensate formation</title>
<p>Here we have shown that exposure of budding yeast to a high, but sub-lethal, concentration of ethanol strongly stimulates the binding of Hsf1 to the upstream regulatory regions of <italic>HSR</italic> genes. Unexpectedly, such binding – which is evident as early as 2.5 min – does not lead to concurrent recruitment of Pol II and transcription of <italic>HSR</italic> genes. Instead, Pol II recruitment and transcription are delayed, typically for 10 min or longer. As exposure to ethanol causes a global yet transient compaction of chromatin (discussed further below), the increase in nucleosome density may present a barrier to both Pol II recruitment and elongation. In addition, another feature of heat shocked-induced Hsf1 activation – repositioning of <italic>HSR</italic> genes within the 3D genome – is observed in cells exposed to ethanol. However, unlike transcription, this phenomenon occurs rapidly and is transient, resembling what is observed in heat shocked cells. The lack of temporal linkage between <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription and <italic>HSR</italic> intergenic interactions is consistent with the idea that <italic>HSR</italic> gene coalescence and transcription are distinct phenomena and that Hsf1 can drive long-range changes in 3D genome structure independent of inducing transcription (with the best example being <italic>HSP12</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref></bold>)). These observations also demonstrate that a gene-specific TF can have functions independent of regulating transcription (discussed further below).</p>
<p>It has recently been demonstrated that in response to heat shock, inducible transcriptional condensates drive 3D genome reorganization in budding yeast. This conclusion arose from several features, including the tight temporal linkage between Hsf1 condensation and <italic>HSR</italic> intergenic interactions and the similar sensitivity of these two phenomena to the aliphatic alcohol, 1,6-hexanediol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with previous observations of heat-shocked cells (and confirmed here), we have found that in response to ethanol stress, Hsf1 forms discrete puncta and that such puncta are detectable within 2.5 min. However, unlike the case with HS, Hsf1-containing condensates are stable – persisting for hours – while in HS cells such assemblies dissipate within 30 min. In light of the transient nature of induced <italic>HSR</italic> intergenic interactions, we conclude that although condensates may initiate or promote <italic>HSR</italic> gene repositioning in ES cells, they cannot maintain the restructured genomic state. One possible explanation for the difference between ES- and HS-induced condensates is an altered composition of Hsf1 transcriptional condensates dependent on the stress.

<title>Exposure to ethanol transiently induces global compaction of chromatin</title>
<p>An important observation is that exposure of cells to 8.5% ethanol leads to widespread compaction of chromatin. Although this effect is temporary, both euchromatic and heterochromatic regions are impacted as revealed by H3 ChIP, and this is consistent with measurements of total chromatin volume that reveal a decrease lasting nearly 60 min. A similar outcome was recently reported for both yeast and mammalian cells exposed to aliphatic di-alcohols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Itoh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Meduri et al., 2022</xref>). It is likely that the effect of ethanol exposure is nearly instantaneous since ethanol is known to denature proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kato et al., 2019</xref>), likely by dehydration (disruption of biomolecules’ hydration shell). While such denaturation may contribute to chromatin compaction, the effect is reversible, possibly due to refolding / renaturation mediated by Hsp70 and other molecular chaperones whose intracellular concentration increases during ethanol exposure. As mentioned above, the temporary effect on chromatin could suppress Pol II recruitment and subsequent elongation. Possible advantages of this chromatin compaction could be to downregulate global transcription, as well as to limit the chromatin damage by reactive oxygen species or other potentially damaging molecules present in the cell during stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bradley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Costa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Davidson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Davidson &amp; Schiestl, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Voordeckers et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>A novel function for a transcription factor that is uncoupled from regulating the transcription of its target gene</title>
<p>A key finding is that in response to ethanol stress, <italic>HSR</italic> genes reposition and Hsf1 condensates form well before transcription of Hsf1-dependent genes peaks, and in certain cases, is even detected. This suggests that Hsf1 has a functional role beyond regulating transcription since it forms nuclear condensates that drive the repositioning of <italic>HSR</italic> genes, culminating in their physical coalescence. A separation of function mutation in Hsf1 underscores this fact. Deletion of the N-terminal IDR / activation domain (amino acids 1-140; see <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>) was observed to have little effect on <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription during an acute heat shock yet intergenic 3C interactions were strongly suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>While Hsf1 is known to induce interactions between transcriptionally active <italic>HSR</italic> genes in response to heat shock, here we have demonstrated a similar role for this transcription factor in response to ethanol stress. Despite minimal <italic>HSR</italic> gene transcription during the initial 10 min exposure to ethanol, <italic>HSR</italic> genes engage in robust physical interactions, rivaling those seen for 2.5 min HS. This interaction correlates with an increase in definition of Hsf1 condensates yet is not accompanied by concurrent recruitment of Pol II to promoters, perhaps due to compaction of chromatin that occurs in ethanol-stressed cells. Hsf1 therefore forms condensates and drives 3D repositioning of its target genes without appreciably activating these genes. Furthermore, Hsf1 does this through formation of condensates that appear to be materially different than those that form in response to HS. Therefore, in ES cells, Hsf1 condensate formation and genome reorganization are not coupled with high transcriptional output, as is the case for HS (see <bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold> for model). Our results also argue that formation of TF clusters, while sufficient for TF DNA binding and 3D genome restructuring, is not sufficient to drive transcription. Additional factors and/or activities – such as the opening of chromatin – are necessary. Further research into the biophysical properties, molecular regulation, and functional consequences of HSF1 condensates will deepen our understanding of how cells respond to both thermal and chemical stress and maintain cellular homeostasis.</p>

<p>For <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, cells were grown at 30°C in Synthetic Complete Dextrose (SDC) medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL adenine to early log phase. From this culture, 90 µL were removed and cells were immobilized onto a concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma Aldrich, 100 μg/mL in ddH<sub>2</sub>O)-coated coverslip for 20 min. The medium was then removed and replaced by either SDC or SDC + 8.5% v/v ethanol. The coverslip was mounted onto a concave microscope slide (2-Well Concavity Slide, Electron Microscopy Sciences). Images were acquired using an AX70 Olympus epifluorescence microscope across 11 z-planes with 0.5 µm of interplanar distance. Filter set 89021 (Chroma Technology) and a Photometrics Prime 95B camera were used to image GFP and mCherry. SlideBook Software version 6.0.15 (Intelligent Imaging Innovations) was used for image capturing and z-axis stepping motor operation (Ludl Electronic products).</p>
<p>For heat shock, No Stress (NS) control images were taken using an Olympus Ach 100/1.25-NA objective coupled to a heating device (Bioptechs objective heater system). Heat-shocked sample imaging was done by rotating the objective away from the coverslip, switching the heating system on, and allowing it to reach 38°C before returning the objective to the coverslip for an instantaneous heat shock. The same field of view on the coverslip was imaged for both NS and HS timepoints. For ethanol stress, an Olympus UPlanFl 100/1.4-NA objective was used for image acquisition. Analysis of the images after acquisition was done using ImageJ (v. 1.52).</p>
<p>In the <italic>HSP104-TMA10</italic> coalescence analysis, cells in which the fluorophore-tagged genes had undergone replication (two green or two red fluorescent spots, indicative of late S/G2 phase) were excluded from the analysis.

A 50µm pinhole disk was used for imaging in combination with 10% of laser power employed for excitation using 405 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm lasers. Z-stacks were captured as for widefield fluorescence. For heat shock, cells were attached to a VAHEAT substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Icha et al., 2022</xref>) using ConA as above.

The substrate reservoir was covered with a coverslip to prevent media evaporation. Imaging was done over multiple timepoints as indicated in the figures. For ethanol stress, cells were mounted onto a coverslip as above, petroleum jelly was used to hold the coverslip against the concave slide.

<p>Image reconstruction and analysis was done using FIJI/ImageJ (v. 1.53t) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>This is a <bold>useful</bold> contribution to our understanding of how different cell stressors (ethanol or heat-shock) might elicit unique responses at the genomic and topographical level under the regulation of yeast transcription factor Hsf1, and of the temporal coupling (or lack thereof) between Hsf1 aggregation and long-range communication among co-regulated heat-shock loci versus chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation. A particular strength is the combination of genomic and imaging-based experimental approaches applied to genetically engineered in vivo systems. While much of the data is <bold>convincing</bold>, the work is <bold>incomplete</bold> in not providing strong evidence supporting (i) a similar rate and extent of proteotoxic stress under the two chosen stress conditions, (ii) relatively greater bulk chromatin compaction elicited by ethanol, (iii) reproducible levels of interactions between chromosomal loci, and (iv) phase-separated condensates versus other types of Hsf1 clusters.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study compares the transcriptional and epigenetic response of baker's yeast cells to heat shock and ethanol shock. The authors made several interesting observations. In response to heat shock, the transcription factor HSF1 rapidly forms foci, binds upstream elements of heat-shock-response genes, facilitates long-distance genomic contacts between heat-shock-response genes, and the genes are rapidly transcribed. In response to ethanol shock, the transcription factor HSF1 rapidly forms foci, binds upstream elements of heat-shock-response genes, facilitates long-distance genomic contacts between heat-shock-response genes, and yet transcription of the genes is substantially delayed. These insights are potentially important, as current models of eukaryotic gene control predict that physical contact between genes and regulatory elements is necessary, and in some cases sufficient to transcribe a gene. The current study indicates that the two effects are virtually decoupled in response to ethanol shock in yeast cells.</p>
<p>Overall, the conclusions appear appropriately supported by the data, and the data appear of high quality.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The particular strengths of the paper include an impressive combination of genomic and imaging-based approaches and insightful genetically engineered cell systems. The manuscript reports interesting and potentially important findings. The text is generally very well written, the ideas are clearly explained, and the reasoning is easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The main weakness seems to be that the heat and ethanol shock approaches likely elicit pleiotropic effects, and therefore it is a challenge to test the causal relationship between various observations. Nevertheless, even as indirect effects might contribute to some of the authors' observations, the results are definitively worth reporting. Also, the presentation of some of the data could be improved.</p>

<p>Significance</p>
<p>
Rubio et al. study the behavior of the transcription factor Hsf1 under ethanol stress, examining its distribution within the nucleus and the coalescence of heat shock response genes in budding yeast. In comparison to the heat shock response, the response to ethanol stress shows similar gene coalescence and Hsf1 binding. However, there is a notable delay in the transcriptional response to ethanol, and a disconnect between it and the appearance of irreversible Hsf1 condensates/puncta, highlighting important differences in how Hsf1 responds to these two related but distinct environmental stresses.</p>
<p>Overview and general concerns</p>
<p>
The authors studied how yeast responds to ethanol stress (8.5%) and compared it to the heat shock response (from 25{degree sign}C to 39{degree sign}C). They observed a more gradual increase in the expression of heat shock response (HSR) genes during ethanol stress compared to heat shock. Additionally, the recruitment of Hsf1 and Pol II to HSR genes, and the inter- and intrachromosomal interactions among these genes, showed slower kinetics under ethanol stress. They attribute the delay in transcriptional response to chromatin compaction induced by ethanol. Despite this delay, these interactions persisted longer. Hsf1 clusters, previously documented during the heat shock response, were also observed during ethanol stress and persisted for an extended period. The conditional degradation of Hsf1 and Rpb1 eliminated most inter- and intrachromosomal interactions for heat shock responsive genes in both ethanol stress and heat shock conditions, indicating the importance of these factors for long-distance interactions between HSR genes. Overall, this manuscript provides novel insights into the differential behavior of HSR genes under different stress conditions. This contributes to the broader understanding of how different stressors might elicit unique responses at the genomic and topographical level under the regulation of transcription factor Hsf1.</p>
<p>The central finding of the study highlights the different dynamics of Hsf1, Pol II, and gene organization in response to heat shock versus ethanol stress. However, one important limitation to consider is that the two chosen conditions may not be directly comparable. For a balanced assessment, the authors should ideally expose yeast to various ethanol concentrations and different heat shock temperatures, ensuring the observed differences stem from the nature of the stressor rather than suboptimal stress intensity. At the very least, an additional single ethanol concentration point on each side of 8.5% should be investigated to ensure that 8.5% is near the optimum. In fact, comparing the number of Hsp104 foci in the two conditions in Fig. 1E and F suggests that the yeast is likely experiencing different intensities of stress for the chosen heat shock condition and ethanol concentration used in this study.</p>
<p>A second significant concern is the use of the term &quot;Hsf1 condensate&quot;. Chowdhary et al.'s 2022 Molecular Cell study highlighted an inhomogeneous distribution and rapid dynamics of Hsf1 clustering upon heat shock, with sensitivity to 1,6-hexandiol, which is interpreted as evidence for condensation by LLPS. However this interpretation has been criticized severely by McSwiggen et al. Genes Dev 2019 and Mussacchio EMBO J 2022. It is important to mention that 1,6-hexandiol is known to affect chromatin organization (Itoh et al. Life Science Alliance 2021). Describing such clusters as 'condensates' without further experimental evidence is premature. I encourage authors to settle on their neutral term 'puncta' which they use interchangeably with 'condensate' so as not to confuse the reader. The dynamic binding and unbinding of the low-abundance Hsf1 at coalescent chromatin target sites might explain the liquid-like properties of these clusters without the need for invoking the phase-separation hypothesis. While Hsf1 clusters exhibit features consistent with phase-separated condensates, other equally plausible alternative mechanisms, such as dynamic site-specific interactions (Musacchio, EMBO J, 2022), should also be considered. This is best left for the discussion where the underlying mechanism for puncta formation can be addressed.</p>
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>- Figure 1: Why does ethanol stress at 0 min display a larger number of Hsp104 foci per cell than heat shock at the same time? How are foci defined by the authors? In Fig. 1D, there are many smaller puncta. A comparative assessment of the number and size of foci for heat shock and ethanol stress would be beneficial.</p>
<p>- Figure 2: Selecting a housekeeping gene with consistent expression levels is crucial for meaningful qPCR analysis. Do SCR1 mRNA levels fluctuate during heat shock or ethanol stress? Additionally, certain genes, such as TMA10 and SSA4, lack visible bars at time 0. Are these levels undetectable? The varying y-axis scales are confusing; presenting data as relative fold changes could offer a clearer perspective.</p>
<p>- Line 239: The evidence for chromatin compaction is unconvincing. An increase in H3 occupancy by ChIP might indicate a reduction in histone exchange dynamics but may not relate to overall chromatin compaction. The authors use H2A-mCherry to suggest a decrease in chromatin volume, but this data is not persuasive. Did the authors observe any changes in nuclear size? Perhaps quantifying chromatin compaction more directly, using signal intensity per volume, would be informative.</p>
<p>- Line 340: The claim of a &quot;strong spatiotemporal correlation&quot; isn't evident from the data. Could correlation coefficients be provided? There is potential anti-correlation in Fig. 6 - Figure Supplement 1C.</p>
<p>- Figure 8: The WT data in Fig 8 seem inconsistent with Fig. 4 (e.g. the interaction frequency for HSP104 and SSA2). Are these fluctuations between experiments, or are they side effects of IAA treatment? The use of ethanol as an IAA solvent vehicle raises concerns. It would be beneficial if the authors could demonstrate that 1.7% ethanol in the control does not induce ethanol stress.</p>

<p>This is an interesting manuscript that builds off of this group's previous work focused on the interface between Hsf1, heat shock protein (HSP) mRNA production, and 3D genome topology. Here the group subjects the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to either heat stress (HS) or ethanol stress (ES) and examines Hsf1 and Pol II chromatin binding, Histone occupancy, Hsf1 condensates, HSP gene coalescence (by 3C and live cell imaging), and HSP mRNA expression (by RT-qPCR and live cell imaging). The manuscript is well written, and the experiments seem well done, and generally rigorous, with orthogonal approaches performed to support conclusions. The main findings are that both HS and ES result in Hsf1/Pol II-dependent intergenic interactions, along with the formation of Hsf1 condensates. Yet, while HS results in rapid and strong induction of HSP gene expression and Hsf1 condensate resolution, ES results in slow and weak induction of HSP gene expression without Hsf1 condensate resolution. Thus, the conclusion is somewhat phenomenological - that the same transcription factor can drive distinct transcription, topologic, and phase-separation behavior in response to different types of stress. While identifying a mechanistic basis for these results would be a tough task perhaps beyond the scope of this study, it would nevertheless be helpful to place these results in context with a series of other studies demonstrating across various organisms showing Hsf1 driving distinct activities dependent on the context of activation. Perhaps even more importantly, this work left out PMID: 32015439 which is particularly relevant considering that it shows that it is human HSF1 condensate resolution rather than simple condensate formation that is associated with HSF1 transcriptional activity - which is similar to the findings here with this particular dose of HS resulting in resolution and high transcriptional activity versus ES resulting in resolution failure and lower activity. It is also worth noting that the stresses themselves are quite different - ethanol can be used as a carbon source and so beyond inducing proteotoxic stress, the yeast are presumably adapting to this distinct metabolic state. Basically, it is not clear whether these differences are due to the dose of stress, versus we are looking at an early timepoint as ES initiates a genome-wide chromatin restructuring and gene expression reprogramming that goes beyond a response to proteotoxic stress. This reviewer is not suggesting a barrage of new experiments, but perhaps discussion points to contextualize results.</p>
