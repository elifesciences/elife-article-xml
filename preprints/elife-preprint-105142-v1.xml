<title>Abstract</title><p>Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) are mobile genetic elements derived from bacteriophages that mediate genome-wide horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in diverse groups of prokaryotes. BaGTA, encoded by all the pathogens of the genus <italic>Bartonella</italic>, is a chimeric GTA that evolved by the domestication of two phages. The run-off-replication module ROR of one phage is integrated with the capsid production, DNA packaging and lysis machinery Bgt of a second phage. Restricted to a self-sacrifying subset of the bacterial population, the position-specific DNA amplification and packaging of a genomic plasticity region enriched for genes involved in host interaction and adaptation selectively enhances the HGT frequency of these pathogenicity genes. This feature of BaGTA is considered a key innovation underlying the evolutionary success of <italic>Bartonella</italic>. Little is known, however, about the mechanism mediating the coordinated expression of the <italic>ror</italic> and <italic>bgt</italic> loci. Here, we established the regulatory hierarchy, with <italic>ror</italic> acting upstream of the capsid gene cluster <italic>bgtA-K</italic>. BrrG, encoded by the <italic>ror</italic> locus, controls the transcription of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> operon by functioning as a processive antiterminator. This study provides the first insights into the mechanism controlling the coordinated expression of the two BaGTA modules of divergent phage origin. Beyond BaGTA, we propose that antitermination is a broadly relevant mechanism for controlling HGT by GTAs of the Alphaproteobacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Timed and tightly controlled gene expression is crucial in bacterial cells. A variety of mechanisms to control transcription are known, comprising both positive and negative regulators (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Turnbough, 2019</xref>). One of the mechanisms of negative regulation involves transcription attenuation at termination sites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Santangelo and Artsimovitch, 2011</xref>). The regulation of transcription attenuation is achieved by a diverse class of antiterminators which counteract the attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Santangelo and Artsimovitch, 2011</xref>). Antiterminators fall into two categories and can either act specifically at a single, defined terminator site or convert RNA polymerase into a termination-resistant complex that is generally resistant to multiple termination sites over a longer distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Santangelo and Artsimovitch, 2011</xref>; reviewed in Goodson and Winkler, 2018). In the latter case, such antiterminators are referred to as processive antiterminators. Well-known examples of processive antiterminators are Q and N of bacteriophage lambda which control progression of the infection cycle (Goodson and Winkler, 2018).</p>
<p>Peculiar examples of phage evolution are Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Québatte and Dehio, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banks and Tung, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Craske et al., 2024</xref>). GTAs are mobile genetic elements, which emerged from defective temperate bacteriophages. GTAs encode bacteriophage-like particles and in contrast to phages transfer random pieces of host bacterial DNA. Despite their phage origin, GTAs are not self-transmitting because the DNA packaging capacity of a GTA particle is too small to package the entire gene cluster encoding it. Therefore, GTAs are transferred vertically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Banks and Tung, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Craske et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Kogay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Lang et al., 2012</xref>). GTAs are found both in bacteria and archaea, and are one of the non-canonical mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Arnold et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Bacterial pathogens of the genus <italic>Bartonella</italic> encode a chimeric GTA known as <italic>Ba</italic>GTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Québatte and Dehio, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Berglund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Ba</italic>GTA encodes the gene clusters <italic>bgtA-K,</italic> responsible for the synthesis and assembly of GTA particles, <italic>bgtL-R</italic>, with orphan functions, and <italic>bgtS-V</italic>, involved in host cell lysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). DNA packaging in GTA particles is coupled to a process of site-specific DNA amplification mediated by the <italic>ror</italic> locus located in between the <italic>bgtL-R</italic> and <italic>bgtS-V</italic> gene clusters. This locus, emerging from a different phage domestication event, includes an origin of run-off replication (ROR) and the associated <italic>brr</italic> gene cluster <italic>(brrA-G)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Berglund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Québatte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Tamarit et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The <italic>bgt</italic> and <italic>ror</italic> loci are located within a high plasticity zone of the genome that is prone to DNA integrations and is highly enriched for genes encoding virulence properties involved in host interaction and adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Berglund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>). This specific genome architecture leads to ROR-driven amplification and packaging of these pathogenicity genes, resulting in elevated transfer rates to other <italic>Bartonella</italic> bacteria compared to housekeeping genes encoded more distantly to the ROR origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Québatte et al., 2017</xref>). This process is considered to provide the recombination substrates for the duplication and evolutionary diversification of genes encoding the type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) and cognate effector proteins which collectively represent a key innovation associated with the adaptive radiation of these pathogens to diverse mammalian hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engel et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, it is also considered to facilitate the fast evolution of surface-located autotransporters serving in host interaction and adaptation, such as the recombination-driven antigenic variation of the CFA autotransporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Siewert et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, BaGTA is a crucial factor for the fitness and adaptability of pathogens in the <italic>Bartonella</italic> genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Québatte and Dehio, 2019</xref>). However, little is known about how the expression of the <italic>bgt</italic> and <italic>brr</italic> loci derived from separate phages is regulated in a coordinated manner.</p>

<p>In this study, we elucidated the regulatory hierarchy between the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> and <italic>ror</italic> loci, resolving the mechanism of gene expression control. We discovered that <italic>Ba</italic>GTA operates under a strict regulatory framework, with a protein encoded by the <italic>ror</italic> locus and controlling the expression of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> capsid-production locus. Specifically, our research revealed that in absence of <italic>Ba</italic>GTA activation, transcription of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus is attenuated by a terminator site. Upon <italic>Ba</italic>GTA activation by a yet unknown process, the <italic>ror</italic> locus-encoded BrrG overcomes this transcription attenuation of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus by acting as a processive antiterminator. Furthermore, we propose that antitermination is a common mechanism of GTA regulation in the Alphaproteobacteria. Collectively, these findings offer significant insights into the regulation of <italic>Ba</italic>GTA-mediated gene transfer in pathogens of the genus <italic>Bartonella</italic> and suggest a broader impact of processive antitermination as a regulatory principle in related GTAs.</p>

<title>BrrG shows structural similarity to the P21 phage-encoded Q21 antiterminator and is essential for GTA transfer and expression of capsid components</title>
<p>Previously, we identified by multiplexed transposon sequencing the genes of BaGTA encoding both for donor transfer and recipient uptake functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Québatte et al., 2017</xref>). However, many of the identified genes had only hypothetical or no functional sequence-based annotation, leaving their contribution to BaGTA function unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we employed the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold2 to model unannotated proteins of <italic>Ba</italic>GTA genes and searched the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database for similar structures. We discovered that the <italic>brrG</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), which is located in the <italic>ror</italic> locus, encodes a protein with structural similarity to the antiterminator Q21 of the lambdoid bacteriophage P21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Q21 and its counterpart Q from phage λ (Qλ) function as processive antiterminators involved in bypassing intrinsic terminators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grayhack and Roberts, 1982</xref>). This enables uninterrupted expression of the late genes, which encode capsid morphogenesis and lysis cassettes. Therefore, we hypothesized that, similar to Q21 and Qλ, BrrG represents a putative antiterminator controling gene expression within the BaGTA regulatory network.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of <italic>brrG</italic> overexpression on the transcription of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus that encodes components of the capsid synthesis and assembly machinery as essential components of BaGTA production. To address this, we utilized the previously established reporter strain <italic>bgtC-gfp</italic> that contains a promoterless <italic>gfpmut2</italic> inserted in the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus in the intergenic region between <italic>bgtC</italic> and <italic>bgtB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Québatte et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). This transcriptional reporter enabled us to monitor <italic>bgtA-K</italic> expression over time using flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, upper panel). We observed that plasmid-based overproduction of BrrG increased the fraction of GFP fluorescent bacteria to up to 75%, compared to about 15% at native BrrG expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), thus massively expanding the fraction of cells expressing the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus. To test whether this increase is followed by GTA production and elevated DNA transfer, we performed the GTA transfer assay. For that, we cocultivated donor and recipient cells carrying different resistance markers followed by plating on selective media to enumerate double-resistant bacteria as a read-out for the frequency of GTA-mediated gene transfer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, lower panel). We observed that - while the proportion of cells expressing the BaGTA locus increased as a result of BrrG overproduction, GTA transfer rates remained similar to native BrrG expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In contrast, deleting <italic>brrG</italic> led to a significant decrease in the proportion of fluorescent bacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>) and caused DNA transfer rates to drop at least 100-fold compared to those observed at native BrrG expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that BrrG plays a crucial role in regulating BaGTA. It is capable of activating the expression of capsid components in a large part of the population that is initially GTA inactive. However, overproduction of BrrG is not sufficient to increase the rate of DNA transfer, indicating that it acts in concert with other regulators controling other crucial steps of this complex process.</p>

<title>BrrG binds in proximity to the P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter located upstream of to the putative <italic>bgtA-K</italic> operon</title>
<p>In lambdoid phages, both Q21 and Qλ are DNA-binding proteins that recognize a motif located in the promoter region of the late operon, which encodes lysis cassettes and proteins required for capsid morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grayhack and Roberts, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Yin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). Considering the structural similarity between BrrG and Q21, we hypothesised that BrrG may be functionally conserved and thus able to directly bind to DNA at the yet unidentified promoter of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus. To test this, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged BrrG followed by DNA sequencing. We found that BrrG binds to DNA, with a single binding site located in the intergenic region far upstream of the <italic>bgtK</italic> gene representing the first conserved gene of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Tamarit et al., 2018</xref>). Given this remote upstream location of the BrrG binding site, we wondered whether the promoter elements might also be located nearby. First, we tested whether the 999 bp fragment spanning the region upstream of <italic>bgtK</italic> until the end of <italic>clpB</italic> could drive expression of a fused promoterless <italic>dsRed</italic> gene using flow cytometry as readout (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, plasmid p<italic>Pf3-dsRed</italic>). Strikingly, this fragment did not only demonstrate promoter activity but also displayed at the population level a temporal control resembling closely the expression pattern of the chromosomal transcriptional reporter strain <italic>bgtC-gfp H1GmR</italic> with a characteristic peak in the size of expressing population at the 6 h time-point of the 24 h expression kinetic (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). This finding suggests that the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus is organized as a transcriptional unit (operon) that is driven by a promoter localizing to the 999 bp fragment upstream of <italic>bgtK</italic>, which we thus named P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, to narrow down the location of P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic>, we split the 999 bp fragment into three partially overlapping fragments and tested them with the same approach using a <italic>gfpmut2</italic>-based promoter-probe plasmid (plasmids p<italic>sF1</italic>, p<italic>sF2</italic> and p<italic>sF3,</italic> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We observed that the most upstream fragment spanning nucleotides 594-999 was able to drive broad expression of <italic>gfpmut2</italic> at population level (plasmid p<italic>sF3</italic> in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The fraction of fluorescent bacteria was substantially higher compared to the chromosomal transcriptional reporter strain <italic>bgtC-gfp</italic>, expanding beyond 40% at each time-point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Importantly, the lack of temporal regulation as seen by the chromosomal transcriptional reporter strain <italic>bgtC-gfp</italic> and likewise the 999 bp fragment in plasmid Pf3 (compare <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>) suggests that absence of downstream control elements located in the more proximal region spanning nucleotides 1-593 converted P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> into a constitutive state. To map P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> based on conserved elements (-10 and -35 boxes) we aligned corresponding sequences from a selection of <italic>Bartonella</italic> species covering the genomic diversity of this genus. By this comparative approach, we identified a highly conserved sequence motive (TTGACA-N<sub>17</sub>-TATCAT) that shows almost full identity to the canonical sigma-70 promoter sequence of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Campbell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Murakami et al., 2002</xref>). This suggests that P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> functions as a minimal promoter of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus. Interestingly, the BrrG binding region coincides with P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic>, suggesting that BrrG controls transcription either by direct binding to P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> or in the vicinity of it.</p>
<p>Taken together, we identified P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> as a strong constitutive promoter located far upstream of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus, driving its expression as a transcriptional unit along with more proximal elements required for controlling temporal expression at the population level. Additionally, we found that the putative antiterminator BrrG, similar to Q21 and λQ, is a DNA-binding protein that directly binds to P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic>and likely controls <italic>bgtA-K</italic> operon expression at population level.</p>

<title>A long leader sequence attenuating expression is located downstream of the P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter</title>
<p>To confirm that the identified conserved sequence is the promoter and to hint at the function of the long downstream sequence in transcription, we generated a panel of promoter-probe plasmids harboring truncations of the 999 bp fragment bearing promoter activity (p<italic>F0-gfp</italic> to p<italic>F6-gfp</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<p>Because fragment F3 is the shortest fragment displaying reduced expression, we hypothesized that a terminator could be present in the sequence extending the highly fluorescent F2 fragment. Indeed, a putative L-shaped terminator with a free energy (ΔG) of -6 kcal/mol is predicted within this stretch of 139 bp of the F3 fragment, which might explain the observed difference in expression levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that the minimal promoter enables uniform and constitutive expression of the BaGTA locus at population level. The observed temporal regulation and heterogeneity of the gene cluster expression appear to be provided by the stretch of 864 bp located downstream of the promoter and upstream to <italic>bgtK</italic> as first gene of the <italic>bgtA-G</italic> locus. This stretch of DNA contains the putative terminator and could harbor other terminators or additional regulatory elements.</p>

<title>A -10-like element is required for expression of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus</title>
<p>In phage lambda, the process of Q-mediated antitermination relies on the engagement of Q into the complex with RNA-polymerase (RNAP) and the conversion of the latter into a termination-resistant form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>). This process begins with RNAP pausing at the -10- like element, a six-nucleotide motif (NANNNT), located just downstream of the -10 promoter element, which allows Q to engage with the transcription complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, we set out to determine whether a -10-like element is present in the vicinity of the identified P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> minimal promoter. We examined the previously generated alignment and identified a conserved NANNNT site located 5 bp downstream of the identified promoter P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As the conserved nucleotides A and T at positions +2 and +6 in phage lambda and other phages are also conserved in this motive directly downstream of P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic>, we hypothesized that this site could act as a -10-like element (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). To validate this hypothesis, we used the promoter-probe plasmid containing the F6 fragment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), and introduced two point mutations, replacing the conserved A in position -2 to G and T in position +6 to C (p<italic>F6<sub>(-10mut)</sub>-gfp</italic>), respectively. Additionally, we introduced a second plasmid directing ATc-inducible BrrG overproduction to test whether these mutations would affect the activity of the putative antiterminator in the flow cytometry assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). In contrast to plasmid p<italic>F6-gfp</italic> encoding the native -10-like element (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, left, -ATc), p<italic>F6<sub>(-10mut)</sub>-gfp</italic> did not display the characteristic kinetics of GFP-expression of wild-type bacteria with a peak at 6 h (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, right, -ATc). Moreover, neither did it display the massive expansion of the GFP-expressing population upon BrrG overproduction (+ATc) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus, the replacement of two conserved nucleotides at the putative -10-like element completely abolished transcription of the downstream <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus under both native BrrG expression and BrrG overproduction conditions. This suggests that the identified conserved site is a functional - 10-like element essential for the BrrG-mediated antitermination.</p>

<title>BrrG is a processive antiterminator allowing RNAP to bypass the termination site</title>
<p>We showed that BrrG shares structural features with the processive antiterminator Q21 and that its function is dependent on the -10-like element suggesting that BrrG belongs to the class of processive antiterminators. To validate this hypothesis, we tested the antitermination properties of BrrG towards a synthetic terminator. For this, we used the artificially designed strong terminator BBa_B1006 from the iGEM collection and placed it in between the F2 fragment (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), which contains the native P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter and downstream -10-like element, but not the native terminator and the <italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>).

Together, these findings demonstrate that the presence of BrrG allows the RNAP to bypass both the native termination site, as well as an unrelated synthetic terminator, indicating that BrrG is indeed a processive antiterminator.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Processive antitermination is an important mechanism of transcriptional control identified both for bacteria and phages. In temperate phages processive antiterminators, i.e phage lambda N and Q-antiterminators, switch on expression of early and late genes, respectively, and thus enable the progression of the infection cycle (Goodson and Winkler, 2018).</p>
<p>Given the ancestral relationship between GTAs and phages, this study investigates whether transcription attenuation and antitermination are preserved in the chimeric BaGTA and whether they play a role in the regulatory integration of two functional gene clusters of divergent phage origin. We showed that the “late” capsid producing <italic>bgtA-K</italic> genes belong to a single transcriptional unit derived from one phage, and that their expression is enabled by the antiterminator BrrG, encoded within the <italic>ror</italic> locus, which originates from a second phage. However, the question remains: Is BrrG a Q-like antiterminator, and does it function in a similar manner?</p>
<p>The canonical Q-dependent regulatory circuit consists of several critical components: Q antiterminator, the promoter P<italic><sub>R’</sub></italic>, a termination site and a -10-like element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Casjens and Hendrix, 2015</xref>). The first component is the Q antiterminator which binds to DNA and engages into the complex with RNAP. The Q-RNAP complex is termination-resistant and permits RNAP to bypass the termination signals in front of late genes which results in the synthesis of the capsid components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Guo et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Grayhack and Roberts, 1982</xref>). In our study we showed that BrrG has structural similarity to the Q21 antiterminator of the P21 lambdoid phage. Moreover, BrrG is able to counteract transcription attenuation imposed by an introduced artificial termination site. Additionally, we demonstrated that BrrG binds in proximity to the P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter and upregulates transcription of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> cluster – BaGTA’s counterpart of the late gene cluster.</p>
<p>The second component of the canonical Q-dependent regulatory circuit is the promoter P<italic><sub>R’</sub></italic> containing Q-binding site for interaction with Q and engagement with RNAP. In this study, we demonstrated that the P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter overlaps with the BrrG binding site. Given that the promoter P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> is located 864 bp upstream from the first gene of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> cassette and is separated from the former by a gene BH14100, this raises the question of whether BH14100 belongs to the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> cluster and what functional role it may play. Previous studies have shown that BH14100 is not conserved among bartonellae and thus is likely not involved in the BaGTA regulation or synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Tamarit et al., 2018</xref>). In support of this, our previous study using multiplexed transposon sequencing showed no effect of BH14100 disruption on GTA transfer, indicating that BH14100 has either no or only a very modest effect on GTA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Québatte et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The third component of the canonical Q-dependent regulatory circuit is the termination site which attenuates expression of the late gene cluster<sub>’</sub>. We showed that the putative terminator T<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> is located downstream of the P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter and regulates expression of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> operon. Whereas the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus is only active in the GTA producing cells, deleting the putative terminator T<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> renders broad and constitituve expression of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus which suggests that the temporal regulation and heterogeneity in expression are granted by T<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>The fourth component of the canonical Q-dependent regulatory circuit is the -10-like element located in proximity to the promoter P<sub>R’</sub> driving expression of late genes. This element resembles the -10-element of the promoter and defines the sigma-dependent pausing of RNAP which is crucial for the engagement of Q into the complex with RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Perdue and Roberts, 2011</xref>). We found that expression of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus is dependent on the conserved -10-like element located downstream of the P<italic><sub>bgtA-K</sub></italic> promoter. Altogether, these data suggest that BrrG is an antiterminator found in BaGTA and involved in regulating expression of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> cluster. Based on these lines of evidence we propose BrrG as Q-like processive antiterminator.</p>
<p>However, why does GTA-mediated DNA transfer remain unaffected upon <italic>brrG</italic> overexpression?</p>
<p>A simple explanation could be that bacterial lysis and particle release are controlled independently of BrrG which activates only transcription of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus. This notion is supported by the apparent absence of lysis of fluorescent bacteria upon BrrG overproduction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). For the archetypical RcGTA of <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatus</italic>, particle synthesis and release are controlled differentially by the CckA-ChpT-CtrA phosphorelay system, where the phosphorylation state of CtrA controls the progression from the GTA synthesis to a lytic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Farrera-Calderon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fogg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Westbye et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Westbye et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesize that similarly to RcGTA a trigger could be involved in the regulation of bacterial lysis and BaGTA release. BaGTA contains two lysis cassettes – <italic>bgtAB</italic> and <italic>bgtTUV</italic> – and only the former one is located within the larger <italic>bgt</italic> cluster, suggesting that the latter cassette is controlled independently.</p>
<p>Taken together, we demonstrate that the transcriptional control mechanism involving transcription attenuation and antitermination, as described for phage lambda, is functionally conserved in the chimeric BaGTA. This mechanism specifically coordinates the temporal expression of the ROR and <italic>bgtA-K</italic> loci, which have independent phage origins. The ROR-encoded BrrG acts as a processive antiterminator, facilitating the induction of the bgtA-K transcriptional unit. However, is this regulatory mechanism also conserved in other types of GTA beyond BaGTA of <italic>Bartonella</italic>? The recent publication by Tran and Le has shown that termination-antitermination is involved in control of gene expression in evolutionary distinct CcGTA of <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Tran and Le, 2024</xref>). The authors showed that transcription of the structural genes, which are counterparts of the <italic>bgtA-K</italic> locus, is co-activated by GafY and IHF, while the GafZ antiterminator prevents expression attenuation at the termination sites. Furthermore, GafYZ regulators of CcGTA are homologous to N’- and C’-domains of GafA – the direct activator of RcGTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fogg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gozzi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sherlock and Fogg, 2022</xref>), which indicates that RcGTA might also be controlled by processive antitermination. Previous studies of GafA indicated that its C’-domain has similarity to the region 4 of a sigma factor (R4σ) and therefore authors proposed GafA as an alternative sigma factor or a transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fogg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sherlock and Fogg, 2022</xref>). However, the related R4σ-like fold was also found in the resolved structure of Q21 antiterminator indicating that findings of Fogg and Sherlock might, in fact, speak for the implication of GafA in antitermination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, Tran and Le found neither sequence nor structural similarity of GafZ to known antiterminators Qλ and Q21. Our comparison of resolved structure of Q21 and modelled BrrG, GafZ and GafA, clearly indicates similar structural features suggesting both GafZ and GafA being antiterminators (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>RcGTA and CcGTA, on one hand, and BaGTA on the other, belong to two evolutionary distinct groups of GTA that emerged from independent events of phage domestication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Kogay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Tamarit et al., 2018</xref>). The reliance of these groups on the termination-antitermination mechanism of transcription control clearly suggests that processive antitermination is a common regulatory mechanism in GTAs, which evolved independently in two types of GTA within Alphaproteobacteria. To date, five types of GTAs have been identified in both bacteria and archaea. Given their phage heritage, it remains unclear whether other GTA types also depend on processive antitermination for regulation, and this should be explored in future studies.</p>

<title>Measuring expression of the BaGTA locus with flow cytometry</title>
<p><italic>B. henselae</italic> strains were grown as described above. Bacteria were resuspended in M199 supplemented with 10% FCS and other additives, e.g inducer, if required (hereafter M199+), diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> <sub>nm</sub> = 0.008 and incubated in 24-well plate for a defined amount of time in a humidified atmosphere at 35°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After a defined amount of time bacteria were collected, centrifuged, and washed once with PBS. Bacteria were resuspended in 4% PFA and fixed for 7 min at RT. The fixation was stopped by adding PBS supplemented with 2% FCS. Samples were kept at 4°C in the dark before flow cytometric analysis. GFP fluorescence in samples was recorded with the BD LSRFortessa™ Cell Analyzer at the FACS Core Facility, Biozentrum, the University of Basel.

<p>GTA transfer assays were done as co-cultivations of two <italic>B. henselae</italic> strains. <italic>B. henselae</italic> strains were grown as described above. Bacteria were resuspended in M199+ supplemented, if required, with inducer at specified concentrations and diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> <sub>nm</sub> = 0.008. For tested co-cultivation pair 1ml of each strain was mixed and a mixture was incubated in 24-well plate for 24h in a humidified atmosphere at 35°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After 24h bacteria were collected and centrifuged. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 30ul of M199+ and resuspensions were used for serial dilutions followed by plating onto CBA plates supplemented with SmGm or SmGmSp antibiotics. Bacteria were grown for 6-15 d in a humidified atmosphere at 35°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Bacterial colonies were counted, and CFU/ml was determined for each co-cultivation pair. Frequency of double resistant bacteria (DRB) was calculated as the ratio of CFUs of recipient DRB (SmR GmR SpR) / total number of recipients (SmR GmR), yielding the transfer frequency per recipient cell.</p>

<p><italic>B. henselae</italic> strains were grown as described above. Bacteria were harvested from plates and resuspended in 5 ml of Schneider’s Insect Medium (24.5 g/l Schneider’s Drosophila Powder Medium Revised, 5% (wt/vol) sucrose, 0.025 M HEPES, adjusted pH 7.25) supplemented with 10% FCS (hereafter Schneider’s Medium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Guy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Riess et al., 2008</xref>). Bacteria were diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> <sub>nm</sub> = 0.01 in 500 ml Schneider’s Medium for each strain and grown at 35°C with shaking 135 rpm for 4d until OD<sub>600</sub> <sub>nm</sub> = 0.6-0.7. Bacteria were pelleted and pellets were resuspended in 50ml PBS. Bacteria were fixed with PFA with final concentration 1% and incubated for 10 min at RT. The fixation was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM, and mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice. Fixed bacteria were centrifuged for 30 min at 4°C at 2000 x g, and bacterial pellets were frozen at -80°C. Thawed pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of ChIP Buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 167 mM NaCl, supplemented with cOmplete™Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail) and cells were lysed by 4 passages with French Press. The lysate was sonicated, and DNA size was checked with the 1.5% agarose gel. The lysate was centrifuged with the maximal speed and supernatant was collected. A 50 ul aliquot of supernatant was taken as “Input DNA” for the subsequent sequencing and data analysis. Following manufacturers’ protocols, remaining supernatant was immunoprecipitated ON with anti-FLAG Magnetic Agarose or anti-HA magnetic beads for 3xFLAG-tagged and HA-tagged proteins, respectively. Magnetic beads/agarose were immobilized and after removal of supernatant were sequentially rinsed with a panel of buffers: Low Salt Wash Buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mM NaCl), High Salt Wash Buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mM NaCl), LiCl Wash Buffer (250 mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1)), TBS Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl). The thawed Input control and immobilized Magnetic beads/agarose were mixed with 450 ul of TBS buffer, 15 µL of 5 M NaCl and 0.5 ul RNAse A (100mg/ml). The mixtures were incubated at 65°C ON. Then 4 µL of 0.5 M EDTA and 2 µL of 10 mg/mL Proteinase-K were added and the mixtures were incubated at 45°C for 2 h. The resulting mixtures were thoroughly mixed in 1:1 ratio with phenol/chlorophorm/isoamylalcohol combination and centrifuged at &gt;10 000g for 1 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, mixed in 1:1 ratio with chloroform and centrifuged at &gt;10’000 x g for 1 min. The upper aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and mixed with: (i) 25 ug of linear polyacrylamide; (ii) NaAc to a final concentration of 0.3 M; (iii) in 1:1 ratio with 100% isopropanol. The solution was centrifuged at &gt;10’000 x g for 30min, washed twice with cold 70% EtOH. Pelleted DNA was dried and resuspend in water ON.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Gene transfer agent (GTA) from Bartonella is a fascinating chimeric GTA that evolved from the domestication of two phages. Not much is known about how the expression of the BaGTA is regulated. In this manuscript, Korotaev et al noted the structural similarity between BrrG (a protein encoded by the ror locus of BaGTA) to a well-known transcriptional anti-termination factor, 21Q, from phage P21. This sparked the investigation into the possibility that BaGTA cluster is also regulated by anti-termination. Using a suite of cell biology, genetics, and genome-wide techniques (ChIP-seq), Korotaev et al convincingly showed that this is most likely the case. The findings offer the first insight into the regulation of GTA cluster (and GTA-mediated gene transfer) particularly in this pathogen Bartonella. Note that anti-termination is a well-known/studied mechanism of transcriptional control. Anti-termination is a very common mechanism for gene expression control of prophages, phages, bacterial gene clusters, and other GTAs, so in this sense, the impact of the findings in this study here is limited to Bartonella.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Convincing results that overall support the main claim of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A few important controls are missing.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors identified and characterized a regulatory mechanism based on transcriptional anti-termination that connects the two gene clusters, capsid and run-off replication (ROR) locus, of the bipartite Bartonella gene transfer agent (GTA). Among genes essential for GTA functionality identified in a previous transposon sequencing project, they found a potential antiterminatior of phage origin within the ROR locus. They employed fluorescence reporter and gene transfer assays of overexpression and knockout strains in combination with ChiPSeq and promoter-fusions to convincingly show that this protein indeed acts as an antiterminator counteracting attenuation of the capsid gene cluster expression.</p>
<p>Impact on the field:</p>
<p>The results provide valuable insights into the evolution of the chimeric BaGTA, a unique example of phage co-domestication by bacteria. A similar system found in the other broadly studied Rhodobacterales/Caulobacterales GTA family suggests that antitermination could be a general mechanism for GTA control.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Results of the selected and carefully designed experiments support the main conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>It remains open why overexpression of the antiterminator does not increase the gene transfer frequency.</p>

<p>(1) Provide Rsmd and DALI scores to show how similar the AlphaFold-predicted structures of BrrG are to other anti-termination factors. This should be done for Fig1B and also for Suppl. Fig 1 to support the claim that BrrG, GafA, GafZ, Q21 share structural features.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the revised manuscript we will provide Rsmd and DALI scores.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Throughout the manuscript, flow cytometry data of gfp expression was used and shown as single replicate. Korotaev et al wrote in the legends that error bars are shown (that is not true for e.g. Figs. 3, 4, and 5). It is difficult for reviewers/readers to gauge how reliable are their experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated in the manuscript all flow cytometry data were performed in triplicate. In the revised manuscript we will include the two replicates not presented in the main figures as supplementary information.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) I am unsure how ChIP-seq in Fig. 2A was performed (with anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies? I cannot tell from the Materials &amp; Methods). More importantly, I did not see the control for this ChIP-seq experiment. If a FLAG-tagged BrrG was used for ChIP-seq, then a WT non-tagged version should be used as a negative control (not sequencing INPUT DNA), this is especially important for anti-terminator that can co-travel with RNA polymerase. Please also report the number of replicates for ChIP-seq experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Fig. 2A presents a coverage plot from the ChIP-Seq of ∆brrG +pTet:brrG-3xFLAG (N’). A replicate of this N-terminally tagged construct will be added as supplementary data in the revised version. As anticipated by the referee, we had used ∆brrG +pTet:brrG (untagged) as control.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Korotaev et al mentioned that BrrG binds to DNA (as well as to RNA polymerase). With the availability of existing ChIP-seq data, the authors should be able to locate the DNA-binding element of BrrG, this additional information will be useful to the community.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will mine the ChIP-Seq data to define the BrrG binding site as closely as possible and include the analysis in the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Mutational experiments to break the potential hairpin structure are required to strengthen the claim that this putative hairpin is the potential transcriptional terminator.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did not claim that the identified hairpin is a terminator but rather suggested it as a candidate terminator. We agree with the referee that the proposed experiment would be necessary to definitively prove its terminator function. However, our primary aim was to demonstrate that BrrG acts as a processive terminator, which we have shown by replacing the putative terminator with a well-characterized synthetic terminator that BrrG successfully overcame. Therefore, we prefer not to conduct the proposed experiment and will instead further tone down our conclusions regarding the putative terminator function of the identified hairpin structure.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors wrote &quot;GTAs are not self-transmitting because the DNA packaging capacity of a GTA particle is too small to package the entire gene cluster encoding it&quot; (page 3). I thought that at least the Bartonella capsid gene cluster should be self-transmissible within the 14 kb packaged DNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003393">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003393</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000546">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000546</ext-link>). This was also concluded by Lang et al (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-101416-041624">https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-101416-041624</ext-link>). In this case the presented results would have important implications. As the gene cluster and the anti-terminator required for its expression are separated on the chromosome, it would not be possible to transfer an active GTA gene cluster, although the DNA coding for the genes required for making the packaging agent itself, theoretically fits into a BaGTA particle. Could the authors comment on that? I think it would be helpful to add the sizes of the different gene clusters and the distance between them in Fig. 2A. The ROR amplified region spans 500kb, is the capsid gene cluster within this region?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this interesting point. The bgt cluster (capsid cluster) is approximately 9.2 kb in size and could feasibly be packaged in its entirety into a GTA particle. In contrast, the ror gene cluster, which encodes the antiterminator BrrG, is approximately 20 kb in size—exceeding the packaging limit of GTA particles—and is separated from the bgt cluster by approximately 35 kb. Consequently, if the bgt cluster is transferred via a GTA particle into a recipient host that does not encode the ror gene cluster, the bgt cluster would not be expressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Another side-note regarding the introduction: On page three the authors write: &quot;GTAs encode bacteriophage-like particles and in contrast to phages transfer random pieces of host bacterial DNA&quot;. While packaging is not specific, certain biases in the packaging frequency are observed in both studied GTA families. For Bartonella this is ROR. In the two GTA-producing strains D. shibae and C. crescentus origin and terminus of replication are not packaged and certain regions are overrepresented (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy005">https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evy005</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001790">https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3001790</ext-link>). Furthermore, D. shibae plasmids are not packaged but chromids are. I think the term &quot;random&quot; does not properly describe these observations. I would suggest using &quot;not specific&quot; instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and will adjust the working accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Page 5: Remove &quot;To address this&quot;. It is not needed as you already state &quot;To test this hypothesis&quot; in the previous sentence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will adjust the working accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) I think the manuscript would greatly benefit from a summary figure to visualize the Q-like antiterminator-dependent regulatory circuit for GTA control and its four components described on pages 15 and 16.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion and will include a summary figure illustrating the deduced regulatory mechanism in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Page 17: It might be worth noting that GafA is highly conserved along GTAs in Rhodobacterales (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.662907">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.662907</ext-link>) and so is probably regulatory integration into the ctrA network (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00803">https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00803</ext-link>). It's an old mechanism. It would be also interesting to know if it is a common feature of the two archetypical GTAs that the regulator is not part of the cluster itself.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the points raised by the reviewer and will address them in the revised manuscript. Specifically, we will highlight the high conservation of GafA in GTAs across Rhodobacterales and its regulatory integration within the ctrA network. Additionally, we will analyze whether the GafA-like antitermination regulator is typically located outside the regulated gene cluster, as we have demonstrated for BrrG of BaGTA in the Bartonellae.</p>
