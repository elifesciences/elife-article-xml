<abstract><p>Electrical synapses containing Connexin 36 (Cx36) represent the main means for direct electrical communication among neurons in the mammalian nervous system. However, little is known about the protein complexes that constitute these synapses. In the present study, we applied different BioID strategies to screen the interactomes of Connexin 36 and its zebrafish orthologue Cx35b in retinal neurons. For <italic>in vivo</italic> proximity labeling in mice, we took advantage of the Cx36-EGFP strain and expressed a GFP-nanobody-TurboID fusion construct selectively in AII amacrine cells. For <italic>in vivo</italic> BioID in zebrafish, we generated a transgenic line expressing a Cx35b-TurboID fusion under control of the Cx35b promoter. Both strategies allowed us to capture a plethora of molecules that were associated with electrical synapses and showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation in the proteomes of both species. Besides known interactors of Cx36 such as ZO-1 and ZO-2 we have identified more than 50 new proteins, such as scaffold proteins, adhesion molecules and regulators of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, we determined the subcellular localization of these proteins in mouse retina and tested potential binding interactions with Cx36. Amongst these new interactors, we identified signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 3 (Sipa1l3), a protein that has been implicated in cell junction formation and cell polarity, as a new scaffold of electrical synapses. Interestingly, Sipa1l3 was able to interact with ZO-1, ZO-2 and Cx36, suggesting a pivotal role in electrical synapse function. In summary, our study provides the first detailed view of the electrical synapse proteome in retinal neurons, which is likely to apply to electrical synapses elsewhere.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With the discovery of acetylcholine as the first neurotransmitter at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it was widely accepted that chemical synaptic transmission is the only means of communication for neurons. Decades later, several authors independently demonstrated evidence for the existence of electrical synapses in invertebrates as well as in vertebrates, and subsequent studies identified gap junctions, which are composed of clusters of intercellular channels, as the morphological substrates of these synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). Today it is considered common knowledge among neuroscientists that both types of synapses coexist in the nervous system and that each of them provides unique features essential for accurate signal processing. Yet, compared to the efforts that have been made to study protein complexes underlying chemical synapse function and regulation, we know fairly little about the proteome that constitutes an electrical synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to chemical synapses, electrical synapses don’t rely on neurotransmitters and specific receptor molecules but instead make use of intercellular channels to convey neural signals bidirectionally in the form of ionic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). This seemingly simple mode of communication allows for an instantaneous signal transmission that synchronizes the activities of electrically coupled neurons giving rise to complex brain functions such as network oscillation, hormone secretion or coordination of motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>).</p>
<p>In the mammalian nervous system, electrical synapses are mainly, but not exclusively formed by Connexin 36 (Cx36), a connexin isoform that is highly specific for neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) and often referred to as the “major neuronal connexin”. One exception to the rule are the insulin producing beta cells in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In general, Cx36 gap junction channels are known to exhibit a very low single channel conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>) but a remarkable degree of plasticity that allows neurons to regulate the number of open channels and hence the strength of synaptic transmission in order to adapt to environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). A prime example of a neuron that is heavily coupled via Cx36 and in which the signal transduction pathways that regulate electrical coupling have been well described is the AII amacrine cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). The AII cell is a glycinergic interneuron in the mammalian retina that is electrically coupled to neighboring AII amacrine cells and to ON Cone bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The main task of this cell is to collect neural signals that originate in rods and relay them into the cone pathway. This circuit is referred to as the primary rod pathway and it forms the neurophysiological basis for scotopic vision. Within the primary rod pathway, electrical coupling of AII amacrine cells is regulated in an activity dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The opening of Cx36 channels in AII amacrine cells requires the activation of calcium calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII), which is triggered by the influx of calcium through non-synaptic NMDA receptors. Once CaMKII is activated, it binds to Cx36 and phosphorylates the intracellular domains causing the channel to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). These activity driven changes clearly resemble long-term potentiation as it has been described for chemical synapses in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Another, almost obvious, but not less important, parallel between electrical and chemical synapses, is the their basic “architecture”: 1) Glutamate receptors, for instance, interact with PSD95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), a membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) that is similar in function and domain structure to ZO-1, another MAGUK and well-known interactor of Cx36. 2) Electrical synapses are surrounded by adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). 3) As described for glutamatergic synapses, electrical synapses also harbor electron dense structures that appear to consist of a dense assemblage of synaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). However, the composition of this density or the type of adhesion molecule that is necessary to specify where an electrical synapse is formed still remain a mystery and require sophisticated proteomics to solve.</p>
<p>The task of identifying compartment specific proteomes or interactomes for a given protein of interest (POI) with standard techniques has always been challenging due to the abundance of non-specific background and the requirement to preserve intact protein complexes. To overcome these limitations, several laboratories have developed novel proximity techniques such as TurboID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), which utilize promiscuous biotin ligases to biotinylate neighboring proteins within a radius of 5 nm of the POI. Like any other tag, TurboID can be fused to the POI and is then expressed in cells, where it is allowed to biotinylate proximal proteins that are subsequently isolated with streptavidin beads under stringent buffer conditions. The ability to directly label “associated” proteins with an affinity tag combined with the fast enzyme kinetics have made TurboID a valuable tool for modern <italic>in vivo</italic> proteomics. Previously, BioID and TurboID have been used to study the proteomes of chemical synapses and even contact sites of astrocytes and neurons in nematodes and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we have applied two different TurboID approaches to uncover the electrical synapse proteome in the mouse and the zebrafish retina. Contrasting these two model organisms allowed us to expose essential components of the molecular architecture of vertebrate electrical synapses. Beyond known components of electrical synapses, such as ZO-1 and ZO-2, our screen identified a plethora of new molecules that were not previously shown to associate with Cx36/Cx35b. These include components of the endocytic machinery, adhesion molecules, regulators of the cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, as well chemical synapse proteins. Overall, our screen showed that many components of electrical synapses in zebrafish and mouse retinas were highly conserved, in particular the ZO proteins and the endocytosis components, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation that suggests a critical functional role for these proteins.</p>

<title>Two TurboID approaches allow a glimpse at the electrical synapse proteome in zebrafish photoreceptors and AII amacrine cells of the mouse retina</title>
<p>In this study, we have adopted two <italic>in vivo</italic> BioID approaches to gain a more comprehensive understanding of protein complexes that are associated with the neuronal connexin Cx36 and its zebrafish orthologue Cx35b in retinal neurons. To implement BioID in zebrafish, we generated a transgenic line expressing a Cx35b-V5-TurboID fusion protein (we used an internal insertion site as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)) under the control of Cx35b promoter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A). As shown in control experiments, the expression of this construct recapitulated the expression pattern of wildtype Cx35b in photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>) which were labelled with ZPR1, indicating that Cx35b-V5-TurboID is correctly targeted to synapses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The inner retina, however, displayed much weaker expression of the fusion construct, which is why we anticipated that most of the candidates we detected with this strategy are proteins that are associated with Cx35b in photoreceptors. To induce efficient biotinylation in zebrafish we injected 10mM biotin solution intraperitoneally on three consecutive days and isolated biotinylated proteins for mass spectrometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and C</xref>). A complete list of proteins captured in two experiments is shown in Supplement 1. For the analysis of mass spec data sets we compared the abundance of candidate proteins from the Cx35b-V5-TurboID strain to wildtype samples that did not express TurboID, and evaluated specificity using Significance Analysis of Interactome (SAINT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). In Cx35b-V5-TurboID samples, but not in wild type retinas, we found several known interactors of the Gjd2 family such as scaffold proteins including Tjp1a, Tjp1b, Tjp2a, Tjp2b, Mupp1, Psd95 and Af6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). In addition to these candidates, we identified proteins that are involved in membrane trafficking including Syt4, Sec22b, components of the endosomal trafficking machinery Snap91 and Eps15I1a, and an additional Cx36 orthologue termed Cx34.7, which has previously been localized to photoreceptors in bass retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). The detection of this Gjd1 isoform via BioID was somewhat surprising, as Cx34.7 was shown to form gap junctions that are separated from Cx35b containing clusters in bass photoreceptors. To determine the subcellular localization of Cx34.7 and its connection to Cx35b in zebrafish photoreceptors, we generated a transgenic Cx34.7-GFP strain, that expressed an internally GFP-tagged fusion protein under the control of the Cx34.7 promoter. In this strain, we found that Cx34.7 was only expressed in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) where it was associated with Cx35b at some gap junctions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, besides known interactors of the Gjd family, our <italic>in vivo</italic> BioID approach identified an additional connexin isoform that is connected to Cx35b in photoreceptors.</p>

<p>To unravel the Cx36 interactome in the mouse retina we initially delivered a Cx36-V5-TurboID fusion via intravitreal AAV injections into retinal neurons. This construct was similarly designed to the Cx35b clone but regulated by a short human synapsin promoter to drive expression in the neural retina (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Unfortunately, this strategy produced massive overexpression artefacts and resulted in an accumulation of Cx36-V5-TurboID in ganglion cell somas, which would have made an interactome analysis of a synaptic protein impossible. To solve this issue and to ensure that TurboID is targeting electrical synapses, we took advantage of the GFP-directed TurboID approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and the Cx36-EGFP transgenic mouse strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). The GFP-directed TurboID strategy was initially developed as a modular system for zebrafish by Xiong et al., and utilizes and a destabilized GFP nanobody that is fused to TurboID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) to direct the biotin ligase towards a given protein of interest carrying a GFP-Tag. To further increase the specificity of our approach and identify the Cx36 interactome within a single type of inhibitory interneuron, the AII amacrine cell, we expressed V5-TurboID-dGBP under control of the HKamac promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). As shown previously, in retinas that were infected with AAVs carrying an HKamac GFP vector, we observed GFP expression mainly in AII amacrine cells but not in bipolar cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, lack of GFP expression in SCGN labelled neurons). In our hands, we also observed GFP labeling in horizontal cells, which was neglectable for our paradigm, since these neurons do not express Cx36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) and because dGBP is degraded unless it is bound to GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). In an initial experiment we injected AAVs carrying HKamac_V5-TurboID-dGBP intravitreally into Cx36-EGFP mice and tracked the localization of the construct two weeks post injection. As expected, all V5 labeled puncta colocalized with Cx36-EGFP, indicating that V5-TurboID-dGBP reached electrical synapses in AII amacrine cells. In the next experiment, we injected a 5 mM biotin solution subcutaneously on 4 consecutive days, 3 1/2 weeks post infection. This treatment was sufficient to induce efficient biotinylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, lower panel and C) and allowed us to capture a plethora of molecules that were associated with Cx36. To distinguish these proteins from background, we included wild type mice injected with AAV HKamac_V5-TurboID-dGBP throughout the entire experiment. A complete list of proteins captured in two experiments is shown in Supplement 2. We compared the abundance of all proteins we detected and evaluated specificity using SAINT. A mass spec hit that was three times or even more abundant in the Cx36-EGFP condition and with a SAINT score greater than 0.5 was considered a candidate that is likely to be associated with Cx36. We illustrated the relationship of all proteins that fell into this category in a string diagram (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Among the most abundant proteins in our screen, we identified the ZO proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 and signal induced proliferation associated 1 like 3 (Sipa1l3), a PDZ domain containing protein that has been implicated in the regulation of cell adhesion and cell polarity. In addition to these candidates, we also identified proteins that are involved in endocytosis, membrane trafficking, regulation of the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and chemical synapses. All of these hits covered different functional categories of proteins that have been related to connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) and thus appear to represent an authentic interactome for a neuronal gap junction protein.</p>

<title>Localization of BioID hits at Cx36 containing gap junctions in the AII amacrine cell</title>
<p>In the next set of experiments, we validated the most abundant candidates from our list in GFP expressing AII amacrine cells. We categorized the proteins based on the cell biological function they serve. In line with the mass spec data, we observed the most frequent colocalization for Cx36 with scaffold proteins including ZO-1, ZO-2, cingulin and Sipa1l3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, arrows). Although ZO-1, ZO-2 and cingulin are known components of electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), Sipa1l3 has not been shown before to associate with Cx36, yet it colocalized with the connexin to a similar extent as the ZO proteins, suggesting that it could be essential for synapse formation or stabilization. In addition to scaffolding proteins, we confirmed an association with several adapter proteins of the endocytic machinery, including Eps15l1, Snap91, Hip1r and Itsn1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, arrows). In comparison to the scaffold proteins, however, the colocalization of Cx36 with each of these endocytic components was clearly less frequent and more heterogenous, which appears to reflect different stages in the life cycle of Cx36. As most proteins we identified in this initial screen broadly labeled the entire inner plexiform layer (IPL – the inner synaptic layer of the retina), we performed a colocalization analysis to exclude a random overlap with Cx36. We quantified the number of Cx36 plaques that contained Cgn, Sipa1l3, Eps15l1 and Hip1r (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> &amp; D) and compared the extent of colocalization to a control in which we flipped the Cx36 channel horizontally. For each candidate, we found a significant reduction in colocalization, when the original images were compared to the flipped control, indicating that the proteins we have identified are actual components of electrical synapses.</p>

<p>Besides synaptic scaffolds and endocytic adapter proteins we tested a variety of additional hits, which include synaptojanin 2 binding protein (Sj2bp), synaptotagmin 4 (Syt4; categorized as “trafficking”) and several proteins that regulate actin dynamics such as G-protein regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (Gprin1), dedicator of cytokinesis 7 (Dock7) and microtubule associated protein 6 (Map6). All of these proteins showed considerable colocalization with Cx36 in AII amacrine cell dendrites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). We also tested components of chemical synapses including GluR2-3, the scaffold Shank2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>) and Bai1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) a synaptic adhesion molecule implicated in excitatory synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>).

<title>Identification of novel Cx36 binding partners</title>
<p>Thus far, we have gained significant insight into the Cx36 interactome and identified several new molecules as components of electrical synapses in AII amacrine cells. To understand how these molecules are organized at the synapse we tested protein-protein interactions in co-transfected HEK293T cells. Interestingly, two of the novel proteins we detected in AII cells contain PDZ domains and thus may directly bind to Cx36 like ZO-1 and ZO-2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, GFP-Trap IP with both ZO proteins served as a positive control); these proteins are Sipa1l3 and Sj2bp. We found that Myc-Sipa1l3 interacted with all major components of electrical synapses: ZO-1, ZO-2 and Cx36 in co-transfected HEK293T cells. The overlap of Sipa1l3 and the ZO proteins was confined to cell cortices and to actin like fibers in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Additionally, we performed IP experiments and demonstrated that Cx36 binds to Sipa1l3 in a PDZ dependent manner. A truncated version of Cx36 lacking the PDZ binding motif (Cx36/S318Ter) failed to interact with Sipa1l3 in IP experiments. In co-transfected cells we observed that Sj2bp, which contains a single PDZ domain and a transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), colocalized with Cx36 but not with the Cx36/S318Ter, indicating that the interaction of these proteins requires the PDZ domain. In IP experiments using FLAG tagged Sj2bp as a bait we were unable to coprecipitate Cx36, which was rather surprising as both proteins clearly colocalized in co-transfected HEK293T cells. One possible explanation for the lack of a detectable interaction, is that Sj2bp displays a low affinity for the PDZ binding motif (PBM) of Cx36, as it is the case for ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). We have previously shown that binding of Cx36 to ZO-1 can be artificially enhanced by a simple deletion of amino acids 313-319 within the C-terminus creating a new PBM with the following sequence: RTYV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). We repeated the IP with this mutant and observed substantial binding to FLAG-Sj2bp (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that Cx36 and SJ2BP are compatible interactors. In addition to the candidates we overexpressed to verify direct binding interactions, we found that Cx36 colocalized with several endogenous HEK293T proteins that also occurred in our AII cell specific data set, including Eps15l1, Gprin1 and Sec22b (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Molecular architecture of the AII amacrine cell/On cone bipolar cell gap junction</title>
<p>AII amacrine cells form two different sets of gap junctions, with neighboring AII amacrine cells and with ON cone bipolar cells to convey neural signals that originate in rod photoceptors into the cone pathway (Illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Ultrastructural studies have revealed an asymmetry in the cytoplasm of AII/ON cone bipolar cell junctions (AII/ONCBC), which exhibits an electron dense structure (termed fluffy material) in the AII amacrine cell but not in the cone bipolar cell, hinting at differences in the molecular composition of both sites of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). Moreover, apart from accessory proteins that bind to the channel, AII/ONCBC gap junctions are likely to be distinct from AII/AII gap junctions since they recognize ON cone bipolar cells as the correct synaptic partner. These two characteristics of the AII/ONCBC gap junction can only be explained by a unique composition of the synapse proteome. We reasoned that the electron density in the AII cell could harbor several proteins we identified in this study. To test this hypothesis, we triple labelled AAV/HKamac_GFP infected retinas with Scgn, Cx36 and the main candidates from our screen. With this strategy it was possible for us to visualize AII/ONCBC contacts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> D, arrows) and the precise localization of each candidate. To illustrate the localization of AII/ONCBC gap junctions in a comprehensive way, we reconstructed the morphology of AII amacrine cells using serial section transmission EM imaging. As seen in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6B</xref>, most AII/ONCBC gap junctions (shown in yellow) were located above homologous AII/AII contacts (Cyan) and contained electron densities on both sides (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>

In addition to these proteins, we also confirmed that AII/Cone bipolar cell gap junctions contained Syt4, Eps15l1, Sj2bp and Gprin1. Finally, we addressed the exact localization of the G protein coupled adhesion receptor Bai1, a synaptic adhesion molecule that has been implicated in excitatory synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Interestingly, we observed Bai1 at AII/ONCBC contacts, in the vicinity of Cx36, which is consistent with the notion of synaptic adhesion molecules as an integral part of electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). This finding further implies that Bai1 might play a role in the formation of AII/ONCBC contacts. However, further knock-out studies will be necessary to address the concrete function of this adhesion molecule. Finally, we addressed the subcellular distribution of Sipa1l3 at AII/ONBC gap junctions. We noticed that these junctions often displayed a ring like shape, that contained Sipa1l3 in the center of each ring (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). One possible interpretation of this distinct sub-synaptic distribution is that Sipa1l3 is interacting with a type of adhesion molecule that is directly adjacent to the gap junction.</p>

<title>Electrical synapse scaffolds are targeted to AII amacrine cell/ ON cone bipolar cell contacts in the absence of Cx36</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that ZO-1 localizes to neuronal contact sites even in the absence of connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). This finding is consistent with a study by Meyer et al., (2014), who reported that Cx36-EGFP containing gap junctions colocalize with ZO-1 at AII/ONCBC contacts despite a C-terminal tag in the fusion protein that is known to interfere with PDZ domain mediated interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). One possible interpretation of these observations is that ZO-1, a protein with multiple protein-protein interaction domains, is connected to additional components of the gap junction such as adhesion molecules, the actin skeleton or other MAGUKs that retain the scaffold at the synapse. We wondered if a similar principle applies to the scaffold proteins that were identified in this study and tested the localization of ZO-2 and Sipa1l3 in Cx36 KO retinas that were infected with AAV/HKamac_GFP to visualize AII/ONCBC contacts. Here, we observed that ZO-2 and Sipa1l3 showed a similar effect as ZO-1 and still localized to AII/ONCBC contacts in Cx36 KO retinas (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>). Additionally, we quantified the density and size of immunoreactive Sipa1l3 and ZO-1 in the inner plexiform layer of WT and Cx36 KO mouse retina (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). While the size of ZO-2 and Sipa1l3 puncta were unchanged in Cx36 KO mice, the density of both ZO-2 and Sipa1l3 puncta were reduced and the colocalization of ZO-2 and Sipa1l3 was reduced in Cx36KO retina. Thus, loss of Cx36 resulted in a quantitative defect in formation of electrical synapse density complexes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we have used TurboID to uncover the electrical synapse proteome in retinal neurons. Our screen identified a plethora of molecules that were associated with the neuronal connexins Cx36/Cx35b in zebrafish and mice such as adhesion molecules, scaffold proteins, chemical synapse proteins, components of the endocytic machinery and cytoskeleton associated proteins (Illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 E-F</xref>). The presence of ZO proteins and endocytosis components in the Cx36 and the Cx35b interactome data suggests a certain degree of conservation in the proteome of electrical synapses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). An apparent difference between species, however, is the existence of additional ZO variants and Cx36 homologues in the zebrafish genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>), which are also represented in our Cx35b interactome. In contrast to the bass retina, where it was shown that Cx35 and Cx34.7 form two distinct circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), we found that zebrafish photoreceptors formed gap junctions that contained both connexins. Cell culture experiments have confirmed that Cx35 and Cx34.7 are able to form heterotypic channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>) that exhibit slightly altered voltage sensitivities compared to the homotypic channels. How exactly these gap junction channels in zebrafish photoreceptors are configured and which exact cell types they connect remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Among other proteins that were detected in this study, we identified Sipa1l3 as a novel scaffold protein for electrical synapses. Interestingly, Sipa1l3 was also described as a component of post synaptic densities of glutamatergic synapses in hippocampal neurons, and is known interact with Fezzins, which occur in a complex with Shank3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Additionally, we found that Sipa1l3 was able to interact with Cx36 and the ZO proteins. This raises the question of what potential function Sipa1l3 might serve given the abundance of colocalization with Cx36 in AII amacrine cells? Genetic screens have shown that mutations in the Sipa1l3 gene result in abnormal eye and lens development and a decrease in the formation of cell adhesions. Like other members of the Sipa1l family, Sipa1l3 also contains a RAP GTPase activating protein (GAP) domain that is known to regulate the activity of RAP proteins, which in the GTP-bound form impacts processes such as adhesion and actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). One way in which Sipa1l3 might influence the formation of electrical synapses might be as a regulator of Rap1 and its effector proteins. To determine the exact function of Sipa1l3 further studies on KO mice will be required.</p>
<p>One striking aspect of the Cx36 interactome in AII amacrine cells is the abundance of the endocytosis machinery. Considering the short half life time of Cx36 of 3.1 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) and the fact that the turnover of electrical synapse proteins is a steady-state process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), it makes sense that the endocytic machinery is that well represented in our interactome data. Thus, besides phosphorylation, it seems possible that the cellular regulation of turnover mechanisms could function as an additional means to adjust the strength of electrical coupling between AII amacrine cells.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Is Bai1 necessary to form electrical synapses in the primary rod pathway?</title>
<p>How and when it is determined where electrical synapses are formed is currently unknown. It has been suggested that neuronal adhesion molecules serve as cues that wire the correct neurons together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This task also has to be accomplished in the primary rod pathway, where AII amacrine cells form synapses among each other and with ON Cone bipolar cells. Interestingly, we identified the brain specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (Bai1) between AII amacrine and ON cone bipolar cell gap junctions, which could suggest that Bai1 is necessary to connect these cells. Recent reports have described Bai1 as a synaptogenic enzyme capable of regulating intracellular signaling pathways that determine synapse formation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). Thus, besides merely functioning as a cell adhesion molecule, Bai1 might actively support synaptogenesis in AII amacrine cells at a level that is hierarchical to Cx36 and its associated scaffolds, which would explain why these cells form contacts with ON Cone bipolar cells even in the absence of Cx36.</p>

Interestingly, however, Mupp 1 was detected in our Cx35b interactome in zebrafish retina. One feasible explanation is that AII cell gap junctions simply lack certain scaffolds such as Mupp 1 that are used by electrical synapses of other neurons like bipolar cells, which our approach did not consider. In general, it will be interesting to understand how well certain components of the electrical synapse proteome are preserved between cell types. Endocytosis and ZO proteins, for instance, are unlikely to be cell-type specific interactors of gap junction channels and are more likely to be ubiquitous constituents of electrical synapses, given their critical function in the constant turnover of Cx36. This is also reflected in the evolutionary conservation of these components in the proteomes from zebrafish and mice. Bai1, on the other hand, a protein that is needed to establish specific synaptic contacts, may only occur in certain electrical synapses.</p>

<title>Tol2 mediated transgenesis</title>
<p>Transgenic Cx35b-V5-TurboID fish were generated using the Tol2 system and a donor vector containing 4.5 kb of the Cx35b promoter, exon1 of the Cx35b gene and the open reading frame of Cx35-V5-TurboID. The coding sequence of V5-TurboID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) was cloned into a region of the Cx35b gene encoding the C-terminal tail. V5-TurboID was inserted between leucine 285 and proline 286 to expose the 19 C-terminal amino acids of Cx35b. Additionally, the donor vector contained a Myl7 promoter driving mCherry expression in the heart to select larvae in which the construct was integrated into genome. Transgenic Cx34.7-oxGFP fish were generated in the same way using a donor vector containing 2.8 kb of the Cx34.7 promoter and the coding sequence of Cx34.7 with oxGFP inserted between aspartate 283 and methionine 284 in the C-terminus. To generate transgenic fish, the donor vector was co-injected with Tol2 transposase mRNA into embryos in the 1 cell stage as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>).

<p>This study aims to identify the proteins that compose the electrical synapse, which are much less understood than those of the chemical synapse. Identifying these proteins is important to understand how synaptogenesis and conductance are regulated in these synapses.</p>
<p>Using a proteomics approach, the authors identified more than 50 new proteins and used immunoprecipitation and immunostaining to validate their interaction of localization. One new protein, a scaffolding protein (Sipa1l3), shows particularly strong evidence of being an integral component of the electrical synapse. The function of Sipa1l3 remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Another strength is the use of two different model organisms (zebrafish and mice) to determine which components are conserved across species. This approach also expands the utility of this work to benefit researchers working with both species.</p>
<p>The methodology is robust and there is compelling evidence supporting the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study by Tetenborg S et al. identifies proteins that are physically closely associated with gap junctions in retinal neurons of mice and zebrafish using BioID, a technique that labels and isolates proteins in proximal to a protein of interest. These proteins include scaffold proteins, adhesion molecules, chemical synapse proteins, components of the endocytic machinery, and cytoskeleton-associated proteins. Using a combination of genetic tools and meticulously executed immunostaining, the authors further verified the colocalizations of some of the identified proteins with connexin-positive gap junctions. The findings in this study highlight the complexity of gap junctions. Electrical synapses are abundant in the nervous system, yet their regulatory mechanisms are far less understood than those of chemical synapses. This work will provide valuable information for future studies aiming to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms essential for the function of neural circuits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of this work is the identification of novel gap junction-associated proteins in AII amacrine cells and photoreceptors using BioID in combination with various genetic tools. The well-studied functions of gap junctions in these neurons will facilitate future research into the functions of the identified proteins in regulating electrical synapses.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold></p>
<p>The authors should clarify the statement regarding the expression in horizontal cells (lines 170-172). In line 170, it is stated that GFP was observed in horizontal cells. Since GFP is fused to Cx36, the observation of GFP in horizontal cells would suggest the expression of Cx36-GFP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that there appears to be a misunderstanding. GFP is observed in horizontal cells, because the test AAV construct, which consists of the HKamac promoter and a downstream GFP sequence, was used to validate the promoter specificity in wildtype animals. This was just a test to confirm that HKamac is indeed active in AII amacrine cells as previously described by Khabou et al. 2023. This construct was not used for the large scale BioID screen. For these experiments, V5-dGBP-Turbo was expressed under the control of the HKamac promoter as illustrated in Figure 2A.</p>

<p>Fig 7: the legend is missing the descriptions for panels A-C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this mistake. We have missed the label “(A-C)” and added it to the legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Supplemental files are not referenced in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added a reference for these files in line 221-226.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p>
<p>Supplementary Files 1 and 2 are presented as two replicates of the zebrafish proteomic datasets, but they appear to be identical.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This appears to be a misunderstanding. These two replicates contain slightly different hits, although the most abundant candidates are identical.</p>

<p>Thank you for the positive comments</p>
