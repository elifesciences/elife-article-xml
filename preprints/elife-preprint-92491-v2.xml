<title>Abstract</title><p>There are thousands of Mendelian diseases with more being discovered weekly and the majority have no approved treatments. To address this need, we require scalable approaches that are relatively inexpensive compared to traditional drug development. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screening in model organisms provides a route for identifying candidate treatments. Success requires a screenable phenotype. However, the right phenotype and assay may not be obvious for pleiotropic neuromuscular disorders. Here we show that high- throughput imaging and quantitative phenotyping can be conducted systematically on a panel of <italic>C. elegans</italic> disease model strains. We used CRISPR genome-editing to create 25 worm models of human Mendelian diseases and phenotyped them using a single standardised assay. All but two strains were significantly different from wild-type controls in at least one feature. The observed phenotypes were diverse, but mutations of genes predicted to have related functions led to similar behavioural differences in worms. As a proof-of-concept, we performed a drug repurposing screen of an FDA approved compound library, and identified two compounds that rescued the behavioural phenotype of a model of UNC80 deficiency. Our results show that a single assay to measure multiple phenotypes can be applied systematically to diverse Mendelian disease models. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping multiple strains suggests that high-throughput worm tracking could provide a scalable approach to drug repurposing commensurate with the number of Mendelian diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="s1a">
<title>By definition, rare genetic diseases each affect a small number of patients</title>
<p>However, because there are many kinds of rare diseases, they are collectively common and affect more than 300 million people worldwide (Nguengang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wakap et al., 2020</xref>). Over 80% of rare genetic diseases affect children and many have severe symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bavisetty et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, 95% of rare diseases have no approved treatment (Nguengang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Wakap et al., 2020</xref>). Given the severity and prevalence of rare diseases, the lack of treatments represents an important unmet need. Genome and exome sequencing has become faster and cheaper, enabling its widespread use in the diagnosis of genetic disease. In turn, this has led to the rapid identification of genetic lesions associated with rare genetic diseases (Gonzaga- Jauregui et al., 2012). Genetic diagnosis is an important first step, but often presents patients and physicians with a research problem rather than a treatment.</p>
<p>Genetic diagnoses rarely lead directly to a drug target hypothesis, especially for loss-of-function mutations. In the absence of a validated drug target, phenotypic screens in a model organism provide an alternative route to candidate treatments. Three things are required for a phenotypic screen to be successful: (1) a conserved gene; (2) a genetically tractable organism or culture system in which the disease mutation can be introduced; and (3) a measurable phenotype compatible with high-throughput screening. For the model nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, more than half of the human genes associated with rare genetic diseases in the OMIM database are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kropp et al., 2021</xref>) and CRISPR-based editing has made the generation of <italic>in vivo</italic> models containing disease-relevant mutations faster and easier. However, the third condition, a screenable phenotype, remains a bottleneck for many mutations and models.</p>
<p>If all three conditions are met, a phenotypic screen for candidate treatments can be performed. Because there is limited investment in drug development for rare diseases, lead optimisation and safety testing may not be possible. Hence, there is a particular focus on screening approved drugs that have already been shown to be safe and bioavailable in humans to reduce the cost and time it takes to translate screening hits to human trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Roessler et al., 2021</xref>). Two recent examples of promising repurposing screens using multiple model organisms illustrate this potential.</p>
<p>Firstly, modelling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with disease-associated genetic variants of conserved genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, zebrafish, and mice led to clinical trials for repurposing of the antipsychotic drug pimozide. By exploiting high throughput drug screening in <italic>C. elegans</italic> carrying point mutations in <italic>TDP-43</italic>, a panel of drugs were identified that rescued ALS movement and neurodevelopment phenotypes in all animal models. Early clinical trials found pimozide improved clinical and physiological outcomes in ALS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Patten et al., 2017</xref>). Secondly, the glycosylation disorder, PMM2-CDG, is caused by mutations in <italic>PMM2</italic> and presents clinically with developmental delay, psychomotor retardation, and axial hypotonia, among other symptoms. <italic>C. elegans</italic> carrying the same disease-associated mutation in their endogenous <italic>pmm-2</italic> gene exhibited larval arrest upon pharmacological ER stress. <italic>In vivo</italic> screening identified two compounds that rescued development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and enzymatic activity in PMM2-CDG patient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Iyer et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the compounds, the aldose reductase inhibitor epalrestat, is currently being tested in clinical trials for PMM2-CDG patients (National Clinical Trial number: NCT04925960).</p>
<p>A screenable phenotype was critical for the success of these studies. In the ALS model, worms became paralysed after 2 hours in liquid and in the PMM2-CDG model, brood size was severely affected. The majority (∼74%) of rare genetic diseases affect nervous system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), and many of these mutations will not cause strong effects on development or gross motility when mutated in worms. High-content phenotyping that measures multiple features simultaneously could be useful in these cases to identify differences between strains that are not captured with univariate measures. In this study, we use a combination of high-throughput imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barlow et al., 2022</xref>) and quantitative phenotyping (Javer, Currie, et al., 2018; Javer, Ripoll-Sánchez, et al., 2018) to phenotype a diverse panel of 25 <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains with mutations in orthologs of human disease genes. All but two of the mutant strains had detectable phenotypes compared to controls in at least one aspect of their morphology, posture, or motion. No single feature was different in all strains highlighting the need for a multidimensional phenotype. Mutation of genes predicted to have similar functions (e.g., <italic>bbs-1</italic>, <italic>bbs-2,</italic> and <italic>tub-1</italic>) led to similar phenotypes. As a proof-of-concept, we then performed a repurposing screen using a library of 743 FDA approved compounds to identify drugs that improved the behavioural phenotype of <italic>unc-80</italic> loss-of-function mutants. Liranaftate and atorvastatin rescued the core behavioural features associated with <italic>unc-80</italic> loss of function and did not cause a large number of detectable side effects.</p>
<p>The ability to detect phenotypic difference in diverse strains using a standardised 16-minute assay will make it possible to perform repurposing screens for existing and newly described rare diseases efficiently.</p>

<title>Selection and molecular characterisation of a diverse panel of C. elegans disease models</title>
<p>The problem of large-scale disease modelling can be thought of as a problem of sampling and connecting two related genotype-phenotype (GP) maps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The first is the human disease map. The genomic space is sampled by mutation and mating in humans and the map is elucidated by sequencing and clinical phenotyping of patients with genetic diseases. The second is the model organism map. Here, the genomic space is sampled using mutagenesis and genome editing and the map is elucidated using laboratory experiments. Given the accelerated characterisation of the human GP map, we sought to accelerate the characterisation of the corresponding <italic>C. elegans</italic> GP map. We follow a phenolog-inspired approach to connecting the two maps. Provided there is a causal connection between a genetic variant and a disease in humans and that the causal gene is conserved in worms, the observed worm phenotype may be a useful disease model even if the connection to the human phenotype is non-obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">McGary et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To identify a set of <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes that samples a broad genotypic space with connections to the human disease GP map, we first filtered the full database of human-<italic>C. elegans</italic> gene orthologs, Ortholist 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim et al., 2018</xref>), using three criteria: (1) at least two orthology prediction algorithms agree the human and worm genes are orthologs; (2) the WormBase (version WS270) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Harris et al., 2020</xref>) gene description includes either ‘neuro’ or ‘musc’; and (3) mutations in the human gene are associated with a Mendelian disease. A total of 767 <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes with 2558 orthologous human protein-coding genes met these criteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). We used keyword searches to further reduce the list to 543 genes. Genes were kept if their WormBase gene description included any of the following: ion, ion channel, dopamine, serotonin, 5-HT, glutamate, acetylcholine, behavior, behaviour, disease, epilepsy, autism, Parkinson, schizophrenia, bipolar, ADHD, seizure, GPCR, coupled receptor, antidepressant, antipsychotic). We prioritised genes associated with autosomal recessive disease in humans to increase the chance that a gene deletion would yield an appropriate model, and we focussed on those where loss-of-function mutants were known or likely to be viable. To get the list of 25 genes presented in this study, the final selection criterion was subjective interestingness based on our prior knowledge, WormBase gene descriptions, and/or brief literature searches.</p>
<p>In the final panel of 25 worm genes selected, 22 genes have &gt;60% sequence similarity to their human ortholog and 11 of the genes share &gt;90% sequence similarity to their human counterpart (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, 24/25 genes are predicted to be orthologous to human genes across &gt;3 orthology prediction algorithms (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), and all selected genes have a BLAST E-value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">McGinnis &amp; Madden, 2004</xref>) smaller than 3x10<sup>-12</sup> (Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>Large CRISPR-Cas9 deletions (mean 4.4 kb) were made in each of the target genes to generate 25 strains containing a &gt;55% deletion (average 76%) of the chosen gene. We direct the reader to the strain-specific gene cards (Supplementary Information) for specific details on the size and position of genomic deletions for each of the individual mutants as well as a brief summary of the associated disease and worm phenotypes. Although we have focused on genes expected to have direct effects on neurons or muscles, even this small subset of disease-associated genes is predicted to affect diverse cellular processes including neurotransmission, excitability, development, and cellular structure (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). According to OMIM, the mutated genes are associated with 31 rare genetic disorders in humans including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and disorders affecting the muscular and/or nervous systems, and are associated with &gt;70 clinical presentations of disease according to the Human Disease Ontology database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Schriml et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Disease-associated mutations result in diverse phenotypes that are captured by multidimensional behavioural fingerprints</title>
<p>Given that there are thousands of rare diseases, methods to characterise the corresponding disease models should be as scalable as possible. Scalability is improved if a single standardised assay can be used to detect model phenotypes regardless of the mutation. High-resolution worm tracking and behavioural fingerprinting is a promising candidate for a widely applicable assay because it is both fast and multidimensional: a single minutes-long recording can capture differences in morphology, posture, and behaviour that can classify the effect of mutations and drug treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baek et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barlow et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Geng et al., 2004</xref>; Javer, Ripoll-Sánchez, et al., 2018; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McDermott-Rouse et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Perni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ramot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Restif et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Swierczek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tsibidis &amp; Tavernarakis, 2007</xref>; S. J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wang &amp; Wang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Yemini et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>We tracked disease model worms on 96-well plates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) in three periods: (1) a 5-minute baseline recording (prestim); (2) a 6-minute video with three ten-second blue light stimuli separated by 90 seconds (blue light), and (3) a 5-minute post-stimulus recording (poststim). For each recording we extract 2763 features covering morphology, posture, and motion and concatenate the feature vectors together to represent the phenotype of each strain (8289 features in total). Many of these features are highly correlated and so for clustering we use a pre-selected subset of 256 features (Javer, Ripoll-Sánchez, et al., 2018) (768 across the three recordings). Using these reduced feature vectors, we performed hierarchical clustering across all strains which demonstrates phenotypic diversity (many of the strains are both different from the N2 wild-type strain and from each other) as well as some similarities. For example, <italic>bbs-1, bbs-2</italic> and <italic>tub-1</italic> mutants affect cilia formation and result in similar phenotypes that cluster together. The same is true for <italic>kcc</italic>-<italic>2</italic>, <italic>snf- 11</italic> and <italic>unc-25</italic> mutants, which all affect GABAergic function. An interactive heatmap containing all behavioural feature vectors extracted for every disease model strain is also available for download (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684130">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684130</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of the same data, but now separated into prestimulus, blue light, and poststimlus recordings again shows the separation of many of the mutant strains from the wild-type N2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The effect of the blue light stimulus on behaviour is clear from the motion of the points through this phenotype space and also reveals new phenotypes. While most strains show a partial recovery in the post-stimulus recording, some strains including <italic>bbs-1</italic>, <italic>bbs-2</italic>, <italic>glr-1</italic>, and <italic>unc-43</italic> display a sustained photophobic response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>From the panel of 25 disease model strains, 23 are significantly different from wild- type in at least one feature (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The strains that are most different from wild- type show significant differences across a large number of features. These strains are particularly useful for high-throughput drug screens because the phenotypes can be reliably detected with a small number of replicates. Strain-specific summaries (gene cards) of each disease model mutant, its associated phenotype, and individual molecular characteristics are available in the supplementary information. Here we provide more detailed characterisation of two classes of mutants modelling ciliopathies and channelopathies in humans.</p>

<title>Ciliopathies</title>
<p>Heritable mutations that affect cilia function are associated with a group of rare genetic disorders (ciliopathies) that share diverse symptoms including retinal dystrophy, developmental polydactyly, obesity, cognitive impairment, and renal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Reiter &amp; Leroux, 2017</xref>). The pleotropic nature of ciliopathies is highlighted by significant interfamilial and intrafamilial phenotypic variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shaheen et al., 2016</xref>), and the resulting poor gene-phenotype correlation significantly complicates the discovery of effective therapeutics. As a result, current treatment regimens are based on treating individual symptoms.</p>
<p>In the longlist of 543 disease genes, there were 35 genes (6.4% of the total list) predicted to be involved in cilia function. We selected four genes (<italic>bbs-1</italic>, <italic>bbs-</italic>2, <italic>tmem-231</italic> and <italic>tub-1</italic>) involved in regulating nonmotile (primary) cilia development and function that have confirmed expression in the cilia of amphid sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ward et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the genes affecting cilia function, two are orthologs of the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) family of genes (<italic>bbs-1</italic> and <italic>bbs-2</italic>). BBS is a pleiotropic syndrome often diagnosed in late childhood and is characterised by retinitis pigmentosa, cognitive impairment, obesity, renal dysfunction, hypogonadism, and polydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Forsythe &amp; Beales, 2013</xref>). The most prevalent BBS mutations are in <italic>BBS1</italic>, accounting for 23.4% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Forsyth &amp; Gunay-Aygun, 2023</xref>), and with 50% embryonic lethality and highly variable phenotypes, <italic>Bbs1-/-</italic> mouse models demonstrate model validity but have not yet yielded insights into potential therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Forsyth &amp; Gunay-Aygun, 2023</xref>). Mutations in <italic>BBS2</italic> account for 8% of BBS cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Forsythe &amp; Beales, 2013</xref>) and are also implicated in other ciliopathies, such as Meckel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Karmous-Benailly et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Mutations in <italic>bbs-1</italic> and <italic>bbs-2</italic> led to strong phenotypes including changes in morphology, posture, and locomotion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). <italic>bbs-1(syb1588)</italic> and <italic>bbs- 2(syb1547)</italic> mutants were shorter, wider, and had decreased curvature compared to wild-type worms (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>, 3B and 3C). They are also hyperactive, with a greater fraction of worms moving during pre-stimulus (baseline) recordings (see individual gene cards), and had faster body bends (derivative of curvature) compared to N2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>). BBS proteins also regulate the <italic>C. elegans</italic> photoreceptor protein LITE1 in ASH sensory neurons through a DLK-MAPK signalling pathway independent of their function in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with this, we find that <italic>bbs-1(syb1588)</italic> and <italic>bbs-2(syb1547)</italic> mutants have attenuated blue light sensitivity, with both strains exhibiting a delayed forward, but enhance backward photophobic escape response upon 10-second stimulation with blue light (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F-H</xref>).</p>

<p>The vertebrate family of tubby-like proteins (TUB, TULP) are required for correct GPCR localisation and intra-flagellar transport in primary cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Mukhopadhyay &amp; Jackson, 2011</xref>).

Furthermore, <italic>Tub1-/-</italic> mice reflect the associated human disease pleiotropy, with insulin resistance, obesity, and cochlea and visual degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> have a single ortholog of tubby-like proteins, <italic>tub-1</italic>, and mutants have defects in chemotaxis and insulin signalling as well as increased lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mak et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>Compartmentalisation of cilia-specific signalling components is regulated by a complex of transmembrane proteins including TMEM231 and mutations in this compartmentalisation complex are associated with neurodevelopmental limb defects and pathologies of the brain and kidneys found in Joubert and Meckel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chih et al., 2012</xref>).

<p>The Na+ cation leak channel (NALCN) is expressed throughout the central nervous system, and in parts of the endocrine (pancreas, adrenal, thyroid gland), respiratory and cardiac systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>). NALCN is a voltage- independent, nonselective cation channel that regulates resting potential (Senatore et al., 2013), and plays a role in neuromodulation by neurotransmitters (Cochet- Bissuel et al., 2014). Mutations in NALCN are associated with neuromuscular disorders including severe hypotonia, infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD), congenital contractures, cognitive delay, autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, and cardiac/respiratory problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aoyagi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cochet-Bissuel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gal et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Consistent with their differential expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jospin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yeh et al., 2008</xref>), we observe phenotypic differences between <italic>nca-2(syb1612)</italic> and <italic>unc- 77(syb1688)</italic> deletion mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

<title>Drug repurposing screen in unc-80 mutants</title>
<p>Because <italic>unc-80</italic> mutants have a clear behavioural phenotype without a strong developmental phenotype, we reasoned that they were a useful test case for a drug repurposing screen using an acute 4-hour treatment which might rescue behavioural ‘symptoms’ in fully developed animals. When screening compound libraries, it is not practical to perform a large number of replicates which would be necessary to detect subtle phonotypes and overcome the reduced statistical power that comes from correcting for multiple comparisons in a large feature set (Supplementary Figure 1). We therefore defined a reduced set of core features to capture the <italic>unc-80</italic> behavioural phenotype consisting of curvature, speed, and fraction of paused worms all during blue light stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>).</p>
<p>For the repurposing screen, we used a library of 743 FDA approved drugs.</p>
<p>We prepared tracking plates where each well contained a drug at a final concentration of 100 μM with 1% DMSO. Three adult worms were added to each well, incubated for 4 hours, and then tracked. The screen was repeated across three independent tracking days with three independent wells per day (9 total well replicates). Hits were defined as compounds that significantly improved all three of the core <italic>unc-80</italic> features, meaning that treated worms were significantly different from <italic>unc-80</italic> DMSO controls and that the direction of the effect was towards wild-type controls. These hit compounds shift <italic>unc-80</italic> towards N2 in a three-dimensional phenotype space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). To test the utility of reducing the feature set in a screen compared to testing a larger feature set, we repeated this with larger feature sets. Testing larger feature sets reduced our power to detect differences. No hits were detected using a predefined set of 256 features (Javer, Ripoll-Sánchez, et al., 2018) (Supplementary Figure 1).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then performed a confirmation screen on 30 of the hit compounds from the initial screen with a larger number of replicates (24 wells per day over three independent days). 13 of the 30 hits were reproduced in the sense of showing significant differences from <italic>unc-80</italic> DMSO controls in the direction of wild-type, however several showed a reduced effect size and were clustered around the <italic>unc- 80</italic> DMSO controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Having a larger number of replicates, we also tested for ‘side effects’ in treated worms which we define as features where there was no significant difference between <italic>unc-80</italic> mutants and wild-type N2 animals but where there is a significant difference between <italic>unc-80</italic> mutants treated with a drug compared to wild-type N2 animals. About half of the confirmed hit compounds lead to more than 1000 side effects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) and are coloured yellow in the core <italic>unc- 80</italic> phenotype space (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The same trend is observed when using 256 predefined features (Javer, Ripoll-Sánchez, et al., 2018) (Supplementary Figure 2).</p>
<p>Of the confirmed hit compounds with fewer than 1000 side effects, liranaftate and atorvastatin (Lipitor) lead to good rescue of the core <italic>unc-80</italic> behavioural phenotypes. Interestingly, both compounds act upon the melavonate biosynthesis pathway. The main trunk of this pathway is conserved across species and converts acetyl-CoA to farnesyl diphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rauthan &amp; Pilon, 2011</xref>). Atorvastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase that regulates lipid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Goldstein et al., 2006</xref>) and catalyses the rate limiting step of the melavonate pathway. Liranaftate, an antifungal inhibitor of squalene epoxidase, shows the greatest behavioural improvement, with the fewest number of side effects. However, <italic>C. elegans</italic> lack the branch of the mevalonate pathway responsible for converting squalene to cholesterol, instead relying on dietary cholesterol. In this case the effect may be due to an off-target interaction on one of the other enzymes in the pathway.</p>
<p>Fenofibrate, a PPAR-alpha activator that increases lipolysis, is also a hit but has a large number of side effects. Given that it overshoots perfect rescue by shifting <italic>unc-80</italic> animals past wild-type controls in core phenospace, it could be that at a lower dose it would provide good rescue with fewer side effects. Since UNC-80 is involved in localisation of the NACLN+ channel complex, we hypothesise that changes in membrane composition might be indirectly affecting the localisation or function of the channel complex.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We framed the problem of disease modelling as one of sampling and elucidating a model organism genotype-phenotype map that is connected to a human disease genotype-phenotype map through genetic conservation. However, both the genomic and phenomic spaces are large and high-dimensional and so it was not clear that a systematic approach would identify useful phenologs for disease modelling. Using an initial set of genes that are diverse in function (but biased towards roles in neurons and muscles) and that lead to diverse symptoms when mutated in humans, we found that it is possible to systematically create and phenotype worm models of rare diseases using a uniform assay and protocol. Without adding additional perturbations or experimental conditions, we found that 23 out of the 25 disease models we made had detectable differences compared to the wild-type.</p>
<p>Of the disease models with detectable phenotypes, approximately half had strong phenotypes that would support high throughput phenotypic screens for candidate treatments. To test the feasibility of performing drug repurposing screens using the same uniform assay, we chose a worm model of UNC80 deficiency and, focussing on a reduced core phenotype, identified an initial list of 30 FDA-approved drugs that rescued the mutant phenotype. A confirmation screen with more replicates identified several compounds that still rescued the core disease model phenotype and did not have a large number of side effects. For UNC80 deficiency we chose a short treatment time of four hours to model treatment in patients where some developmental effects will have already occurred. Our approach is also compatible with longer treatments where animals at the first larval stage are added to tracking plates and allowed to develop in the presence of drugs. This might reveal other hit compounds and would be particularly interesting for mutants with developmental delays including some in this study (e.g. <italic>cat-4</italic>, <italic>dys-1</italic>, <italic>figo-1</italic>, <italic>gpb-2</italic> and <italic>kcc-2</italic>).</p>
<p>For this proof-of-principle study, we focused on the generation of large deletion alleles to help ensure the target gene is functionally disrupted. However, patient-specific missense mutations can also be introduced at conserved loci within genes and these mutations can lead to detectable behavioural phenotypes (see for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barlow et al., 2022</xref>; D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Wang et al., 2021</xref>)). There is also value in studying multiple alleles even for loss-of-function mutations. The large deletions we use here can delete regulatory elements or non-coding RNAs that could lead to phenotypes not related to the modelled disease. Alternative methods of creating loss-of-function alleles such as introducing premature stop codons can also be done at the scale of dozens of strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Pu et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, to study loss of function in essential genes, balanced heterozygous strains can be created where this makes sense for a particular disease model.</p>
<p>With a current discovery rate of &gt;100 new genetic diseases each year, the number of diseases with little aetiological understanding is going to grow at a faster rate than biomedical and pharmaceutical research will find therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Boycott et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, novel approaches that can systematically screen the effects of large numbers of genetic variants associated with different diseases are required. CRISPR genome editing in model organisms including <italic>C. elegans</italic> allows the creation of new disease models at the required rate and cost. We have shown that high-throughput worm tracking can identify screenable phenotypes and be used for repurposing screens. However, we do not yet know whether the phenotypes and repurposing hits will be useful for translation. It is possible that the phenotypes we detect are not direct results of key disease mechanisms but are instead secondary effects on connected systems. We expect that secondary effects are less likely to be driven by conserved mechanisms but this can only be assessed on a case-by-base basis. Similarly, the ‘side effects’ we detect in worms may not be predictive in humans. Still, we think quantifying side effects will be useful in some cases. For example, if a disease model is hyperactive and gross motility were the only measure used in a screen, compounds that are broadly toxic would be detected as hits. This kind of broad toxicity would result in a large number of side effects and could be avoided. Ultimately, the translatability of hits in invertebrate screens can only be determined in clinical trials and choosing hits from phenotypic screens to pursue clinically will require judgement that takes into account the full picture available from multiple data sources including the strength of rescue, the putative drug mechanism of action, knowledge of disease biology, and an assessment of the risk of testing a given drug in patients. We are optimistic that we will see more human trials based on screens in diverse small animal models.</p>

<p>Low peptone (0.013%) nematode growth medium (detailed protocol: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.2rcgd2w">https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.2rcgd2w</ext-link>) was prepared as follows: 20 g agar (Difco), 0.13 g Bactopeptone, and 3 g NaCl were dissolved in 975 mL of milliQ water. After autoclaving, 1 mL of 10 mg/mL cholesterol was added along with 1 mL CaCl2 (1 M), 1 mL MgSO4 (1 M) and 25 mL KPO4 buffer (1M, pH 6.0). Molten agar was cooled to 50-60°C and 200 μL was dispensed into each well of 96-square well plates (Whatman UNIPLATE: WHAT-77011651) using an Integra VIAFILL (detailed protocol: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bmxbk7in">https://dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bmxbk7in</ext-link>). Poured plates were stored agar-side up at 4°C until required.</p>
<p>One day prior to imaging, plates were placed without lids in a drying cabinet to lose 3-5% of weight by volume. Wells were then seeded with 5 μL OP50 (OD600 1.0) using an Integra VIAFILL dispenser, and plates were stored with lids (WHAT- 77041001) on at room temperature overnight.</p>

<title>Image acquisition</title>
<p>All videos were acquired and processed following methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barlow et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, videos were acquired at 25 frames per second in a room with a nominal temperature of 20°C using a shutter time of 25 ms and a resolution of 12.4 µm/px. Three videos were taken sequentially: a 5-minute pre- stimulus video, a 6-minute blue light recording with three 10-second blue light pulses starting at 60, 160 and 260 seconds, and a 5-minute post-stimulus recording. The script for controlling recording timings and photostimulation was made using LoopBio’s API for their Motif software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/loopbio/python-motifapi">https://github.com/loopbio/python-motifapi</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Image processing and feature extraction</title>
<p>Videos were segmented and tracked using Tierpsy Tracker (Javer, Currie, et al., 2018). After segmentation of worm skeletons, our previously described convolutional neural network classifier was used to exclude non-worm objects from being classified during feature extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barlow et al., 2022</xref>). Skeletons that did not meet the following criteria were removed from the analysis: 700 – 1300 µM length, 20 – 200 µM width. As an additional quality control measure, we used Tierpsy Tracker’s viewer to mark wells with visible contamination, agar damage, compound precipitation, or excess liquid as “bad”, and exclude these wells from downstream analysis.</p>
<p>Following tracking, we extracted a previously-defined set of 3076 behavioural features for each well in each of the three videos (pre-stimulus, blue light, and post- stimulus) (Javer, Ripoll-Sánchez, et al., 2018). Feature values are averaged over tracks to produce a single feature vector for each well.</p>

<sec id="s4f">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistically significant differences in the pre-stimulus, post-stimulus and blue-light behavioural feature sets extracted from each disease model strain compared to our N2 reference were calculated using block permutation t-tests (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Tierpsy/tierpsy-tools-python/blob/master/tierpsytools/analysis/statistical_tests.py">https://github.com/Tierpsy/tierpsy-tools-python/blob/master/tierpsytools/analysis/statistical_tests.py</ext-link>). Python (version 3.8.5) was used to perform the analysis, using <italic>n</italic> = 10000 permutations that were randomly shuffled within, but not between, the independent days of image acquisition for each strain to control for day-to-day variation in the experiments. The <italic>p</italic>-values were then corrected for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure to control the false discovery rate at 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benjamini &amp; Yekutieli, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Heatmaps, cluster maps and principal component analysis of the extracted feature sets for each disease model strain compared to our N2 reference were calculated using in-built Seaborn (version 0.11.2) packages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Waskom, 2021</xref>). All scripts used for statistical analysis and the generation of figures are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Tom-OBrien/Disease-Modelling">https://github.com/Tom-OBrien/Disease-Modelling</ext-link>.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides proof of principle that C. elegans models can be used to accelerate the discovery of candidate treatments for human Mendelian diseases by detailed high-throughput phenotyping of strains harboring mutations in orthologs of human disease genes. The data are <bold>compelling</bold> and support an approach that enables the potential rapid repurposing of FDA-approved drugs to treat rare diseases for which there are currently no effective treatments. The authors should provide a clearer explanation of how the statistical analyses were performed, as well as a link to a GitHub repository to clarify how figures and tables in the manuscript were generated from the phenotypic data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>As the scientific community identifies increasing numbers of genes and genetic variants that cause rare human diseases, a challenge in the field quickly identify pharmacological interventions to address known deficits. The authors point out that defining phenotypic outcomes required for drug screen assays is often a bottleneck, and emphasize how invertebrate models can be used for quick ID of compounds that may address genetic deficits. A major contribution of this work is to establish a framework for potential intervention drug screening based on quantitative imaging of morphology and mobility behavior, using methods that the authors show can define subtle phenotypes in a high proportion of disease gene knockout mutants. Overall, the work constitutes an elegant combination of previously developed high-volume imaging with highly detailed quantitative phenotyping (and some paring down to specific phenotypes) to establish proof of principle on how the combined applications can contribute to screens for compounds that may address specific genetic deficits, which can, in turn, suggest both mechanism and therapy.</p>
<p>In brief, the authors selected 25 genes for which loss of function is implicated in human neuro-muscular disease and engineered deletions in the corresponding C. elegans homologs. The authors then imaged morphological features and behaviors prior to, during, and after blue light stimuli, quantitating features, and clustering outcomes as they elegantly developed previously (PMID 35322206; 30171234; 30201839). In doing so, phenotypes in 23/25 tested mutants could be separated enough to distinguish WT from mutant and half of those with adequate robustness to permit high-throughput screens, an outcome that supports the utility of related general efforts to ID phenotypes in C. elegans disease orthologs. A detailed discussion of 4 ciliopathy gene defects, and NACLN-related channelopathy mutants reveals both expected and novel phenotypes, validating the basic approach to modeling vetted targets and underscoring that quantitative imaging approaches reiterate known biology.</p>
<p>The authors then screened a library of nearly 750 FDA-approved drugs for the capacity to shift the unc-80 NACLN channel-disrupted phenotype closer to the wild type. Top &quot;mover&quot; compounds shift outcome in the experimental outcome space; and also reveal how &quot;side effects&quot; can be evaluated to prioritize compounds that confer the fewest changes of other parameters away from the center.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although the imaging and data analysis approaches have been reported and the screen is restricted in scope and intervention exposure, it is impressive, encouraging and important that the authors strongly combine tools to demonstrate how quantitative imaging phenotypes can be integrated with C. elegans genetics to accelerate the identification of potential modulators of disease (easily extendable to other goals). Generation of deletion alleles and documentation of their associated phenotypes (available in supplemental data) provide potentially useful reagents/data to the field. The capacity to identify &quot;over-shooting&quot; of compound applications with suggestions for scale back and to sort efficacious interventions to minimize other changes to behavioral and physical profiles is a strong contribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work does not have major weaknesses, and in revision, the authors have expanded the discussion to potential utility and application in the field.</p>
<p>The authors have also taken into account minor modifications in writing.</p>

<p>Summary and strengths:</p>
<p>O'Brien et al. present a compelling strategy to both understand rare disease that could have a neuronal focus and discover drugs for repurposing that can affect rare disease phenotypes. Using C. elegans, they optimize the Brown lab worm tracker and Tierpsy analysis platform to look at movement behaviors of 25 knockout strains. These gene knockouts were chosen based on a process to identify human orthologs that could underlie rare diseases. I found the manuscript interesting and a powerful approach to make genotype-phenotype connections using C. elegans. Given the rate that rare Mendelian diseases are found and candidate genes suggested, human geneticists need to consider orthologous approaches to understand the disease and seek treatments on a rapid time scale. This approach is one such way. Overall, I have a few minor suggestions and some specific edits.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Throughout the text on figures, labels are nearly impossible to read. I had to zoom into the PDF to determine what the figure was showing. Please make text in all figures a minimum of 10 point font. Similarly, Figure 2D point type is impossible to read. Points should be larger in all figures. Gene names should be in italics in all figures, following C. elegans convention.</p>
<p>(2) I have a strong bias against the second point in Figure 1A. Sequencing of trios, cohorts, or individuals NEVER identifies causal genes in the disease. This technique proposes a candidate gene. Future experiments (oftentimes in model organisms) are required to make those connections to causality. Please edit this figure and parts of the text.</p>
<p>(3) How were the high-confidence orthologs filtered from 767 to 543 (lines 128-131)? Also, the choice of the final list of 25 genes is not well justified. Please expand more about how these choices were made.</p>
<p>(4) Figures 3 and 4, why show all 8289 features? It might be easier to understand and read if only the 256 Tierpsy features were plotted in the heat maps.</p>
<p>(5) The unc-80 mutant screen is clever. In the feature space, it is likely better to focus on the 256 less-redundant Tierpsy features instead of just a number of features. It is unclear to me how many of these features are correlated and not providing more information. In other words, the &quot;worsening&quot; of less-redundant features is far more of a concern than &quot;worsening&quot; of 1000 correlated features.Reviewer #2 (Public review):</p>

<p>In this study, O'Brien et al. address the need for scalable and cost-effective approaches to finding lead compounds for the treatment of the growing number of Mendelian diseases. They used state-of-the-art phenotypic screening based on an established high-dimensional phenotypic analysis pipeline in the nematode C. elegans.</p>
<p>First, a panel of 25 C. elegans models was created by generating CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out lines for conserved human disease genes. These mutant strains underwent behavioral analysis using the group's published methodology. Clustering analysis revealed common features for genes likely operating in similar genetic pathways or biological functions. The study also presents results from a more focused examination of ciliopathy disease models.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the study focuses on the NALCN channel gene family, comparing the phenotypes of mutants of nca-1, unc-77, and unc-80. This initial characterization identifies three behavioral parameters that exhibit significant differences from the wild type and could serve as indicators for pharmacological modulation.</p>
<p>As a proof-of-concept, O'Brien et al. present a drug repurposing screen using an FDA-approved compound library, identifying two compounds capable of rescuing the behavioral phenotype in a model with UNC80 deficiency. The relatively short time and low cost associated with creating and phenotyping these strains suggest that high-throughput worm tracking could serve as a scalable approach for drug repurposing, addressing the multitude of Mendelian diseases. Interestingly, by measuring a wide range of behavioural parameters, this strategy also simultaneously reveals deleterious side effects of tested drugs that may confound the analysis.</p>
<p>Considering the wealth of data generated in this study regarding important human disease genes, it is regrettable that the data is not made accessible to researchers less versed in data analysis methods. This diminishes the study's utility. It would have a far greater impact if an accessible and user-friendly online interface were established to facilitate data querying and feature extraction for specific mutants. This would empower researchers to compare their findings with the extensive dataset created here.</p>
<p>Another technical limitation of the study is the use of single alleles. Large deletion alleles were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. At first glance, this seems like a good idea because it limits the risk that background mutations, present in chemically-generated alleles, will affect behavioral parameters. However, these large deletions can also remove non-coding RNAs or other regulatory genetic elements, as found, for example, in introns. Therefore, it would be prudent to validate the behavioral effects by testing additional loss-of-function alleles produced through early stop codons or targeted deletion of key functional domains.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>As the scientific community identifies increasing numbers of genetic variants that cause rare human diseases, a challenge is how the field can most quickly identify pharmacological interventions to address known deficits. The authors point out that defining phenotypic outcomes required for drug screen assays is often challenging, and emphasize how invertebrate models can be used for quick ID of compounds that may address genetic deficits. A major contribution of this work is to establish a framework for potential intervention drug screening based on quantitative imaging of morphology and mobility behavior, using methods that the authors show can define subtle phenotypes in a high proportion of disease gene knockout mutants.</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although the imaging and data analysis approaches have been reported and the screen is limited in scope and intervention exposure, it is important that the authors strongly combine individual approach elements to demonstrate how quantitative imaging phenotypes can be integrated with C. elegans genetics to accelerate the identification of potential modulators of disease (easily extendable to other goals). Generation of deletion alleles and documentation of their associated phenotypes (available in supplemental data) provide potentially useful reagents/data to the field. The capacity to identify &quot;over-shooting&quot; of compound applications with suggestions for scale back and to sort efficacious interventions to minimize other changes to behavioral and physical profiles is a strong contribution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work does not have major weaknesses, although it may be possible to expand the discussion to increase utility in the field:</p>
<p>(1) Increased discussion of the challenges and limitations of the approach may enhance successful adaptation application in the field.</p>
<p>It is quite possible that morphological and behavioral phenotypes have nothing to do with disease mechanisms and rather reflect secondary outcomes, such that positive hits will address &quot;off-target&quot; consequences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is possible and can only be determined with human data. We now discuss the possibility in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The deletion approach is adequately justified in the text, but the authors may make the point somewhere that screening target outcomes might be enhanced by the inclusion of engineered alleles that match the human disease condition. Their work on sod-1 alleles (PMID 35322206) might be noted in this discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and now mention this work in the discussion. We are currently working on a collection of strains with patient-specific mutations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Drug testing here involved a strikingly brief exposure to a compound, which holds implications for how a given drug might engage in adult animals. The authors might comment more extensively on extended treatments that include earlier life or more extended targeting. The assumption is that administering different exposure periods and durations, but if the authors are aware as to whether there are challenges associated with more prolonged applications, larger scale etc. it would be useful to note them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>More prolonged applications are definitely possible. We chose short treatments for this screen to model the potential for changing neural phenotypes once developmental effects of the mutation have already occurred. We now briefly discuss this choice and the potential of longer treatments in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) More justification of the shift to only a few target parameters for judging compound effectiveness.</p>
<p>- In the screen in Figure 4D and text around 313, 3 selected core features of the unc-80 mutant (fraction that blue-light pause, speed, and curvature) were used to avoid the high replicate requirements to identify subtle phenotypes. Although this strategy was successful as reported in Figure 5, the pared-down approach seems a bit at odds with the emphasis on the range of features that can be compared mutant/wt with the author's powerful image analysis. Adding details about the reduced statistical power upon multiple comparisons, with a concrete example calculated, might help interested scientists better assess how to apply this tool in experimental design.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To empirically test the effect of including more features on the subsequent screen, we have repeated the analysis using increasing numbers of features. In a new supplementary figure we find increasing the number of features reduces our power to detect rescue. At 256 features, we would not be able to detect any compounds that rescued the disease model phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) More development of the side-effect concept. The side effects analysis is interesting and potentially powerful. Prioritization of an intervention because of minimal perturbation of other phenotypes might be better documented and discussed a bit further; how reliably does the metric of low side effects correlate with drug effectiveness?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ultimately this can only be determined with clinical trial data on multiple drugs, but there are currently no therapeutic options for UNC80 deficiency in humans. We have included some extra discussion of the side effect concept.</p>

Gene names should be in italics in all figures, following C. elegans convention.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have updated all figures with larger labels and, where necessary, split figures to allow for better readability. We’ve also corrected italicisation.</p>

<p>We have removed references to causation. We were thinking of cases where a known variant is found in a patient where causality has already been established rather than cases of new variant discovery.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We now explain the extra keyword filtering step. For the final filtering step, we simply examined the list and chose 25. There is therefore little justification to provide and we acknowledge these cannot be seen as representative of the larger set according to well-defined rules. The choice was based on which genes we thought would be interesting using their descriptions or our prior knowledge (“subjective interestingness” in the main text).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figures 3 and 4, why show all 8289 features? It might be easier to understand and read if only the 256 Tierpsy features were plotted in the heat maps.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this case, we included all features because they were all tested for differences between mutants and controls. By consistently using all features for each fingerprint we can be sure that the features that are different that we want to highlight in box plots can be referred to in the fingerprint.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</disp-quote>
<p>This is a good point. We’ve redone the analysis using the Tierpsy 256 feature set and included this as a supplementary figure. We find that the same trend exists when looking at this reduced feature set.</p>

This would empower researchers to compare their findings with the extensive dataset created here. Otherwise, one is left with a very limited set of exploitable data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now made the feature data available on Zenodo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684118">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12684118</ext-link>) as a matrix of feature summaries and individual skeleton timeseries data (the feature matrix makes it more straightforward to extract the data from particular mutants for reanalysis). We have also created a static html version of the heatmap in Figure 2 containing the entire behavioural feature set extracted by Tierpsy. This can be opened in a browser and zoomed for detailed inspection. Mousing over the heatmap shows the names of features at each position making it easier to arrive at intuitive conclusions like ‘strain A is slow’ or ‘strain B is more curved’.</p>

<p>We have added a note in the main text on limitations of deletion alleles. We like the idea of making multiple alleles in future studies, especially in cases where a project is focussed on just one or a few genes.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Note that none of the above suggestions or the one immediately below are considered mandatory.</p>
<p>One additional minor point: The dual implication of mevalonate perturbations for NACLM deficiencies is striking. At the same time, the mevalonate pathway is critical for embryo viability among other things, which prompts questions about how reproductive physiology is integrated in this screen approach. It appears that sterilization protocols are not used to prepare screen target animals, but it would be useful to know if there were a signature associated with drug-induced sterility that might help identify one potential common non-interesting outcome of compound treatments in general. In this work, the screen treatment is only 4 hours, which is probably too short to compromise reproduction, but as noted above, it is likely users would intend to expose test subjects for much longer than 4-hour periods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point. In its current form our screen doesn’t assess reproductive physiology. This is something that we will consider in ongoing projects.</p>

<p>Figure 4, asterisks is spelled incorrectly.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>- As stated in the public review, the utility of the study is limited by the lack of access to the complete dataset. The wealth of data produced by the study is one of its major outputs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have made the data publicly available on Zenodo. We appreciate the request.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Describe the exact break-points of the different alleles, because it was not readily feasible to derive them from the gene fact sheets provided in the supplementary materials.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now provided the start position and total length of deletion for each gene in the gene fact sheets.</p>

<p>- Figure 1C: what does &quot;Genetic homology&quot;/&quot;sequence identity&quot; refer to? How were these values calculated?</p>
<p>UNC-49 is clearly not 95% identical to vertebrate GABAR subunits at the protein level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the axis label to “BLAST % Sequence Identity” to clarify that these values are calculated from BLAST sequence alignments on WormBase and the Alliance Genom Resources webpages.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Figure 1E : The data presented in Figure 1E appears somewhat unreliable. For example, a cursory check showed:</p>
<p>(1) Wrong human ortholog: unc-49 is a Gaba receptor, not a Glycine receptor as indicated in the second column.</p>
<p>(2) Wrong disease association: dys-1 is not associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome; overall the data indicated in the table does not seem to fully match the HPO database.</p>
<p>(3) Inconsistent disease association: why don't the avr-14 and glc-2 (and even unc-49) profiles overlap/coincide given that they present overlapping sets of human orthologs.</p>

<p>Thank you for catching this! We have corrected gene names which were mistakenly pasted. We have also made this a standalone table (Table 1) for improved readability.</p>

<p>- Error in legend to figure 4I : &quot;with ciliopathies and N2&quot; &gt; ciliopathies should be &quot;NALCN disease&quot;.</p>
<p>- Error at line 301: &quot;Figures 2E-H&quot; should be &quot;Figures 4E-H&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected.</p>
