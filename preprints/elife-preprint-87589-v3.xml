<title>Abstract</title><p>Astrocytes perform multifarious roles in the formation, regulation, and function of synapses in the brain, but the mechanisms involved are incompletely understood. Interestingly, astrocytes abundantly express neuroligins, postsynaptic adhesion molecules that function as synaptic organizers by binding to presynaptic neurexins. Here we examined the function of neuroligins in astrocytes with a rigorous genetic approach that uses the conditional deletion of all major neuroligins (<italic>Nlgn1-3</italic>) in astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> and complemented this approach by a genetic deletion of neuroligins in glia cells that are co-cultured with human neurons. Our results show that early postnatal deletion of neuroligins from astrocytes in vivo has no detectable effect on cortical or hippocampal synapses and does not alter the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes when evaluated in young adult mice. Moreover, deletion of astrocytic neuroligins in co-cultures of human neurons produced no detectable consequences for the formation and function of synapses. Thus, astrocytic neuroligins are unlikely to fundamentally shape synapse formation or astrocyte morphogenesis but likely perform other important roles that remain to be discovered.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Astrocytes perform vital roles across the lifespan of a synapse, from synapse formation to synaptic transmission to synapse elimination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Farhy-Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Eroglu and Barres 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Shan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lyon and Allen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Nagai et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, at least a subset of synapses physically interacts with astrocytes to form ‘tripartite synapses’. The abundance for such astrocyte-synapse contacts varies among synapse types from &lt;25% of synapses to nearly all synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Ventura and Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Araque et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Kuwajima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Ostroff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arizono and Nägerl, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Salmon et al., 2023</xref>). Some synapses are always associated with astrocytic processes (e.g., parallel-fiber synapses in the cerebellum; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Castejón, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Baude et al., 1994</xref>), whereas others are never associated with astrocytes (e.g., calyx synapses in the brainstem; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Meinrenken et al., 2003</xref>), and most are in between these two extremes.</p>
<p>The emergence of novel tools to genetically access and interrogate astrocytes has paved the way for a new effort dedicated to understanding the functional significance and the molecular mechanisms of the synaptic roles of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Yu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gleichman et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shigetomi et al., 2013</xref>). Among others, RNA sequencing (RNAseq) studies have revealed astrocytic expression of cell-adhesion molecules that were traditionally viewed as specifically synaptic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schaum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>). The astrocytic expression of these synaptic cell-adhesion molecules gave rise to a parsimonious and attractive hypothesis that accounts for how astrocytes may interact with synapses at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Imrie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chung et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Saint-Martin and Goda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tan and Eroglu, 2021</xref>). This hypothesis posits that astrocytes are integrated into tripartite synapses via synaptic cell-adhesion molecules, thereby enabling astrocytes to regulate synapse formation, maturation, function, or elimination.</p>
<p>Prominent among synaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are expressed by astrocytes are neuroligins, a family of postsynaptic adhesion molecules that are encoded in vertebrates by four genes (<italic>Nlgn1-4</italic>) (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> below). The four neuroligin genes produce highly homologous proteins with an identical domain structure and a high degree of sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ichtchenko et al., 1995</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bolliger et al. 2008</xref>). Neuroligins were discovered as the postsynaptic ligands for presynaptic neurexins but also bind to presynaptic LAR-type receptor tyrosine phosphatases and postsynaptic MDGA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Connor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Südhof 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bemben et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yoshida et al., 2021</xref>). Despite their similarity, however, different neuroligins display distinct localizations in brain and perform different non-redundant functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; Chanda et al., 2018). Specifically, neuronal <italic>Nlgn1</italic> and <italic>Nlgn2</italic> function exclusively at excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively, whereas <italic>Nlgn3</italic> and Nlgn4 may act at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Connor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Krueger et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<p>In a tripartite synapse, astrocytic neuroligins would be ideally positioned to control synapse numbers or properties, for example by binding to presynaptic neurexins or postsynaptic MDGAs presented on the surface of synaptic membranes. Thereby, astrocytic neuroligins could regulate astrocyte-neuron interactions. Indeed, a landmark study concluded that astrocytic expression of neuroligins controls synapse formation in mice and that in particular one specific neuroligin isoform, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, plays a central role in enabling excitatory synapse formation in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill <italic>et al</italic>. 2017</xref>). Moreover, this paper described that <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and other neuroligins regulate the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes since a loss-of-function of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and other neuroligins greatly reduced astrocyte branching in mixed cortical cultures of glia and neurons and in the visual cortex in vivo.</p>
<p>However, the impact of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn2</italic> deletions on excitatory synapse number reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> was surprising because a preponderance of data indicates that <italic>Nlgn2</italic> protein (referred to as Nlgn2) is exclusively localized to, and functions in, inhibitory and not excitatory synapses. Specifically, multiple studies showed that in cultured neurons, Nlgn2 is only present in inhibitory synapses and that the deletion of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> causes a loss of inhibitory synapses and inhibitory synaptic responses but has no effect on excitatory synapse numbers or excitatory synaptic transmission (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref> and 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>; Poulopoulos et al., 2009; Chanda et al., 2019). These results thus showed that in culture, astrocytic or neuronal Nlgn2 has no essential role in excitatory synapse formation or function. Notably, in the same cultures the <italic>Nlgn2</italic> deletion did have a dramatic effect on inhibitory synapses. Moreover, classical experiments from the Barres lab revealed that astrocytes do contribute to synapse formation in culture preparations, suggesting that astrocytes are important for synapse formation even in culture preparations despite the limitations of such preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Pfrieger and Barres, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Ullian et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>It might be argued that the synaptogenic contribution of astrocytic Nlgn2 to excitatory synapse formation could have become dispensable in culture by an unknown mechanism, as opposed to a ‘real brain’ in which Nlgn2 might be required for excitatory synapse formation. Contrary to this argument, however, several <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of multiple brain regions confirm the conclusion from culture experiments that Nlgn2 is only present and only functions in inhibitory, but not in excitatory, synapses. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Patrizi et al. (2008)</xref> showed that in the cerebellar cortex, Nlgn2 protein exclusively localizes to inhibitory synapses even though excitatory synapses are vastly more abundant. No quantifications of the Nlgn2 localization were offered in this paper, presumably because no Nlgn2 signal was detectable in the numerous parallel-fiber and climbing-fiber synapses of the cerebellar cortex, whereas Nlgn2 was observed in 100% of inhibitory synapses. Blundell et al. (2009) quantified the density of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in <italic>Nlgn2</italic> constitutive KO mice in the adult hippocampal CA1 region using both confocal light microscopy and electron microscopy. In the mature brain, they found a decrease in inhibitory synapses (∼40%) but no change in excitatory synapses after constitutive germline deletions. Since the excitatory synapses in the CA1 region turn over every 2-3 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Attardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Pfeiffer et al., 2018</xref>), astrocytic Nlgn2 is clearly not essential in the hippocampus for excitatory synapse formation. These results also agree with the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Panzanelli et al. (2017)</xref> who documented in the hippocampal CA1 region that Nlgn2 exclusively localizes to inhibitory synapses. Again, no quantifications were offered but the pictures are unequivocal in that staining for Nlgn2 overlaps 100% with that of two different markers for inhibitory synapse, gephyrin and GABA receptors. Furthermore, in likely the most definitive study to date, Kerti-Szigeti and Nusser (2016) performed a quantitative immuno-EM investigation of the GABA receptor composition of inhibitory hippocampal synapses. In the context of these studies, they labeled hippocampal sections with Nlgn2 antibodies. Although they also did not quantify excitatory synapses directly, their images and quantifications show that Nlgn2 completely co-localizes with GABA receptors at the EM level. These collective findings are mirrored by the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Takacs et al. (2013)</xref> who show by immuno-EM that Nlgn2 is present in GABAergic and cholinergic synapses in the cortex, hippocampus, and several other brain regions. These authors also did not comment on excitatory synapses but inspection of their electron micrographic images indicates that Nlgn2 is absent from excitatory synapses. Finally, Poulopoulos et al. (2009) show that in the adult brainstem of constitutive Nlgn2 KO mice, inhibitory synaptic responses are severely impaired but excitatory synaptic responses are unchanged. Poulopoulos et al. (2009) also demonstrated that the constitutive <italic>Nlgn2</italic> KO suppresses hippocampal inhibitory synaptic responses but the authors again did not measure excitatory synaptic responses in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>Viewed together, the results from these prior studies are difficult to reconcile with the notion that astrocytic Nlgn2 is selectively essential for excitatory synapse formation as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref>. However, the many earlier studies cited here examined the constitutive <italic>Nlgn2</italic> deletion in which <italic>Nlgn2</italic> is deleted from neurons in addition to astrocytes, which may for an unknown reason cause a phenotype that is different from the astrocyte-only deletion of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref>. It is thus conceivable that Nlgn2 has an essential function in excitatory synapse formation that only becomes manifest when <italic>Nlgn2</italic> is deleted from astrocytes but not neurons. Moreover, nearly all earlier studies did not examine the cortex but primarily studied the hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem, suggesting that Nlgn2 could perform distinct functions in the cortex and hippocampus. Finally, it is possible that differences in the timepoints of the deletions (i.e., constitutive deletions in the germline vs. in utero deletions) or in the developmental stages at which experiments were performed (young adult vs. adolescent mice) may have influenced the results.</p>
<p>Given the importance of understanding the potential role of astrocytic neuroligins in synapse formation and the differences between the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> and of previous studies on Nlgn2, we have here examined the fundamental functions of astrocytic neuroligins. Using a rigorous genetic approach, we show that early selective postnatal deletions of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in astrocytes do not significantly alter excitatory or inhibitory synapse numbers or functions (<italic>Nlgn4</italic> was not targeted owing to its low expression levels), at least when assessed in young adult mice. In addition, the astrocytic deletions of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> had no effect on the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes. Finally, deletion of all neuroligins (<italic>Nlgn1-4</italic>) in mouse glia that are then co-cultured with human neurons (which depend on the glia for synapse formation) did not detectably impair the ability of the mouse glia to promote neuronal synapse formation. Thus, astrocytic neuroligins in general and astrocytic Nlgn2 in particular likely do not perform a fundamental and essential function in promoting synapse formation or in shaping the astrocyte cytoarchitecture, suggesting that other astrocytic proteins are key drivers of synapse formation and that astrocytic neuroligins perform other important non-synaptic roles.</p>

<title>Astrocytes abundantly express neuroligins</title>
<p>For a gene to be involved in a particular physiological process, it must be expressed in the right place at the right time. To assess the expression of neuroligins in astrocytes in comparison with other cell types in brain, we examined the mRNA levels of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in various brain cells by analysis of published RNA sequencing (RNAseq) datasets (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>Nlgn4</italic> mRNAs were not detected in these datasets, possibly because of the low expression levels of <italic>Nlgn4</italic> mRNAs or their high GC content. We quantified <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> mRNA transcripts in astrocytes and other cell types in the mouse hippocampus and cortex in the single-cell RNAseq datasets from the McCarroll Lab (Saunders and Macosko et al., 2018, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dropviz.org">www.dropviz.org</ext-link>), Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Schaum et al. 2018</xref>), Wu lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhang et al. 2014</xref>), and Linnarson lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mousebrain.org">www.mousebrain.org</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). Interestingly, these quantifications showed that all three neuroligins were abundantly expressed in astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in addition to neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-D</xref>). The relative expression levels of <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> in various cell types differed between datasets, probably because different cell isolation methods, RNAseq procedures and data analysis algorithms were used, but all datasets revealed similarly high neuroligin expression levels in neurons and astrocytes and generally even higher expression levels in OPCs. <italic>Nlgn3</italic> was consistently the most astrocyte-enriched neuroligin isoform (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The prominent expression of neuroligins in astrocytes was further supported by bulk RNAseq experiments performed by the Khakh lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Srinivasan et al., 2016</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.astrocyternaseq.org">www.astrocyternaseq.org</ext-link>) using astrocytic mRNAs purified via the RiboTag approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>) from the cortex, hippocampus, or striatum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Again, all three isoforms were detected across these brain regions, with <italic>Nlgn3</italic> identified as the most enriched isoform compared to the input.</p>
<p>In mice, the major period for developmental synaptogenesis occurs over the first three weeks of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Semple et al., 2013</xref>), although synapses are continuously formed and eliminated throughout life. Measurements of the expression of neuroligin proteins in brain as a function of postnatal development showed that neuroligin expression parallels the process of synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Irie et al., 1997</xref>). Moreover, comparative analysis of RNAseq data from the Barres lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.brainrnaseq.org">www.brainrnaseq.org</ext-link>) indicates that during the entire lifespan of a mouse, astrocytes in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum continuously express <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> at similar levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), consistent with a role of astrocytic neuroligins in the regulation of neural circuits. Thus, neuroligins are expressed in the right place and time for a role as astrocytic drivers of synapse formation.</p>

<title>Conditional deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in astrocytes</title>
<p>To assess the fundamental functions of astrocytic neuroligins in synaptogenesis and astrocyte development, we generated mice that enable the inducible conditional deletion of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn1</italic>, <italic>Nlgn2</italic>, and <italic>Nlgn3</italic>. We targeted the conditional deletion specifically to astrocytes by crossing Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> BAC transgenic mice that exhibit astrocyte-specific expression of tamoxifen-activatable Cre-recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Winchenbach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Yu et al., 2020</xref>) with <italic>Nlgn1</italic>-<italic>3</italic> conditional KO (cKO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We then bred homozygous female triple <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> cKO mice with male triple cKO mice carrying the Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> allele to generate littermate male and female Cre-positive test mice and Cre-negative control mice. Mice were injected with tamoxifen intraperitoneally at postnatal days 10 and 11 (P10 and P11) or subcutaneously at postnatal day 1 (P1) and were analyzed at P35 – P48 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, 2C</xref>). The P10-11 tamoxifen injection paradigm was chosen based on a similar injection window used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> in <italic>Nlgn2</italic> cKO mice harboring GLAST-CreERT2 alleles, which resulted in a striking reduction in excitatory synaptic transmission in V1 layer 5 pyramidal neurons. On the other hand, the P1 injection was chosen to target astrocytes earlier in development and to better recapitulate the early postnatal targeting of astrocytes that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> achieved using electroporation of P0/P1 mouse pups with plasmids to express shRNA (i.e. targeting individual <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic>) or Cre recombinase (in mice carrying floxed-Nlgn2 alleles). The mice carrying the astrocyte-specific deletion of neuroligins will subsequently be referred to as astro-Nlgn123 cKO mice.</p>

<title>Efficient deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> following P1 subcutaneous tamoxifen injection</title>
<p>To confirm the efficacy of CreER<sup>T2</sup> induction, we focused on the subcutaneous tamoxifen injections at P1 since this condition was used for the majority of our experiments as the most rigorous approach but was not validated in detail previously. We crossed Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> BAC transgenic mice with Cre-dependent tdTomato (tdT) reporter mice (Ai14), injected the resulting double-transgenic mice subcutaneously with tamoxifen at P1, and analyzed the mice at P35 by staining brain sections for tdTomato (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In the CA1 region of the hippocampus of these mice, we observed tdTomato-labeling in over 80% of astrocytes in the <italic>S. oriens</italic>, <italic>S. pyramidale</italic>, <italic>S. radiatum</italic>, or <italic>S. lacunosum</italic>-<italic>moleculare</italic>. In the cortex and hippocampus we found no neuronal recombination except for low levels in the dentate gyrus that is populated by adult-born neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). In layer IV (L4) of the primary visual cortex (V1), we also detected Cre-dependent tdTomato expression only in astrocytes without non-specific recombination in neurons. Again, approximately 90% of S100beta-expressing cells expressed tdTomato as an indicator of Cre activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> &amp; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>). Since some of the S100beta-expressing are OPCs, the true efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination likely exceeds 90%. Thus, the P1 tamoxifen injection protocol efficiently activates Cre recombinase in Aldh1l1-CreER<sup>T2</sup> BAC transgenic mice.</p>
<p>We next determined the efficacy of the actual genetic recombination of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> alleles by employing a viral method that allows highly efficient capture of ribosome-bound mRNA (i.e. Ribotag) from infected astrocytes while minimizing unspecific capture of other mRNA’s, especially from neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This was accomplished by packaging in AAV2/5 an expression construct containing four elements: 1) the GfaABC1D promoter, which allows efficient expression of genetic cargo in astrocytes, 2) RiboTag (i.e., Rpl22-HA, which allows affinity capture of ribosome-bound mRNA with HA antibodies), 3) a membrane-targeted fluorescent reporter (i.e., Lck-mVenus), and 4) a 4×6T cassette of mIR-124 targeting sequences as was recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gleichman et al., 2023</xref>). Inclusion of the 4×6T was essential to minimize off-target expression of RiboTag in neurons, which we had detected to occur in low but detectable levels in earlier versions of this construct lacking this cassette.</p>

<p>We validated this approach using astro-<italic>Nlgn123</italic> cKO mice and their littermate controls, both of which were injected subcutaneously with tamoxifen on P1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). At 5-6 weeks of age, mice were injected with equal amounts of AAV’s into the dorsal hippocampus. Approximately 3 weeks after surgery, acute slices were prepared in ice-cold cutting solution. After confirmation of the presence of Lck-mVenus(+)-astrocytes, the dorsal CA1 and nearby cortex were micro-dissected followed by lysis in the presence of cycloheximide. qPCR was performed in RiboTag pull-downs compared to input (i.e. total RNA) to assess the relative levels of marker genes for major cell types (e.g. astrocytes, neurons, OPC’s, oligodendrocytes, and microglia). In both the cortex and hippocampal area CA1, we found the expected enrichment of astrocytic <italic>Aqp4</italic> (∼5-10 fold) and de-enrichment of other cell markers, including a ∼95% de-enrichment of the neuronal marker <italic>Rbfox3</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p>
<p>We then examined the expression of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> using qRT-PCR with primers that recognize the exons that are targeted in the astro-<italic>Nlgn123</italic> cKO mice in order to avoid measurements of mRNAs that do not undergo efficient nonsense-mediated decay. In the CA1 region, we observed robust loss of <italic>Nlgn3</italic> (∼96%), <italic>Nlgn2</italic> (∼86%), and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> (65%) gene expression. Similarly, in the cortex, we observed a equivalent robust loss of <italic>Nlgn3</italic> (93%), <italic>Nlgn2</italic> (83%), and <italic>Nlgn1</italic> (72%) expression. Given that our targeting of astrocytes based on Ai14 Cre-reporter mice was ∼90-99% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>), these reductions are striking and definitive. The existence of some residual neuroligin transcripts likely reflects the presence of a small population of astrocytes heterozygous or wildtype for <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> or contaminations in the RiboTag pulldowns. In contrast, <italic>Nlgn1</italic> appears more difficult to recombine and it is likely that while many astrocytes are <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and <italic>Nlgn3</italic> knockout cells, a significant number may be heterozygous or wildtype for <italic>Nlgn1</italic>.</p>

Given that astrocytes account for only ∼20% of cells in brain, the absence of a significant decrease in neuroligin proteins in brain after the <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> deletion in astrocytes is not surprising as one would expect maximally a ∼20% decrease in neuroligin levels if mRNA and protein levels perfectly correlated. Protein level measurements are inherently noisy, making detections of change of &lt;20% difficult. The finding of a ∼25% decrease in <italic>Nlgn3</italic> levels in cortex after the P1 induction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) is consistent with this assessment since <italic>Nlgn3</italic> is the most abundantly expressed neuroligin isoform in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Astrocytic neuroligins are dispensable for hippocampal synapse formation</title>
<p>Measurements of synaptic proteins in tissue lysates are a relatively insensitive approach to assessing synapse numbers. For a more direct measurement, we labeled cryosections from the brains of littermate astro-<italic>Nlgn123</italic> cKO and control mice at P35 after P1 induction of Cre-recombinase with antibodies to the excitatory presynaptic marker vGluT1, the excitatory postsynaptic marker Homer1 and the dendritic marker MAP2, and counterstained the sections with DAPI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Because excitatory synapses in the hippocampus are too dense to be individually resolved by confocal imaging, we used the overall staining intensity as a proxy for synapse density.

<p>To assess whether astrocytic neuroligins are required for inhibitory synapse formation, we labeled hippocampal sections with antibodies to the inhibitory presynaptic marker GAD67, the inhibitory postsynaptic marker gephyrin and the dendritic marker MAP2, and again counterstained the sections with DAPI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).

Given the lower density of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, individual inhibitory synapses could be resolved with high magnification imaging.

<title>Astrocytic neuroligins are not required for basal synaptic function</title>
<p>The lack of a requirement of astrocytic neuroligins for synapse formation in the hippocampus, at least in young adult mice, agrees well with previous data demonstrating that constitutive neuroligin deletions do not decrease excitatory synapse numbers, but severely impair synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>; Poulopoulos et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Patrizi et al., 2008</xref>; Blundell et al., 2009). To test whether loss of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> causes a functional impairment of synapses, we monitored spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 region pyramidal neurons. We produced acute slices from littermate astro-<italic>Nlgn123</italic> cKO and control mice at P44-50 after P1 tamoxifen injections and performed patch-clamp recordings from CA1-region pyramidal neurons in the presence of tetrodotoxin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The amplitude, frequency, and kinetics of mEPSCs and mIPSCs were not changed by deletion of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, deletion of astrocytic neuroligins did not alter the membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>).

<p>Since the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al.

As in the hippocampus, excitatory synapses in L4 of the primary visual cortex are too dense to be resolved individually, so we quantified the overall staining intensity as a proxy for synapse number. High magnification imaging revealed that loss of astrocytic neuroligins had no effect on the staining intensity of vGluT1 or vGluT2 but produced a small decrease (∼15%) in the staining intensity of Homer1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B, D</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the effect of deleting astrocytic neuroligins on inhibitory synapses in L4, sections were co-stained with antibodies to GAD67, gephyrin, and MAP2 and again counterstained with DAPI (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). The staining intensity of GAD67 and gephyrin were unaffected by the astrocytic neuroligin deletion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>).

<title>Astrocytic neuroligins are not essential for astrocyte morphogenesis</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Astrocytes are integral to shaping neural circuits. In the gray matter of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Halassa et al. 2007</xref>), hippocampus (CA1 <italic>S. radiatum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Bushong et al. 2001</xref>), and cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Spacek 1985</xref>), astrocytes (or their cousins, the Bergmann glia of the cerebellum) occupy non-overlapping territories, effectively “tiling” the neuropil. Within their territories, astrocytes not only contact all other cells in brain, but also associate with axons and dendrites and elaborate cellular processes close to synaptic junctions, often referred to as leaflets or perisynaptic astrocytic processes, thus forming tripartite synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Witcher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Derouiche et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Imrie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chung et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Saint-Martin and Goda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Oliveira and Araque, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Lyon and Allen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Arizono and Nägerl, 2022</xref>). Astrocytes exhibit an exceptionally complex cytoarchitecture that includes thousands of fine processes infiltrating the neuropil where these processes likely perform multiple essential functions. At tripartite synapses, astrocyte functions include the removal of released glutamate from the perisynaptic area via glutamate transporters, thereby facilitating input specificity and preventing neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Rothstein et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tanaka et al, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Bergles and Jahr, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bergles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Rose et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mahmoud et al., 2019</xref>). Astrocytes express numerous neurotransmitter receptors, enabling them to contribute to synaptic signaling and to respond to synaptic activity in a dynamic and activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Tanaka et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Allen and Eroglu, 2017</xref>). Moreover, astrocytic processes contain an array of ion channels that regulate their activity and contribute to ion homeostasis not only at synapses but also at other cellular locations, such as the nodes of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Butt and Berry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Black and Waxman, 1988</xref>) and blood vessels (Kuboter et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Takano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Attwell et al., 2010</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which astrocytes interact with synapses, blood vessels, nodes of Ranvier, and other brain components are incompletely understood.</p>
<p>Recent transcriptomic studies revealed that, in addition to neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, astrocytes express a large array of cell-adhesion molecules that are known to function at synapses, suggesting that synaptic cell-adhesion molecules may mediate the integration of astrocytes into tripartite synapses and that astrocytes may regulate synapses via signals that are transmitted by such cell-adhesion molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Imrie et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Chung et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Saint-Martin and Goda, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Tan and Eroglu, 2021</xref>). Indeed, our analysis of multiple independent RNAseq datasets showed that astrocytes express particularly high levels of neuroligins, canonical postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules that are known to be essential for synaptic function (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The absolute and relative expression levels of different neuroligin isoforms in astrocytes varied among studies, but all studies concur in the conclusion that the mRNA levels of the three major neuroligins (<italic>Nlgn1-3</italic>) are overall similar in astrocytes and neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>Nlgn4</italic> was not captured in the RNAseq studies owing to the high GC content of its mRNA and its lower abundance). Thus, neuroligins are clearly not neuron-specific, which is consistent with the possibility that neuroligins in astrocytes may embed astrocytes in tripartite synapses and enable astrocytes to contribute to the formation and performance of synapses.</p>
<p>Motivated by the observation of high levels of neuroligin expression in astrocytes and by the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> that suggest a major role for astrocytic neuroligins in synapse formation and have guided the understanding of the role of astrocytes at synapses, we here investigated the function of neuroligins expressed in astrocytes. We aimed to achieve two related goals: First, to test the hypothesis emerging from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> paper that astrocytic neuroligins as synaptic cell-adhesion molecules perform a critical role in promoting synapse formation. Second, to resolve a major contradiction arising from a comparison of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> findings with previous studies that argue against this hypothesis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al.

Inconsistent with this conclusion, however, earlier studies detected <italic>Nlgn2</italic> protein of any origin only in inhibitory but not in excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Varoqueaux et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Graf et al., 2004</xref>; Poulopoulos et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Patrizi et al., 2008</xref>; Blundell et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Panzanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Takacs et al., 2013</xref>; Kerti-Szigeti and Nusser, 2016) and showed that deletion of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> in both neurons and glia caused a dysfunction of only inhibitory but not of excitatory synapses (Vareauqueaux et al., 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Chubykin et al., 2007</xref>; Poulopoulos et al., 2009; Blundell et al., 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chanda et al., 2017</xref>). Since this contradiction remained unaddressed in studies following the Stogsdill et al. paper (2017), we felt that it was necessary to try to resolve it.</p>
<p>In order to investigate whether astrocytic neuroligins, as opposed to neuronal neuroligins, perform an essential function in synapse formation, we used a rigorous genetic approach. We generated a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model that enables conditional deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in all astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), which we confirmed allowed their efficient deletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We then analyzed the effect of such deletion in depth in the hippocampal CA1 region and the visual cortex using two different time points of induction of the deletion of astrocytic neuroligins (P1 and P10-11; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). We made two principal observations.</p>
<p>First, deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> from astrocytes had no detectable effect on the density of excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus or cortex, or on the properties of spontaneous excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus when measured in young adult mice. We established this conclusion by immunocytochemical analyses using a panel of antibodies to synaptic markers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), by electrophysiology (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), and by quantification of the synaptic proteome (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, human neurons co-cultured with mouse glia do not depend on glial neuroligins for synapse formation, even though the human neurons require mouse glia for efficient synapse formation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, astrocytic <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> are not required for synapse formation and/or maintenance in mice at P35-42 or in co-cultures of human neurons with dissociated mouse glia.</p>
<p>Second, deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> from astrocytes does not cause a measurable change in the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). This was assessed by monitoring the astrocyte protein composition, GFAP staining in the hippocampus, and three-dimensional reconstruction of astrocytes in the hippocampus or cortex. Thus, <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> are not fundamentally required for the morphogenesis or cell shape maintenance of astrocytes when analyzed in young adult mice.</p>
<p>Two questions arise at this point. Is it possible that the genetic deletion of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> in astrocytes for some reason was ineffective? To assess the efficiency of the tamoxifen-induced deletion of floxed genes, we quantified Cre-activity using the P1 induction protocol, which is the approach used for most experiments in this paper since it aims to permanently delete all neuroligins at a time early in development (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>). We observed Cre-mediated recombination in &gt;80% of astrocytes but in &lt;5% of neurons except for the dentate gyrus in which neurons are continuously replenished by adult neurogenesis. This finding confirms that the genetic approach efficiently induces Cre-recombinase activity, which in turn we previously demonstrated using the same conditional triple <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> alleles employed here quantitatively deletes all three neuroligin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chanda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). We further confirmed efficient recombination of <italic>Nlgn1-3</italic> using a viral RiboTag approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), which showed the highly efficacy knockout of <italic>Nlgn2</italic> and <italic>Nlgn3</italic>, and to a lesser extent <italic>Nlgn1</italic>. In addition, we demonstrated that the deletion of glial neuroligins in the co-culture experiments with human neurons was complete (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>).</p>
<p>The second question is how can we explain the discrepancies between our results and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017</xref>)? It is possible that multiple differences in the approaches used may have contributed to these discrepancies.</p>
<p>First, we used a purely genetic approach, whereas a large amount of the data in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> paper were obtained with shRNAs. shRNA-mediated knockdowns are prone to off-target effects and additionally suffer from the limitation that their use interferes with the entire microRNA processing machinery of a cell. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> used conditional <italic>Nlgn2</italic> KO mice (the same alleles that we originally generated and that were used in the present study) for analyses of synapse numbers, astrocyte morphology, and spontaneous synaptic transmission. To confirm <italic>Nlgn2</italic> shRNA findings, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> employed postnatal astrocyte labeling by electroporation (PALE) to sparsely express Cre and a fluorescent reporter in astrocytes started on P2. They then confirmed a similar change in astrocyte morphology as was caused by shRNA, as well as ∼50% reductions in thalamocortical and intracortical excitatory synapses in the territories of V1 L4 astrocytes. They also used tamoxifen-induced deletion of astrocytic <italic>Nlgn2</italic> at P10-11 with the GLAST-CreER<sup>T2</sup> mouse line, which led led to an impairment in the function of excitatory synapses in the layer V of the primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. 2017</xref>). Thus, although it is not possible with this approach to assess the efficiency of the <italic>Nlgn2</italic> deletion, at least some of the findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> cannot be completely explained by RNAi-dependent off-target effects.</p>
<p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> largely employed ‘sparse’ deletions of neuroligins in a subset of astrocytes whereas we used a global deletion of neuroligins in nearly all astrocytes, and that they mostly analyzed adolescent mice whereas we examined young adult mice. Sparse deletions, such as those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref>, are powerful tools but their phenotypes are difficult to interpret because a manipulated cell with a deletion will be at a competitive disadvantage with surrounding wild-type cells. As a result, changes that are not related to the function of the deleted gene but are caused by this competitive disadvantage become manifest as phenotypes. It is thus possible, maybe even likely, that neuroligins perform a non-synaptic function in astrocytes, and that owing to indirect downstream effects induced by the competition with surrounding wild-type astrocytes, the shape of the mutant astrocytes and the formation of excitatory synapses may have been compromised even though astrocytic neuroligins are not important for the formation of synapses <italic>per se</italic>. Astrocytes tile the neuropil by engaging in a competition with neighboring astrocytes for individual territories through a mechanism similar to that of dendritic tiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Freeman, 2010</xref>). Thus, we might expect that a sparse manipulation would produce a misleading phenotype over that of a global manipulation. An indirect effect produced by a competitive disadvantage induced with a sparse deletion has been recently reported in astrocytes for hepatocyte cell-adhesion molecule (hepaCAM). In this study, sparse deletion of hepaCAM led to a reduction in the volume of the astrocyte territory, while global deletion of hepaCAM had no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Baldwin et al. 2021</xref>), although there was an increase in astrocyte overlap in the global hepaCAM knockouts. Additionally, it has been reported that while the global deletion of <italic>Nlgn1 in vivo</italic> has no effect on synapse number in cortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, sparse deletion via electroporation of shRNAs targeting <italic>Nlgn1</italic> does result in a reduction of spine density and synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Kwon et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, we analyzed a different developmental timepoint than <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref>. Our analyses were performed in young adult mice (largely P35), whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> examined synapses in adolescent mice (P21) when synaptic and astrocytic morphological refinements are advanced but not yet fully complete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Freeman 2010</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the phenotype observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Stogsdill et al. (2017)</xref> is developmentally transient in nature and recovers in the time difference between their and our analysis. A transient effect of a neuroligin-like gene in astrocytes has been described in Drosophila. Here, RNAi knockdown of astrocytic Drosophila <italic>Nlgn2</italic> delayed motor circuit closure during development but did not result in robust, lasting behavioral phenotypes after the critical period had passed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackerman et al. 2021</xref>). It is important to note that, in agreement with our data indicating that astrocytic neuroligins do not control astrocyte morphogenesis, astrocyte-specific deletions of the Drosophila <italic>Nlgn2</italic> also had no effect on astrocyte volume or tiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ackerman et al. 2021</xref>). Furthermore, in a screen investigating astrocyte morphological diversity across the nervous system, neuroligins were not identified among the genes correlating with differences in astrocyte morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Endo et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, it seems unlikely that astrocytic neuroligins have a fundamental and long-lasting function in synapse formation or in shaping the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes. However, it is probable that neuroligins perform other important roles in astrocytes that remain to be identified. Indeed, two recent studies on astrocytic <italic>Nlgn3</italic> have uncovered roles in social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dang et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Qin et al., 2024</xref>). Continual advances in the tools available to access astrocytes, in concert with genetic models that allow temporally-defined manipulation of genes, will be key to discovering these roles that may provide new insights into astrocyte biology.</p>

<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated. Hippocampus and cortex were collected in RIPA buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA) with cOmplete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Cat# 11873580001) on ice. Tissue samples were homogenized with a dounce tissue grinder on ice, rotated at 4°C for 30 min, and finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min. Supernatant was collected from the samples and protein content was quantified using a BCA assay (Thermo, Cat# 23225). Protein lysates were stored at −80°C until use.</p>
<p>Quantified protein lysates were added to Laemmli sample buffer with DTT. Samples were boiled at 95°C for 5 min, except in the case of immunoblotting for multi-pass transmembrane proteins, for which samples were not heated. Samples were run on 4-20% Criterion TGX precast gels (Bio-Rad, Cat# 5671094 &amp; 5671095) to separate proteins by molecular weight. Proteins were transferred from gels to 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Cat# 1620112) using the Trans-blot turbo system (Bio-Rad) for 7 min at 25V. For detection of proteins, membranes were first blocked in 5% non-fat milk (Carnation) in TBST for one hour at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk (Carnation) in TBST overnight at 4°C Membranes were washed with TBST three times for 10 min per wash prior to incubation with LI-COR secondary antibodies diluted in 5% non-fat milk (Carnation) in TBST at a concentration of 1:10,000. Membranes were subsequently imaged with the Odyssey CLx imaging system (LI-COR) with quantification carried out in Image Studio Lite 5.2.

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then pericardially perfused with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 min followed by ice cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 7 min at a rate of 1 µl/min. PBS and PFA were filtered through a 0.2 µm filter prior to perfusion. Brains were extracted and post-fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. PFA was removed, followed by thee washes with PBS. Brains were then placed in 30% sucrose (dissolved in PBS) for 24-48 hours and subsequently frozen in cryomolds (Tissue-Tek) in O.C.T. compound (Tissue-Tek). Brains were then sectioned coronally at 35 µm on a CM3050-S cryostat (Leica). To stain, free floating sections were first blocked for 1 hour at room temperature in blocking buffer (5% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100) and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The next day, sections were washed three times for 15 min per wash in PBS at room temperature. Free floating sections were then incubated in secondary antibodies diluted at 1:1000 in blocking buffer for 2 hours at room temperature. Sections were washed three times for 15 min per wash in PBS at room temperature and then mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Fisherbrand) in 10% PBS. Once the sections were dry, slides were dipped in water and allowed to dry again. Coverslips (#1.5, VWR) were affixed with DAPI Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images of the hippocampus and primary visual cortex were taken with a Nikon confocal microscope using either the 20X air objective or 60X oil objective. Imaging of immunostained sections to confirm successful viral targeting was performed on the Olympus VS200 slide scanner using a 20X air objective.</p>

<p>Ribosome-bound mRNA was purified using a modified version of the RiboTag method, which has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sanz et al., 2009</xref>). Following euthanasia with isoflurane and decapitation, rapidly dissected brains were dropped in ice cold cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 228 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose,7 MgSO4-7H2O, and 0.5 CaCl2. Acute coronal brain slices (300 μm) containing the dorsal hippocampus were visualized using a stereomicroscope equipped with fluorescent lamp to check for mVenus-expressed astrocytes, indicating successful viral targeting. Hippocampal area CA1 and the entire cortex region superior to CA1 from just above the alveus to the cortical service were dissected using a microknife with the aid of a stereomicroscope. CA1 and cortical tissue from a given animal was pooled, excess cutting solution was removed, and tissue was Dounce homogenized in a homogenization buffer at 10% weight/volume. Homogenate was clarified by centrifugation and 10% of the supernatant was saved as input. The remaining lysate was incubated with pre-washed anti-HA magnetic beads (Thermo) overnight at 4°C. Beads were washed 3 times with a high-salt buffer followed by elution with RLT lysis buffer with β-ME. Both input and IP samples were subjected to RNA extraction using the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro kit.

Equal volumes of cDNA were then mixed with TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Thermo) and qRT-PCR reactions were performed using a QuantStudio 3 RT-PCR System (Thermo). We utilized PrimeTime qPCR Probe Assays (Integrated DNA Technologies), consisting of two primers and one FAM-labeled, ZEN/IBFQ-quenched 5’ nuclease probe. The Ct values for technical replicates, which were performed in duplicate for all reactions, were averaged. Data were normalized to the arithmetic mean of ActB using the 2-ΔΔCt method. For measuring the purity of cell type-specific ribosome-bound mRNA following immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, 3F</xref>), the following assays were employed (gene, assay ID): Actb (Mm.PT.51.14022423), Aqp4 (Mm.PT.58.9080805), Sox9 (Mm.PT.58.42739087), Pdgfra (Mm.PT.56a.5639577), MBP (Mm.PT.58.28532164), P2ry12 (Mm.PT.58.43542033), and Rbfox3 or NeuN (Mm.PT.58.11398454), Nlgn1 (recognizing ex7a-ex8; Mm.PT.58.5704919), Nlgn2 (recognizing ex3-ex4; Mm.pt.58.41142345), and Nlgn3 (recognizing ex2-ex3; Mm.PT.58.31138258).</p>

<p>Acute coronal brain slices (300 μm) containing the dorsal hippocampus were prepared from P45-50 Nlgn123 astrocyte conditional knockout mice and littermate controls, both of which had been injected with tamoxifen at P1. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was quickly removed and dropped into into ice cold, oxygenated physiological cutting solution containing the following (in mM): 228 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose,7 MgSO4-7H2O, and 0.5 CaCl2. Slices were then recovered for 30 minutes at 32°C in pre-warmed, oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) that contained (in mM): 119 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2 and 1.3 MgCl2 in ddH2O. aCSF had been adjusted to a final osmolarity of 300 mOsm. Slices were then recovered at RT in oxygenated ACSF for another 60 minutes. Slices were maintained for 2-3 hours at RT in oxygenated ACSF throughout recordings. Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings were performed on CA1 pyramidal neurons while clamping the cells - 70 mV. Slices were perfused with room temperature, oxygenated ACSF at ∼2 ml / minute. Electrical signals were recorded at 5 kHz with a two channel MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Axon Instruments). They were digitalized with a Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular devices), which was controlled by Clampex 10.7 (Molecular Devices). Patch clamp pipettes were generated with thin-walled borosilicate glass pipettes to resistances of 3-5 MΩ. mEPSCs were recorded with an internal solution that contained (in mM): 135 cesium methanesulfonate, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.2 Na2-GTP, 0.1 spermine, 7 phosphocreatine, and 0.3 EGTA with a pH of 7.3 and adjusted to a final osmolarity of 300 mOsm. mIPSCs were recorded with an internal solution that contained (in mM): 140 mM CsCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, 10 mM Hepes, 0.3 mM Na3-GTP, and 4 mM Na2-ATP at pH 7.35 and adjusted to a final osmolarity of 300 mOsm. For mIPSC recordings, the calcium levels were reduced to 1 mM owing to the extremely high frequency observed in CA1 pyramidal neurons. To isolate mEPSCs, recordings were performed in the presence of 0.5 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX; Cayman Chemical, Cat. 14964) and 50 μM picrotoxin (Tocris, Cat. 1128). To isolate mIPSCs, recordings were performed in the presence of 10 μM CNQX (Tocris, Cat. 1045), 50 μM D-AP5 (Tocris, Cat. 0106), and 0.5 μM TTX. Analysis was performed blindly using Clampfit 10.7 via a template search for inward currents and selected manually based on trained templates. Kinetics were calculated as 10%-90% (rise) and 90%-10% (decay) peak amplitude of currents.

<title>Plasmids</title>
<p>To assess astrocyte morphology, the following plasmids were used: pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus and the helper plasmids pHelper and pAA5. The pAAV-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus construct was generated using PCR stitching to include the GfaABC1D promoter and a membrane targeting domain as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chai et al., 2017</xref>) and fused with mVenus in order to mark astrocyte membranes for analysis of astrocyte morphology. PCR stitching was also used to create a novel viral tool for capturing astrocyte-enriched ribosome-bound mRNA. The expression construct included features from previous astrocyte-targeted viral RiboTag vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Bravo-Ferrer et al., 2022</xref>), including the the GfaABC1D promoter, which allows efficient expression of genetic cargo in astrocytes, and RiboTag (i.e., Rpl22-HA, which allows affinity capture of ribosome-bound mRNA with HA antibodies). We also incorporated upstream of Ribotag, a membrane-targeted fluorescent reporter (i.e., Lck-mVenus) to allow visualized of targeted astrocytes, and the self-cleaving peptide, P2A, to allow separate targeting of the reporter and RiboTag. Finally, we included a 4×6T cassette of mIR-124 targeting sequences as was recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Gleichman et al., 2023</xref>), which significantly reduces off-target expression of genetic cargo in infected neurons.</p>

Approximately 12 hours after transfection, media was changed. At, ∼72 hours after the transfection, the HEK293T cells were collected using PBS with 10 mM EDTA and then spun down at 1500 x g. The cell pellets were resuspended in freezing buffer and subjected to 3 freeze-thaw cycles, alternating between 37C and a dry ice bath. Lysates were then incubated with 50 units / ml of benzonase nuclease at 37C for 30 minutes followed by a spin at 3000 x g for 30 minutes. The supernatant was loaded into discontinuous iodixanol gradient and centrifuged at 65,000 rpm for 3 hours. The 40% iodixanol fraction was collected and concentrated using 100,000 MWCO centricon columns. Filtrate was washed with several charges of MEM and then aliquoted and stored at −80C until use. Although viral titer was not determined, purified AAV was injected in vivo at various dilutions in order to identify a dilution that allowed sparse targeting of astrocytes for morphological reconstruction; thus, final viral titer was relatively low.</p>
<p>AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus-P2A-Rpl22-HA-4×6T was produced by the Stanford Gene Vector and Virus Core (RRID:SCR_023250). The titer was determined to be 2.10E+13 and 3.00E+13 using assays that recognize the WPRE and ITR sequences, respectively.</p>

<title>Stereotactic Injections</title>
<p>Prior to surgery, P21 mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (Avertin) at a dosage of 125-300 mg/kg and Buprenorphine Sustained Release was administered at 0.5 mg/kg to provide analgesia. Mouse heads were shaved and then cleaned with Betadine prior to incision of the scalp. Using a stereotactic rig (Kopf) for targeting, AAV expressing membrane-targeted mVenus under the control of the GFAP promoter was injected into CA1 (coordinates from bregma: A-P −1.8, M-L ±1.15, D-V −1.4) or V1 (coordinates from bregma: A-P −3.99, M-L ±2.6, D-V - 1.5). Virus was injected through a glass pipette attached to a syringe pump (SP101i, World Precision Instruments) at a speed of 0.15 µl/min at a volume that was empirically determined to sparsely infect astrocytes (0.5 µl). Following injection, the incision was closed with 4-0 nylon sutures (Unify). Mice were allowed to recover in a clean cage on a heating pad prior to transfer to a clean home cage. Sutures were removed 10 days post-surgery.</p>
<p>For validating Nlgn123 knockout efficiency, P35-P40 mice were injected with AAV2/5-GfaABC1D-Lck-mVenus-P2A-Rpl22-HA-4×6T diluted at 1:1 in DMEM (final titer is 1.05E+13 and 1.5E+13 based on WPRE and ITR sequences, respectively). 0.45 μl per hemisphere (coordinates from bregma: A-P −1.8, ML ± 1.45, D-V −1.15 to −1.45 with 0.15 μl per 0.15 step).</p>

<title>Astrocyte Morphology</title>
<p>Mice were stereotactically injected with AAV expressing membrane-targeted mVenus under the control of the GFAP promoter at P21 and then perfused, as described in the immunohistochemistry section, at P35. Brains were post-fixed in 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4°C. Brains were then washed 3 times in PBS and then vibratome sectioned at 100µm in PBS. Sections were counterstained with DAPI (D8417, Sigma) and mounted on gelatin-coated slides (FD Neurotechenologies, Cat# PO101) in 10% PBS. Once sections were dry, slides were dipped in water and again allowed to dry. Coverslips (#1.5, VWR) were affixed with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Images were taken on a Zeiss AiryScan microscope using the same imaging parameters for controls and Astro-Nlgn123 cKO animal. While blinded, astrocyte morphologies were reconstructed with 3D rendering in Imaris and astrocyte volumes were measured.</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Statistics</title>
<p>For electrophysiology experiments, data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.7 (Molecular Devices). For immunoblot, immunohistochemistry, and astrocyte morphology experiments, unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to assess statistical significance. For electrophysiology experiments, unpaired two-tailed t-tests were used to analyze data plotted in bar graphs (e.g., rise time) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were used to assess statistical significance of cumulative curves. For bar graphs, data are depicted as means ± SEM. For all experiments, significance is indicated by * p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 or ****p&lt;0.0001.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study examines whether synaptic cell adhesion molecules neuroligin 1-3 resident on astrocytes, rather than neurons, exert effects on synaptic structure and function. With <bold>compelling</bold> evidence, including rigorous validation of neuroligin deletion efficiency in astrocytes and independent confirmation using human neuron-mouse glia co-cultures, the authors report that deletion of neuroligins 1-3 specifically in astrocytes does not alter synapse formation or astrocyte morphology in the hippocampus or visual cortex. This study provides definitive evidence highlighting the specific role of neuronal neuroligins rather than their astrocytic counterparts in synaptogenesis.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are known to express neuroligins 1-3. Within neurons, these cell adhesion molecules perform important roles in synapse formation and function. Within astrocytes, a significant role for neuroligin 2 in determining excitatory synapse formation and astrocyte morphology was shown in 2017. However, there has been no assessment of what happens to synapses or astrocyte morphology when all three major forms of neuroligins within astrocytes (isoforms 1-3) are deleted using a well characterized, astrocyte specific, and inducible cre line. By using such selective mouse genetic methods, the authors here show that astrocytic neuroligin 1-3 expression in astrocytes is not consequential for synapse function or for astrocyte morphology. They reach these conclusions with careful experiments employing quantitative western blot analyses, imaging and electrophysiology. They also characterize the specificity of the cre line they used. Overall, this is a very clear and strong paper that is supported by rigorous experiments. The discussion considers the findings carefully in relation to past work. This paper is of high importance, because it now raises the fundamental question of exactly what neuroligins 1-3 are actually doing in astrocytes. In addition, it enriches our understanding of the mechanisms by which astrocytes participate in synapse formation and function. The paper is very clear, well written and well illustrated with raw and average data.</p>

<p>In the present manuscript, Golf et al. investigate the consequences of astrocyte-specific deletion of Neuroligin (Nlgn) family cell adhesion proteins on synapse structure and function in the brain. Decades of prior research had shown that Neuroligins mediate their effects at synapses through their role in the postsynaptic compartment of neurons and their transsynaptic interaction with presynaptic Neurexins. More recently, it was proposed for the first time that Neuroligins expressed by astrocytes can also bind to presynaptic Neurexins to regulate synaptogenesis (Stogsdill et al. 2017, Nature). However, several aspects of the model proposed by Stogsdill et al. on astrocytic Neuroligin function conflict with prior evidence on the role of Neuroligins at synapse, prompting Golf et al. to further investigate astrocytic Neuroligin function in the current study. Using postnatal conditional deletion of Nlgn1-3 specifically from astrocytes in mice, Golf et al. show that virtually no changes in the expression of synaptic proteins or in the properties of synaptic transmission at either excitatory or inhibitory synapses are observed. Moreover, no alterations in the morphology of astrocytes themselves were found. To further extend this finding, the authors additionally analyzed human neurons co-cultured with mouse glia lacking expression of Nlgn1-4. No difference in excitatory synaptic transmission was observed between neurons cultured in the presence of wildtype vs. Nlgn1-4 conditional knockout glia. The authors conclude that while Neuroligins are indeed expressed in astrocytes and are hence likely to play some role there, this role does not include any direct consequences on synaptic structure and function, in direct contrast to the model proposed by Stogsdill et al.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a strong study that addresses a fundamental and highly relevant question in the field of synaptic neuroscience. Neuroligins are not only key regulators of synaptic function, they have also been linked to numerous psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting the need to precisely define their mechanisms of action. The authors take a wide range of approaches to convincingly demonstrate that under their experimental conditions, Nlgn1-3 are efficiently deleted from astrocytes in vivo, and that this deletion does not lead to major alterations in the levels of synaptic proteins or in synaptic transmission at excitatory or inhibitory synapses, or in the morphology of astrocytes. The authors have conducted an elegant and compelling analysis demonstrating efficient deletion of astrocytic Nlgn1-3, with deletion rates of 83-96% for Nlgn2 and Nlgn3, and 65-72% for Nlgn1. While the co-culture experiments provide additional support, they are not essential as the in vivo data on astrocytic Nlgn1-3 deletion are compelling on their own. Together, the data from this study provide compelling and important evidence that, whatever the role of astrocytic Neuroligins may be, they do not contribute substantially to synapse formation or function under the conditions investigated.</p>

<p>All of my concerns have been satisfactorily addressed.</p>
<p>
The authors have fully addressed my concerns, and have in particular conducted a very elegant and compelling analysis of the degree of deletion of astrocytic Nlgn1-3/4 in their models. This greatly strengthens the main claims of their study and the fundamental nature of their conclusions for the field of synapse biology.</p>
<p>
Regarding the co-culture experiments, while I was initially concerned about the lack of controls demonstrating that glia affect synapse formation in human neurons, the authors have appropriately addressed this by clarifying the missing references and explaining that their culture system has been extensively validated in previous studies. Since the data on astrocytic Nlgn1-3 deletion in vivo are compelling on their own, the co-culture experiment provides useful additional support for the main conclusions.</p>
<p>
The authors have also added the mouse strain background information to the methods section as requested, which is important for interpreting potential differences with other studies.</p>

<p>Astrocytes are known to express neuroligins 1-3. Within neurons, these cell adhesion molecules perform important roles in synapse formation and function. Within astrocytes, a significant role for neuroligin 2 in determining excitatory synapse formation and astrocyte morphology was shown in 2017. However, there has been no assessment of what happens to synapses or astrocyte morphology when all three major forms of neuroligins within astrocytes (isoforms 1-3) are deleted using a well characterized, astrocyte specific, and inducible cre line. By using such selective mouse genetic methods, the authors here show that astrocytic neuroligin 1-3 expression in astrocytes is not consequential for synapse function or for astrocyte morphology. They reach these conclusions with careful experiments employing quantitative western blot analyses, imaging and electrophysiology. They also characterize the specificity of the cre line they used. Overall, this is a very clear and strong paper that is supported by rigorous experiments. The discussion considers the findings carefully in relation to past work. This paper is of high importance, because it now raises the fundamental question of exactly what neuroligins 1-3 are actually doing in astrocytes. In addition, it enriches our understanding of the mechanisms by which astrocytes participate in synapse formation and function. The paper is very clear, well written and well illustrated with raw and average data.</p>

Together, the data from this study provide compelling and important evidence that, whatever the role of astrocytic Neuroligins may be, they do not contribute substantially to synapse formation or function under the conditions investigated.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors have fully addressed my concerns, and have in particular conducted a very elegant and compelling analysis of the degree of deletion of astrocytic Nlgn1-3/4 in their models. This greatly strengthens the main claims of their study and the fundamental nature of their conclusions for the field of synapse biology.</p>
<p>I am somewhat less convinced by the newly added experiment to investigate deletion of Nlgns1-4 from glia in glia-neuron co-cultures. The authors provide no evidence to show that either WT or cKO glia have any effect on synapse formation or function in human neurons, and therefore, the current lack of a difference could equally result from the fact that both WT and cKO glia were non-functional altogether. The authors cite two studies to state that human neurons do not form synapses in the absence of astrocytes, Zhang et al. 2013 and Huang et al. 2017, but neither seem to be listed in the references (unless Zhang et al. 2014 was meant), making it difficult to assess the relevance of these data. However, since the data on astrocytic Nlgn1-3 deletion in vivo are compelling on their own, I do not see the co-culture experiment as essential for the main conclusions of the study.</p>
<p>Minor comment:</p>
<p>Please add the information on the strain background of the mice to the methods section of the manuscript. Strain background can have a significant impact on many aspects of neuronal function, and this information is therefore essential for the interpretation of potential differences to other studies.</p>

<p>We deeply apologize for forgetting to include the two important references mentioned by the reviewer in the reference list. We understand that the reviewer as a result could not assess the validity of our statement that co-culture of glia is required for efficient synapse formation by human neurons that are induced from ES or iPS cells. Note that this conclusion does not postulate that all synapse formation requires glia, since the cited papers demonstrate that human neurons induced by our protocol still form scarce synapses without glia. This observation has been confirmed in many different experiments that were performed after the data presented in the cited papers. As a result of this extensive prior documentation that human neurons produced by forced expression of Ngn2 require coculture of glia for efficient synapse formation, we do not feel that we need to repeat this basic characterization of our culture system again to validate multiple previous papers and hope the reviewer will concur. We have additionally added the relevant mouse strain information to the methods section.</p>
