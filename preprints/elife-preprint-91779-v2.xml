<title>Abstract</title><p>Heterotopic ossification (HO) occurs following mechanical trauma and burns, or congenitally in patients suffering from fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Recently, we demonstrated that inhibitors of phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3Kα) may be a useful therapy for patients undergoing HO. In this study, using the already marketed BYL719/Alpelisib/Piqray drug, we have further confirmed these results, detailed the underlying mechanisms of action, and optimized the timing of the administration of BYL719. We found that BYL719 effectively prevents HO even when administered up to three to seven days after injury. We demonstrate in cell cultures and in a mouse model of HO that the major actions of BYL719 are on-target effects through the inhibition of PI3Kα, without directly affecting ACVR1 or FOP-inducing ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> kinase activities. <italic>In vivo</italic>, we found that a lack of PI3Kα in progenitors at injury sites is sufficient to prevent HO. Moreover, time course assays in HO lesions demonstrate that BYL719 not only blocks osteochondroprogenitor specification, but also reduces the inflammatory response. BYL719 inhibits the migration, proliferation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in monocytes and mast cells, suggesting that BYL719 hampers the hyper-inflammatory status of HO lesions. Altogether, these results highlight the potential of PI3Kα inhibition as a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for HO.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We have performed additional experiments regarding the effects on proliferation and differentiation of additional cell types in the muscle, such as myogenic and mesenchymal progenitors as well as chondrogenesis in parental hMSCs that did not express exogenous ACVR1. Moreover, we performed all the chondrogenic experiments with addition of TGFβ in the differentiation media and analyzed chondrogenesis by both Alcian blue staining and qPCR analysis of gene markers (Sox9, Acan, Col2a1 and Mmp3). We also extended our RNA-seq analysis and included new data using both hMSCs expression wild type or R206H ACVR1 receptor, with or without different ACVR1 ligands (BMP6 and Activin A) and treated or not with the inhibitor BYL719. The new data suggests that BYL719 is able to inhibit the expression of genes involved in ossification and osteoblast differentiation irrespective of the presence of the mutation. We also discuss the effect of BYL719 in mTOR signaling.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a disorder characterized by ectopic bone formation at extraskeletal sites, including skeletal muscle and connective tissues. Trauma-induced HO develops as a common post-operative complication after orthopedic surgeries (e.g., hip arthroplasty), blast injuries, deep burns and nervous system injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to trauma-induced HO, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare congenital autosomal dominant disorder also involving HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bravenboer et al., 2015</xref>). Ectopic bones form progressively through endochondral ossification, mostly in episodic flare-ups associated with inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Towler and Shore, 2022</xref>). These cumulative osteogenic events lead to reduced mobility resulting from ankylosing joints. Affected individuals have a shorter life-span, most commonly due to thoracic insufficiency syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaplan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Pignolo et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>HO reflects a shift from a normal tissue repair process to an aberrant reactivation of bone-forming developmental programs that require acute inflammation and the excessive expansion of local progenitors, followed by inappropriate differentiation of these progenitors into chondroblasts and osteoblasts which finally results in bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). In both trauma-induced HO and FOP, pathology appears following the excessive activation of receptors sensitive to Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). FOP arises from gain-of-function mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor <italic>ACVR1</italic>, with the most common mutation being c.617G&gt;A, R206H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shore et al., 2006</xref>). Higher SMAD1/5 mediated signaling of mutated ACVR1 has been partially attributed to a loss of auto-inhibition of the receptor and mild hypersensitivity to BMP ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chaikuad et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Groppe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Van Dinther et al., 2010</xref>). Signaling by mutated ACVR1 still relies on ligand-induced heterotetrameric clustering but, unlike wild type ACVR1, does not require ACVR2A/B kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agnew et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ramachandran et al., 2021</xref>). More importantly, mutated ACVR1 receptors alter their signaling specificity, abnormally activating SMAD1/5 and altering the non-canonical BMP signals (e.g., p38 or PI3K) in response to activin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Valer et al., 2019a</xref>). Accordingly, evidence supports that activin A is necessary and sufficient for HO in FOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, activin A does not drive post-traumatic HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>), and non-genetically-driven HO mostly arises from excessive BMP and TGFβ signaling, with functional redundancy between different type I receptors of the TGFβ-superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agarwal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence points to mesenchymal fibroadipogenic precursors (FAPs), which are widely distributed in muscle and other connective tissues, as the key cell-of-origin that aberrantly undergo chondrogenesis and further ectopic bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Dey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Eisner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>). However, both FOP or non-genetic HO also require local tissue destruction and inflammation, which indicate that FAPs should be invariably primed for ectopic bone formation by this inflammatory microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsuo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Pignolo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Inflammation in HO is characterized by an initial acute response following injury with the activation of innate immunity and the influx of neutrophils and monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, B and T cells of the adaptive system are also recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>). However, mice lacking B or T lymphocytes exhibited no delay in the development of heterotopic ossification (HO) after injury, indicating that these cells may play a subsequent role in the dissemination of bone lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kan et al., 2009</xref>). During intermediate and late inflammatory stages, the recruitment of monocytes, macrophages and mast cells occurs, which in turn exerts autocrine and paracrine effects on nearby FAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tu et al., 2022</xref>). Highlighting their relevance in HO, the depletion of mast cells and macrophages profoundly impairs genetic and non-genetic HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Torossian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tu et al., 2022</xref>). BMP receptors are robustly expressed in monocytes and macrophages and the expression of <italic>ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> has been shown to extend inflammatory responses in patient-derived macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matsuo et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">2019</xref>). Among the plethora of cytokines secreted by monocytes, macrophages and mast cells, both activin A and TGF-β stand out as extremely relevant for HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alessi Wolken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Genetic and pharmacological studies have indicated that osteochondroprogenitor specification and maturation depend on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-α (PI3Kα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ford-Hutchinson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Fujita et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gámez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ikegami et al., 2011</xref>). We found that PI3K signaling was also linked to HO, since inhibitors of PI3Kα (BYL719/Alpelisib/Piqray) prevented HO in mouse models without major side-effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Valer et al., 2019a</xref>). Mechanistically, PI3Kα inhibitors hamper canonical and non-canonical BMP signaling, decreasing total and phosphorylated SMAD1/5 levels and reducing transcriptional responsiveness to BMPs/Activin A in mesenchymal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gámez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Valer et al., 2019b</xref>). In the current study, we demonstrate that the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PI3Kα in HO progenitors at injury sites reduces HO <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, envisioning a future translation into the clinic, we have optimized the administration of BYL719 and found that the delayed administration of BYL719, up to seven days after inflammatory injury, still prevents HO in mice. In addition, we found that BYL719 blocks osteochondroprogenitor specification and effectively reduces the essential inflammatory response. Altogether, the data presented here show the potent therapeutic effect of PI3Kα inhibition on HO in mouse models.</p>

<title>Delayed initiation of treatment with PI3K<bold><italic><sub>α</sub></italic></bold> inhibitor effectively prevents heterotopic ossification</title>
<p>Heterotopic ossification takes place following a precise temporal pattern of progenitor activation and the recruitment of distinct cell types at the ossification centers which causes early divergence from the normal skeletal muscle repair program. We previously found that the pharmacological administration of BYL719 prevents HO in a mouse model of HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Valer et al., 2019a</xref>). Given that BYL719 is marketed for the treatment of cancer and overgrowth syndrome, it is a promising therapeutic molecule in pathological HO. To further determine a potential therapeutic window for BYL719 and better understand the cellular targets of BYL719, we evaluated the effect of BYL719 when administered intermittently and several days after HO induction. For this, we used a conditional mouse model (<italic>ACVR1<sup>Q207Dfl/fl</sup>)</italic> in which we combine the overexpression of Cre recombinase through adenoviral particles with the injection of cardiotoxin intramuscularly in the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fukuda et al., 2006</xref>). In this model, we administered intermittently BYL719 (i.p. 25 mg/kg) or vehicle control starting one, three or seven days after HO induction. We also implemented a different administration regimen of BYL719 only for the initial three days following the injury (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). None of the treatments led to significant changes in mouse body weight (Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1). HO volume was analyzed by micro computed tomography (µCT) twenty-three days post-injury. The early administration of the treatment with BYL719 at day one or three after the onset of HO resulted in significantly lower HO; late administration seven days after the induction of HO was also partially effective (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Discontinuation of the treatment after three days did not prevent HO at day 23. These results indicate that the inhibition of PI3Kα by BYL719 after injury prevents HO and this protection is still effective if the treatment is started several days after injury, expanding its therapeutic window.</p>

<title>Deficiency of PI3K<bold><italic><sub>α</sub></italic></bold> at injury sites is sufficient to partially prevent heterotopic ossification</title>
<p>Since other small molecules designed to target PI3Kα have reported partial off-target effects on kinases other than PI3Kα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Furet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>), we aimed to confirm that the results obtained with BYL719 were due to the specific inhibition of PI3Kα. Therefore, we developed a conditional mouse model (<italic>ACVR1<sup>Q207Dfl/fl</sup>:p110</italic>α<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) in which the Cre recombinase simultaneously drives the expression of <italic>ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup></italic> and the deletion of the catalytic subunit of PI3Kα (<italic>p110</italic>α) upon intramuscular hindlimb combined injection of adenovirus-Cre and cardiotoxin to trigger HO. With this approach, Cre mediates the expression of ACVR1 <italic><sup>Q207D</sup></italic> and the deletion of PI3Kα in the same cells, whereas cells recruited afterwards will remain wild type for both genes. As expected, µCT analysis performed 23 days after injury showed extensive HO in mice expressing ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup>, which was prevented by intermittent treatment with BYL719 initiated one day after injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>). Genetic deletion of <italic>p110</italic>α in mice expressing ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup> led to a reduction in HO, which was further enhanced by BYL719 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Importantly, no significant changes in the weight of the mice were observed, confirming the absence of severe toxicity (Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1A). Histomorphometrically, ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup> mice wild type for PI3Kα developed islands and/or bone spurs with a well-organized bone structure. However, in PI3Kα deficient mice ACVR1<sup>Q207D</sup> expression only led to minor ectopic calcifications that were already surrounded by fully regenerated muscle tissue on the 23<sup>rd</sup> day after injury (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1B, Figure 2-Figure Supplement 2). Accordingly, analysis of the ratio bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV) and the correlation between bone volume and BV/TV of individual mice was clearly different between <italic>p110</italic>α genotypes, irrespective of BYL719 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1C). These results demonstrate that the abrogation of PI3Kα activity (either genetic of pharmacologically) in cells at injury sites is relevant for their inhibitory effects in HO. This might be attributed to the direct effects of BYL719 on progenitor cell expansion and chondroblast specification, as well as its possible ability to reduce the inflammatory response required for HO.</p>

<title>Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PI3K<bold><italic><sub>α</sub></italic></bold> prevents osteochondroprogenitor specification</title>
<p>Next, we aimed to assess the effects of PI3Kα inhibition in osteochondroprogenitor cells. For this, we isolated bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) from <italic>p110</italic>α<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice and transduced them <italic>ex-vivo</italic> with retrovirus expressing <italic>Acvr1</italic> (<italic>wild type</italic> and <italic>R206H</italic>) with or without Cre recombinase. The gene expression levels of exogenous mRNA of <italic>Acvr1</italic> and <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic>was similar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). As anticipated, transduction with Cre viruses significantly reduced the expression levels of p110α to approximately 40%. This is consistent with an estimated transduction efficiency of nearly 60% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The overexpression of <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic> increased basal and activin-dependent expression of canonical (<italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Sp7</italic>) and activin-dependent expression of non-canonical (<italic>Ptgs2</italic>) BMP target genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), known markers and drivers of osteochondrogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Nakashima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Both pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PI3Kα reduced canonical and non-canonical ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> transcriptional responses induced by activin A. Of note, stimulation with activin A increased its own transcription (<italic>Inhba</italic>) in <italic>Acvr1<sup>R206H</sup></italic>-transduced BM-MSCs, which was also inhibited by BYL719 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, BYL719 may also prevent osteochondroprogenitor differentiation indirectly, via transcriptional inhibition of <italic>INHBA</italic>/Activin A expression. These results demonstrate a direct effect of BYL719 on osteochondroprogenitor cells and suggest that the effects of BYL719 on ACVR1-downstream signaling are mainly on target, due to PI3Kα kinase inhibition.</p>

<p>It is known that 2-aminothiazole-derived PI3Kα inhibitors could also inhibit ACVR1 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we investigated whether BYL719 effects could be explained by the reduction in ACVR1 kinase activity. For this, we made use of a kinase target engagement approach. Upon transient transfection of Nanoluciferase-tagged TGF-β receptors, we incubated the cells with BYL719 and/or an ATP-like tracer analogue. In the absence of an ATP competitor molecule, the tracer analogue and Nanoluciferase enzyme stay in close proximity, thereby allowing for bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between the Nanoluciferase (energy donor, emitting at 460 nm) and the tracer analogue (energy acceptor) Once excited, the acceptor molecule emits fluorescence (610 nm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). BYL719 incubated at 1 and 10 µM failed to significantly inhibit the acceptor emission of the BMP type I receptors ACVRL11, ACVR1, BMPR1A, ACVR1B, TGFBR1 and the mutant receptor ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), without significant changes in the protein levels of each receptor (Figure 4-Figure Supplement 1).In addition, we demonstrated that BYL719 does not target the activity of the type II kinase receptors ACVR2A, ACVR2B, BMPR2 and TGFBR2. We confirmed these results using <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase activity assays with recombinant ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup>. BYL719 exhibited no major effects on ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> activity up to 10µM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Given that BYL719 does not directly target the activity of ACVR1 or related receptors, we established an <italic>in vitro</italic> model using human MSCs (hMSCs) stably overexpressing ACVR1 or ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> to profile further the main targeted pathways. In this model, recombinant Activin A was able to induce SMAD1/5 activation and the expression of ACVR1 downstream targets <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID3</italic> in cells over-expressing ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (Figure 5-Figure Supplement 1A and B). We performed micromass chondrogenic differentiation assays in differentiation media supplemented with TGFβ1, with or without activin A and BYL719 in parental cells and cells transduced with ACVR1<sup>WT</sup> or ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup>. Coincubation with BYL719 (10 μM) completely inhibited the formation of a chondrogenic glycosaminoglycans-rich matrix in response to TGFβ1 plus activin A in the different cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref>) and partially abrogated the expression of the chondrogenic genes <italic>ACAN</italic> and <italic>MMP13</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results confirmed that BYL719 could inhibit chondrogenic differentiation of parental hMSCs and also the chondrogenic specification irrespective of the expression of either wild type or mutant ACVR1.. Furthermore, in these cells, coincubation with BYL719 (10 μM) was able to repress Activin A-induced alkaline phosphatase activity upon 7 and 11 days of culture, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">E</xref>).</p>

<p>To further identify the effects of BYL719, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (GSE237512) where we preincubated hMSCs-ACVR1<sup>WT</sup> or hMSCs-ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> with or without BYL719 for 30 minutes, which was followed by stimulation with two high affinity ligands for ACVR1, Activin A (50ng/ml) or BMP6 (50ng/ml) for 1 hour (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with our results on osteogenic progenitor cells, gene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes between cells expressing ACVR1<sup>WT</sup> and ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> resulted in the robust regulation of relevant biological processes. Ossification (GO:0001503) and osteoblast differentiation (GO:0001649) were detected as two of the ten most significantly differentially regulated biological processes between these conditions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>).

<p>When comparing gene expressions profiles between ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> treated with Activin A, with or without BYL719, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of our GO terms of interest showed negative normalized enrichment scores, consistent with our gene ontology analysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). By looking at the leading edge we could investigate the most relevant genes within these GO terms, which included relevant genes of these pathways such as <italic>PTGS2</italic>, <italic>MSX2</italic>, <italic>SOX9</italic>, and <italic>BMP2</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, several inflammatory cytokine genes (e.g. <italic>IL6</italic> and <italic>IL15</italic>) and inflammatory signaling pathways (e.g. TNF and NFκB), were downregulated by BYL719 (Figure 6-Figure Supplement 1A and B). Therefore, we hypothesized that, in addition to preventing the activation of osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation pathways in progenitor cells, part of the mechanism by which BYL719 prevents HO in vivo may be due to the modulation of inflammatory responses.</p>

<title>PI3K<bold><italic><sub>α</sub></italic></bold> inhibition reduces proliferation, migration and inflammatory cytokine expression in monocytes, macrophages and mast cells</title>
<p>Next, we used several models of disease-relevant immune cells to study the effect of pharmacological PI3Kα inhibition. Activation of ACVR1 signaling with BMP6 did not significantly modify the proliferation rate of any of the cell lines tested, that is, monocytes (THP1), macrophages (RAW264.7) and mast cells (HMC1) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">C</xref>). However, incubation with BYL719 in vitro strongly reduced their growth rate at 2µM and almost completely arrested their proliferation at 10µM. It is well known that monocytes are actively recruited from circulation to the ossification sites early after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>). We also examined the effects of BYL719 in proliferation in additional cell types involved in HO, such as myoblast and mesenchymal progenitors. BYL719 reduced the proliferation of myoblast and mesenchymal progenitors <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Figure Supplement 1 A and B). However, the reduction in the proliferation did not reach the extent observed in monocytes or macrophages. We expanded our analysis by interrogating chemotactic migration of monocytes in transwell assays. Whereas monocytes actively migrated towards FBS as a chemotactic agent, the incubation of monocytes with BYL719 deeply diminished their migratory ability (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that BYL719 is able to diminish monocyte recruitment, while reducing also the expansion of inflammatory cells at injury sites.</p>

<p>Upon tissue injury, a multitude of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are released at the site of injury. This triggers the recruitment and infiltration of various cell types, including immune cells and osteochondrogenic progenitors. We examined the expression of distinct cytokines upon ACVR1 stimulation with BMP6 in the presence of BYL719 in monocytic, macrophagic and mast cell lines. In monocytes, BYL719 inhibited the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>TNF-</italic>α and the expression of activin A (<italic>INHBA</italic>), whereas the expression of transforming growth factor <italic>TGF-</italic>β<italic>1</italic> was increased by BMP6 and not modified by the addition BYL719 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). <italic>CCL2</italic> (MCP-1), a chemokine inducing the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages into inflamed tissues as well as the M2 polarization of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sierra-Filardi et al., 2014</xref>), was significantly induced by BMP6 and partially reduced by BYL719 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). In macrophages, BYL719 reduced the expression of pan-macrophage markers <italic>Adgre1</italic> (F4/80), <italic>Cd68</italic> and the M1 macrophage marker <italic>Cd80</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Conversely, BYL719 increased the expression of the M2 macrophage marker <italic>Il10</italic>, regardless of the presence or absence of BMP6. In the human mast cell line HMC1, BYL719 inhibited the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine <italic>IL6</italic>, while the expression of <italic>TGFβ1</italic>, <italic>TNFα</italic>, and activin A (<italic>INHBA</italic>) remained unchanged upon the addition of either BMP6 or BYL719 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). We also analyzed the effects of BYL719 on myogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Addition of 2 or 10µM BYL719 was able to abolish the expression of the myogenic markers <italic>MyoD1</italic> and myosin heavy-chain 1 (<italic>Myh1</italic>) while barely altering the expression of the myofibroblast marker α-SMA (<italic>Acta2</italic>) (Figure 7-Figure Supplement 1C). Similarly, BYL719 (at 2 or 10µM) was able to block formation of myotubes after 7 days of myogenic differentiation <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure 7-Figure Supplement 1D). Altogether, these data suggest that PI3Kα inhibition reduces the expression of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines and might skew macrophages towards M2. Moreover, even though these results should be further validated in cells carrying mutated ACVR1, the reduction on activin A expression by BYL719 observed in inflammatory cells and mesenchymal progenitors could be relevant for HO in FOP.</p>

<title>PI3K<bold><italic><sub>α</sub></italic></bold> inhibition reduces the hyperinflammatory response in heterotopic ossification</title>
<p>To confirm whether BYL719 can modulate excessive inflammation at the injured sites, we examined its impact on monocytes, macrophages and mast cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. These cell populations are known to increase in number two to four days after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>), which coincides with the effects observed following early administration of BYL719. Hindlimb muscle samples were collected at two, four, nine, sixteen and twenty-three days post-induction of HO with Cre viruses and cardiotoxin in <italic>ACVR1<sup>Q207Dfl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). The group of treated animals received BYL719 intermittent treatment starting one day after injury. After sixteen days, structures of mineralized bone became detectable in vehicle-treated mice (Figure 8-Figure Supplement 1A and B). The number of F4/80-positive monocytes/macrophages was high two days after injury and remained elevated in the HO lesions throughout the ossification process (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). BYL719-treated animals showed an almost 50% reduction in the number of F4/80 positive cells at day two post-injury onwards. Consistent with previous studies, we observed an increased number of mast cells at injury sites. Their numbers peaked at four days and only dropped twenty-three days after injury in vehicle-treated mice (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). In BYL719-treated mice, mast cells were increased up to day 9, but their number was completely normalized to preinjury levels already at day 16 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). This observation is consistent with the complete muscle regeneration observed in BYL719-treated mice compared to untreated mice, which are actively developing ossifications at that time (Figure 8-Figure Supplement 2). These results confirm a functionally relevant dual role of PI3Kα inhibition, by preventing the differentiation of osteochondrogenic progenitor cells and also by reducing the local inflammatory response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We previously showed that pharmacological PI3Kα inhibition using BYL719 has the potential to suppress HO by increasing SMAD1/5 degradation, reducing transcriptional responsiveness to BMPs, and blocking non-canonical responses such as the activation of AKT/mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Valer et al., 2019a</xref>). In this manuscript, we confirmed these results through both pharmacological and genetic approaches, and further expanded the insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of PI3K inhibition. Here, we optimized the therapeutic window for BYL719 administration and found that the delayed administration of BYL719 effectively prevents HO. Moreover, in vivo simultaneous genetic inhibition of <italic>p110</italic>α and the activation of mutated <italic>ACVR1</italic> at injury sites partially prevents HO, and we demonstrate that inhibition of PI3Kα inhibits osteochondroprogenitor specification. We determined that BYL719 does not inhibit recombinant ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> kinase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and does not behave as an ATP competitor inhibitor for none of the TGF-β receptor kinases. Finally, the administration of BYL719 prevented an exacerbated inflammatory response in vivo, possibly due to specific effects observed on immune cell populations.</p>
<p>While FAPs play a key role in bone formation in different types of HO, inflammation is also closely associated with all types of HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>; de Ruiter et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Matsuo et al., 2019</xref>). For instance, the depletion of mast cells and macrophages has been shown to reduce bone volume in FOP mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Convente et al., 2018</xref>. Moreover, Activin A, TGF-β and other cytokines secreted by FAPs, monocytes, macrophages and mast cells are essential for FOP and non-genetic HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alessi Wolken et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hatsell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lees-Shepard et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Patel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Upadhyay et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, ACVR1 antibodies can activate ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> even in the absence of Activin A, but muscular trauma is still required to induce HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aykul et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lees-Shepard et al., 2022</xref>), indicating the involvement of additional immune factors. Our study finds that BYL719, a PI3Kα inhibitor, reduces the expression of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines, effectively blocks the proliferation of monocytes, macrophages and mast cells and reduces the migratory potential of monocytes. This likely contributes to a decreased number of monocytes and macrophages at injury sites and throughout the in vivo ossification process. It is known that excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, including activin A, by monocytes and macrophages is observed in all types of HO and is induced by ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Matsuo et al., 2021</xref>). Non-canonical signaling pathways (mTOR, p38, TAK1, NF-κB) are also affected by ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> in immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barruet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). M1-type macrophages initiate acute inflammatory responses but later transition to M2-type macrophages associated with anti-inflammatory and reparative functions. Therefore, modulating macrophage phenotype towards regeneration may dampen HO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sorkin et al., 2020</xref>). BYL719 reduces monocyte/macrophage numbers, migration, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, potentially altering their polarization. It also reduces activin A expression and promotes a shift towards the M2 phenotype. BYL719 can help to reduce the hyper-inflammatory state in HO, inhibit FAP expansion, and favor myogenic regeneration of muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Stanley et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Our observation that the delayed administration of BYL719 is still effective has pathophysiological and therapeutic derivatives. Muscle injury in mice induces sequential changes in HO progression: early immune cell infiltration (days 1-3), a fibroproliferative and late inflammatory phase, with an expansion of FAPs and a spectrum of monocytes, macrophages and mast cells as highly secretory cells (days 3-7), followed by chondrogenesis (day 7-14) and osteogenesis (days 14-23) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). Starting BYL719 administration 3 days post-injury is still fully therapeutically effective and even partially at 7 days post-injury. In addition, whereas untreated mice developed cartilage and bony lesions by days 9 and 16 post-injury, respectively, BYL719-treated animals fully regenerated muscle by day 16 post-injury. Altogether, this evidence suggests that the major effects of BYL719 occur between 3 and 16 days post-injury. We found that BYL719 completely blocks chondrogenesis in cultured hMSCs. In addition, in the histological analyses of these BYL719-treated mice that do not develop HO, we cannot find any sign of cartilage formation on either the 9<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup> or 23<sup>rd</sup> days post-injury, which confirms that BYL719 is also able to block chondrogenesis in mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. This suggests that intervention with BYL719 over a temporal window after a HO flare might be sufficient to inhibit endochondral ossification. In addition, although surgical resection is not recommended in FOP patients and has a risk of recurrence in resected non-genetic HO, it could be envisaged using as preventive therapy in subjects undergoing surgeries to remove ectopic bone.</p>
<p>Treatment options for HO and FOP are currently limited, primarily consisting of anti-inflammatories such as corticosteroids and NSAIDs. Promising pharmacological treatments have progressed to II/III clinical trials. Palovarotene, a retinoic acid receptor-γ agonist, has been approved in Canada and U.S.A. for patients over 10 years old (NCT03312634). However, a previous clinical trial with palovarotene was paused for children due to concerns about premature growth plate closure, which is debated in FOP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rosen et al., 2018</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chakkalakal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rosen et al., 2018</xref>). Antibodies targeting activin A (Garetosmab) showed effectiveness, but serious adverse effects led to a temporary hold on the trial (NCT03188666). The outcome of a clinical trial with Rapamycin has not been publicly disclosed and a case report indicated limited benefits in classical FOP patients (UMIN000028429) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kaplan et al., 2018</xref>). BYL719 (Alpelisib/Piqray®) was recently licensed in combination with hormone therapy for a PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cardoso et al., 2020</xref>). BYL719 has been shown to be also clinically effective in adult patients with PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome (PROS) and children under 1 year of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Madsen and Semple, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Morin et al., 2022</xref>). In both scenarios, BYL719 had no major adverse effect when patients were treated for more than one year (in adults at a dose of 300mg daily for oncological or PROS purposes and at a dose of 25 mg daily in infants with PROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Morin et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, implementing BYL719 for treatment of HO, at least during a restricted temporal window (i.e. surgery to remove ectopic bone in HO, or during flare-ups in FOP individuals), might be a valid therapeutic option for FOP patients.</p>

<title>Murine bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells isolation</title>
<p>Murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) were isolated from 6-8 weeks-old C57BL6/J mice for the floxed p110α allele (Beatriz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gámez et al., 2016</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Soleimani and Nadri, 2009</xref>). Mice were euthanized and femurs were dissected and stored in DMEM with 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). Soft tissues were cleaned and femur ends were cut under sterile conditions. Bone marrow was flushed with media using a 27-gauge needle. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer and seeded in a 100-mm cell culture dish. Non-adherent cells were discarded after 3 hours. Media was slowly replaced every 12 hours for up to 72 hours. Then, media was replaced every 2 days until the culture reached 70% confluence. Then, cells were lifted by incubation with 0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA for 5 minutes at room temperature. Lifted cells were cultured and expanded.</p>

<title>Production of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) expressing ACVR1</title>
<p>For chondrogenic differentiation and RNA sequencing, bone marrow-derived human MSCs were transduced by lentiviral delivery encoding ACVR1<sup>WT</sup> or ACVR1<sup>R206H</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Van Dinther et al., 2010</xref>).

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> insights by demonstrating that BYL719 is a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of heterotopic ossification (HO), with inhibition of PI3Ka via BYL719 appearing to be a critical factor. However, the results of the study are <bold>incomplete</bold> because BYL719 affects multiple intracellular signaling pathways beyond PI3Ka, and it thus remains uncertain whether BYL719 attenuates HO exclusively through suppression of the PI3Ka pathway or through modulation of alternative signaling pathways. A detailed elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of action of BYL719 is essential for a thorough understanding of its effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors examined the possibility of using phosphatidyl-inositol kinase 3-kinase alpha (PI3Ka) inhibitors for heterotopic ossification (HO) in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). Administration of BYL719, a chemical inhibitor of PI3Ka, prevented HO in a mouse model of FOP that expressed a mutated ACVR1 receptor. Genetic ablation of PI3Ka (p110a) also suppressed HO in mice. BYL719 blocked osteochondroprogenitor specification and reduced inflammatory responses, such as pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and migration/proliferation of immune cells. The authors claimed that inhibition of PI3Ka is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for HO.</p>
<p>This is a revision of the original manuscript by Valer et al. The authors performed new experiments and added those data to the manuscript to respond to this reviewer's comments and questions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Now it became clear that BYL719 inhibited the multiple signaling pathways in multiple types of cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, it was not clear the critical role of PI3K in the inhibition of HO by this compound.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors in this study previously reported that BYL719, an inhibitor of PI3Kα, suppressed heterotopic ossification in mice model of a human genetic disease, fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive, which is caused by the activation of mutant ACVR1/R206H by Activin A. The aim of this study is to identify the mechanism of BYL719 for the inhibition of heterotopic ossification. They found that BYL719 suppressed heterotopic ossification in two ways: one is to inhibit the specification of precursor cells for chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation and the other is to suppress the activation of inflammatory cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is based on authors' previous reports and the experimental procedures including the animal model are established. In addition, to confirm the role of PI3Kα, authors used the conditional knock-out mice of the subunit of PI3Kα. They clearly demonstrated the evidence indicating that the targets of PI3Kα are not members of TGFBR by a newly established experimental method.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the presented data were closely related to those previously published by authors' group or others and there were very few new findings. The molecular mechanisms through which BYL719 inhibits HO remain unclear, even in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Heterotopic ossification in the mice model was not stable and inappropriate for the scientific evaluation.</p>
<p>The method for chondrogenic differentiation was not appropriate, and the scientific evidence of successful differentiation was lacking.</p>
<p>The design of the gene expression profile comparison was not appropriate and failed to obtain the data for the main aim of this study.</p>
<p>The experiments of inflammatory cells were performed in cell lines without ACVR1/R206H mutation, and therefore the obtained data were not precisely related to the inflammation in FOP.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Our revised version of the manuscript addresses all the comments and suggestions raised, as clarified in our point-by-point answer to the reviewers. We have performed additional experiments regarding the effects on proliferation and differentiation of additional cell types in the muscle, such as myogenic and mesenchymal progenitors as well as chondrogenesis in parental hMSCs that did not express exogenous ACVR1. Moreover, as suggested by reviewer #2, we performed all the chondrogenic experiments with addition of TGFβ in the differentiation media and analyzed chondrogenesis by both Alcian blue staining and qPCR analysis of gene markers (Sox9, Acan, Col2a1 and Mmp3). We also extended our RNA-seq analysis and included new data using both hMSCs expression wild type or R206H ACVR1 receptor, with or without different ACVR1 ligands (BMP6 and Activin A) and treated or not with the inhibitor BYL719. The new data suggests that BYL719 is able to inhibit the expression of genes involved in ossification and osteoblast differentiation irrespective of the presence of the mutation. We also discuss the effect of BYL719 in mTOR signaling and addressed all the minor comments suggested by both reviewers.</p>
<p>We addressed the specific comments of the reviewers as follows:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer # 1:</bold></p>
<p>Specific points:</p>
<p>Point #1 and #2. The authors showed that BYL719 inhibited HO in FOP model mice. Did they have HO not only in the muscle but also in the bone marrow? The progenitor cells of chondrocytes and osteoblasts may differ between the muscle and bone marrow. The authors should examine the effects of BYL719 on some other types of cells in the muscle, such as myoblasts and fibro-adipogenic cells, in addition to the bone marrow-derived MSCs. Furthermore, it was unclear whether they were human or murine MSCs in the text.</p>
<p>The inhibitory effect of BYL719 on HO in FOP mice was clear, but the molecular mechanisms or target cells were still unclear because BYL719 affected multiple types of cells and molecules. The authors are encouraged to show clearer mechanisms and target cells' critical inhibition of HO. Again, this reviewer believes that in vivo and in vitro experiments using muscle and bone marrow and cells prepared from them should provide additional critical information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As detailed in the introduction, it is known that Heterotopic Ossification develops in the skeletal muscle and connective tissues. Consistent with the current knowledge of the field, none of the mice showed HO in the bone marrow. Additionally, since activation of the mutant allele is achieved by injection of CRE-expressing adenovirus and cardiotoxin in the muscle hindlimb, it is unlikely that mesenchymal progenitors in the bone marrow would be strongly affected. Interestingly, single-cell RNA sequencing from multiple mouse tissues identified a very strong transcriptional similarity between FAPs and non-muscle mesenchymal progenitors (PMID: 37599828). As suggested, we examined the effects of BYL719 in proliferation and differentiation in additional cell types such as muscle progenitors. In this new version of the manuscript, we show that BYL719 reduces the proliferation of muscle and mesenchymal progenitors while it blocks myoblast differentiation in vitro (Figure 7, Figure Supplement 1). MSCs were murine on those experiments shown in Figure 3; whereas assays shown in Figures 5 and 6 were of human origin. We have further clarified this in the respective Figure legends.</p>
<p>All the data generated strongly suggests that there is not a single mechanism supporting all the effects of BYL719 in HO. Instead, BYL719 affects multiple cell types involved in efficient HO (e.g. reduction in proliferation and osteochondrogenic specification of mesenchymal precursors (MPs), reduction on proliferation, migration, and inflammatory gene expression on monocytes, etc.). Interestingly, our data suggests that BYL719 is able to inhibit these effects on MPs and monocytes irrespective of the presence of the ACVR1-R206H mutation (Figures 5, 6 and 7). Additionally, there are several signaling mechanisms affected. BYL719 reduces SMAD1/5, p38, AKT and mTOR signaling in parental MPs or with mutations in ACVR1 (Figure 3 and our previous publication PMID: 31373426), being all these pathways required for efficient osteochondrogenic specification of MPs. We consider that the different detailed mechanisms by which BYL719 inhibits osteochondrogenic specification enhances the robustness of the findings in this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #3. In FOP model mice, ACVR1 was mutated as Q207D. However, R206H was used in in vitro experiments. Do they have the same characteristics? This reviewer would like to recommend examining the effect of BYL719 on wild-type ACVR1, R206H, and Q207D simultaneously in each experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We already performed these experiments, assaying in parallel ACVR1-WT, ACVR1-Q207D and ACVR1-R206H, in the transcriptional responses of MPs in our previous work (PMID: 31373426). Both mutations had similar responses, being ACVR1-Q207D stronger than ACVR1-R206H, as it has been shown in vivo in mouse models of HO (PMID: 34633114). In any case, BYL719 inhibits these transcriptional responses induced by both mutant alleles.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #4. Figure 5: What was the effect of BYL719 on the differentiation of parental cells that did not express exogenous ACVR1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed new assays of chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs that are shown in the new Figure 5. BYL719 inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of parental hMSCs and also inhibits chondrogenic specification irrespective of the expression of either wild type or mutant ACVR1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #5. Figure 6: In this experiment, gene expression was examined in pretreated MSCs-ALK2 (ACVR1?) R206H with and without BYL719. It was clear whether suppression of gene expression by BYL719 was specifically caused in cells expressing R206H. What were the effects of BYL719 on parental cells that did not express exogenous ACVR1?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To be consistent, we relabeled ALK2 to ACVR1 in the figure. We expanded the conditions analyzed in the RNA-sequencing. We included conditions where we activate ACVR1 (either WT or R206H) with their known physiological ligand BMP6. In both, human MSCs expressing ACVR1-R206H and human MSCs expressing Wild Type ACVR1, we observed a downregulation of differentially expressed genes upon addition of BYL719, irrespective of ligand (BMP6 or Activin A) or receptor (RH or WT) (added new Figure 6: B and C).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #6. Figure 7: BYL719 suppressed cell proliferation of all cells examined partially at 2 uM and almost completely at 10 uM, respectively. There is a possibility that BYL719 inhibits HO by inhibiting osteochondroprogenitor proliferation. The authors are encouraged to show data on the effect of BYL719 on the proliferation of other types of cells, such as myoblasts, fibro-adipogenic cells, or bone marrow cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We examined the effects of BYL719 in proliferation in additional cell types such as muscle and mesenchymal progenitors. BYL719 slightly reduced the proliferation of myoblasts and mesenchymal cells in vitro (Figure 7, Figure Supplement 1). However, the reduction in the proliferation in myoblasts or MPs did not reach the extent to that observed in monocytes or macrophages (Figure 7).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #7. Figure 8: How was the effect of BYL719 on muscle regeneration in wild-type? It was reported that mTOR signaling is important in HO in FOP. The authors are encouraged to show the effect of BYL719 on mTOR signaling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Muscle regeneration in wild-type mice has also been shown in our previous results PMID: 31373426. In addition, we included images of the muscle regeneration after 23 days of treatment with BYL719 in mice ACVR1Q207D with or without PI3Kα deletion after induction of HO in the new Figure 2, Figure Supplement 2. These mice showed full muscle regeneration or small calcifications surrounded by muscle at most. The effects of PI3Kα inhibitors, either BYL719 or A66, on mTOR signaling had been previously shown by our group (PMID: 31373426). Both inhibitors strongly reduced signaling of mTOR, visualized by activation of p70 S6-kinase, a surrogate marker of mTOR activity.</p>

<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(9) SMAD 1/5 should be SMAD1/5.</p>

<p>We introduced the suggested changes in the manuscript and Figure 6 and indicated the source of human MSCs in Materials and Methods. We also examined the levels of each receptor that are shown in the new Figure 4, Figure Supplement 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer # 2:</bold></p>
<p>Specific points:</p>
<p>Point #1. Because the involvement of PI3K in HO of FOP, was already reported by authors' group and also others (Hino et al, Clin Invest, 2017), the main purpose of this study was to disclose the mechanism of how PI3K was activated in FOP cells. In the published study (Hino et al, Clin Invest, 2017), PI3K was activated by the ENPP2-LPA-LPR cascade. Unfortunately, there were no new data for this important issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The main purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the pharmacological and genetic inhibition of PI3Kα in HO progenitors at injury sites reduces HO in vivo, to extend the insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of PI3K inhibition, and to optimize the timing of the administration of BYL719. Class I PI3Ks are heterodimers of a p110 catalytic subunit in complex with a regulatory subunit. They engage in signaling downstream of tyrosine kinases, G protein-coupled receptors and monomeric small GTPases. Therefore, a plethora of growth factors, cytokines, inflammatory agents, hormones and additional external and internal stimuli are able to activate PI3Kα (PMID: 31110302). In fact, TGF-β family members, including activin A, are able to activate PI3K and mediate some of their non-canonical responses (PMID: 19114990). Multiple factors with known increased expression in the ossifying niche in HO and FOP (e.g. activin A, TGF-β, inflammatory agents such as TNFα, IL6, IL3, etc.) are known activators of PI3K (PMID: 30429363). Interestingly, in our RNA-seq analysis in hMSCs we did not observe increased expression levels of Enpp2 when comparing wild type and R206H mutated cells treated with activin A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #2. The HO formation of ACVR1/Q207D model mice in this study is extremely unstable (Figure 1B, DMSO). Even the bone volume of some red symbols, which indicate the presence of HO, is located on the base (0.00) line. I would examine carefully the credibility of the data. Also, it is well known that the molecular behavior of mice Acvr1/Q207D and human ACVR1/R206H was different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that induction of HO is variable between mice showing variations in penetrance and intensity of the ossifying lesions. This variability is a known common trend that appears in all the models of HO published so far (e.g. PMID: 28758906, PMID: 26333933). Accordingly, we did not exclude any animal that has been injected with CRE-expressing adenovirus plus cardiotoxin in the μCT analysis. Regarding the behavior of mice Acvr1/Q207D and human ACVR1/R206H, it is well known that Q207D produces more robust and stronger responses in terms of signaling and formation of heterotopic ossification (PMID: 34633114). Therefore, reduction of HO by BYL719 would be more stringent in the Acvr1/Q207D model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #3. The experimental design of Figure 5 experiments is confusing. Although the authors mentioned that the data in Figure 5A were taken seven days after chondrogenic induction, I am skeptical whether the chondrogenic induction was successful. Based on the description of Material and Methods, the authors did not include TGFβ in their &quot;Differentiation Medium&quot;, which is an essential growth factor to induce chondrogenic differentiation of human MSC. Why did the ALP activity increase after chondrogenic induction? The authors should demonstrate the evidence of successful chondrogenic induction by showing the expression of key chondrogenic genes such as SOX9, ACAN, or COL2A1. The data in Figure 5B-E are also confusing. The addition of Activin A showed no difference between ACVR1/WT and ACVR1/R206H cells, suggesting that these cells did not reproduce the situation of FOP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed new assays of chondrogenic differentiation of hMSCs that are shown in the new Figure 5. We included TGFβ1 in the differentiation medium and also included the parental cell line in the analysis. In addition of being a marker of osteoblast differentiation, alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) has also been shown to be induced during chondroblast differentiation in vitro (PMID: 19855136; PMID: 9457080; PMID: 18377198; PMID: 23388029). Moreover, expression data of SOX9, COL2A1, ACAN and MMP13 of cells after chondrogenic differentiation is included in the new Figure 5. Expression of some markers (e.g. ACAN) are increased by the expression of ACVR1R206H, however, we did not observe significant differences in chondroblast differentiation gene expression between ACVR1wt and ACVR1R206H expressing cells. In any case, BYL719 could inhibit chondrogenic differentiation of parental hMSCs and also the chondrogenic specification irrespective of the expression of either wild type or mutant ACVR1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #4. The experimental design and data analyses of RNA-seq were inappropriate and insufficient, which is disappointing for the reviewer because this will be a key experiment in this study. Because the most important point is to identify the signal for PI3Kα induced by Activin A via ACVR1/R206H, they should also use hMSC-ACVR1/WT for this experiment. Because the authors clearly demonstrated that TGFBR were not targets of BYL719, they should compare the expression profiles between MSC-ACVR1/WT and MSC-ACVR1/WT with BYL719 to identify the targets of BYL719 unrelated to Activin A signal. Then the expression profiles of ACVR1/R206H cells treated with Activin A and Activin A plus BYL719 were compared. Among down-regulated signals by BYL719, those found also in MSC-ACVR1/WT should be discarded. It is important to investigate whether the GO term of ossification or osteoblast differentiation is found also in MSC-ACVR1/WT. If it is so, the effect of BYL719 is not specific for FOP cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We extended our RNA sequencing analysis with additional experimental conditions and comparisons. In new Figure 6, we now compare hMSCs expressing wild type or R206H receptors, with or without BYL719 inhibition, and with or without different ligand activations (BMP6 or Activin A) (New Figure 6A). New Figure 6B shows the Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed genes between cells expressing WT and RH receptors under control conditions. We can observe that ossification (GO:0001503) and osteoblast differentiation (GO:0001649) were detected within the top 10 significantly differentially regulated biological processes between these conditions. Therefore, we analyzed these relevant identified GO terms in 5 different comparisons upon GO enrichment analysis (Figure 6C). In addition to the comparison between cells expressing WT and RH receptors under control conditions explained above, we also compared cells expressing WT or RH receptor, with different ACVR1 ligands (BMP6 and Activin A), and with or without BYL719 inhibitor. The addition of BYL719 resulted in a downregulation of the GO terms “ossification” and “osteoblast differentiation” (new Figure 6C). These results confirm the inhibitory effect of BYL719 on ossification and osteoblast differentiation biological processes, and inform that this inhibitory effect remains consistent upon BMP6 or Activin A ligand activation, and with ACVR1 WT and RH expression.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Point #5. The data in Figure 7 were not related to the aim of this study because cell lines used in these experiments did not have ACVR1/R206H mutations. It is not appropriate to extrapolate these data in the FOP situation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We utilized immune cell lines where we could activate ACVR1 with their known physiological ligand BMP6. Mutated ACVR1 gains response to activin A in addition to maintaining the physiological response to BMP6 as the wild type form. Therefore, in these assays we interrogated in vitro, with addition of BMP6, the effects of BYL719 in the growth, migration and inflammatory gene expression upon conditions of activated ACVR1 receptor downstream signaling. We consider that understanding the effects of PI3Kα inhibition in the regulation of proliferation, migration and inflammatory cytokine expression in monocytes, macrophages and mast cells is essential to better define the potential outcome of BYL719 treatment for heterotopic ossifications.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) The legends for Figure 1C were those for Figure 1D, and there were no descriptions for Figure 1C in the legends and methods section. The reviewer was unable to understand the meaning of BV/TV. What is TV?</p>
<p>(2) “However, in PI3Kα deficient mice ACVR1Q207D expression only led to minor ectopic calcifications that were already surrounded by fully regenerated muscle tissue on the 23rd day after injury (Figure 2D, Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1B)&quot;: There were no histological data either Figure 2D, Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1B), which showed muscle tissues.</p>
<p>(3) &quot;The overexpression of Acvr1R206H increased basal and activin dependent expression of canonical (Id1 and Sp7) and non-canonical (Ptgs2) BMP target genes (Figure 3C),&quot;: There was no increase of Ptgs2 gene in basal level.</p>
<p>(4) Materials and Methods. Production of human fetal mesenchymal stem cells expressing ACVR1.: Is it derived from a fetus?</p>
<p>(5) Figure 6C: There was no description of the meaning of each column. What does AA mean and what is the number?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We introduced the missing information in the manuscript, Figure legends and material and methods section for points #1, 4 and 5. AA was Activin A, the number was the number of replicates. This has been detailed in the figure legend. We included images of the muscle regeneration after 23 days of treatment with BYL719 in mice after induction of HO in the new Figure 2, Figure Supplement 2 (point #2). We corrected the mistake in the manuscript refraining for suggesting increase of Ptgs2 gene expression by ACVR1-R206 at the basal level (Point #3).</p>
