<title>Abstract</title><p>Cells react to stress by triggering response pathways, leading to extensive alterations in the transcriptome to restore cellular homeostasis. The role of RNA metabolism in shaping the cellular response to stress is vital, yet the global changes in RNA stability under these conditions remain unclear. In this work, we employ direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5’ end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. By developing a statistical framework to identify robust RNA length variations in nanopore data, we find that cellular stress induces prevalent 5’ end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, we show that stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on removal of the poly(A) tail. We observed that RNAs undergoing decay are predominantly enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Inhibition of stress granule formation via genetic ablation of G3BP1 and G3BP2 fully rescues RNA length and suppresses stress-induced decay. Our findings reveal RNA decay as a key determinant of RNA metabolism upon cellular stress and dependent on stress-granule formation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells respond to stress by triggering extensive transcriptome remodeling to restore cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Galluzzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Payea et al., 2023</xref>). Cellular stress responses have been under intense study as the capacity of cells to activate adaptive pathways deteriorates with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Derisbourg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haigis and Yankner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Maragkakis et al., 2022</xref>) and has been associated with many diseases, particularly age-related neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Beckman and Ames, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stadtman and Berlett, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The response to different stressors converges at the induction of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), a common adaptive molecular pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Harding et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>) that induces phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) to inhibit translation initiation and decrease global protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hinnebusch, 1994</xref>). In turn, mRNAs exiting the translational pool get localized in stress granules (SGs), membraneless organelles that are formed upon stress when translation of mRNAs gets arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Panas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). SGs comprise several different types of biomolecules, particularly mRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, but their precise functions in mRNA storage or decay are not yet fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Marcelo et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Short- and long-read sequencing following tagging of RNA 5’ ends has revealed that RNA content in cells is a mix of intact RNA molecules and RNA decay intermediates that exist in a transient, partially degraded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>). However much less is known about the global transcriptome-wide state of RNA under stress and whether stress leads to RNA decay or stabilization. Evidence have been found in both directions with stress having been associated with mRNA stabilization in a translation-dependent and independent way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Gowrishankar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hilgers et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Horvathova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kharel et al., 2023</xref>). On the other hand, in yeast, ribosomal and other RNA binding proteins, which under certain physiological conditions contact mRNAs to facilitate translation, show diminished mRNA association under heat shock stress and decreased mRNA abundance mediated by the 5′-3′ exoribonuclease Xrn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bresson et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, under oxidative stress, deletion of Xrn1 can lead to accumulation of oxidized RNAs bearing nucleotide adducts such as 8-oxoguanosine (8-oxoG), in turn inhibiting translation and triggering No-Go decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yan et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we globally profile the integrity of individual RNA molecules in human cells under stress by full-length direct RNA sequencing with nanopores. We develop a new computational framework for statistical interrogation of RNA decay at single molecule and nucleotide resolution. We find that upon cellular stress, RNAs globally exhibit marked shortening at their 5′ end. This stress-induced decay is mediated by XRN1, but is not dependent on prior de-adenylation, as classical models would posit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Passmore and Coller, 2021</xref>). Importantly, we find that the decaying RNA molecules are preferentially enriched in the SG transcriptome. Prevention of SG formation by ablation of cells for G3BP1 and G3BP2 rescues RNA length upon stress, suggesting SG formation as a required step for stress-induced RNA decay. Our results identify 5’ RNA decay as a hallmark of cellular stress response that defines the transcriptome and that is dependent on stress-granule formation.</p>

<title>Stress induces widespread decay at the 5’ end of RNAs</title>
 <p>To explore the state of RNA under stress, we treated HeLa cells with sodium arsenite (0.5 mM) for 60 minutes to induce oxidative stress. We verified the formation of SGs and increased eIF2α phosphorylation (discussed in subsequent section) and monitored cell viability up to 24 hours after treatment with no major change observed (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup. Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). We collected arsenite-treated and untreated cells and performed direct RNA-Seq using the TERA-Seq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). Direct RNA-Seq profiles RNA at single molecule resolution without cDNA conversion or PCR amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Workman et al., 2019</xref>). TERA-Seq additionally incorporates unique adapters that are ligated to the 5’ phosphorylated end of individual RNA molecules, which are then sequenced along with the native sequence. Nanopore-based direct RNA sequencing proceeds in the 3’ to 5’ direction thus the inclusion, and subsequent computational identification of an adapter, at the 5’ end of a read acts as internal control ensuring an RNA molecule has been sequenced in its entirety. Notably, the method does not biochemically select for ligated molecules, thus the resultant sequencing datasets comprise both ligated and non-ligated molecules. Ligated molecules can be computationally recognized and separated to be analyzed jointly or independently to non-ligated reads. Samples were prepared in triplicates and sequenced on a MinION device, yielding approximately 2 million long reads per library (<bold>Sup. Table 1</bold>). Replicates displayed high expression correlation and high alignment efficiency to the human genome <bold>(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1b</xref>, Sup. Table 1)</bold>. Consistent with oxidative stress induction, differential gene expression analysis identified several stress response genes being upregulated in arsenite while gene ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed expected associations to cellular response to stress (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup. Fig 1c</xref>, Sup. Table 3</bold>). These results show that our long-read data accurately and reproducibly capture the expression status of the transcriptome upon oxidative stress.</p>

<p>To test the decay status of RNA for each individual transcript, we quantified the average read length aligning to each transcript (“transcript” refers to annotated loci corresponding to gene isoforms). Surprisingly, we found RNAs in oxidative stress were globally shorter than in unstressed cells, independently of transcript differential expression status, indicating that RNAs in stressed cells were globally shorter than unstressed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref></bold>). Quantification of all transcripts combined, revealed that RNAs under oxidative stress were significantly shorter by an average of 115.3 nucleotides compared to unstressed (Mann–Whitney: p-value &lt; 10<sup>-123</sup>, <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref></bold>). Similar results were observed independently of the transcript coding potential (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup. Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref></bold>). To exclude potential library preparation artifacts or failure to capture long transcripts by the sequencing device, we repeated the analysis by computationally selecting only reads with ligated 5′ adaptors, ensuring RNA molecules were fully sequenced. The subset of 5′ adaptor-ligated reads confirmed our findings and again showed global RNA shortening upon oxidative stress (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref></bold>). Since both ligated and non-ligated reads showed comparable results, all reads were used in subsequent analysis, unless otherwise mentioned.</p>
<p>To test whether stress induced RNA shortening depends on preexisting steady-state fragmentation levels, we performed analyses in a length-normalized space (meta-length) that represents read length as a percent of annotated transcript length. We calculated normalized meta-length by splitting each annotated transcript in 20 equal bins, assigning the mapped read ends into individual bins, and defining the transcript meta-length as the difference of the 5’ and 3’ end bins (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref></bold>). Our data showed a consistent reduction of transcript meta-length upon oxidative stress, independent of the position on the x-axis, indicating that transcripts are being shortened independently of steady-state fragmentation levels (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1g</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1f</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To exclude potential effects of the arsenite chemical itself, we further tested oxidative stress induction with 0.3 mM hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 2 hours followed by TERA-Seq. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress also resulted in significant transcript shortening (Mann–Whitney: p-value &lt; 10<sup>-96</sup>), similar to that observed with arsenite, indicating that oxidative stress results in RNA shortening irrespective of inducer (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup. Fig. 1g</xref></bold>). To explore whether RNA shortening is unique to oxidative stress or constitutes a general stress response, we re-examined publicly available direct RNA-Seq data for human K562 cells that were subjected to heat shock at 42°C for 60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Maier et al., 2020</xref>). The results showed that heat-shocked cells also had significantly shorter RNAs compared to unstressed cells (Mann–Whitney: p-value &lt; 10<sup>-76</sup>), again independently of differential expression (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 1h</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">i</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To identify transcripts with systemic RNA length changes, we developed NanopLen, a statistical tool that uses linear mixed models, and modeled the library as a random effect to adjust for variation across replicates. To test the model, we simulated sequencing data over varying RNA shortening proportions and expression counts. The simulated data showed that the model accurately predicted the true length difference for each tested shortening proportion and had a well-controlled false positive rate (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref></bold>). As expected, NanopLen reported lower significance for smaller length differences while higher expression counts resulted in higher statistical power. We compared unstressed and arsenite-treated cells and identified 2730 significantly shortened transcripts (p-value &lt; 0.05) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>, <bold>Sup. Table 4)</bold>. Gene Ontology analysis of these transcripts highlighted processes relevant to RNA catabolism, translation initiation, and protein localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The presence of the poly(A) tail is required for direct RNA-Seq. Therefore, we anticipated that our method would only capture fragmentation occurring at the 5’ end of RNAs. To confirm this, we compared the heterogeneity observed at the 5’ end of transcripts and at the terminal templated end upstream of the poly(A) tail. As expected, contrary to non-significant transcripts, significantly shortened transcripts showed that their 3’ templated end were almost identical in oxidative stress and unstressed conditions whereas the corresponding 5’ ends were more heterogenous (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>). Quantification at the transcriptome-wide level further confirmed this observation (Mann Whitney p-value &lt; 10<sup>-256</sup>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Sup. Fig. 2c</xref></bold>). We reasoned that RNA shortening at the 5’ end, should also be reflected in short-read RNA-Seq as reduction in read coverage at the 5’ end of RNAs. We thus re-analyzed recent data from HEK293 cells treated with a battery of stressors i.e. 42 °C heat shock for 1 h; 0.6 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 2 h and 300 µM NaAsO<sub>2</sub> for 2 h followed by short-read RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Watkins et al., 2022</xref>). Our analysis showed that, compared to unstressed, all stress conditions resulted in significantly reduced read coverage at the 5’ end (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 2d</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Finally, we considered the possibility that selection of alternative transcription start sites (TSSs) downstream of annotated TSSs could be contributing to RNA shortening. We have previously established that positions with high read density upstream of coding sequences in TERA-Seq, accurately represent TSSs matching those defined by CAGE-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>). We used this method to independently calculate TSSs in stress and unstressed conditions. Our results showed non-significant changes between conditions (Mann–Whitney: p-value = 0.35) with no preference towards shorter or longer transcripts (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref></bold>) indicating that the observed shortening is not affected by TSS selection. Conclusively, our results, while not excluding 3’ end decay for molecules not sequenced due to lack of poly(A) tails, provide strong evidence for stress-induced decay occurring at the 5’ end of RNA molecules that harbor poly(A) tails.</p>

<title>Stress-induced RNA decay is XRN1-mediated but independent of de-adenylation</title>
<p>XRN1 is the primary 5’ to 3’ exonuclease in cells, and thus a likely candidate for mediating 5’ transcript shortening upon stress. We hypothesized that in the absence of XRN1, RNAs would be stabilized, and their observed length would be restored. Silencing of XRN1 with siRNAs (siXRN1) resulted in substantial reduction of protein level compared to non-targeted control (siCTRL) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Sup. Fig. 3a</xref></bold>). We subsequently performed TERA-Seq for siCTRL- and siXRN1-transfected cells in the presence or absence of oxidative stress. Our results showed that transfection with siXRN1 resulted in significantly longer transcripts than mock transfection, largely rescuing RNA length (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b, c</xref></bold>). Quantifying this length difference at the transcript level showed that indeed most expressed transcripts were generally longer after XRN1 downregulation, again independently of differential expression (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Sup.

<p>The yeast Xrn1 has previously been associated with the decay of oxidized RNAs via the No-Go decay pathway following ribosome stalling at nucleotide adducts, particularly 8-oxoguanosine (8-OxoG), and endonucleolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). We reasoned that if endonucleolytic cleavage induced by 8-OxoG was the major contributor to the transcript shortening, then an increase in guanine prevalence should be expected at the vicinity of 5’ ends of sequenced RNAs upon stress. However, our data did not support this explanation, as no G-nucleotide enrichment difference between arsenite and unstressed was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref></bold>). Similarly, no difference was observed upon XRN1 silencing (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Sup. Fig. 1a</xref></bold>). These findings, combined with the presence of shortening under heat shock (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref></bold>), indicates that the stress-induced RNA decay described here is not mediated via 8-OxoG ribosome stalling.</p>

<p>Under traditional decay models, de-adenylation is considered the first and rate-limiting step prior to decapping and subsequent exonucleolytic action from the 5’-end via XRN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Borbolis and Syntichaki, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Łabno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mugridge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Passmore and Coller, 2021</xref>). We therefore wished to assess the role of the poly(A) tail in stress-induced RNA decay. We used nanopolish to quantify the poly(A) tail length of RNA molecules in the TERA-Seq libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Workman et al., 2019</xref>). Contrary to the traditional model, our data showed a modest but significant increase of poly(A) tail length (p-value &lt; 10<sup>-143</sup>) in arsenite-treated compared to unstressed cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). However, no association with gene expression levels was observed (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4b</xref></bold>). Similarly, no correlation was observed between poly(A) tail length and RNA decay levels indicating that shortening of the poly(A) tail was not required for stress-induced RNA decay (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4c</xref>-<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">d</xref></bold>). These finding are in agreement with previous studies where increase of poly(A) tail length in response to endoplasmic reticulum, arsenite, heat, and nutrient starvation stresses was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tudek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Woo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yamagishi et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we tested a composite metric for transcript length by adding the poly(A) tail length to the corresponding templated read length. Our data again showed that composite transcript length was reduced in arsenite-treated compared to unstressed cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref></bold>). In conclusion, our results show that stress-induced RNA decay is mediated by XRN1 but is independent of prior de-adenylation.</p>

<title>Restoring ribosome density inhibits stress-induced RNA decay</title>
<p>To identify gene features that could be driving stress-induced RNA decay, we tested whether the annotated nucleotide content and transcript length were predictive of transcripts prone to stress-induced 5’ shortening. Our results showed a significant association with the annotated coding sequence length and GC content, both being significantly lower for significantly shortened transcripts (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">i</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">f</xref></bold>). Since the coding sequence is the primary region of ribosome occupancy, we used publicly available ribosome profiling data from unstressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2016</xref>) to test whether pre-stress ribosome density could be defining 5’ shortening. Our analysis showed no association between ribosome density per RNA and stress-induced shortening (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Sup. Fig. 5a</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">b</xref></bold>) indicating that the pre-stress ribosome levels on RNAs are not linked to RNA decay under stress.</p>
<p>Rather, another possibility is that stress-induced RNA decay is associated with the rate at which RNAs leave the translation pool following translation initiation inhibition upon stress. If true, then alteration of the ribosome dynamics under stress should have a direct effect on observed RNA decay. To test the role of translation initiation inhibition and ribosome run-off upon stress on stress-induced decay, we treated cells with the ISR Inhibitor (ISRIB) that bypasses the effect of eIF2α phosphorylation and facilitates translation initiation under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rabouw et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Sidrauski et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed that ISRIB had no noticeable effect on the dose-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α but inhibited the SG formation under stress, as expected (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a-c</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Polysome fractionation following ISRIB addition showed a clear reduction of the monosome fraction, indicating partial recovery of translation initiation, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sidrauski et al., 2013</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref></bold>). We then performed TERA-Seq on ISRIB-treated and control cells in the presence or absence of arsenite. Our results showed that compared to cells treated with arsenite only, ISRIB treatment resulted in a significant shift of RNA length towards longer molecules (p-value &lt; 10<sup>-156</sup>) essentially restoring transcript length to the level of the unstressed (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Importantly, previously identified significantly shortened transcripts showed the greatest recovery of their length compared to non-significant ones (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5f</xref></bold>). To test whether this could be simply attributed to a possible length imbalance between up-and down-regulated genes, we again plotted the average transcript length stratified by the differential expression status. Our data show that the observed shift in length is independent of differential expression status (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g, h</xref></bold>). These results indicated that stress-induced RNA decay is associated with RNAs leaving the translation pool following translation initiation inhibition upon stress.</p>
<p>As an alternative to ISRIB which modulates translation initiation, we also treated cells with cycloheximide to interrogate the dynamics of ribosome elongation and to prevent ribosome run-off. Cycloheximide blocks elongation and thus traps ribosomes on RNAs along with translation factors in polysomes, thus decreasing SG formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Jayabalan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kedersha and Anderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Takahashi et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed that treatment with cycloheximide also reduced the monosome fraction, although to a lower degree than ISRIB (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Sup. Fig. 5c</xref></bold>). Interestingly, cycloheximide treatment also inhibited RNA decay, particularly for the most significantly shortened RNAs largely rescuing their length (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5i-k</xref></bold>).

<title>Inhibition of stress-granule formation in cells devoid of G3BP1/2 rescues RNA decay</title>
<p>During stress, ribosome run-off and the exit of RNAs from the translation pool is accompanied by the formation of SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Protter and Parker, 2016</xref>). To test whether stress-induced decaying transcripts associate with SGs, we used publicly available data representing genes enriched in the SG transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khong et al., 2017</xref>), we found that SG-enriched genes were generally significantly longer, particularly in their coding and 3’ UTR sequences, (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 6a</xref></bold>) and less expressed than SG-depleted ones (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Sup. Fig. 6b</xref></bold>). However, differential gene length analysis showed, interestingly, a significant difference in gene shortening dependent on SG enrichment status. Specifically, SG-enriched genes were found to be shortened at a significantly higher level upon oxidative stress than SG-depleted or non-localized RNAs for both HeLa and U-2 OS cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">c</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup. Fig. 6c</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">d</xref></bold>). Consistent with stress-induced gene shortening being associated with SG enrichment, SG-enriched RNAs harbored lower GC content, similar to significantly shortened transcripts <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6f</xref></bold>). We again found no association with poly(A) tail length as, although SG-enriched RNAs had significantly longer poly(A) tails, their lengths did not significantly change upon stress (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d, e</xref></bold>). To test whether the observed enrichment of shortened genes is specific to the SGs, we also tested for association with processing bodies (P-bodies), membraneless organelles enriched in de-capping factors and exoribonucleases, essential for RNA decay under normal, non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Brothers et al., 2023</xref>). We re-analyzed previously published data from HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Matheny et al., 2019</xref>), but in contrast to SGs, we found no association between P-body localization and gene lengths (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Sup.

We also did not find an association between P-body localization and RNA shortening which however could be a result of comparing different cell lines (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6g</xref></bold>). Our data show that shortened RNAs exhibit similar properties to SG-enriched transcripts and are preferentially enriched in the SG transcriptome.</p>

ΔΔG3BP1/2 cells inhibit SG condensation in response to arsenite and other stressors. Treatment of WT U-2 OS cells with arsenite showed a clear and global shortening of RNA, comparable to our previous results, confirming that stress-induced decay also occurs in U-2 OS cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6h</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup.

Further comparison of ΔΔG3BP1/2 against WT U-2 OS showed that inhibition of G3BP1/2-mediated SG formation fully rescues RNA length to the level of unstressed WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6i</xref></bold>, <bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Sup.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cellular response to stress is critical for cell recovery or induction of apoptosis if stress is unresolved. Recent works have delineated many of the biochemical pathways involved in stress responses. However, the full-length state of RNA under cellular stress remains incompletely characterized. In this work, we used TERA-Seq, a protocol that involves the ligation of unique adaptors at the 5’ end of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>) to address a key limitation in nanopore direct RNA sequencing – the inability to consistently capture the 5’ end of sequenced RNA molecules. By sequencing RNA molecules end-to-end, we show that stress triggers decay at the 5′ end of RNAs. Interestingly our results show that stress-induced 5’ end decay leaves “scars” that can also be identified in traditional short-read RNA-Seq as decreased read density at the 5’ end of transcripts.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight XRN1 as an essential component for stress-induced decay, in the absence of which RNA length is largely rescued. However, contrary to the traditional decay model, evaluation of the most significantly shortened RNAs did not reveal a dependency on de-adenylation. Instead, these shortened transcripts possess shorter coding sequences and lower GC content. Previous studies in unstressed cells have shown an association between GC content and mRNA stability in P-bodies, with XRN1-dependent decay preferentially acting on GC-rich mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Courel et al., 2019</xref>). P-bodies and SGs are dynamically linked under stress with shared RNA binding proteins and mRNAs shuttling between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Moon et al., 2019</xref>). The GC content appears to also be a determinant for RNA recruitment to SGs but, as also confirmed in our study, primarily for GC-poor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this finding, our data show that the SG transcriptome is significantly enriched for stress-induced shortened RNAs. In fact, our results show that the formation of the SGs is required and indispensable for stress-induced decay as genetic ablation of G3BP1/2 rescues RNA length to the level of non-stressed controls. Finally, we find that inhibition of the ISR to re-initiate translation and dissolve SGs also curtails stress-induced RNA decay, further supporting a critical role for SG formation in stress-induced RNA decay.</p>
<p>The primary function of ISR activation during stress is to inhibit translation initiation and preserve energy for cell recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>). While the physiological role of stress-induced RNA decay is currently unknown, it is intriguing to hypothesize that it evolved as a mechanism to further reduce translational load during stress. Degradation of the 5’ end of RNAs is expected to eliminate translation initiation sites thus offering an orthogonal strategy to dial down translation. Future studies to test these hypotheses will be required, especially considering the emerging significance of SGs and RNA metabolism in neurodegenerative diseases and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ferrucci et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ripin and Parker, 2022</xref>).</p>

Whole cell lysates were prepared by adding 1 volume of SDS lysis buffer (60 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Cat # 11836153001) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Roche, Cat # 10837091001). The lysate was passed 10 times through a 25-gauge needle, heated at 95°C for 20 minutes and cleared by centrifugation at 16,500 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 minutes. Protein concentrations were measured using the Qubit protein assay (Invitrogen, Cat # Q33211). 25 µg of proteins was separated on NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Invitrogen, Cat #NP0321BOX) and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore, Cat # IPVH00010). After blocking in TBS-T 5% milk for 2 hours, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Membranes were washed 3 times 5 min in TBS-T and incubated for 2 hours with secondary antibodies. Signals were developed using Chemiluminescence (Azure Biosystems, Cat # AC2204) and acquired on a ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Biorad). For studies of eIF2α phosphorylation (eIF2α-P), the lysis buffer was supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma, Cat # Cocktail 2 - P5726 and Cocktail 3-P0044) and 5% BSA was used instead of milk for blocking. Antibodies are listed in Sup. Table 2.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Cells were cultured at 70-80% confluency in Millicell EZ SLIDE 8-well glass (Milipore, Cat # PEZGS0816) in the presence of 50, 100, 250, 500 µM of arsenite +/-200 nM of ISRIB (Sigma, Cat # SML0843). After the indicated time of treatment, cells were washed 3 times with warm PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature (RT) in PBS / 3.7% paraformaldehyde and washed with PBS for 5 min with shaking. After permeabilization in PBS 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT, cells were blocked in PBS 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) supplemented with 1% BSA for 1 hour at 37°C with gentle shaking. Primary antibody diluted in 1% BSA were added to the cells and incubated at 4C overnight. Cells were washed in PBS-T three times 5 min with shaking before staining with secondary antibody for 1 hour at RT. Cells were washed four times for 5 min with PBS-T with shaking and nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:1000 in PBS-T) for 5 min at RT. Slides were mounted with ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant (Invitrogen, Cat # P36982) and images were acquired using a DeltaVision Microscope System (Applied Precision).</p>

<title>Polysome profiling</title>
<p>The polysome profiling was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Panda et al., 2017</xref>) with modifications. Briefly, HeLa cells (80-85% confluency) cultured in 100 mm dishes were treated with 500 µM sodium arsenite, 200 nM ISRIB or 25 µg/ml cycloheximide as indicated. DMSO was used as a control. Immediately before harvesting, cells were treated with 100 µg/ml cycloheximide for 10 minutes. After one wash with ice-cold PBS containing 100 µg/ml cycloheximide, 500 µL of polysome extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1mM DTT, 1 X HALT Protease, 1.0% Triton x-100, and 100 µg/ml cycloheximide) was added directly to the plate and lysates were harvested by scraping. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 <italic>x g</italic> for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto the 10-50% sucrose gradient followed by high-speed centrifugation (260,800 <italic>x g</italic> for 90 minutes at 4°C). Using a density gradient fractionation system monitored by UV absorbance detector (A254), 12 fractions were collected.</p>

<title>Nanopore sequencing data processing</title>
<p>Nanopore sequencing data were basecalled using Guppy (v3.4.5). The 5′ adaptors were identified and removed using cutadapt (v2.8). Reads were first aligned against ribosomal sequences obtained from SILVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Quast et al., 2013</xref>). Non-ribosomal reads were subsequently mapped against the human genome hg38 using minimap2 (version 2.17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li, 2018</xref>) and parameters -a -x splice -k 12 -u b -p 1 --secondary=yes.

<title>Differential gene expression and Gene Ontology</title>
<p>Transcript counts were quantified from the transcriptome alignments as the total number of reads aligning on each transcript. Differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Love et al., 2014</xref>). EnhancedVolcano (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano">https://github.com/kevinblighe/EnhancedVolcano</ext-link>) was used for visualization.

<p>Ribosome profiling sequencing data were downloaded from GEO GSM2100595 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Adaptors were removed using cutadapt (version 2.8) and reads were aligned to the human genome using STAR (2.5.3a). Further processing to calculate counts per transcript was performed with in-house scripts using pysam (v0.15.4) and counts were converted to reads per kilobase of transcript per million (RPKM).</p>

<title>Meta-length calculation</title>
<p>For calculating the bin (meta) lengths, we divided the transcripts into 20 equal bins [0, 19]. Reads were assigned to each of these bins based on the corresponding location of their ends. The binned-(meta-) length is calculated as the difference of the binned 3’ end over the binned 5’ end.</p>

<title>Transcription start site identification</title>
<p>Transcription start site identification was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ibrahim et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, all reads from all replicates were combined and the distribution of read 5’ ends within the 5’ UTR was quantified. The TSS was selected as the position with the highest read density withing the 5’ UTR with minimum 5 supporting reads.</p>

<title>NanopLen</title>
<p>NanopLen reads a file of read lengths with library identifiers and gene or transcript identifiers, and a metadata file describing the experimental design. The latter includes the library identifiers and the corresponding condition for each library. The software supports three models: t-test, Wilcoxon, and linear mixed model (LMM). In the t-test and LMM options, the user can also supply a customized model to use extra variables in the metadata. In this work we have used the LMM to adjust for putative batch effects across libraries.</p>
<p>Given a vector Y of read lengths associated with a gene/transcript, the t-test is functionally equivalent to a linear regression model. The model also supports optional read-specific extra covariates but are not used in this work:
<disp-formula id="ueqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="555629v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>Similarly, the LMM models Y using the condition as fixed effect and the library identifier as a random effect.
<disp-formula id="ueqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="555629v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>lib</italic> is the random effect of each library. By adding the random effect, the analysis is more robust against potential false positives from library variation and prevents deeper libraries from dominating the effect size. A Wald test is used to test for significance of 𝛽<sub><italic>cond</italic></sub>. The Wilcoxon test option is restricted to only testing the condition variable and cannot adjust for additional variables. Each gene/transcript is assigned a statistic corresponding to the test used and a p-value. p-values are adjusted for multiple testing using the Bonferroni-Hochberg method.</p>
<p>To test NanopLen models, transcript length data with known shortening rates were simulated. Each simulation was parameterized with a “true” transcript length, a read count as a proxy for transcript expression, and a shortening proportion. The database of known human genic lengths from Ensembl (release 91) was used and the median was selected as “true” length. Since the simulated variance is in proportion of the true length, using any length will result in similar results so we do not simulate additional true lengths. Expression counts were simulated, ranging from 10 to 200 reads per transcripts to capture the dynamic expression range particularly towards small read depth. Varying shortening percentages were simulated from 50, 60, .., 100% of the true length (equivalent of -1, -0.74, .., 0 log2 fold change) with the 100% corresponding to the null simulation of no-change.</p>
<p>Given the parameters, the simulated lengths were generated based on the mixed model in NanopLen, with the number of sampled lengths being the selected expression counts. The library random effect was simulated as if imitating a fluctuation with standard deviation of 10% of the true length, and the global error having a standard deviation of 20% of the expected length mean. As with the real experiment, six libraries of three control and three condition were simulated, with 1000 genes per scenario. Using the LMM option with the logscale option selected, the resulting log2FCs and p-values were calculated.</p>

<p>Transcripts that were identified as significantly shortened at a false discovery rate of 0.05 by NanopLen, had at least 50 supporting reads in both conditions and had a difference of 200 nts in length were selected. From the list of 32 transcripts, 5 were randomly selected (<italic>ASCC3</italic>, <italic>FASTKD2</italic>, <italic>MTRR, HNRNPM</italic> and <italic>DSG2</italic>) for visualization. As control, 3 transcripts with non-significant, lower than 10 nt difference (<italic>AGPAT2</italic>, <italic>EPHX1</italic>, <italic>TBCA</italic>) were selected.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study describes mRNA shortening during cellular stress and interestingly observes that this shortening is dependent on localization in stress granules. Surprisingly, this mRNA shortening does not appear to require the shortening of polyA tails. These are in principle novel findings, but the evidence for them is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>. Additional experiments would help bolster confidence in how the authors interpret their data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors employed direct RNA sequencing with nanopores, enhanced by 5' end adaptor ligation, to comprehensively interrogate the human transcriptome at single-molecule and nucleotide resolution. They conclude that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy. Contrary to the literature, they found that, unlike typical RNA decay models in normal conditions, stress-induced RNA decay is dependent on XRN1 but does not depend on the removal of the poly(A) tail. The findings presented are interesting but a substantial amount of work is needed to fully establish these paradigm-shifting findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These are paradigm-shifting observations using cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions do not appear to be fully supported by the data presented.</p>

<p>In the manuscript &quot;Full-length direct RNA sequencing uncovers stress-granule dependent RNA decay upon cellular stress&quot;, Dar, Malla, and colleagues use direct RNA sequencing on nanopores to characterize the transcriptome after arsenite and oxidative stress. They observe a population of transcripts that are shortened during stress. The authors hypothesize that this shortening is mediated by the 5'-3' exonuclease XRN1, as XRN1 knockdown results in longer transcripts. Interestingly, the authors do not observe a polyA-tail shortening, which is typically thought to precede decapping and XRN1-mediated transcript decay. Finally, the authors use G3BP1 knockout cells to demonstrate that stress granule formation is required for the observed transcript shortening.</p>
<p>The manuscript contains intriguing findings of interest to the mRNA decay community. That said, it appears that the authors at times overinterpret the data they get from a handful of direct RNA sequencing experiments. To bolster some of the statements additional experiments might be desirable.</p>
<p>A selection of comments:</p>
<p>(1) Considering that the authors compare the effects of stress, stress granule formation, and XRN1 loss on transcriptome profiles, it would be desirable to use a single-cell system (and validated in a few more). Most of the direct RNAseq is performed in HeLa cells, but the experiments showing that stress granule formation is required come from U2OS cells, while short RNAseq data showing loss of coverage on mRNA 5'ends is reanalyzed from HEK293 cells. It may be plausible that the same pathways operate in all those cells, but it is not rigorously demonstrated.</p>
<p>(2) An interesting finding of the manuscript is that polyA tail shortening is not observed prior to transcript shortening. The authors would need to demonstrate that their approach is capable of detecting shortened polyA tails. Using polyA purified RNA to look at the status of polyA tail length may not be ideal (as avidity to oligodT beads may increase with polyA tail length and therefore the authors bias themselves to longer tails anyway). At the very least, the use of positive controls would be desirable; e.g. knockdown of CCR4/NOT.</p>
<p>(3) The authors use a strategy of ligating an adapter to 5' phosphorylated RNA (presumably the breakdown fragments) to be able to distinguish true mRNA fragments from artifacts of abortive nanopore sequencing. This is a fantastic approach to curating a clean dataset. Unfortunately, the authors don't appear to go through with discarding fragments that are not adapter-ligated (presumably to increase the depth of analysis; they do offer Figure 1e that shows similar changes in transcript length for fragments with adapter, compared to Figure 1d). It would be good to know how many reads in total had the adapter. Furthermore, it would be good to know what percentage of reads without adapters are products of abortive sequencing. What percentage of reads had 5'OH ends (could be answered by ligating a different adapter to kinase-treated transcripts). More read curation would also be desirable when building the metagene analysis - why do the authors include every 3'end of sequenced reads (their RNA purification scheme requires a polyA tail, so non-polyadenylated fragments are recovered in a non-quantitative manner and should be discarded).</p>
<p>(4) The authors should come to a clear conclusion about what &quot;transcript shortening&quot; means. Is it exonucleolytic shortening from the 5'end? They cannot say much about the 3'ends anyway (see above). Or are we talking about endonucleolytic cuts leaving 5'P that then can be attached by XRN1 (again, what is the ratio of 5'P and 5'OH fragments; also, what is the ratio of shortened to full-length RNA)?</p>
<p>(5) The authors should clearly explain how they think the transcript shortening comes about. They claim it does not need polyA shortening, but then do not explain where the XRN1 substrate comes from. Does their effect require decapping? Or endonucleolytic attacks?</p>
<p>(6) XRN1 KD results in lengthened transcripts. That is not surprising as XRN1 is an exonuclease - and XRN1 does not merely rescue arsenite stress-mediated transcript shortening, but results in a dramatic transcript lengthening.</p>

<p>The work by Dar et al. examines RNA metabolism under cellular stress, focusing on stress-granule-dependent RNA decay. It employs direct RNA sequencing with a Nanopore-based method, revealing that cellular stress induces prevalent 5' end RNA decay that is coupled to translation and ribosome occupancy but is independent of the shortening of the poly(A) tail. This decay, however, is dependent on XRN1 and enriched in the stress granule transcriptome. Notably, inhibiting stress granule formation in G3BP1/2-null cells restores the RNA length to the same level as wild-type. It suppresses stress-induced decay, identifying RNA decay as a critical determinant of RNA metabolism during cellular stress and highlighting its dependence on stress-granule formation.</p>
<p>This is an exciting and novel discovery. I am not an expert in sequencing technologies or sequencing data analysis, so I will limit my comments purely to biology and not technical points. The PI is a leader in applying innovative sequencing methods to studying mRNA decay.</p>
<p>One aspect that appeared overlooked is that poly(A) tail shortening per se does lead to decapping. It is shortening below a certain threshold of 8-10 As that triggers decapping. Therefore, I found the conclusion that poly(A) tail shortening is not required for stress-induced decay to be somewhat premature. For a robust test of this hypothesis, the authors should consider performing their analysis in conditions where CNOT7/8 is knocked down with siRNA.</p>
<p>Similarly, as XRN1 requires decapping to take place, it necessitates the experiment where a dominant-negative DCP2 mutant is over-expressed.</p>
<p>Are G3BP1/2 stress granules required for stress-induced decay or simply sites for storage? This part seems unclear. A very worthwhile test here would be to assess in XRN1-null background.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors speculate that the mechanism of stress-induced decay may have evolved to relieve translational load during stress. But why degrade the 5' end when removing the cap may be sufficient? This returns to the question of assessing the role of decapping in this mechanism.</p>
