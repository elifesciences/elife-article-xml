<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that converts epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells with migratory potential in both developmental and pathological processes. Although originally considered a binary event, EMT in cancer progression involves intermediate states between a fully epithelial and a fully mesenchymal phenotype, which are characterized by distinct combinations of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. This phenomenon has been termed epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), however, the intermediate states remain poorly described and it’s unclear whether they exist during developmental EMT. Neural crest cells (NCC) are an embryonic progenitor cell population that gives rise to numerous cell types and tissues in vertebrates, and their formation is a classic example of developmental EMT. An important feature of NCC development is their delamination from the neuroepithelium via EMT, following which NCC migrate throughout the embryo and undergo differentiation. NCC delamination shares similar changes in cellular state and structure with cancer cell invasion. However, whether intermediate states also exist during NCC EMT and delamination remains unknown. Through single cell RNA sequencing, we identified intermediate NCC states based on their transcriptional signature and then spatially defined their locations in situ in the dorsolateral neuroepithelium. Our results illustrate the progressive transcriptional and spatial transitions from premigratory to migratory cranial NCC during EMT and delamination. Of note gene expression and trajectory analysis indicate that distinct intermediate populations of NCC delaminate in either S phase or G2/M phase of the cell cycle, and the importance of cell cycle regulation in facilitating mammalian cranial NCC delamination was confirmed through cell cycle inhibition studies. Additionally, transcriptional knockdown revealed a functional role for the intermediate stage marker <italic>Dlc1</italic> in regulating NCC delamination and migration. Overall, our work identifying and characterizing the intermediate cellular states, processes, and molecular signals that regulate mammalian NCC EMT and delamination furthers our understanding of developmental EMP and may provide new insights into mechanisms regulating pathological EMP.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular process that converts epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells with migratory potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hay 1995</xref>). EMT plays an essential role in various developmental and pathological processes such as embryonic morphogenesis, wound healing, tissue fibrosis and cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Trainor 2023</xref>). Studies of EMT, particularly in the field of cancer biology, have increased exponentially in the past 5 years due to the implied role of EMT in numerous aspects of malignancy such as cancer cell invasion, survival, stemness, metastasis, therapeutic resistance and tumor heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Yang et al. 2020a</xref>).</p>
<p>EMT has traditionally been considered a binary process comprising either full epithelial cell or mesenchymal cell states. However, studies of cancer have uncovered an alternative scenario termed epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP), in which multiple intermediate states exist along the EMT spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dong et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gonzalez et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Huang et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Karacosta et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kumar et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pastushenko et al. 2018</xref>). More specifically, in some cases of head and neck cancer, primary tumors and matching lymph nodes contain a subpopulation of tumor cells in a partial EMT state, as defined by their expression of both epithelial marker genes and mesenchymal marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Puram et al. 2017</xref>). Moreover, cells in this partial EMT state are highly invasive and located at the leading edge of tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Similarly, in mouse xenograft models of skin cancer and breast cancer, the absence of epithelial cellular adhesion molecules in several cell populations was discovered to represent early EMT hybrid states as they also expressed both Vimentin and Cytokeratin 14 at intermediate levels and consequently had high metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pastushenko et al. 2018</xref>). Partial EMT states have also been recognized in lung cancer and ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gonzalez et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Karacosta et al. 2019</xref>), with tumor cells expressing both the epithelial marker E-cadherin, and the mesenchymal marker Vimentin. Besides primary tumors, EMT intermediate states have also been identified in circulating tumor cells from patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Yu et al. 2013</xref>). Even though EMT intermediate states have been discovered in numerous studies, few have focused on describing and understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing or defining each intermediate state due to the challenges of studying cancer initiation and progression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Since EMT during embryogenesis and cancer progression have been shown to share analogous phenotypic changes that involve similar core transcription factors and molecular mechanisms, it was proposed that the initiation and development of carcinoma could be attributed to an unusual activation of EMT factors involved in normal developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hay 1995</xref>). However, compared to tumorigenesis, it remains largely unknown whether intermediate or transition states exist or play a role in classic developmental EMT. Therefore, identifying and characterizing intermediate states during developmental EMT can further our understanding of the cellular processes, and molecular signaling networks that regulate EMP.</p>
<p>NCC formation is a classic example of developmental EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Trainor 2023</xref>). NCC are a migratory progenitor cell population unique to vertebrates. Formed during neurulation in the dorsolateral domain of the neural plate, EMT facilitates their delamination from the neuroepithelium and migration throughout the body, where they differentiate into neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system, pigment cells in the skin, craniofacial bone and cartilage, as well as many other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bhatt et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dash and Trainor 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Lièvre and Douarin 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Trainor 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Weston 1983</xref>). Disruption of NCC delamination and migration can result in developmental abnormalities, referred to as neurocristopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achilleos and Trainor 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Watt and Trainor 2014</xref>), hence it is important to study the mechanisms that regulate mammalian NCC development.</p>
<p>We performed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify and define intermediate transcriptional and cellular states during mouse cranial NCC EMT and delamination. We identified two NCC EMT intermediate populations distinguished by their S or G2/M cell cycle phase state during delamination. Interestingly, trajectory analyses reveal that these distinct intermediate populations are formed simultaneously, and independently, but then converge into a single or common pool, suggesting they do not have distinct fates following migration. This is consistent with the known plasticity and potency of early migrating NCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Golding et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sandell and Trainor 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Trainor and Krumlauf 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Trainor and Krumlauf 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">2001</xref>). Transcriptional profiling revealed that the intermediate NCC populations could also be defined by unique transcriptional signatures, including differential expression of genes involved in cell protrusion, such as <italic>Dlc1</italic>, <italic>Pak3</italic> and <italic>Sp5</italic>. Further interrogation using SABER-FISH, revealed that these intermediate NCC populations were spatially localized in the dorsolateral region of the neural plate. In addition, knocking down the NCC EMT intermediate marker <italic>Dlc1</italic> led to a significant reduction in the number of migratory NCC, which revealed a critical role for <italic>Dlc1</italic> in the regulation of mouse cranial NCC delamination. Overall, our findings provide novel, detailed, high-resolution descriptions of the intermediate cell populations, and transcriptional states that occur during cranial NCC EMT and delamination in mouse embryos. Our work further illustrates that molecular characterization of NCC EMT intermediate states can reveal essential regulatory components of mouse NCC EMT and delamination. These results shed light on similar mechanisms of NCC EMT and delamination in other mammalian species and will also serve as a resource for the community. In addition to NCC EMT, our work may also help to inform the phenotypic changes and corresponding gene regulatory control of EMP in other developmental EMT events as well as pathological conditions such as tissue fibrosis and cancer progression.</p>

<title>Identification of intermediate stages during mouse cranial NCC EMT and delamination</title>
<p>To investigate the biological process and mechanisms governing mouse cranial NCC EMT and delamination, we performed scRNA-seq on dissociated cranial tissues isolated from E8.5 mouse embryos with 7-9 somites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). More specifically, embryos were collected from two transgenic mouse lines: <italic>Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chai et al. 2000</xref>) and <italic>Mef2c-F10N-LacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aoto et al. 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In E8.5 <italic>Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> embryos, YFP is expressed by <italic>Wnt1+</italic> neuroepithelial cells located in the dorsolateral neural plate, which encompasses premigratory NCC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> labels premigratory and migratory NCC and other lineage labeled cells derived from the <italic>Wnt1+</italic> cell population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chai et al. 2000</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Mef2c-F10N-LacZ</italic> predominantly labels migratory NCC, with lacZ activity driven by the F10N enhancer of the <italic>Mef2C</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Aoto et al. 2015</xref>). The two different transgenic lines allowed us to distinguish premigratory from migratory NCC spatially within an embryo, but also later bioinformatically following single cell dissociation and RNA-sequencing.</p>

<p>The scRNA-seq data was processed and analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Falcon et al. 2022</xref>). We initially identified 6 major cell or tissue types present in E8.5 mouse embryonic cranial tissues based on the differential expression of classic cell or tissue type specific markers, and we clustered the data accordingly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> were used to delineate neural ectoderm, whereas <italic>Cdh1</italic> (E-cadherin) was used to define non-neural ectoderm. <italic>eYFP</italic>, <italic>lacZ</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Twist</italic> delineated migrating neural crest cells. <italic>Tbx1</italic> was primarily used as a marker of mesoderm cells and <italic>Kdr</italic> (<italic>Vegfr2</italic>) demarcated mesoderm-derived endothelial cells. We then bioinformatically segregated the cranial NCC cluster, which includes both premigratory and migratory NCC, and divided it into 5 subclusters at a resolution of 0.26 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="564204v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To characterize these NCC subclusters, we then interrogated the expression of known neuroepithelial and neural plate border markers, as well as genes expressed by NCC during their specification and migration (Supplementary Table 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Echelard et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hafemeister and Satija 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murdoch et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Parr et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sauka-Spengler and Bronner-Fraser 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Wood and Episkopou 1999</xref>). A high percentage of cells in subclusters 0-3 express elevated levels of markers of migratory NCC (<italic>Vim</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Twist1</italic>), while only subclusters 0 and 1 exhibit high levels of expression of NCC specifier genes (<italic>Zeb2</italic>, <italic>Pax3</italic>, <italic>Nr6a1</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Foxd3</italic>, <italic>Snai1)</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheung et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dottori et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hari et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kobayashi et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lee et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Li et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Murdoch et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Schorle et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Soo et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Van de Putte et al. 2003</xref>). Since NCC specifiers are downregulated as NCC migrate and later differentiate into specific lineages, the combinatorial expression of genes suggests that subclusters 0 and 1 likely represent an earlier stage of NCC delamination and migration than subclusters 2 and 3. This conclusion was further verified by integrating previously published networks of genes that represent an early migratory NCC program versus a late migratory NCC program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Soldatov et al. 2019</xref>). Early migratory NCC program genes are expressed by the majority of migratory NCC whereas late migratory NCC program genes are only expressed in a subset of migratory NCC as they have already begun to mature.</p>
<p>Subclusters 0-3 each exhibit significant expression of early migratory NCC program genes (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, subclusters 2 and 3 express a significantly higher level of late migratory NCC program genes than subclusters 0 and 1, which demonstrates that subclusters 0 and 1 contain early migratory NCC, whereas subclusters 2 and 3 comprise late migratory NCC (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed that a small percentage of subcluster 0 cells express early migratory NCC genes, but at a lower intensity compared to subcluster 1. This implies that subcluster 0 might also contain premigratory NCC that do not yet express any migratory NCC genes (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Despite similar expression profiles, NCC subclusters 2 and 3 possibly represent undifferentiated NCC derived mesenchyme tissue in different parts of the head. More specifically, subcluster 2 displays a high level of expression of pharyngeal arch NCC mesenchyme marker <italic>Dlx2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bulfone et al. 1993</xref>). In contrast, subcluster 3 expresses a frontonasal mesenchyme marker <italic>Alx1</italic> (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Iyyanar et al. 2022</xref>). Consistent with these observations, neither population expresses a high level of neurogenic lineage markers such as <italic>Nrp1</italic> and Nrp2, which is indicative of their undifferentiated state (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lumb et al. 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Subcluster 4 exhibits a unique transcriptional profile distinct from subclusters 0-3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Higher expression of <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> is indicative of a neuroepithelial identity for subcluster 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). During NCC formation, <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> are downregulated in the dorsal neural plate border domain but remain strongly expressed more ventrally throughout the neural plate (Supplementary Table 1). Concomitantly, Sox9 and Sox10 are activated in what is known as the SoxB (1/2) to SoxE (9/10) switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mandalos et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Remboutsika et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wakamatsu et al. 2004</xref>). Consistent with this model, overexpressing <italic>Sox2</italic> in the dorsal neural tube has been shown to repress NCC specification, whereas overexpressing <italic>Sox9</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> have been shown to precociously promote NCC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aybar et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cheung and Briscoe 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mandalos et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">McKeown et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Remboutsika et al. 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if mouse cranial NCC EMT is non-binary, and occurs through intermediate or transition states, we further subdivided the 5 cranial NCC clusters into smaller subclusters (resolution=2.0; subcluster 1’-21’) and extracted 15 subclusters out of the original early migratory NCC subclusters 0, 1 and 4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). Through heatmap analysis, expression of the same NCC marker genes as described above was examined within these new subclusters, and the order of the subclusters was arranged according to their combinatorial expression patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). For example, <italic>Wnt1</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> were used to identify NCC transitioning from premigratory to migratory states since <italic>Wnt1</italic> is only expressed in premigratory NCC and is immediately downregulated as NCC delaminate and start to migrate. In contrast, <italic>Sox10</italic> is activated only after NCC have delaminated and begun to migrate. The heatmap shows that a significant number of cells in subcluster 17’ express a much higher level of <italic>Wnt1</italic> than any other subcluster, suggesting that subcluster 17’ comprises premigratory NCC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Consistent with this observation, subcluster 17’ cells also express other neural plate border and NCC specifier genes such as <italic>Zic2</italic>, <italic>Pax7</italic>, <italic>Nr6a1</italic>, <italic>Pax3</italic>, <italic>Sox9</italic>, and <italic>Foxd3,</italic> but does not express migratory NCC markers such as <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Vim</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Subclusters 2’ and 10’ share a similar expression profile to subcluster 17’. However, subcluster 2’ and 10’ express less <italic>Wnt1</italic> and less neural plate border specifiers such as <italic>Zic2</italic> and <italic>Pax7</italic> than subcluster 17’ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1</xref>). This data suggests that subclusters 2’ and 10’ could represent EMT intermediate states as premigratory NCC transition to migratory NCC during delamination. Lastly, the remaining early NCC subclusters express <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Vim</italic> indicating that they comprise or represent migratory NCC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further validate the identity of subclusters 2’ and 10’ as representing intermediate cellular stages of EMT, we assessed the expression of genes associated with adherens junctions, tight junctions, and apical-basal polarity, which are required to maintain epithelial integrity, and cytoskeleton rearrangement that is typically associated with EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dongre and Weinberg 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Matsuuchi and Naus 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Radisky and Radisky 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Trainor 2023</xref>). Intermediate NCC exhibit a decrease in <italic>Nectin</italic>, <italic>Cadherin</italic> and <italic>Tight Junction Protein</italic> gene expression consistent with intercellular tight junction breakdown and degradation of apicobasal polarity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Although many cell junction related genes (e.g. <italic>Cdh1</italic>) were not expressed by premigratory and intermediate NCC in our data, <italic>Myh9</italic> and <italic>Myh10</italic> were expressed, but didn’t exhibit a significant difference or change in their expression levels. This suggests that myosin-II microfilaments localized to the adherens junction-associated circumferential actin belt may not have been impacted at this stage of NCC EMT. At the same time, subcluster 2 and 10 cells exhibit an increase in <italic>Rac</italic>, <italic>Rack1</italic> and <italic>Cdc42</italic> gene expression which is indicative of cytoskeletal rearrangement and the formation of cell protrusions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These alterations in gene expression are molecular indicators of the cellular mechanisms that underpin EMT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>Mouse cranial NCC undergo EMT and delamination in S or G2/M phase cell cycle</title>
<p>Since intermediate NCC stages represent a transitional or intermediate phase between premigratory and migratory NCC, the molecular and signaling pathway signatures uniquely expressed by these intermediate NCC can reveal essential regulatory mechanisms governing NCC EMT and delamination. Analysis of cell cycle gene expression, for example, indicated that EMT intermediate NCC populations exhibit distinct cell cycle phase properties or characteristics. NCC in subcluster 2’ primarily express S phase cell cycle genes such as <italic>Pcna</italic>, <italic>Pol1</italic> subunits, <italic>Plk1</italic>, <italic>Ccnd</italic> and <italic>Mcm</italic> family members. In contrast, NCC in subcluster 10’ predominantly express G2/M phase cell cycle genes including <italic>Mik67</italic>, <italic>Aurka/b</italic>, <italic>Cenp</italic> and <italic>Kif</italic> family members (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>).</p>

<p>To understand the potential for any temporal or lineage relationships between the two intermediate stage NCC populations based on their different cell cycle states, we performed pseudotime trajectory analysis on the entire NCC population using Monocle 3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>). Premigratory and EMT intermediate NCC were identified as the earliest discrete populations to form among the entire cranial NCC population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, late migratory NCC represent a more mature stage of NCC development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Results from the pseudotime analysis indirectly support the identities previously assigned to the cranial NCC subclusters under both resolutions. The trajectory analysis also demonstrates that NCC can arise through two independent paths and initially become two distinct intermediate populations (subcluster 2’ and 10’) during EMT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Later the trajectories or lineages of the intermediate NCC subclusters then merge back together into a single or common population of early migratory NCC, before ultimately maturing into still as yet undifferentiated late migratory NCC as they colonize the frontonasal or pharyngeal arch mesenchyme (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results imply that NCC representing two distinct intermediate stages form simultaneously and independently during development. Moreover, the different cell cycle status of subclusters 2’ and 10’ suggest that premigratory NCC can undergo EMT and delamination in either S phase or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The trajectory analysis further depicts that EMT intermediate NCC and their immediate lineages are not fate restricted to any specific cranial NCC derivative at this timepoint.</p>

<title>Cell cycle regulation is critical for mouse cranial NCC EMT and delamination</title>
<p>Since EMT intermediate NCC are either in S phase or G2/M phase of the cell cycle, we then investigated whether cell cycle regulation plays a significant role in driving mouse cranial NCC delamination. We dissected E8.5 <italic>Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> mouse embryos and examined the expression of cell cycle markers to compare the cell cycle status of delaminating NCC at the neural plate border in cranial tissues versus premigratory non-delaminating NCC in in the neural plate border of the trunk. EdU and phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) were used to label S phase and G2/M phase of the cell cycle respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). A majority of delaminating cranial NCC express either EdU or pHH3 or both. Only a very small percentage of cells do not express either of these cell cycle markers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, almost 50% of premigratory, non- delaminating trunk NCC in the dorsolateral neural tube, do not express either cell cycle marker (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). These observations imply that specific cell cycle phases are intimately connected to mouse cranial NCC EMT and delamination.</p>

<caption><p>Cell cycle regulation plays an important role in mouse cranial NCC delamination and EMT. (A) Cell cycle marker staining of early E8.5 mouse embryonic cranial and trunk tissues reveals differences in cell cycle status between cranial delaminating premigratory NCC and trunk neural plate border cells. EdU (magenta) and pHH3 (cyan) staining were performed on 10um transverse sections of early E8.5 (5-7 somites) <italic>Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> mouse embryo cranial and trunk tissues. (B) E8.0 CD1 mouse embryos treated with Aphidicolin exhibit reduced migratory NCC that primarily express pHH3. Cranial sections of treated embryos were stained with Sox10, EdU and pHH3 (magenta) and arrowheads indicate migratory NCC expressing pHH3. Most remaining migratory NCC in Aphidicolin treated samples express pHH3. In contrast, a small proportion of migratory NCC in control DMSO treated samples express pHH3. (C) Cell cycle staining quantification of delaminating premigratory NCC in the cranial neural plate border shows that most cells express cell cycle markers. Staining and quantification were performed on delaminating premigratory NCC in the cranial neural plate border of 5-7 somite <italic>Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> mouse embryos (n=3). The neural plate border region was manually selected in the most dorsolateral domain of the neural plate. EdU+%=the percentage of EdU positive cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC in the selected neural plate border domain. pHH3+%= the percentage of pHH3 positive cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC. EdU+pHH3+%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double positive cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC. EdU-pHH3-%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double negative cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC. (D) Cell cycle staining quantification of trunk neural plate border cells shows that a significant proportion of cells do not express any cell cycle markers. Staining and quantification were performed on trunk neural plate border cells of 5-7 somite <italic>Wnt1- Cre;RosaeYFP</italic> mouse embryos (n=3). The neural plate border region was manually selected in the most dorsolateral domain of the neural plate. EdU+%=the percentage of EdU positive cells within DAPI positive neural plate border cells at the trunk axial level. pHH3+%= the percentage of pHH3 positive cells within DAPI positive trunk neural plate border cells. EdU+pHH3+%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double positive cells within DAPI positive trunk neural plate border cells. EdU-pHH3-%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double negative cells within DAPI positive trunk neural plate border cells. (E) Quantification of Sox10 expressing migratory NCC upon Aphidicolin and control treatment reveals fewer cranial migratory NCC in Aphidicolin treated embryos. Sox10 staining and quantification were performed on cranial sections of 4-6 somite CD1 mouse embryos post treatment (n=3 per treatment; ****p&lt;0.0001). For quantification, we calculated the ratio of Sox10 positive migratory NCC over DAPI positive neural plate/neuroepithelial cells.</p></caption>

<p>To further validate the association between cell cycle status and cranial NCC EMT and delamination, we inhibited S phase during early NCC development by incubating E8.0 CD1 mouse embryos in whole embryo roller culture with Aphidicolin. After 12 hours of treatment, we quantified the number of migratory NCC via Sox10 immunostaining to determine the number of premigratory NCC that delaminated. Cell cycle status was also evaluated in DMSO (control) and Aphidicolin treated samples via EdU and pHH3 staining. Based on our trajectory analyses, we hypothesized that inhibiting S phase progression would block S phase delamination but not G2/M phase delamination. As we expected, the EdU signal was completely absent in Aphidicolin treated embryos demonstrating that cells cannot enter S phase post treatment (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). The Aphidicolin treatment did not induce cell death as the level of TUNEL staining in treated embryos was similar to that observed in controls (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). Quantification of Sox10 positive cells revealed significantly fewer migratory neural crest cells in the craniofacial region of Aphidicolin treated embryos compared to DMSO treated control embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Similarly, we also treated E8.0 <italic>Mef2c-F10N-LacZ</italic> embryos with Aphidicolin for 12 hours in roller culture and observed fewer migratory NCC compared to control embryos as evidenced by LacZ staining (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, pHH3 is expressed by a major proportion of the remaining migratory NCC after Aphidicolin treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). This data is consistent with the pseudotime trajectory analysis that cranial NCC delamination in G2/M phase of the cell cycle (subcluster 10’ NCC) is independent of delamination in S phase of the cell cycle (subcluster 2’ NCC). Disrupting S phase of the cell cycle didn’t prohibit EMT intermediate NCC in G2/M phase of the cell cycle from delaminating and forming migratory NCC that express G2/M phase cell cycle markers. Thus, our data shows that cranial NCC delamination is disrupted upon S phase cell cycle inhibition, which supports the hypothesis that cell cycle regulation is critical for cranial NCC delamination in mouse embryos.</p>

<p>To identify and define EMT intermediate stage NCC <italic>in vivo</italic> during mouse cranial NCC development, we used the scRNA-seq data to extract genes that were differentially expressed (threshold based on average logFC ≥ 0.25) in the intermediate NCC populations (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>To confirm that the intermediate stage markers <italic>Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> are expressed during NCC delamination, and determine the spatial location of the intermediate stage NCC, we performed signal amplification by exchange reaction for multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization (SABER-FISH). SABER-FISH was chosen for our multiplexed analyses of gene expression because SABER-FISH probes lack secondary structure which facilitates increased sensitivity and depth of tissue penetration. SABER-FISH oligo pools were designed for <italic>Wnt1</italic>, <italic>Sox10, Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3,</italic> using stringent parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kishi et al. 2019</xref>). Intermediate stage marker probes were validated by comparing the expression patterns of the SABER-FISH staining for <italic>Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> with traditional in situ hybridization staining in transverse histological sections (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>). The expression of <italic>Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> matched between SABER-FISH and traditional in situ hybridization methods, validating our probe design (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Following individual validation, we then performed combined staining to visualize the spatial distribution of all the genes in the same tissue section (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The intermediate stage markers <italic>Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> appeared to overlap in expression in the dorsal most region of the neural fold, where EMT takes place as evidenced by the presence of <italic>Sox10</italic> labelled migratory NCC adjacent to the neuroepithelium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Spatial expression of these markers changes over developmental time, thus overlap of expression in the dorsal most region of the neural fold was not observed in older embryos in regions where EMT had concluded. To better visualize and confirm co-localized expression of these genes in the same dorsolateral region of the neural plate border, we generated polyline kymographs depicting the average intensity of each gene’s fluorescent signal along the dorsal most region of the neural fold and into the migratory NCC population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). We observed a consistent pattern of activity in which <italic>Wnt1</italic> is highly expressed in the dorsal neuroepithelium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). However, in the most dorsolateral domain, where <italic>Wnt1</italic> expression is slightly diminished, the intermediate stage NCC markers <italic>Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> are highly expressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, minimal <italic>Sox10</italic> expression is detected in this transition region at the edge of the neuroepithelium, but high levels of <italic>Sox10</italic> in the clear absence of <italic>Wnt1, Dlc1, Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3,</italic> is observed in migratory NCC located more ventrally (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Therefore, our data indicates that EMT intermediate stages can not only be transcriptionally defined, but also spatially resolved to the dorsolateral most region of the neuroepithelium.</p>

<title>EMT intermediate stage marker gene Dlc1 regulates NCC delamination</title>
<p>Having transcriptionally defined intermediate stage NCC and determined their spatial location during delamination, it was important to test whether any of the intermediate stage signature genes, <italic>Dlc1</italic>, <italic>Pak3</italic> or <italic>Sp5</italic>, play functional or essential roles in NCC development. We prioritized <italic>Dlc1</italic> over <italic>Pak3</italic> and <italic>Sp5</italic> because <italic>Dlc1</italic> is not expressed by premigratory NCC but is expressed at high levels in all EMT intermediate stage NCC. Furthermore, <italic>Dlc1</italic> null mutant mice are embryonically lethal and exhibit craniofacial malformation phenotypes. Specifically, gross morphological anomalies of craniofacial tissues such as frontonasal prominence and pharyngeal arch hypoplasia, are apparent in E10.5 Dlc1 null mouse embryos, which is suggestive of a perturbation of NCC development. In contrast, <italic>Pak3</italic> and <italic>Sp5</italic> are expressed in premigratory NCC, but in only 50-60% of intermediate stage NCC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Pak3</italic> and <italic>Sp5</italic> null mutant mice are healthy and fertile with no obvious abnormalities. Therefore, we hypothesized that alone, <italic>Dlc1</italic> loss-of-function would more likely perturb cranial NCC delamination.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we knocked down <italic>Dlc1</italic> by injecting <italic>Dlc1</italic> shRNA-based lentiviruses and control scrambled shRNA lentiviruses into the amniotic cavity of E7.5 CD1 mouse embryos. Since the neural plate remains open at this developmental stage, all neuroepithelial cells are exposed or in contact with amniotic fluid containing virus. The embryos were then cultured for 24 hours after which we assessed the number of migratory NCC via <italic>Sox10</italic> staining, to determine how many premigratory NCC underwent EMT and delamination (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We subsequently observed that the number of migratory NCC was significantly reduced in all <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown embryos (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). In fact, each of the <italic>Dlc1</italic> shRNA constructs led to a significant reduction in the number of migratory NCC compared to their respective control (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe any difference in cell death in <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown embryos comparable to controls (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). On average, a 30% reduction of <italic>Dlc1</italic> expression was achieved by each <italic>Dlc1</italic> shRNA lentivirus knockdown (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6-figure supplement 1</xref>), and notably, the <italic>Dlc1</italic> isoforms targeted by the different <italic>Dlc1</italic> shRNA constructs used in this study suggest a correlation with <italic>Dlc1</italic> null mouse embryos and their phenotypes.</p>

Consequently, <italic>Dlc1a</italic> shRNA is capable of exclusively eliminating the expression of <italic>Dlc1</italic> mRNA variant 2 (isoform 2) since the same exon region is not present in variant 1 or 3. Interestingly, one of the <italic>Dlc1</italic> null mouse models, <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup>gt/gt</sup>, carries a gene trap vector inserted into intron 1, which results in reduction of the 6.1 kb transcript (Dlc1 isoform 2) alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sabbir et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the craniofacial phenotypes observed in <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup>gt/gt</sup> null mice are caused by abnormal cranial NCC EMT and delamination as shown by <italic>Dlc1a</italic> knockdown in our data. In contrast, <italic>Dlc1b</italic> and <italic>Dlc1c</italic> shRNA constructs both target exon 5 of <italic>Dlc1</italic> mRNA variant 2 and 3, which is the same as exon 9 of variant 1. Consequently, all three <italic>Dlc1</italic> variants should be diminished by <italic>Dlc1b</italic> and <italic>Dlc1c</italic> shRNAs. In another <italic>Dlc1</italic> null mouse model, exon 5 was deleted by replacing it with a neomycin resistance gene, which caused a reading frame shift and subsequently premature translation termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Durkin et al. 2005</xref>). This led to the synthesis of truncated polypeptides containing only the first 77 amino acids, which encode the sterile alpha motif (SAM) protein interaction domain and 23 novel residues. Since <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> null, <italic>Dlc1b</italic> and <italic>Dlc1c</italic> shRNAs all cause disruptions in exon 5/9 of <italic>Dlc1</italic> transcripts, there is a strong correlation between the <italic>Dlc1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> null craniofacial phenotypes and cranial NCC EMT defects observed in <italic>Dlc1b</italic> and <italic>Dlc1c</italic> knockdown mouse embryos. Collectively, these results therefore demonstrate an important functional role for Dlc1 in mammalian NCC EMT and delamination. Moreover, our results suggest that genes that are differentially expressed in intermediate NCC can play a regulatory role during EMT and delamination.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>EMT is a cellular process that converts epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. EMT is essential for normal development and is a key driver of disease pathogenesis, particularly cancer metastasis. Although classically considered to be a binary event, studies of EMT in cancer identified multiple intermediate states within the EMT spectrum, a phenomenon termed epithelial to mesenchymal plasticity (EMP). However, it remained to be determined whether developmental EMT is also a developmental EMP process. Our goal therefore was to determine whether intermediate stages of NCC development during EMT could be transcriptionally and spatially defined, and then test whether transitional stage associated genes are functionally required for NCC EMT and delamination.</p>
<p>Through scRNA-seq analysis of mouse cranial tissues at E8.5, which coincided with the onset of NCC EMT and delamination, we identified two populations of NCC, whose gene expression profiles or signatures were representative of intermediate stages between premigratory and migratory NCC. Furthermore, we determined that the two intermediate populations could be defined by their distinct transcriptional states which were consistent with being in either S phase or G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Although it is possible that the two intermediate populations represent a single population that is temporarily bifurcated due to cell cycle asynchrony, the pseudotime trajectory analysis suggests that these intermediate stage cranial NCC populations can undergo EMT and delaminate in either S phase or G2/M phase, simultaneously, and independently of each other. This is further supported by the observation that S phase cell cycle inhibition failed to completely eliminate NCC delamination since NCCs delaminating in G2/M phase were observed. The two intermediate populations later merge into a single or common pool of early migratory NCC suggesting they do not have distinct fates following migration that can be tied to their cell cycle status as the time of delamination. This is not indicative a common progenitor of both ectomesenchyme and neuro/glial/pigment derivatives, but rather, is consistent with the known plasticity and potency of migrating NCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sandell and Trainor 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Trainor and Krumlauf 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Trainor and Krumlauf 2000b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>These results correlate with observations that cell cycle status is also a critical factor regulating NCC delamination in avian and zebrafish embryos. For example, BrdU incorporation, which demarcates proliferating cells in S phase of the cell cycle, was previously used to evaluate the cell cycle status of emigrating trunk NCC, dorsal midline neuroepithelial cells and surrounding cells at the segmental plate, epithelial somite and dissociating somite axial levels in chicken embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burstyn-Cohen and Kalcheim 2002</xref>). Most emigrating trunk NCC (about 80%) at the epithelial somite and dissociating somite axial levels were in S phase of the cell cycle, while less than 50% of dorsal neuroepithelial cells were BrdU+. Similarly, slice culture of the trunk of chicken embryos also revealed that most premigratory NCC contained basally positioned nuclei indicative of S phase. Interestingly, however, a small proportion of premigratory NCC presented as round mitotic cells, whose daughter cells later became migratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahlstrom and Erickson 2009</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> time-lapse imaging of chicken embryos revealed that half of the delaminating trunk NCC that were tracked, displayed signs of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">McKinney et al. 2013</xref>). However, in most cases, only one progeny of a mitotic premigratory NCC was observed to exit the neural tube and become a migratory NCC. Interestingly, time-lapse imaging of zebrafish embryos also revealed active cell division in dorsal neuroepithelial cells prior to NCC delamination and EMT. The daughter cells of those divisions then translocate into the basal side of the neuroepithelium, where EMT subsequently occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berndt et al. 2008</xref>). Whether delaminating NCC undergo proliferation and cell division in zebrafish embryos remains to be investigated, however, active cell division in the dorsal neuroepithelium is a shared feature of NCC delamination in avian and aquatic species. Even though our findings primarily illustrate the association of distinct cell cycle phases with intermediate stage NCC during EMT and delamination, this work has emphasized the importance of further examining the cell division and cell cycle activities of delaminating NCC in mouse embryos as critical contributors to normal development and the pathogenesis of neurocristopathies.</p>
<p>In contrast to delaminating trunk NCC, only around 30% of delaminating cranial NCC in chicken embryos were found to be in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Théveneau et al. 2007</xref>) illustrating considerable differences between cranial and trunk neural crest cells and in the correlation between cell cycle phase and delamination. Blocking G1/S transition in the trunk of chicken embryos via <italic>in ovo</italic> electroporation, or via small molecule inhibitors in explanted neural primordia, prevents the onset of NCC delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burstyn-Cohen and Kalcheim 2002</xref>). Furthermore, BMP and Wnt canonical signaling regulates the G1/S transition and promotes trunk NCC delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burstyn-Cohen et al. 2004</xref>). Although it remains to be determined which signaling pathways regulate cell cycle phase progression in the intermediate or transitional populations of cranial NCC in mouse embryos, our results illustrate an evolutionarily conserved mechanistic role for cell cycle progression in NCC delamination in vertebrate embryos.</p>
<p>The intermediate populations of cranial NCC in mouse embryos exhibited transcriptional profiles that were characterized by the downregulation of tight junction and polarity genes. This is consistent with the breakdown of intercellular tight junctions and degradation of apicobasal polarity, which are hallmarks of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhao and Trainor 2023</xref>). Further interrogation of genes that were differentially expressed in the intermediate NCC populations revealed <italic>Dlc1</italic>, <italic>Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> based on their relatively high expression levels as potentially specific markers, and regulators of intermediate NCC populations. Through SABER- FISH staining of <italic>Dlc1</italic>, <italic>Sp5</italic> and <italic>Pak3</italic> in combination with <italic>Wnt1</italic> as a marker of premigratory NCC, and <italic>Sox10</italic> as a marker of migratory NCC, we spatially resolved the location of intermediate NCC to the most dorsolateral domain of the cranial neural plate in E8.5 mouse embryos. We then prioritized <italic>Dlc1</italic> for functional analyses because it is expressed at high levels in all EMT intermediate stage NCC, but not in premigratory NCC. Lentiviral shRNA knockdown of <italic>Dlc1</italic> in cultured mouse embryos resulted in a significant reduction in the number of migratory neural crest cells, which may account for the craniofacial and cardiac malformation phenotypes observed in <italic>Dlc1</italic> null mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sabbir et al. 2010</xref>). Gross morphological defects in craniofacial tissues are apparent in E10.5 <italic>Dlc1</italic> null mouse embryos. More specifically, <italic>Dlc1</italic> null embryos exhibit hyperplastic frontonasal prominences and pharyngeal arches, a neural tube closure defect and underdeveloped atrial and ventricular walls of the heart. Although phenotypes at earlier developmental stages and during NCC development were not examined in these mutants, <italic>Dlc1</italic>, is primarily expressed in intermediate stage NCC, and plays an important role in NCC EMT, delamination, and the subsequent development of NCC derived tissues. Dlc1 is a Rho GTPase Activating Protein (GAP) that regulates the activity of Rho family GTPases Rho and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al. 2008</xref>). RhoGTPases are known to regulate cell morphology and motility through modulating the activity of the actin cytoskeleton. More specifically, Rho has been shown to facilitate the formation of stress fibers, while Cdc42 is involved in filopodium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al. 2008</xref>). RhoGTPases also regulate the organization of tight junctions, which breakdown during EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Popoff and Geny 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Terry et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, the effect of <italic>Dlc1</italic> knockdown on cranial NCC EMT and delamination may be mediated via disrupted RhoGTPase activity and subsequent downstream cellular changes.</p>
<p>A similar regulatory role for Dlc1 and other GAP family members has also been observed during NCC EMT and delamination in chicken and zebrafish embryos. In chicken embryos, <italic>Dlc1</italic> overexpression results in ectopic trunk NCC delamination, including apically into the neural tube lumen, due to a disruption in apical-basal polarity of dorsal neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Liu et al. 2017</xref>). Furthermore, NCC overexpressing <italic>Dlc1</italic> exhibit a loss of directionality during migration. Conversely, <italic>Dlc1</italic> inhibition and depletion results in less NCC emigration and thus fewer migratory NCC. In addition, the downregulation of <italic>Dlc1</italic> in migrating NCC restricts their motility. Thus, <italic>Dlc1</italic> regulates trunk NCC delamination and migration in chicken embryos. Interestingly, in zebrafish embryos, another GAP family member Arhgap has been shown to modulate NCC EMT and delamination via the localization of Rho activation to designated subcellular compartmentsin concert with promoting localized actomyosin contraction to trigger directional cell motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Clay and Halloran 2013</xref>). More specifically, the knockdown of Arhgap in NCC results in Rho activation, which in turn inhibits NCC EMT and delamination. These data suggest that the role of Dlc1 during NCC delamination might be evolutionarily conserved in vertebrate embryos. However, whether Dlc1 regulates mouse cranial NCC delamination through localized activation of Rho remains to be determined. Nevertheless, consistent with similarities in EMT, delamination and cell migration between neural crest cells and cancer cells, Dlc1 may also play an important role in promoting cell migration during cancer progression. High levels of <italic>DLC1</italic> expression are detected in most melanoma tissues, and functional studies have revealed that DLC1 is both necessary and sufficient for melanoma growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yang et al. 2020b</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study focused on the identification and characterization of NCC EMT intermediate states and essential regulatory factors during cranial NCC delamination and EMT. Nevertheless, whether trunk NCC delamination and EMT also involve intermediate stages and are regulated by similar genetic/cellular elements remains to be explored. Differences between cranial and trunk NCC delamination have been previously identified. For example, in mouse embryos, cranial NCCs delaminate from the dorsolateral neuroepithelium or neural plate border prior to neural plate closure. Trunk NCCs, on the other hand, delaminate from the dorsal neural tube after neural plate closure. In the cranial region, premigratory NCCs delaminate in bulk as a collective stream, to give rise to the cranial ganglia and craniofacial bones and cartilages. In the trunk region, premigratory NCCs delaminate progressively one after another in a chain migration fashion to form the sympathetic ganglia, the dorsal root ganglia, glial cells, and melanocytes. Additionally, key signaling pathways and regulatory networks governing cranial and trunk NCCs in various species have also been shown to differ in these distinct axial populations of NCC (Theveneau &amp; Mayor, 2012). Due to these differences between cranial and trunk NCCs, the molecular and cellular mechanisms discovered during cranial NCC delamination and EMT do not necessarily represent the signaling scheme in trunk NCCs. In order to enhance our knowledge of the gene regulatory network governing trunk NCC delamination/EMT and to decipher whether EMT intermediate states also exist in the trunk region of mouse embryos, scRNA-seq must be performed using trunk tissues during trunk NCC delamination. Since trunk NCC delamination/EMT occurs progressively from anterior to posterior as the embryos grow, it is very important to select correct axial domains of the trunk to match the appropriate or required developmental stage.</p>
<p>In conclusion, through scRNA-sequencing we have transcriptionally identified two distinct intermediate stages of NCC during EMT and delamination based primarily on cell cycle status. Delamination in S phase or G2/M phase seems to occur simultaneously but also independently, resulting in a single or common pool of early migratory NCC. Further interrogation of our transcriptomic dataset revealed <italic>Dlc1</italic> to be a key molecular marker of intermediate stage NCC, and their location in situ in the dorsolateral neural plate, which we spatially resolved in E8.5 mouse embryos. Lastly, we tested and functionally validated that <italic>Dlc1</italic> plays an important role in NCC delamination in mouse embryos. Taken together, our identification and characterization of intermediate stage cranial NCC during their delamination are consistent with NCC EMT being a developmental EMP event. Similar to intermediate EMT states in cancer metastasis, NCC downregulate certain epithelial cell features but maintain co- expression of epithelial cell markers and mesenchymal cell markers during EMT and delamination. Additionally, intermediate stage NCC are localized at the dorsolateral edge of the neural plate border, which is reminiscent of the localization of intermediate EMT states at the leading edge of invasion in several types of primary tumors. However, unlike certain intermediate EMT cells present in the lymph nodes or circulating tumor cells, mouse EMT intermediate NCC represent a transient state and eventually form migratory NCC with mesenchymal character. This suggests that EMP may be a more common developmental phenomenon. Our transcriptional data and signatures of intermediate stage NCC during EMT and delamination can serve as a useful resource for the community. This also now sets the stage for uncovering the gene regulatory networks that govern intermediate stage NCC development and function, and for exploring whether EMP is a feature of other developmental and pathological EMT events such as in gastrulation, wound healing, and fibrosis.</p>

Next, embryos were embedded in OCT, frozen and cryosectioned at 20µm thickness. Sections were placed on Histogrip treated slides and warmed to encourage adherence, washed 3 times for 5 minutes in PBTW, incubated in Hybridization wash buffer and allowed to equilibrate to 37°C (the lowest melting temperature limit out of our probe set). Sections were then incubated with pre- equilibrated probes overnight (roughly 16 hours) at 37°C. The next day the sections were washed with Hybridization wash buffer, 2X SSCT (2×SSC + 0.1% Tween-20) and PBTW and then the first set of fluorophores were applied to the sections [set one: Sox10, Wnt1 and Sp5; set two: Pak3 and Dlc1] and left to hybridize at 37°C for 30 minutes. Following fluorophore probe hybridization, sections were washed in PBTW with 1:1000 DAPI for 10 minutes followed by PBTW 2 times for 5 minutes.

The first set of fluorophore probes were removed by washing 3 times for 5 minutes in PBTW washes, followed by 3 washes with Displacement buffer and another 3 washes in PBTW. Slides were remounted with VECTASHIELD®, covered with a coverslip and imaged to ensure all previous fluorescent probes had been removed. After imaging, the coverslip was removed again, and the sections were rinsed in PBTW. 3 times for 5 minutes. The second fluorophore probes were then applied to the sections and allowed to hybridize for 30 minutes at 37 °C.

<title>SABER-FISH image processing</title>
<p>All image processing was performed in FIJI/ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schindelin et al. 2012</xref>) and plugin source code can be accessed through <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jayunruh/Jay_Plugins">https://github.com/jayunruh/Jay_Plugins</ext-link>. Plugins can be used by following the Stowers Fiji update site. Convenience macros that combine these plugin functionalities are included in the supplemental materials.</p>
<p>After acquisition, images were scaled by 0.5 with averaging (i.e. binning). Background subtraction was run on the scaled images using the “roi average subtract jru v1” plugin. This plugin takes the average intensity signal in a selected region of interest or chosen area of background in the image and removes that average across the image. The two series of z-stack images acquired for each set of probes were then aligned and combined through a “registration_macro.ijm”. In summary, this macro registers the two z-stacks according to DAPI signal from a selected representative z-slice. Alignment is achieved through using an implementation of the TurboReg tool set to a rigid body transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thevenaz et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Once the two sets of probes have been aligned, the signals are measured and tracked with the macro “all_combined_aftersubreg.ijm”. Images were first copied, and then sum projected in z before undergoing a Gaussian blur with sigma value 4. Nuclei are then identified in the DAPI channel by a maximum finding approach with a minimum spot distance of 70 pixels and a threshold of 10% of the maximum intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Varberg et al. 2022</xref>). Those spots provided a locational value for later mapping of transcript signals in two dimensions. Individual transcripts are found in three dimensions in the original combined images with a Gaussian blur with sigma value 1 and a rolling ball background subtraction with a radius of 10 pixels. Because the signal is very punctate and slides can accumulate auto-fluorescent debris over the course of staining, we next removed the 20 brightest spots in 3D with a spheroid of xy diameter 15 and z diameter 5 to ensure we were evaluating true signal. Spots were found using the same maximum finding approach as above but in 3 dimensions with a minimum separation of 12 pixels in xy and 4 slices in z and a threshold at 7% of the maximum intensity in each channel. The positions of those found maxima were then sum projected in z to estimate the number of transcripts in the vicinity of each nuclear maximum (see above).</p>
<p>An image showing the number of transcripts per cell was generated using “make_nuclear_image.py” macro based on the nuclei and transcript locations identified in the previous step. To generate the polyline kymograph showcasing spatial expression through the tissue, a zoomed in region of the transcript mapped images was generated around the dorsal neural fold tips. A line of 100 pixel width was drawn starting from the middle of the neuroepithelium towards the dorsal most tip of the neural fold and then ventrally into the underlying mesoderm and migratory neural crest cell population. The polyline kymograph was generate based on this line using the plugin “polyline kymograph jru v1”.</p>

<title>ShRNA-based lentiviral plasmids and lentivirus production</title>
<p>A shRNA plasmid clone set targeting <italic>Dlc1</italic> was obtained from GeneCopoeia (MSH100727-LVRU6MP). Each set contains 3 shRNA expression constructs and 1 scrambled shRNA control. Each shRNA hairpin consists of a 7 base loop and 19-29 base stem optimized for specific gene sequences as detailed by the manufacturer. Glycerol stocks of shRNA-based lentiviral plasmids were cultured in LB buffer with 100lilμg/ml of ampicillin (Amresco # 0339). Plasmids were purified using a HiSpeed Plasmid midi kit (Qiagen #12643).</p>
<p>A total of 4e<sup>6</sup>-5e<sup>6</sup> of 293T cells were seeded in one 10cm plate with 12ml of media without antibiotics the day before transfection. On the following day, when the cells reached 70-80% confluence, transfection was performed as follows: shRNA-based lentiviral plasmids (7ug), Pax2 packaging plasmid (7ug) and VSVG envelop plasmid (1ug) were mixed with 45ul of Fugene HD transfection reagent (Promega, cat#E5911) in 1.5ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco, cat#31985070). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes and then added dropwise to the plate of 293T cells. Virus-containing old culture media was harvested after 48 hours and 72 hours upon transfection. We then mixed the virus-containing media and added HEPES to reach 10mM final concentration. The media was spun down at 500g for 5 minutes at 4°C to remove cell debris and the supernatant was then collected and filtered through 0.45um filter into a falcon tube. We added 1 volume of 4x lentivirus concentrator solution (40% PEG-8000 in 1.2M NaCl) to 3 volumes of the filtered virus, mixed well and placed the tube on a shaker (60rpm/minute) at 4°C for overnight. The filtered virus was centrifuged at 1600g for 1hour at 4°C and the supernatant was carefully removed without disturbing the pellet. The pellet was then thoroughly resuspended with 1ml of cold PBS by gently pipetting up and down. The solution was transferred to 1.5ml tube and placed at room temperature for 10 minutes. We gently pipetted the virus again about 20 times and spun it down in a microcentrifuge at full speed for 3 minutes to pellet the protein debris.

<p>Fluorescently stained section images were captured on an upright Zeiss LSM-700 laser scanning confocal microscope using 405 nm, 488 nm, 555 nm and 639 nm excitation lasers. Emissions filters used to acquire images were Far-red: LP 640nm, Red: BP 505-600 nm, GFP: BP 490-555 nm, DAPI: SP 490 nm. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Fluar 10x objective lens. For each specimen, a z-stack of images was collected and processed as a maximum intensity projection.</p>
<p>All the images used for quantification were acquired with an Orca Flash 4.0 sCMOS 100fps at full resolution on a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope equipped with a Yokagawa CSU W1 10,000 rpm Spinning Disk Confocal system.

<title>Image processing</title>
<p>All analyses of fluorescent intensity were performed using Fiji and custom-written ImageJ Macro and python notebooks. Prior to the analyses, raw images were processed by subtracting background and were then projected for the max intensity to form single multiple- color images. Individual cells were segmented based on DAPI channel with a pre-trained cellpose model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Stringer et al. 2021</xref>), and then the mean intensity of the individual channel was measured by FIJI. The segmented cells were classified as either positive or negative based on their intensity in the corresponding channel. For images from the shRNA lentivirus injection experiments, due to the large variety of background signals, we manually labeled positive cells and then trained a cellpose model based on the manually labeled cells. Positive cells were classified based on the trained model, and their coordinates were recorded and saved to ImageJ ROI files for future verification.</p>
<p>For the cell cycle staining analysis, cells in the most dorsal lateral domain of the cranial and trunk neural plate were selected and saved to ImageJ ROI files. In cranial neural plate border cells, the following quantifications were performed: EdU+%=the percentage of EdU positive cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC; pHH3+%= the percentage of pHH3 positive cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC; EdU+pHH3+%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double positive cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC; EdU-pHH3-%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double negative cells within eYFP positive delaminating premigratory NCC. In trunk neural plate border cells, the following quantifications were performed: EdU+%=the percentage of EdU positive cells within DAPI positive neural plate border cells at the trunk axial level; pHH3+%= the percentage of pHH3 positive cells within DAPI positive trunk neural plate border cells; EdU+pHH3+%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double positive cells within DAPI positive trunk neural plate border cells; EdU-pHH3-%= the percentage of EdU and pHH3 double negative cells within DAPI positive trunk neural plate border cells. For the Aphidicolin treatment experiments, neuroepithelial cells and Sox10 positive migratory NCC were selected and saved to ImageJ ROI files. The ratio of Sox10 positive migratory NCC over DAPI positive neural plate/neuroepithelial cells was calculated. For the shRNA lentivirus injection experiments, Sox10 positive migratory NCC were selected and saved to ImageJ ROI files. The number of Sox10 positive cells was quantified.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study reports <bold>compelling</bold> findings that intermediate states exist in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during natural development and differentiation of mammalian neural crest cells, similar to recent reports in cancer. The authors determined that there were at least two paths to delamination and migration - one that occurs during S-phase of cell cycle and another during G2/M phase, and that the process of delamination is not restricted to cell fate. Finally, the authors showed that expression of Dlc1 may be used to identify cells in an intermediate state of EMT as well as their spatial location in the mouse embryo. The work will be of interest to developmental biologists, neurobiologists and cancer researchers.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This describes the molecular identity of the intermediate status of cranial neural crest cells (NCCs) during the initial delamination process. Taking advantage of single-cell RNA seq, the authors identify new populations of cells during EMT characterized by a specific set of gene expressions, including Dlc1. Promigratory cranial NCCs differentiate through different trajectories depending on their cell cycle phases but converge into a common progenitor, then differentiate into mesenchymal cells expressing region-specific genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Single-cell RNA seq data convincingly support what the authors claim. This is the first time to identify intermediate states between premigratory and migratory cranial NCCs. Silencing one of the marker genes, Dlc1, reduces the migratory activity of cranial NCCs. These findings deepen our understanding of the mechanism of EMT in general.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None after substantial revision.</p>

<p>Zhao et al., focus on mechanisms through which cells convert from epithelium to mesenchyme and become migratory. This phenomenon of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs during both embryonic development and cancer progression. During cancer progression, EMT seemingly includes cells at intermediate states as defined by the combinatorial expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. But the importance of these markers and the role of these intermediate states remains unclear. Moreover, whether EMT during development also involves equivalent intermediate cell states is not known. To address this gap in knowledge, the authors devise a strategy to identify and characterize changes that an embryonic population of cells called the cranial neural crest undergo as they delaminate from the neuroepithelium and become a highly migratory population of mesenchymal cells that ultimately give rise to a broad range of derivatives.</p>
<p>To isolate and study the neural crest, the authors use embryos collected at E8.5 from two transgenic mouse lines. Wnt1-Cre;RosaeYFP labels Wnt1-positive neuroepithelial cells in the dorsolateral neural plate, which includes pre-migratory neural crest that reside in the dorsal neuroectoderm and neural plate border before induction (as well as some other lineages). Mef2c-F10N-LacZ leverages a neural crest cell-specific enhancer of Mef2c to control LacZ expression in predominantly migratory neural crest. This dual genetic approach that allows the authors to distinguish and compare pre-migratory and migratory neural crest cells is a strength of the work.</p>
<p>To assay for the differential expression of genes involved in the EMT and migration of cranial neural crest, the authors perform single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using current methods. A strength is a large sample size per mouse line, and relatively high numbers of single cells analyzed. The authors identify six major cell/tissue types present in mouse E8.5 cranial tissues using known markers, which they then segregate into a cranial neural crest cluster using a well-reasoned bioinformatic strategy. The cranial neural crest cluster contains pre-migratory and migratory cells that they partition further into five subclusters and then characterize using the differential expression and combinatorial patterns of neural crest specifier genes, markers of pre-migratory neural crest, markers of early versus late migratory neural crest, markers of undifferentiated versus differentiated neural crest, tissue-specific markers, and region-specific markers. One weakness is that there is little attempt to map potential novel genes and/or pathways that also distinguish these clusters.</p>
<p>The authors then go on to subdivide the five cranial neural crest subclusters into almost two dozen smaller subclusters, again using the combinatorial expression of known markers (e.g., neural crest genes, cell junction genes, and cell cycle genes). A weakness is that the marker analysis and accompanying interpretation of the results relies heavily on the purported roles of different genes as described in the published work of others, which potentially introduces some untested assumptions and a bit of hand-waving into the study. Moreover, the limited correlation between mRNA and protein abundance for cell cycle markers is well documented in the literature but the authors rely heavily on gene expression to determine cell cycle status. Even though the authors add a compelling Edu/pHH3 double-labeling experiment and cell cycle inhibition studies, the work would be strengthened by including some analysis of protein expression to see if the cell cycle correlations hold up. Nonetheless, the subcluster and cell cycle analyses lead the authors to conclude that there are a series of intermediate cell states between neural crest EMT and delamination, and that cell cycle regulation is a defining feature and necessary component of those states. These novel findings are generally well supported by the data.</p>
<p>To test if there are spatiotemporal differences in the localization of neural crest cells during EMT in vivo, the authors apply a cutting-edge technique called signal amplification by exchange reaction for multiplexed fluorescent in situ hybridization (SABER-FISH), which they validate using standard in situ hybridization. The authors select specific marker genes that seem justified based on their scRNA-seq dataset, and they generate a series of convincing images and quantitative data that add valuable depth to the story.</p>
<p>As a functional test of their hypothesis that one of the genes indicative of an EMT intermediate stage (i.e., Dlc1) is essential for neural crest migration, the authors use a lentivirus-mediated knockdown strategy. A strength is that the authors include appropriate scramble and cell death controls as part of their experimental design.</p>
<p>The authors use Sox10 as a marker to count neural crest cells, but Sox10 may only label a subset of neural crest cells and thus some unaffected lineages may not have been counted. Although the data are persuasive, a second marker for counting neural crest cells following knockdown would make the analysis more robust.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a first-rate study with many more strengths than weaknesses. The authors generate high quality data, and their interpretations are reasonable and balanced. Another strength is the writing, which is clear and well organized, and the figures (including supplemental), which are excellent and provide unambiguous visualization of some very complex data sets. The methods are state-of the art and are effectively executed, and they will be useful to the broader cell and developmental biology community. The work contains well-substantiated findings and supports the conclusion that EMT is a highly dynamic, multi-step process, which was previously thought to be more-or-less binary. Such findings will alter the way the field thinks about EMT in neural crest and the work will likely serve as an important example alongside cancer metastasis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhao et al. address the question of whether intermediate states of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) exist in a natural developmental context as well as in cancer cells. This is important not only for our understanding of these developmental systems but also for their development as resources for new anti-cancer approaches. Guided by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of delaminating mouse cranial neural crest cells, they identify two distinct populations with transcriptional signatures intermediate between neuroepithelial progenitors and migrating crest. Both clusters are also spatially intermediate and are actively cycling, with one in S-phase and one in G2/M. They show that blocking progression through S phase prior to the onset of delamination and knockdown of intermediate state marker Dlc1 both reduce the number of migratory cells that have completed EMT. Overall, the work provides a modern take and new insights into the classical developmental process of neural crest delamination.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Deep analysis of the scRNAseq dataset revealed previously unappreciated cell populations intermediate between premigratory and migratory crest.</p>
<p>
• The observation that delaminating/intermediate neural crest cells appear to be in S or G2/M phase is interesting and worth reporting, though the ultimate significance remains unclear, given that they do not make distinct derivatives depending on their cycle state.</p>
<p>
• The authors employ new methods for multiplex spatial imaging to more accurately define their populations of interest and their relative positions.</p>
<p>
• The authors present evidence that intermediate state gene Dlc1 (a Rho GAP) is not just a marker but functionally required for neural crest delamination in mouse, as previously shown in chicken.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Similar experiments involving blockade of cell cycle progression and Dlc1 dose manipulation were previously performed in chick models, as noted in the discussion. The newly-defined intermediate states give added context to the results, but they are not entirely novel.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) More explanation/description of Fig 3C and 3D would be helpful for readers, including the color code of 3D and black lines shown in both panels.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added more description to the legend of Figure 3, and we have used the same color code as in Figure 2, which we now specifically note in the figure legend as well.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Differences between cranial and trunk NCC could be experimentally shown or discussed. Fig 4C shows some differences between these two populations, but in situ, results using Dlc1/Sp5/Pak3 probes in the trunk region may be informative, like Fig 5 supplement 2 for cranial NCCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point. The focus of our study was on cranial neural crest cells, and the single cell sequencing data is therefore truly reflective of only cranial neural crest cells. We have not functionally tested for the roles of Dlc1/Sp5/Pak3 in trunk neural crest cells, however, based on the expression and loss-of-function phenotypes of Sp5 or Pak3 knockout mice, we predict they individually may not play a significant role. It remains plausible that Dlc1 could play an important role in the delamination of trunk neural crest cells, but we have not tested that definitively. Nonetheless, Sabbir et al 2010 showed in a gene trap mouse mutant that Dlc1 is expressed in trunk neural crest cells. Regarding the similarities and differences between cranial and trunk neural crest cells as noted by the reviewer with respect to Figure 4, it’s important to recognize the temporal differences illustrated in Figure 4. Neural crest cell delamination proceeds in a progressive wave from anterior to posterior, but also that the analysis was designed to quantify cell cycle status before and during neural crest cell delamination. We have compared cranial and trunk neural crest cells in more detail in the discussion and also speculate what might happen in the trunk based on what we know from other species.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Discussion can be added about the potential functions of Dlc1 for NCC migration and/or differentiation based on available info from KO mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added specific details regarding the published Dlc1 knockout mouse phenotype to the discussion, particularly with respect to the craniofacial anomalies which included frontonasal prominence and pharyngeal arch hyperplasia, and defects in neural tube closure and heart development. Although the study didn’t investigate the mechanisms underpinning the Dlc1 knockout phenotype, the craniofacial morphological anomalies would be consistent with a deficit in neural crest cell delamination reducing the number of migrating neural crest cells, as we observed in our Dlc1 knockdown experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors used the (Tg(Wnt1-cre)11Rth Tg(Wnt1-GAL4)11Rth/J) line but work from the Bush lab (see Lewis et al., 2013) has demonstrated fully penetrant abnormal phenotypes that affect the midbrain neuroepithelium, increased CyclinD1 expression and overt cell proliferation as measured by BrdU incorporation. The authors should explain why they used this mouse line instead of the Wnt1-Cre2 mice (129S4-Tg(Wnt1-cre)1Sor/J) in the Jackson Laboratory (which lacks the phenotypic effects of the original Wnt1-Cre line), or a &quot;Cre-only&quot; control, or at a minimum explain the steps they took to ensure there were no confounding effects on their study, especially since cell proliferation was a major outcome measure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important point, and we thank the reviewer for raising it. Yes, it has been reported that the original Wnt1Cre mice exhibit a midbrain phenotype (Ace et al. 2013). However, it has also been noted that Wnt1Cre2 can exhibit recombination in the male germline leading to ubiquitous recombination (Dinsmore et al., 2022). Therefore, to avoid any potential for bias, we used an equal number of cells derived from the Wnt1  and F10N transgenic line embryos in our scRNA-seq, and this included multiple non-Cre embryos. Our scRNA-seq analysis was therefore not dependent upon Wnt1-Cre, but also because we used whole heads not fluorescence sorted cells. However, Wnt1-Cre lineage tracing was advantageous from a computational perspective to help define cells that were premigratory and migratory in concert with Mef2c-lacZ ¬based on their expression of YFP, LacZ or both. We note these specifics more clearly in the methods.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Results section (line 122) states that scRNA-seq was performed on dissociated cranial tissues but the Methods section (lines 583-584) implies that whole E8.5 mouse embryos were dissociated. Which was dissociated, whole embryos or just cranial tissues? Obviously, the latter would be a better strategy to enrich for cranial neural crest, but the authors also examine the trunk neural crest. This should be clarified in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize that some of the details regarding the tissue isolation were confusing and we have clarified this in the methods and the text. For the record, after isolating E8.5 embryos, we then dissected the head from those embryos, and performed scRNA-seq on dissociated cranial tissues. As the reviewer correctly noted, this approach strategically enriches for cranial neural crest cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors do not justify why they chose a knockdown strategy, which has its limitations including its systemic injection into the amniotic cavity, its likely global and more variable effects, and its need to be conducted in culture. Why the authors did not instead use a Wnt1-Cre-mediated deletion of Dlc1, which would have been &quot;cleaner&quot; and more specific to the neural crest, is not clear (maybe so they could specifically target different Dcl1 isoforms?). Also, the authors use Sox10 as a marker to count neural crest cells, but Sox10 may only label a subset of neural crest cells and thus some unaffected lineages may not have been counted. The authors should mention what is known about the regulation of Dcl1 by Sox10 in the neural crest. Although the data are persuasive, a second marker for counting neural crest cells following knockdown would make the analysis more robust. Can the authors explain why they did not simply use the Mef2c-F10N-LacZ line and count LacZ-positive cells (if fluorescence signal was required for the quantification workflow, then could they have used an anti-beta Galactosidase antibody to label cells)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising these important considerations. It has previously been noted that although Wnt1-Cre is the gold standard for conditional deletion analyses in neural crest cell development, especially migration and differentiation, it is not a good tool for functional studies of the specification and delamination of neural crest cells due to the timing of Wnt1 expression and Cre activation and excision (see Barriga et al., 2015). Therefore, we chose a knockdown strategy instead, and also because it allows us to more rapidly evaluate gene function. We agree that there are limitations to the approach with respect to variability, however, this is outweighed by the ability to repeatedly perform the knockdown at multiple and more relevant temporal stages such as E7.5 (which is prior to the onset of Wnt1-Cre activity), as well as target different isoforms, and also treat large numbers of embryos for quantitative analyses. The advantage of using Sox10 as a marker for counting neural crest cells is that at the time of analysis, cranial neural crest cells are still migrating towards the frontonasal prominences and pharyngeal arches, and the overwhelming majority of these cells are Sox10 positive. Moreover, we can therefore assay every Dlc1 knockdown embryo for Sox10 expression and count the number of migrating neural crest cells. The limitation of using the Mef2c-F10N-LacZ line is that this transgenic line is maintained as a heterozygote, and thus only half the embryos in a litter could reasonably be expected to be lacZ+. But combining Sox10 and Mef2c-F10N-LacZ fluorescent immunostaining for similar analyses in the future is a great idea.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The putative intermediate cells differentially express mRNAs for genes involved in cell adhesion, polarity, and protrusion relative to bona fide premigratory cells (Fig. 2E). This is persuasive evidence, but only differentially expressed genes are shown. Discussing those markers that have not yet changed, e.g. Cdh1 or Zo1 (?), would be instructive and help to clarify the order of events.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the author for this suggestion and we have provided more detail about adherens junction and tight junctions. Cdh1 is not expressed, and although Myh9 and Myh10 are expressed, we did not detect any significant changes. ZO1 is a tight junction protein encoded by the gene Tjp1, which along with other tight junctions protein encoding genes, is downregulated in intermediate NCCs as shown in the Figure 2E.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is unclear whether the two putative intermediate state clusters differ other than their stage of the cell cycle. Based on the trajectory analysis in Fig. 3C-D, the authors state that these two populations form simultaneously and independently but then merge into a single population. However, without further differential expression, it seems more plausible that they represent a single population that is temporarily bifurcated due to cell cycle asynchrony.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed the cell cycle question in the discussion by noting that while it is possible the transition states represent a single population that is temporarily bifurcated due to cell cycle asynchrony, if this were true, then we should expect S phase inhibition to eliminate both transition state groups. Instead, our trajectory analyses suggest that the transition states are initially independent, and furthermore, S phase inhibition did not affect delamination of the other population of neural crest cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors do not present an in-depth comparison of these neural crest intermediate states to previously reported cancer intermediate states. This analysis would reveal how similar the signatures are and thus how extrapolatable these and future findings in delaminating neural crest are to different types of cancer.</p>

<p>We have also added more detail to the discussion to address the potential for similarities and differences in neural crest intermediate states compared to previously reported cancer intermediate states. The challenge, however, is that none of the cancer intermediate states have been characterized at a molecular level. Nonetheless, with the limited molecular markers available, we have not identified any similarities so far, but our datasets are now available for comparison with future cancer EMP datasets.</p>
<p>The reduction in SOX10+ cells may be in part or wholly attributable to inhibition of proliferation AFTER delamination. Showing that there are premigratory NCCs in G2/M at ~E8.0 would bolster the argument that this population is present from the earliest stages.</p>
<p>The presence of premigratory neural crest cells in G2/M is shown by the scRNA-seq data and cell cycle staining data in the neural plate border.</p>

<p>Lines 248-249: The pseudo-time analysis in Fig 3C/D does indicate that the two most mature cell clusters (pharyngeal arch and frontonasal mesenchyme) may arise from common or similar migratory progenitors. However, given the decades of controversy about fate restriction of neural crest cells, the statement that &quot;EMT intermediate NCC and their immediate lineages are not fate restricted to any specific cranial NCC derivative at this timepoint&quot; should be toned down so as to not give the impression that they have identified common progenitors of ectomesenchyme and neuro/glial/pigment derivatives.</p>

<p>We appreciate this comment, because as the reviewer noted, there has been considerable literature and debate about the fate restriction and plasticity of neural crest cells, and indeed we did not intend to imply we have identified common progenitors of ectomesenchyme and neuro/glial/pigment derivatives. That can only be truly functionally demonstrated by clonal lineage tracing analyses. Rather, we interpret our pseudo-time analyses to indicate that irrespective of cell cycle status at the time of delamination, these two populations come together with equivalent mesenchymal and migratory properties, but in the absence of fate determination in the collective of cells. This does not mean that individual cells are common progenitors of both ectomesenchyme and neuro/glial/pigment derivatives. The nuance is important, and we address this more carefully in the text.</p>

<p>Lines 320-321: &quot;...this overlap in expression was notably not observed in older embryos in areas where EMT had concluded&quot;. It is unclear whether the markers no longer overlap in older embryos (i.e. segregate to distinct populations) or are simply no longer expressed.</p>

<p>The data in Figure 5 demonstrates the dynamic and overlapping expression of Dlc1, Sp5 and Pak3 in the different clusters of cells as they transition from being neuroepithelial to mesenchymal. In contrast to Sp5 and Pak3, Dlc1 is not expressed by premigratory neural crest cells but is expressed at high levels in all EMT intermediate stage neural crest cells. Later as Dlc1 continues to be expressed in migrating neural crest cells, Pak3 and Sp5 are downregulated. But the absence of overlapping expression in the dorsolateral neural plate at the conclusion of EMT coincides with their downregulation in that territory.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the final results section on Dlc1, the previously published mutant mouse lines are referenced as having &quot;craniofacial malformation phenotypes&quot;. The lack of detail given on what those malformations are (assuming descriptions are available) makes the argument that they may be related to insufficient delamination less persuasive. The degree of knockdown correlates so well with the percentage reduction in migratory neural crest (Fig. 6) that one would imagine a null mutant to have a very severe phenotype.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The inference from the reviewer is correct and indeed Dlc1 null mutant mice do have a severe phenotype. We have added more specific details regarding the craniofacial and other phenotypes of the Dlc1 mutant mice to the discussion. Of note the frontonasal prominences and the pharyngeal arches are hypoplastic in E10.5 Dlc1 mutant embryos, which would be consistent with a neural crest cell deficit. Although a deficit in neural crest cells can be caused my multiple distinct mechanisms, our Dlc1 knockdown analyses suggest that the phenotype is due to an effect on neural crest cell delamination which diminishes the number of migrating neural crest cells.</p>
