<title>Abstract</title><p>Each year, hundreds of millions of people are infected with arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika, which are all primarily spread by the notorious mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Traditional control measures have proven insufficient, necessitating innovations. In response, here we generate a next generation CRISPR-based precision-guided sterile insect technique (pgSIT) for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> that disrupts genes essential for sex determination and fertility, producing predominantly sterile males that can be deployed at any life stage. Using mathematical models and empirical testing, we demonstrate that released pgSIT males can effectively compete with, suppress, and eliminate caged mosquito populations. This versatile species-specific platform has the potential for field deployment to effectively control wild populations of disease vectors.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the principal vector of several deadly viruses, including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and Zika. Unfortunately, its geographic spread has been exacerbated by climate change, global trade, and its preference for anthropogenic habitats, such that 3.9 billion people are presently at risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brady et al., 2012</xref>). Traditionally, mosquito control has been achieved through insecticides, though developing resistance have rendered them less effective. Moreover, insecticides are harmful to non-target species, such as insect pollinators, and direct exposure can be dangerous for humans and pets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hemingway et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sánchez-Bayo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Trdan, 2016</xref>). Alternative integrated approaches for mosquito control include preventative measures designed to reduce mosquito populations through habitat reduction or larval predation, though these can also be impractical or introduce invasive species. Notwithstanding, the continuous expansion of this invasive mosquito species demonstrates that current measures are insufficient.</p>
<p>Alternative genetic biological approaches have been developed to control specific species, including the sterile insect technique (SIT), the <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>mediated incompatible insect technique (<italic>W</italic>IIT), ♀-specific release of insects carrying a dominant lethal gene (fsRIDL), inherited female elimination by genetically encoded nucleases to interrupt alleles (Ifegenia), gene drive and precision-guided SIT (pgSIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Knipling 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Laven 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Spinner et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Smidler et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al. 2017</xref>; Kandul et al. 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al. 2021</xref>). Here, radiation-sterilized males (♂’s), or ♂’s harboring <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, are repeatedly mass released to mate with wild females (♀’s) which typically mate only once, thereby reducing mosquito populations over time. The fsRIDL can genetically sex-sort ♂’s, and can be released as eggs. Ifegenia disrupts a female-essential gene, femaleless (fle), demonstrating complete genetic sexing via heritable daughter gynecide. Gene drives leverage the CRISPR based precise DNA cutting and repair to spread into populations. Two types of gene drives have been engineered: suppression drives collapses a population, whereas modification drives spread cargo genes that can potentially block the chain of transmission of a targeted disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Champer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Marshall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Raban and Akbari, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The pgSIT works by simultaneously disrupting genes essential for ♀ viability and ♂ fertility during development to genetically generate sex-sorted and viable sterilized ♂’s.</p>
<p>Previously, we showed that disrupting a ♀-specific flight muscle gene (fem-myo) induced a flightless ♀-specific phenotype in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> ♀’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>). However, this approach would still result in viable flightless transgenic ♀’s being released which may be less desirable than removing females altogether. To further build upon the system, we instead cause ♀ lethality, simplifying the process of generating pgSIT ♂’s for release. Our herein-developed next-generation pgSIT approach simultaneously disrupts three genes in <italic>Ae. aegypti: doublessex</italic> (<italic>dsx</italic>), <italic>intersex</italic> (<italic>ix</italic>), and β<italic>-Tubulin 85D</italic> (β<italic>Tub</italic>), to induce ♀ lethality, or intersex (11) transformation, and near-complete ♂/♀ sterility. We demonstrate that pgSIT ♂’s are competitive and multiple releases can suppress cage populations. Notably, mathematical modeling indicates that this technology can control insect populations effectively over a wide range of realistic performance parameters and fitness costs. Overall, this next-generation pgSIT approach provides a viable option for the release of sterile males, bringing the field significantly closer to deployable CRISPR-based vector control strategies. Additionally, we also develop a rapid diagnostic assay to detect pgSIT transgene presence that could be used alongside field tests. Taken together, we have demonstrated that pgSIT could be designed to target essential sex determination and fertility genes in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to produce sterilized males that can suppress and eliminate caged populations thereby providing an alternate system for controlling this deadly vector.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Disrupting sex-determination and fertility</title>
<p>To induce ♀-specific lethality and/or 11 transformation in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, we targeted either the <italic>dsx</italic> (AAEL009114) or <italic>ix</italic> (AAEL010217) genes, both of which are associated with sex determination and differentiation in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chase and Baker, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garrett-Engele et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mysore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Salvemini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Scali et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Trujillo-Rodríguez et al., 2021</xref>). The <italic>dsx</italic> gene is located on chromosome 1R and is alternatively spliced to produce two ♀- specific (<italic>dsxF<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>dsxF<sub>2</sub></italic>) and one ♂-specific (<italic>dsxM</italic>) isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Salvemini et al., 2011</xref>). Exon 5b is retained in both ♀-specific <italic>dsxF<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>dsxF<sub>2</sub></italic> transcripts and is spliced out in the ♂-specific <italic>dsxM</italic> transcript. Therefore, to disrupt both ♀-specific <italic>dsx</italic> isoforms, we selected four gRNAs that target exon 5b (Supplementary Table 1) and assembled the pBac <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup></italic> plasmid (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The <italic>ix</italic> gene (AAEL010217) is located on chromosome 3L and is orthologous to the <italic>ix</italic> gene required for ♀-specific sexual differentiation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chase and Baker, 1995</xref>)</italic>. While the <italic>D. melanogaster ix</italic> does not undergo sex-specific alternative splicing and is expressed in both sexes, <italic>ix</italic> interacts with <italic>dsxF</italic>, but not <italic>dsxM</italic>, resulting in ♀-specific activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garrett-Engele et al., 2002</xref>). To disrupt <italic>ix</italic>, we engineered a <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup></italic> cassette harboring two gRNAs targeting <italic>ix</italic> exon 1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). To determine the effects of targeting these genes, multiple separate <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup></italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup></italic> strains were generated and assessed by crossing with <italic>Nup50-Cas9</italic> (hereafter, <italic>Cas9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>). To explore potential effects of maternal Cas9 carryover, all genetic crosses were conducted reciprocally (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Remarkably, the disruption of either <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>ix</italic> transformed all trans-hemizygous ♀’s into intersexes (11’s), independent of whether Cas9 was inherited from the mother (i.e., ♀Cas9), or father (i.e., ♂Cas9). These <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup>/+; Cas9/+</italic> 11 exhibited multiple malformed morphological features, such as mutant maxillary palps, abnormal genitalia, and malformed ovaries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, Supplementary Table 2). Notably, only ∼50% of <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup>/+</italic>; <italic>Cas9/+</italic> 11’s were able to blood feed, producing very few unhatchable eggs. While a similar fraction of <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup>/+</italic>; <italic>Cas9/+</italic> 11 were able to blood feed, the fed 11’s laid hatchable eggs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Sanger sequencing confirmed expected mutations at the <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>ix</italic> loci (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe changes in the ear anatomy, wing beat frequency (WBF), or phonotactic behaviors in either <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup>/+; Cas9/+</italic> ♂’s or <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup>/+; Cas9/+</italic> ♂’s suggesting that the trans-hemizygous ♂’s have normal courtship behavior (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Taken together, these findings reveal that 11 transformation can be efficiently achieved by disrupting either <italic>dsx</italic> or <italic>ix</italic> genes, while the ♀ or 11 sterility requires the <italic>dsx</italic> disruption.</p>

<title>Multiplexed target gene disruption</title>
<p>To guide CRISPR-mediated disruption of multiple genes essential for ♀-specific viability and ♂- specific fertility, we engineered the <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> construct which combines the effective gRNAs described above (Supplementary Figure 2). More specifically, this construct harbors six gRNAs: three gRNAs targeting the <italic>dsx</italic> exon 5b; one gRNA targeting the <italic>ix</italic> exon 1; and two gRNA targeting the β<italic>-Tubulin 85D</italic> (β<italic>Tub</italic>, AAEL019894) exon 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). The β<italic>Tub</italic> gene is specifically expressed in mosquito testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akbari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Degner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Gamez et al., 2020</xref>) and is essential for sperm maturation, elongation, and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>).

<title>pgSIT <bold>♂</bold>’s are mostly sterile with normal longevity and mating ability</title>
<p>We found that ∼94% of the eclosed pgSIT mosquitoes were ♂’s due to the majority of the 11’s not surviving to adulthood (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Supplementary Table 4).

<title>pgSIT <bold>♂</bold>’s induce population suppression</title>
<p>To further explore whether pgSIT ♂’s are competitive enough to mate with WT ♀’s in the presence of WT ♂’s to suppress populations, we conducted multigenerational, population cage experiments. At each generation, adult <italic>pgSIT</italic><sup>♀<italic>cas9</italic></sup> or <italic>pgSIT</italic><sup>♂<italic>Cas9</italic></sup> and WT ♂ mosquitos were released into cages using several introduction frequencies (pgSIT:WT - 1:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, and 40:1; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and Supplementary Table 9).

<title>Theoretical performance of pgSIT in a wild population</title>
<p>To explore the effectiveness of non-optimal pgSIT gene disruption on population suppression outcomes, we simulated releases of pgSIT eggs into a population of 10,000 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> adults (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Weekly releases of up to 500 pgSIT eggs (♀ and ♂) per wild-type adult (♀ and ♂) were simulated over 1-52 weeks. The scale of releases was chosen considering adult release ratios of 10:1 are common for sterile ♂ mosquito interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Carvalho et al., 2015</xref>) and ♀ <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> produce &gt;30 eggs per day in temperate climates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mordecai et al., 2019</xref>). We assume released eggs have the same survival probability as wild-laid eggs; however if released eggs do have higher mortality, this would be equivalent to considering a smaller release. A preliminary sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine which parameters population suppression outcomes are most sensitive to (<xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). The analysis considered probability of elimination (the percentage of 60 stochastic simulations that result in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> elimination) and window of protection (the time duration for which ≥50% of 60 stochastic simulations result in ≥90% suppression of the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population) as outcomes, and explored how these vary with number of releases, size of releases, release interval, gRNA cutting rate, Cas9 maternal deposition rate, pgSIT ♂ fertility and mating competitiveness, and pgSIT ♀ viability. Suppression outcomes were found to be most sensitive to release schedule parameters (number, size and interval of releases), ♂ fertility and ♀ viability. Model-predicted efficacy of pgSIT-induced population suppression was then explored in more detail as a function of these parameters through a series of simulations depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Results from these simulations reveal that a window of protection exceeding two years (a common benchmark for interruption of disease transmission) is generally achieved for pgSIT ♀ viability between 0 (complete inviability) and 0.15, and pgSIT ♂ fertility between 0 (complete sterility) and 0.15, provided the release scheme exceeds ∼23 releases of ≥100 pgSIT eggs per wild adult (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Achieving a ≥90% probability of elimination places slightly tighter restrictions on ♀ viability and ♂ fertility - a safe ballpark being ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-0.10, given a release scheme of ∼26 releases of 250 pgSIT eggs per wild adult (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). These results suggest a target product profile for pgSIT to be ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-0.10. The pgSIT strain described here falls well within these bounds, with ♀ viability of 0 and ♂ fertility of ∼0.01.</p>

Female viability was varied between 0 (complete inviability) and 0.15, male fertility was varied between 0 (complete sterility) and 0.15, release size was varied between 0 and 500 eggs released per wild adult, and the number of weekly releases was varied between 0 and 52.

<title>Mitigation tools for rapid transgene detection</title>
<p>Being able to rapidly identify transgenes in the environment in mixtures of captured mosquitoes will be important for field applications of genetic biocontrol tools. While PCR-based tests do exist, these may be difficult to implement in the field. Therefore, developing an assay with a simple readout would be desired. To generate a rapid assay for transgene detection that could be used alongside future pgSIT field trials, we adapted the sensitive enzymatic nucleic acid sequence reporter (SENSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brogan et al., 2021a</xref>) to rapidly detect pgSIT DNA fragments in <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> constructs in mosquitoes. In SENSR, the presence of transgenic sequences triggers the activation of the <italic>Ruminococcus flavefaciens</italic> CasRx/gRNA collateral activity that cleaves a quenched probe, resulting in a rapid fluorescent readout (Brogan et al., 2021b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dalla Benetta et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brogan et al., 2021a</xref>). Multiple ratios of trans-hemizygous <italic>pgSIT</italic> to WT mosquitoes - 0:1; 1:1; 1:5; 1:10; 1:25; 1:50 and a no template control (NTC) were used to challenge SENSR.

Notably, in every tested ratio, SENSR rapidly detected the transgenic sequence, reaching the half maximum fluorescence (HMF) in less than 20 min (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 13B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To develop a robust and stable population control technology for addressing insect disease vectors, we engineered a next-generation pgSIT system that induced near complete ♀-specific lethality and ♂ sterility by simultaneously targeting the <italic>dsx, ix</italic>, and β<italic>Tub</italic> genes. Our cage experiments indicate that releases of pgSIT ♂’s can induce robust population suppression and elimination, and mathematical models reinforce this finding. To support future field trials of this and other trangene-based technologies, we also developed a rapid and sensitive method, SENSR, for identifying pgSIT transgenes.</p>
<p>Overall, the released pgSIT males were competitive in our cage populations, as repeated releases resulted in population elimination at several different introduction frequencies. That said, we did observe some limitations. Firstly, we determined that pgSIT males were not 100% sterile, with an estimated ∼1% still producing some progeny, this may stem from using fewer gRNAs to target β<italic>Tub,</italic> as our previous system that saw complete sterility used four gRNAs while here we used only two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>). That said, it would not be difficult to build new strains that harbor additional gRNAs targeting β<italic>Tub</italic> or other genes important for male fertility to ensure sterility is achieved. Even though mutations could potentially become fixed within the natural population, the likelihood of off-target effects becoming fixed within the population is exceedingly low. To mitigate potential negative impacts, we employed CHOPCHOP V3.0.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no</ext-link>) for the selection of gRNAs, specifically to minimize the occurrence of genomic off-target cleavage events. Furthermore, our releasing process will be carried out in multiple rounds. Even in the event that an undesired mutant is introduced into the local population, it will either be completely eradicated through subsequent rounds of releases or be naturally eliminated through the process of natural selection over time. Secondly, we also noticed some reduced fitness parameters when Cas9 was inherited maternally, which may result from an overabundance of Cas9 present in the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kandul et al., 2020</xref>). That said, these maternal fitness effects can be avoided by ensuring Cas9 is inherited paternally as pgSIT phenotypes can be achieved when Cas9 is inherited from either the father or mother. Moreover, the longevity was not significantly altered, and released pgSIT males still performed well in the population cages, which indicates that these fitness costs and lack of complete male sterility could be tolerated for population suppression.</p>
<p>Even in the presence of pgSIT construct imperfections, our mathematical modeling showed that population suppression is very promising, both in terms of the potential to eliminate a mosquito population, or to suppress it to an extent that would largely interrupt disease transmission. Our models determined that having ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-10% provides a reasonable target product profile for pgSIT - criteria that the construct described in this study easily satisfies. Previously published analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>) have also shown fitness costs associated with pgSIT constructs are well-tolerated in the range 0-25%. Overall, our results indicate that perfection is not required for an effective pgSIT system, though improvements to the presented and other systems could allow for reduced introduction ratios.</p>
<p>Before a possible field deployment, there are still several considerations that must be addressed for this pgSIT system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kandul et al., 2019a</xref>). Firstly, our herein-presented system requires a genetic cross to produce the releasable insects, similarly to previous pgSIT systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kandul et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>) that will require a scalable genetic sexing system. While sophisticated mechanical systems that exploit sex-specific morphological differences have been generated in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Crawford et al., 2020</xref>) and are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.senecio-robotics.com">www.senecio-robotics.com</ext-link>, these approaches may be cost prohibitive. Therefore, there exists a need to develop inexpensive and scalable genetic sexing systems that could be combined with pgSIT to eliminate its reliance on mechanical adult sexing approaches. Alternatively, if a temperature inducible Cas9 strain was generated in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> then it may be possible to generate a temperature inducible pgSIT (TI-pgSIT) system as was done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kandul et al., 2021</xref>) and this would alleviate the need for an integrated genetic sexing approach. Secondly, studies are required to determine the survival and mating competitiveness of released pgSIT males under field conditions, and to optimize their release protocol. Thirdly, although pgSIT is self-limiting and inherently safe, it does require genetic modification, so regulatory authorizations will be necessary prior to implementation. Despite this, we anticipate that obtaining such authorizations will not be insurmountable.</p>
<p>Altogether, we demonstrate that removing females by disrupting sex determinate genes is possible with pgSIT, which can inform the development of future such systems in related species. The self-limiting nature of pgSIT offers a controllable alternative to technologies such as gene drives that will persist and uncontrollably spread in the environment. Moving forward, pgSIT could offer an efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly next-generation technology for controlling wild mosquito populations, leading to widespread prevention of human disease transmission.</p>

<title>Genetic assessment of gRNA strains</title>
<p>To evaluate the activity of <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx</sup></italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>ix</sup></italic>strains, we reciprocally crossed hemizygous mosquitoes of each generated strains to the homozygous <italic>Nup</italic>-<italic>Cas9</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>), and thoroughly examined F<sub>1</sub> trans-hemizygous ♀ progeny (Supplementary Tables 2-3). Each of three established <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> strains was subjected to single-pair sibling matings over 5-7 generations to generate the homozygous stocks. Zygosity was confirmed genetically by repeated test crosses to WT. To generate trans-hemizygous progeny with a maternal <italic>Cas9</italic> (<italic>pgSIT</italic><sup>♀<italic>Cas9</italic></sup>) and paternal <italic>Cas9</italic> (<italic>pgSIT</italic><sup>♂<italic>Cas9</italic></sup>), homozygous <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> ♂’s and ♀’s were mated to homozygous <italic>Cas9</italic> ♀’s and ♂’s, respectively. Then, the generated trans-hemizygous mosquitoes were mated to WT mosquitoes of the opposite sex, and numbers of laid and hatched eggs were scored to measure the fecundity. Multiple genetic control crosses were also performed for comparisons: WT ♂ × WT ♀; WT ♂ × <italic>Cas9</italic> ♀; <italic>Cas9</italic> ♂ × WT ♀; <italic>gRNA</italic> ♂ × <italic>Cas9</italic> ♀; <italic>gRNA</italic> ♀ × <italic>Cas9</italic> ♂; <italic>gRNA</italic> ♀ × WT ♂; and <italic>gRNA</italic> ♂ ×WT ♀. For the genetic cross, adult mosquitoes were allowed to mate in a cage for 4-5 days, then blood meals were provided, and eggs were collected and hatched. To calculate the normalized percentage of laid eggs per ♀ (e.i. fecundity), the number of laid eggs per ♀ for each genotype replicate was divided by the maximum number of laid eggs per ♀ (Supplementary Table 4). The percentage of egg hatching (i.e. fertility) was estimated by dividing the number of laid eggs by the number of hatched eggs. Egg-to-adult survival ratios were the number of laid eggs divided by the total number of eclosed adults. Larvae-to-adult survival rates were calculated by dividing the number of eclosed adults by the number of larvae. Pupae-adult survival rates were calculated by dividing the number of pupae by the number of eclosed adults. Blood feeding rates were calculated by dividing the number of blood-fed ♀’s or 11’s by the total number of ♀ or 11’s. Trans-hemizygous 11’s had many morphological features visibly different from those of WT ♀’s. To assess differences in external and internal anatomical structures, we dissected twenty trans-hemizygous and control mosquitoes for each genotype and sex (♂, ♀ and 11) in 1% PBS buffer and imaged structures on the Leica M165FC fluorescent stereomicroscope equipped with a Leica DMC4500 color camera. The measurements were performed using Leica Application Suite X (LAS X by Leica Microsystems) on the acquired images (Supplementary Table 2).</p>

Prior to tone playback, a gentle puff of air was provided to each ♂ to stimulate flight initiation. Mosquitoes were considered to demonstrate phonotaxis behaviors if they orientated to the speaker and then demonstrated abdominal bending behaviors. A video camera (GoPro) was used to record all responses to stimulation, with responses being scored as either 0 (no approach/no bending) or 1 (approach and bending). Mosquitoes were tested on two consecutive days, with mosquitoes showing behavior considered as a phonotactic response to stimuli on at least one test day being regarded as responders. Three repeats were conducted for each genotype (across 3 generations), with at least 10 ♂’s tested per repeat. Statistical comparisons were made using Chi-squared tests.</p>

RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA 6000 Pico Kit for Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies #5067-1513), and mRNA was isolated from ∼1 μg of total RNA using NEB Next Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB #E7490). RNA-seq libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7770) following the manufacturer’s protocols. Libraries were quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific #Q32854), and the size distribution was confirmed using a High Sensitivity DNA Kit for Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies #5067-4626). Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq2000 in paired end mode with the read length of 50 nt and sequencing depth of 20 million reads per library.

Then, one anesthetized mouse (similar size and weight) was put into each cage for 20 minutes (from 9:00 am to 9:20 am) daily for five days, and two times were recorded for each mosquito ♀ or 11. First, the ‘time to bite’ is the time interval between a mouse placed in a cage and ♀/11 landing on the mouse. Second, the ‘feeding time’ is the duration of blood feeding (Supplementary Table 5). When individual ♀/11’s finished blood feeding they were removed from the cage, while unfed ♀/11’s were kept in the cage and the blood feeding was repeated the next day. In total, each ♀/11 had 6000 seconds to initiate bite and feed during 5 days. To assess whether distance affects blood feeding of <italic>pgSIT</italic> 11’s, we conducted the experiment in two sizes of cages: small (24.5 X 24.5 X 24.5 cm) and large (60 X 60 X 60 cm).

<p>To assess the competitiveness of pgSIT ♂’s, we performed discrete non-overlapping multigenerational population cage trials as described in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, 3/4-day-old mature WT adult ♂’s were released along with mature (3/4 days old) pgSIT adult ♂’s at release ratios (pgSIT: WT): 1:1 (50:50), 5:1 (250:50), 10:1 (500:50), 20:1 (1000:50), and 40:1 (2000:50), with three biological replicates for each release ratio (15 cages total). One hour later, 50 mature (3/4 days old) WT adult ♀’s were released into each cage. All adults were allowed to mate for 2 days. ♀’s were then blood fed and eggs were collected. Eggs were counted and stored for four days to allow full embryonic development. Then, 100 eggs were randomly selected, hatched, and reared to the pupal stage, and the pupae were separated into ♂ and ♀ groups and transferred to separate cages. Three days post eclosion, ratios (pgSIT: WT) of 50 (1:1), 250 (5:1), 500 (10:1), 1000 (20:1), and 2000 (40:1) age-matched pgSIT mature ♂ adults were caged with these mature ♂’s from 100 selected eggs. One hour later, mature ♀’s from 100 selected eggs were transferred into each cage. All adults were allowed to mate for 2 days. ♀’s were blood fed, and eggs were collected. Eggs were counted and stored for 4 days to allow full embryonic development. The remaining eggs were hatched to measure hatching rates and to screen for the possible presence of transformation markers. The hatching rate was estimated by dividing the number of hatched eggs by the total number of eggs. This procedure continued for all subsequent generations.</p>

<title>Mathematical modeling</title>
<p>To model the expected performance of pgSIT at suppressing and eliminating local <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations, we used the MGDrivE simulation framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sánchez et al., 2019</xref>). This framework models the egg, larval, pupal, and adult mosquito life stages with overlapping generations, larval mortality increasing with larval density, and a mating structure in which ♀’s retain the genetic material of the adult ♂ with whom they mate for the duration of their adult lifespan. We used the same egg-to-adult survival rate for WT and pgSIT eggs. The inheritance pattern of the pgSIT system was modeled within the inheritance module of MGDrivE. This module includes parameters for ♀ pupatory success (as a proxy for viability), and ♂ fertility and mating competitiveness. We simulated a randomly-mixing <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population of 10,000 adults and implemented the stochastic version of MGDrivE to capture chance effects that are relevant to suppression and elimination scenarios. Density-independent mortality rates for juvenile life stages were calculated for consistency with the population growth rate in the absence of density-dependent mortality, and density-dependent mortality was applied to the larval stage following Deredec <italic>et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deredec et al., 2011</xref>)</italic>. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with “window of protection” (mean duration for which the <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population is suppressed by at least 90%), probability of <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> elimination, and reduction in cumulative potential for transmission as the outcomes, and model parameters sampled describing the construct (gRNA cutting rate and maternal deposition frequency), release scheme (number, size and frequency of releases), ♀ viability, and ♂ fertility and mating competitiveness. Model parameters were sampled according to a latin-hypercube scheme with 2<sup>16</sup> parameter sets and 20 repetitions per parameter set. Regression models were fitted to the sensitivity analysis data using multi-layered perceptrons as emulators of the main simulation in predicting the window of protection outcome. Subsequent simulations focused on the most sensitive parameters from the sensitivity analysis (those describing the release scheme, ♀ viability, and ♂ fertility) and were explored via factorial simulation design. Complete model and intervention parameters are listed in Supplementary Table 12-13.</p>

<title>Transgene detection method in mosquitoes</title>
<p>SENSR assays were performed as described previously (Brogan et al., 2021c) using a two-step nucleic acid detection protocol. Target sequences were first amplified in a 30 min isothermal preamplification reaction using recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). RPA primers were designed to amplify 30 bp gRNA spacer complement regions flanked by 30 bp priming regions from the transgenic elements (<italic>Cas9</italic> coding sequence or <italic>gRNA</italic> scaffold for <italic>Cas9</italic> or <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> construct, respectively) while simultaneously incorporating a T7 promoter sequence and “GGG’’ into the 5′ end of the dsDNA gene fragment to increase transcription efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Brieba et al., 2002</xref>). The RPA primer sequences and synthetic target sequences can be found in Supplementary Table 14. The RPA reaction was performed at 42°C for 30 min by using TwistAmp Basic (TwistDx #TABAS03KIT). The final conditions for the optimized (28.5% sample input) RPA protocol in a 10-μL reaction are as follows: 5.9 μL rehydration buffer (TwistDx), 0.35 μL primer mix (10 μM each), 0.5 μL MgOAc (280 mM), and 50 ng of genomic DNA. The RPA reaction was then transferred to a second reaction, termed the Cas Cleavage Reaction (CCR), which contained a T7 polymerase and the CasRx ribonucleoprotein. In the second reaction, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription was coupled with the cleavage assay and a fluorescence readout using 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM). A 6-nt poly-U probe (FRU) conjugated to a 5′ 6-FAM and a 3′ IABlkFQ (Iowa Black Fluorescence Quencher) was designed and custom-ordered from IDT(Brogan et al., 2021d). Detection experiments were performed in 20-μL reactions by adding the following reagents to the 10 μL RPA preamplification reaction: 2.82 μL water, 0.4 μL HEPES pH 7.2 (1 M), 0.18 μL MgCl2 (1 M), 1 μL rNTPs (25 mM each), 2 μL CasRx (55.4 ng/μL), 1 μL RNase inhibitor (40 U/μL), 0.6 μL T7 Polymerase (50 U/μL), 1 μL gRNA (10 ng/μL), and 1 μL FRU probe (2 μM). Experiments were immediately run on a LightCycler 96 (Roche #05815916001) at 37°C for 60 min with the following acquisition protocol: 5 sec acquisition followed by 5 sec incubation for the first 15 min, followed by 5 sec acquisition and 55 sec incubation for up to 45 min. Fluorescence readouts were analyzed by calculating the background-subtracted fluorescence of each timepoint and by subtracting the initial fluorescence value from the final value. Statistical significance was calculated using a one-way ANOVA followed by specified multiple comparison tests (n = 4). The detection speed of each gRNA was calculated from the Half-Maximum Fluorescence (HMF) (Brogan et al., 2021d). Raw SENSR assays data can be found in Supplementary Table 15.</p>
<p>We generated 12 gRNAs, six target regions within <italic>Cas9</italic> or <italic>gRNA</italic> transgenes, to assess the detection capabilities in a SENSR reaction for each selected gRNA using <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> plasmids for detection of <italic>Cas9</italic> and <italic>gRNA<sup>dsx,ix,</sup></italic><sup>β<italic>Tub</italic></sup> transgenic sequences, respectively.

WBF box plots indicate the median (middle bar), and 25% and 75% quartiles (lower/upper boundaries of box). The average ♀ WBF is 468 Hz. No significant differences were observed between ♀ groups, or between ♂ groups, regardless of the genotypes tested (ANOVA on ranks, <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The male phonotaxis assay was conducted, in which individual flying ♂’s showed attractive or no response (scored as 1 or 0, respectively) toward the female-specific WBF produced for 30 secs by a speaker (<bold>E</bold>). Three batches (aka. 3 replicate groups) of at least 10 ♂’s were examined for each genotype. ♂’s across all genotypes exhibited robust responses to sound. The point plot shows the mean (middle bar) and one Standard Deviation (± SD) for the proportion of ♂’s responding to the auditory stimulus.

<caption><title>Sensitivity of pgSIT population suppression outcomes to model parameters.</title>
<p><bold>A</bold> Partial dependency (thin traces) and individual conditional expectation plots<sup>3</sup> (magenta dashed lines) are depicted for regression models fitted to three model outcomes: i) probability of elimination (POE), ii) window of protection (WOP) (measured in years), and iii) reduction in cumulative potential for transmission (RPT). These three outcomes were evaluated for several parameters - number of releases, size of releases (as a proportion of the number of wild adults in the environment), release interval (in days), gRNA cutting rate, Cas9 maternal deposition rate, male fertility, male mating competitiveness (relative to wild-type males), and female viability. Population suppression outcomes are most sensitive to release schedule parameters (number, size and interval of releases), male fertility and female viability. <bold>B</bold> Statistical sensitivity analysis metrics on the simulated data are compared to importance metrics for surrogate models. For the first-order statistical sensitivity analysis, we used Delta<sup>4</sup>, Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST)<sup>5</sup>, and High-Dimensional Model Representation (HDMR)<sup>6</sup>; whilst for the emulators we used Permutation feature importance<sup>7</sup>, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)<sup>8</sup>.

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> paper builds on a method, previously conceptualized and validated, of genetic control for insect populations. The method, called pgSIT, uses integrated CRISPR-Cas9 based constructs to generate, in certain combinations of genotypes, mutations that cause both male sterility and female inviability. Release of such genotypes in sufficiently large numbers can lead to an inundation of a local insect population with sterile males and this can lead to localised population suppression, which represents an effective method of control for problematic insect populations. The data are <bold>convincing</bold> and will be of interest to anyone working on vector control strategies.</p>

<p>Precision guided sterile insect technology (pgSIT) is a means of mosquito vector control that aims to simultaneously kill females while generating sterile males for field release. These sterile males are expected to mate with 'wild' females resulting in very few eggs being laid or low hatching rates. Repeated releases are expected to result in the suppression of the mosquito population. This method avoids cumbersome sex-sorting while generating the sterile males. Importantly, until release, the two genetic elements that bring about female lethality and male sterility - the Cas9 and the gRNA carrying mosquitoes - are maintained as separate lines. They are crossed only prior to release, and therefore, this approach is considered to be more safe than gene drives.</p>
<p>The authors had made a version of this pgSIT in their 2021 paper where they targeted *β-Tubulin 85D*, which is only expressed in the male testes and its loss-of-function results in male sterility. In that pgSIT, they did not have female lethality, but generated flightless females by simultaneously targeted *myosin heavy chain,* which is expressed only in the female wings. Here the authors argue, that the survival of females is not ideal, and so modify their 2021 approach to achieve female lethality/sterility.</p>
<p>To do this, they target two genes - the female specific isoform of Dsx and intersex. They use multiple gRNAs against these genes and validate their ability to cause female lethality/sterility. Having verified that these do indeed affect female fertility, they combine gRNAs against Dsx and ix to generate female lethality/sterility and use *β-Tubulin 85D* to generate male sterility (previously validated). When these gRNA mosquitoes are crossed to Cas9 and the progeny crossed to WT (the set-up for pgSIT), they find that very few eggs are laid, larval death is high, and what emerges are males or intersex progeny that are sterile.</p>
<p>As this is the requirement for pgSIT, the authors then test if it is able to induce population suppression. To do this, they conduct cage trials and find that only when they use 20:1 or 40:1 ratio of pgSIT:WT cages, does the population crash in 4-5 generations. They model this pgSIT's ability to suppress a population in the wild. Unfortunately, I was not able to assess what parameters from their pgSIT were used in the model and therefore the predicted efficacy of their pgSIT, (though the range of 0-.1 is not great, given that the assessment is between 0-0.15).</p>
<p>Finally, they also develop a SENSR with a rapid fluorescence read-out for detecting the transgene in the field. They show that this sensor is specific and sensitive, detecting low copy numbers of the transgene. This would be important for monitoring any release.</p>
<p>Overall, the data are clear and well presented.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed the major issues raised by reviewers related to off target effects, writing and figures, and comparisons with other vector control methods and claims made in passing.</p>

<p>This is a thorough and convincing body of work that represents an incremental but significant improvement on iterations of this method of CRISPR-based Sterile Insect Technique ('pgSIT'). In this version, compared to previous, the authors target more genes than previously, in order to induce both female inviability (targeting the genes intersex and doublesex, compared to fem-myo previously) and male sterility (targeting a beta-tubulin, as previously in the release generation.</p>
<p>The characterization of the lines is extensive and this data will be useful to the field. However, what is lacking is some context as to how this formulation compares to the previous iteration. Mention is made of the possible advantage of removing most females, compared to just making them flightless (as previously) but there is no direct comparison, either experimental, or theoretical i.e. imputing the life history traits into a model. For me this is a weakness, yet easily addressed. In a similar vein, much is made in alluding to the 'safety concerns of gene drive' and how this is a more palatable half-way house, just because it has CRISPR component within it; it is not. It would be much more sensible, and more informative, to compare this pgSIT technology to RIDL (release of insects carrying a dominant lethal), which is essentially a transgene-based version of the Sterile Insect Technique, as is the work presented here.</p>
<p>The authors achieve impressive results and show that these strains, under a scenario of high levels of release ratios compared to WT, could achieve significant local suppression of mosquito populations. The sensitivity analysis that examines the effect of changing different biological or release parameters is well performed and very informative.</p>
<p>The authors are honest in acknowledging that there are still challenges in bringing this to field release, namely in developing sexing strains and optimizing release strategies.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Li et al. presents an elegant application of sterile insect technology (pgSIT) utilizing a CRISPR-Cas9 system to suppress mosquito vector populations. The pgSIT technique outlined in this paper employs a binary system where Cas9 and gRNA are conjoined in experimental crosses to yield sterile male mosquitoes. Employing a multiplexed strategy, the authors combine multiple gRNA to concurrently target various genes within a single locus. This approach successfully showcases the disruption of three distinct genes at different genomic positions, resulting in the creation of highly effective sterile mosquitoes for population control. The pioneering work of the Akbari lab has been instrumental in developing this technology, previously demonstrating its efficacy in Drosophila and Aedes aegypti.</p>
<p>By targeting the female-specific splice isoform (exon-5) of doublesex in conjunction with intersex and β-tubulin, the researchers induce female lethality, leading to a predominance of sterile male mosquitoes. This innovation is particularly noteworthy as the deployment of sterile mosquitoes on a large scale typically requires substantial investment in sex sorting. However, this study circumvents this challenge through genetic manipulation.</p>

<p>We express our sincere appreciation for the valuable comments received. A wide range of ♀ viability and ♂ fertility values were explored in the model. The results determined that: “Achieving a ≥90% probability of elimination places slightly tighter restrictions on ♀ viability and ♂ fertility - a safe ballpark being ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-0.10, given a release scheme of ~26 releases of 250 pgSIT eggs per wild adult (Fig. 4B). These results suggest a target product profile for pgSIT to be ♀ viability and ♂ fertility both in the range 0-0.10.” A subsequent sentence has been added pointing out how the described pgSIT strain falls within this range: “The pgSIT strain described here falls well within these bounds, with ♀ viability of 0 and ♂ fertility of ~0.01.” The parameters of the described pgSIT strain are also listed throughout the paper and quoted here: “Cas9 in combination with gRNAdsx,ix,βTub induces either the lethality or transformation of pgSIT ♀’s into sterile unfit ⚥’s.” And: “Firstly, we determined that pgSIT males were not 100% sterile, with an estimated ~1% still producing some progeny.”</p>

<p>Finally, they also develop a SENSR with a rapid fluorescence read-out for detecting the transgene in the field. They show that this sensor is specific and sensitive, detecting low copy numbers of the transgene. This would be important for monitoring any release.</p>
<p>Overall, the data are clear and well presented. The manuscript is well written (albeit likely dense for the uninitiated!). I had concerns about the efficacy of generating the pgSIT animals - the overall number of eggs hatched from the gRNA (X) Cas9 cross appears to be low, therefore, very large numbers of parental animals would have to be reared and crossed to obtain enough sterile males for the SIT. In addition to this, I was concerned about the intersex progeny that can blood-feed. These could potentially contribute to the population and it would be useful to see the data that suggest that these numbers are low and the animals will not be competent in the field.</p>

<p>We express our sincere appreciation for the valuable comments received. A wide range of ♀ viability and ♂ fertility values were explored in the model. Given the intricate nature of this study and taking into account the recommendations provided by multiple reviewers and the editor, we have eliminated superfluous comparisons among various methodologies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors achieve impressive results and show that these strains, under a scenario of high levels of release ratios compared to WT, could achieve significant local suppression of mosquito populations. The sensitivity analysis that examines the effect of changing different biological or release parameters is well performed and very informative.</p>
<p>The authors are honest in acknowledging that there are still challenges in bringing this to field release, namely in developing sexing strains and optimizing release strategies - a question I have here is how to actually release eggs, and could variability in the efficiency of this aspect be modelled in the sensitivity analysis? It seems to me like this could be a challenge and inherently very variable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate comments. Several approaches are available to release eggs - either in pre-existing breeding sites in the field, or in artificial breeding sites (e.g., cups). We have added a sentence in the Discussion section to highlight that this is an area requiring further research: “Secondly, studies are required to determine the survival and mating competitiveness of released pgSIT males under field conditions, and to optimize their release protocol.” Regarding the efficiency of egg releases, the following sentence in the modeling results section has been added: “We assume released eggs have the same survival probability as wild-laid eggs; however if released eggs do have higher mortality, this would be equivalent to considering a smaller release.” As stated in the modeling results (and depicted in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 5): “Suppression outcomes were found to be most sensitive to release schedule parameters (number, size and interval of releases), ♂ fertility and ♀ viability.” It follows that suppression outcomes are equivalently sensitive to the efficiency of an egg release.</p>

<p>Summary and Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Li et al. presents an elegant application of sterile insect technology (pgSIT) utilizing a CRISPR-Cas9 system to suppress mosquito vector populations. The pgSIT technique outlined in this paper employs a binary system where Cas9 and gRNA are conjoined in experimental crosses to yield sterile male mosquitoes. Employing a multiplexed strategy, the authors combine multiple gRNA to concurrently target various genes within a single locus. This approach successfully showcases the disruption of three distinct genes at different genomic positions, resulting in the creation of highly effective sterile mosquitoes for population control. The pioneering work of the Akbari lab has been instrumental in developing this technology, previously demonstrating its efficacy in Drosophila and Aedes aegypti. By targeting the female-specific splice isoform (exon-5) of doublesex in conjunction with intersex and β-tubulin, the researchers induce female lethality, leading to a predominance of sterile male mosquitoes. This innovation is particularly noteworthy as the deployment of sterile mosquitoes on a large scale typically requires substantial investment in sex sorting. However, this study circumvents this challenge through genetic manipulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One notable concern arising from this manuscript pertains to the absence of data regarding the potential off-target effects of the gRNA. Given the utilization of multiple gRNA, the risk of unintended mutations in non-target areas of the genome increases. With around 1% of males still capable of producing fertile offspring, understanding the frequency of unintended genome targeting becomes crucial. Such mutations could potentially become fixed within the natural population.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We express our sincere appreciation for the valuable comments received and fully agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of understanding the frequency of unintended genome targeting. However, the likelihood of off-target effects becoming fixed within the population is exceedingly low. To mitigate potential negative impacts, we employed CHOPCHOP V3.0.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no</ext-link>) for the selection of gRNAs, which will specifically tminimize the occurrence of genomic off-target cleavage events. Furthermore, our releasing process will be carried out in multiple rounds. In the event that an undesired mutant is introduced into the local population, the mutated gene will either be quickly eradicated through subsequent rounds of releases or be naturally eliminated through the process of natural selection over time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experiments are well-conceived, featuring suitable controls and repeated trials to yield statistically significant data. However, a primary issue with the manuscript lies in its data presentation. The authors' graphical representations are intricate and demand considerable attention to discern the nuances, especially due to the striking similarity between the symbols representing different genotypes. As it stands, the manuscript primarily caters to experts within the field, thereby warranting improvements in data visualization for broader comprehension.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment. However, as this work is indeed complex and intricate and as there is limitations imposed by the publisher on data visualizations (i.e. number of figures in the main text, etc.) we have tried our best for presenting our data in full.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>All three reviewers were appreciative of the work presented in this manuscript. There were some common concerns that we shared, that the authors could consider revising. They are listed below.</p>
<p>Essential revisions:</p>
<p>1. Formal comparison with the previous/other methods: The authors make many statements that compare this pgSIT with their previous method, gene drives, or with RIDL. We suggest that they focus their comparisons within the scope of data and avoid comparisons between RIDL, gene drive, and pgSIT that are based on perceptions of these methods. It would be useful if, for example, they could impute life history traits and demonstrate this pgSIT's efficacy over their previous versions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We express our sincere appreciation for the valuable comments received. We have removed the unnecessary comparisons between different methods, please review the revised version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Writing and presentation of figures: The authors should please take advantage of the eLife format and unpack each sentence/figure so that it's accessible to readers outside this field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your comment, and we have implemented some necessary changes based on your suggestions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Data to support claims made in passing: There are many instances, such as detailed in the reviews (and the entire second paragraph in the discussion) that are not supported by data. The authors should either provide that data or not make these claims.</p>

<p>1. Off target effects: There is the formal possibility that off target effects that might get fixed in the population. Could the authors please address this in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment and fully agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of understanding the frequency of unintended genome targeting. However, the likelihood of off-target effects becoming fixed within the population is exceedingly low. We have address this in the discussion.</p>
<p>“Even though mutations could potentially become fixed within the natural population, the likelihood of off-target effects becoming fixed within the population is exceedingly low. To mitigate potential negative impacts, we employed CHOPCHOP V3.0.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no">https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no</ext-link>) for the selection of gRNAs, specifically to minimize the occurrence of genomic off-target cleavage events. Furthermore, our releasing process will be carried out in multiple rounds. Even in the event that an undesired mutant is introduced into the local population, it will either be completely eradicated through subsequent rounds of releases or be naturally eliminated through the process of natural selection over time.”</p>

<p>The writing: Each sentence is packed with information and while this is fine for those immersed in the field, it might be dense for those who are not. There are a lot of nuances in such an approach and clearly laying it out for the reader is important. The authors should unpack some of these sentences to make their work more accessible.</p>

<p>It will help to have a schematic linked to the introduction about how these mosquitoes are designed to be used. Which strains would be scaled up in the lab, which ones (and what stage) could be released, and in which animal/generation they expect sterility or lethality. This would be useful while interpreting the schematics of the genetic crosses in the rest of the figures (1B, 2B). Li et al 2021 has something to this effect. I say this particularly because in the text, 'pgSIT' is used to refer to both the lab stocks and the F1s.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate the suggestion to incorporate a schematic into the introduction to clarify the intended use of these mosquitoes. Taking into account all the suggestions, we would like to keep textual descriptions and context provided within the manuscript, which, together with Figures 1B and 2B, illustrate our intentions. Nevertheless, we value your input and have taken other feedback into account to improve the overall quality of the content.</p>

<p>Because Figure 1A depicts all the gRNAs I thought that's what they were testing in the first results section. But the legends seems to suggest that the individual gRNAs have been tested. Such issues will be sorted with attention to the writing. It would also be nice to have Figure 2A here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any misunderstanding. Figure 1A displays two gRNA constructs: one for dsx (comprising 4 gRNAs) and another for ix (with 2 gRNAs). All of these gRNAs were tested in the initial results section. Subsequently, we engineered the final gRNA construct, denoted as gRNAdsx,ix,βTub, which combines the effective gRNAs described earlier (3 targeting dsx and 1 targeting ix, as illustrated in Supplementary Figure 2).</p>

<p>It wasn't clear to me how egg laying percentages were calculated or what it means.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your comment. Female fecundity depends on the egg output (egg laying percentage) and the egg hatching rate, since insect female can lay unfertalized eggs that does not hatch. Egg laying percentages were calculated by dividing the numbers of laid eggs by a test female group by that of the control female group that laid the highest egg number. This procedure is called normalization and enable relative comparison of laid egg number.</p>

<p>Calling something 'intersex': The authors are assessing intersex by malformed genitalia, maxillary palps and ovaries. But the genitalia defects in Fig1D were not clear to me. Can the authors show better images? While the MP snd ovary phenotypes were clear, it would be nice to see these quantified - what proportion of the females have each/some/all of these phenotypes? It would be nice to see this quantified. (They have some of this in the supplementary table).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We express our gratitude for the comment received and acknowledge the issue regarding the clarity of the images. It is important to note that these photographs represent the highest level of clarity achieved thus far. We value your interest in the quantification of the observed phenotypes. However, due to certain constraints, we were unable to quantify the proportions for all the females, and we did not retain all the samples needed for this specific quantification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It's interesting that 50% of the intersex don't blood-feed - is this because they do not have appropriately formed stylets? It would be important to quantify the number of hatch-able eggs. This is particularly important in the context of field application and should ideally be included in the mathematical modelling. In the discussion, the authors mention that they are not able to host-seek and a variety of other behaviours - these data should be presented as it would be important for assessing the efficacy of the pgSIT.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the comment. We did not find the mutant stylets from these intersex mosquitoes. We agree with the reviewer that the number of hatchable eggs is particularly important in the context of field application. Indeed, the number of hatchable eggs is what was considered in the mathematical modeling. We did a blood feed assay (small cage and big cage) for host seeking behavior. Data were presented in Supplementary Table 5.</p>

<p>At the end of the first results section, the authors state, &quot;Taken together, these findings reveal that ♀-specific lethality and/or ⚥...&quot; But I don't see data that show female-specific lethality until Figure 2C.</p>

<p>In the combined gRNA mosquito (the pgSIT), they find that the cross between the gRNA and Cas9 results in very few eggs being laid, high larval death, and what emerges are males. This suggests that it would be a poor pgSIT, right? You'd have to set up huge crosses to get enough males emerging in the wild to mate with WT females to bring about population suppression. Could the authors comment on this?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the comment. Even in the presence of imperfections, such as reduced egg production resulting from the gRNA and Cas9 cross and the necessity of extensive mating to obtain an adequate number of males, population suppression is very promising with the pgSIT, both in terms of the potential to eliminate a mosquito population, or to suppress it to an extent that would largely interrupt disease transmission. It's worth noting that our current efforts serve as a validation of the system before its potential large-scale application, because we have demonstrated that removing females by disrupting sex determinate genes is possible with pgSIT, which can inform the development of such systems in other species in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>If I'm reading Figure 2C right, the authors have combined the results from two types of crosses in the last two plots: 1) the Cas9 (X) gRNA mosquitoes and 2) the progeny from these crossed to WTs. This is not ideal. I would suggest the authors unpack the text around this data and plot it separately.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really appreciate the comment here, the panel 2C depicts the phenotypic data of the F1 progeny generated by the cross of the parents indicated below the X axis: egg-to-adult survival, larval death, sex ratios, and fertility. The fertility of F1 progeny is the major phenotypic feature for the project. To assess the fertility of the surviving F1 progeny, we had to cross the F1 females and males to WT males and females, respectively and assess the hatching rate of produced eggs before sacrificing emerged larvae and unhatched eggs. It's important to note that mosquito females can lay unfertilized eggs that fail to hatch.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The text around 2F needs to be more explanatory. There are lots of labels in the figure that are not referred to, making it difficult to follow the data.</p>
