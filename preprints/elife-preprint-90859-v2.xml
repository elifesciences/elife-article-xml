<abstract>
<p>Neurobiological investigations of perceptual decision-making have furnished the first glimpse of a flexible cognitive process at the level of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>). Neurons in the parietal and prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim and Shadlen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Romo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hernández et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ding and Gold, 2012</xref>) are thought to represent the accumulation of noisy evidence, acquired over time, leading to a decision. Neural recordings averaged over many decisions have provided support for the deterministic rise in activity to a termination bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>). Critically, it is the unobserved stochastic component that is thought to confer variability in both choice and decision time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>). Here, we elucidate this drift-diffusion signal on individual decisions. We recorded simultaneously from hundreds of neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) of monkeys while they made decisions about the direction of random dot motion. We show that a single scalar quantity, derived from the weighted sum of the population activity, represents a combination of deterministic drift and stochastic diffusion. Moreover, we provide direct support for the hypothesis that this drift-diffusion signal approximates the quantity responsible for the variability in choice and reaction times. The population-derived signals rely on a small subset of neurons with response fields that overlap the choice targets. These neurons represent the integral of noisy evidence. Another subset of direction-selective neurons with response fields that overlap the motion stimulus appear to represent the integrand. This parsimonious architecture would escape detection by state-space analyses, absent a clear hypothesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neural signals in the mammalian cortex are notoriously noisy. They manifest as a sequence of action potentials (spikes) that approximate non-stationary Poisson point processes. Therefore, to characterize the signal produced by a neuron, electrophysiologists typically combine the spike times from many repetitions, or trials, relative to the time of an event (e.g., stimulus onset), to yield the average firing rate of the neuron as a function of time. Such trial-averaged firing rates are the main staple of systems neuroscience. They are the source of knowledge about spatial selectivity (e.g., receptive fields), feature selectivity (e.g., direction of motion, faces vs. other objects), and even cognitive signals associated with working memory, anticipation, attention, motor planning, and decision making. But there is an important limitation.</p>
<p>Trial averages suppress signals that vary independently across trials (here and throughout, trial average and across-trial average refer to the mean of signal values, over all specified trials at the same time, <italic>t</italic>, relative to a trial event [<italic>e.g</italic>., motion onset]).. In many cognitive tasks, such as difficult decisions, the variable component of the signal is the most interesting, because it is this component that is thought to explain the variable choice and response time. This variability is thought to arise from a decision process that accumulates noisy evidence in favor of the alternatives and terminates when the accumulated evidence for one alternative, termed the decision variable (DV), reaches a terminating bound. The DV is stochastic because the integral of noisy samples of evidence is biased Brownian motion (or drift-diffusion) and this leads to a stochastic choice and response time on each decision. However, the stochastic part of this signal is suppressed by averaging across trials. We will use the term drift-diffusion because it is the expression most commonly applied in models of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>), and we will consider the noise part—that is, diffusion—as the signal of interest.</p>
<p>In the setting of difficult perceptual decisions, studied here, bounded drift-diffusion reconciles the relationship between decision speed and accuracy. It also explains the trial-averaged firing rates of neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) that represent the action used by monkeys to indicate their choice. These firing rate averages show motion-dependent, ramping activity that reflects the direction and strength of motion, consistent with the drift component of drift-diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>). Up to now, however, the diffusion component has not been observed, owing to averaging.</p>
<p>There is thus a missing link between the mathematical characterization of the decision process and its realization in neural circuits, leaving open the possibility that drift-diffusion dynamics do not underlie LIP activity (<italic>e.g</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>), or emerge only at the level of the population, without explicit representation by single neurons. We reasoned that these and other alternatives to drift-diffusion could be adjudicated if it were possible to resolve the DV giving rise to a single decision.</p>
<p>This stratagem is now feasible, owing to the development of high-density Neuropixels probes, which are capable of recording from deep sulci in the primate brain. Here we provide the first direct evidence for a drift-diffusion process underlying single decisions. We recorded simultaneously from up to 203 neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) while monkeys made perceptual decisions about the direction of dynamic random dot motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Newsome et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>). Using a variety of dimensionality reduction techniques, we show that a drift-diffusion signal can be detected in such populations on individual trials. Moreover, this signal satisfies the criteria for a DV that controls the choice and reaction time. Notably, the signal of interest is dominated by a small subpopulation of neurons with response fields that overlap one of the choice targets, consistent with earlier single neuron studies (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>)</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Two monkeys made perceptual decisions, reported by an eye movement, about the net direction of dynamic random dot motion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We measured the speed and accuracy of these decisions as a function of motion strength (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, circles). The choice probabilities and the distribution of reaction times (RT) are well described (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, traces) by a bounded drift-diffusion model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). On 50% of the trials, a brief (100 ms) pulse of weak leftward or rightward motion was presented at a random time. The influence of these pulses on choice and RT further supports the assertion that the choices and RTs arose through a process of integration of noisy samples of evidence to a stopping bound (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Stine et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hyafil et al., 2023</xref>). In addition to the main task, the monkeys performed two control tasks: instructed, delayed saccades to peripheral targets and passive viewing of random dot motion (see Methods). These control tasks served to identify, <italic>post hoc</italic>, neurons with response fields that overlap the choice target in the hemifield contralateral to the recording site <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, neurons with response fields that overlap the other choice target <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and neurons with response fields that overlap the random-dot motion stimulus (M<sub>in</sub>; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>We recorded simultaneously from populations of neurons in area LIP, using newly developed macaque Neuropixels probes while monkeys performed these tasks. The data set comprises eight sessions from two monkeys (1696– 2894 trials per session; <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Our primary goal was to identify activity in LIP that relates to the decision variable, a theoretical quantity that determines the choice and reaction time on each trial. To achieve this, we formed weighted averages from all neurons in the sample population, including those with response fields that do not overlap a choice target or the motion stimulus. We used several strategies to assign this vector of weights, which we refer to as a <italic>coding direction</italic> in the neuronal state space. The projection of the spiking activity from the population of neurons onto the vector of weights gives rise to a scalar function of time, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>), where the superscript <italic>x</italic> labels the strategy. We focus on such one-dimensional projections because of the long-standing hypothesis that the DV is drift-diffusion, which is a scalar function of time.</p>
<p>We first developed a targeted strategy that would reproduce the well-known coherence-dependent ramping activity evident in the across-trial averages. This strategy applies regression to best approximate a linear ramp, on each trial, <italic>i</italic>, that terminates with a saccade to the choice-target contralateral to the hemisphere of the LIP recordings. The ramps are defined on the epoch spanning the decision time: from <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.2 s after motion onset to <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> = 0.05 s before saccade initiation (black lines in <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The epoch is motivated by many previous studies (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>, and see below). Each ramp begins at <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) = −1 and ends at <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) = 1. The ramp approximates the expectation—conditional on the choice and response time—of the deterministic components of the drift-diffusion signal which can incorporate (<italic>i</italic>) the deterministic drift, (<italic>ii</italic>) a time-dependent but evidence-independent urgency signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</xref>), and (<italic>iii</italic>) a dynamic bias signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hanks et al., 2011</xref>). It can also be viewed as an approximation to firing rates averaged across trials and grouped by contraversive choice and RT quantile (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>, see also <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Importantly, the fit is not guided by an assumption of an underlying diffusion process. That is, the ramp coding direction is agnostic to the underlying processes whose averages approximate ramps. The weights derived from these regression fits specify a ramp-coding direction in the state space defined by the population of neurons in the session. The single-trial signal, <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>(<italic>t</italic>), is rendered as the projection of the population firing rates onto this coding direction.</p>
<p>The left side of <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> shows single-trial activity rendered by this strategy. The right side of the figure shows the averages of the single-trial responses grouped by signed coherence and aligned to motion onset or response time (saccade initiation). These averaged traces exhibit features of the firing rate averages in previous studies of single neurons in LIP (e.g., see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>, and <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). They begin to diverge as a function of the direction and strength of motion approximately 200 ms after the onset of motion. The traces converge near the time of saccadic response to the contralateral choice-target such that the coherence dependence is absent or greatly diminished. Coherence dependence remains evident through the initiation of saccades to the right (ipsilateral) target, consistent with a race architecture—between negatively correlated accumulators—depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>.</p>

<p>Rows show three types of population signals. The left columns show representative single-trial firing rates during the first 300 ms of evidence accumulation using two motion strengths: 0% and 25.6% coherence toward the left (contralateral) choice target. For visualization, single-trial traces were baseline corrected by subtracting the activity in a 50 ms window around 200 ms. We highlight several trials with thick traces (same trials in a–c). The right columns show the across-trial average responses for each coherence and direction. Motion strength and direction are indicated by color (legend) and aligned to motion onset (left) or saccade initiation (right). The gray bars under the motion-aligned averages indicate the 300 ms epoch used in the display of the single-trial responses (left panels). The epoch begins when LIP first registers a signal related to the strength and direction of motion. Except for saccade-aligned response, trials are cut off 100 ms before saccade initiation. Error trials are excluded from the saccade-aligned averages, only. <bold>a</bold>, Ramp coding direction. The weight vector is established by regression to ramps from −1 to + 1 over the period of putative integration, from 200 ms after motion onset to 100 ms before saccade initiation (see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). Only trials ending in left (contralateral) choices are used in the regression. <bold>b</bold>, First principal component (PC1) coding direction. <bold>c</bold>, Average firing rates of the subset of neurons that represent the left (contralateral) target.

Note the similarity of both the single-trial traces and the response averages produced by the different weighting strategies.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We complemented this regression strategy with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and use the first PC (PC1), which explains 44 ± 7% of the variance (mean ± s.e. across sessions) of the activity between 200 and 600 ms from motion onset (see Methods). This coding direction renders single trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). In a third strategy, we consider the mean activity of neurons with response fields that overlapped the contralateral choice target (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons), which were the focus of previous single-neuron studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>). In those studies, the task was modified so that one of the choice targets was placed in the neural response field, whereas here we identify neurons <italic>post hoc</italic> with response fields that happen to overlap the contralateral choice target. This difference probably accounts for the lower firing rates of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons studied here. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> shows single-trial and across-trial averages from these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons. They too render signals, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, similar to those derived from the full population. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons thus furnish a third coding direction defined by a vector of identical positive weights assigned to all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons and 0 for all other neurons in the population. The emboldened single-trial traces in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <italic>left</italic> correspond to the same trials rendered by the three coding directions. It is not difficult to tell which are the corresponding traces, an observation that speaks to their similarity, and the same is true for the averages. We will expand on this observation in what follows.</p>
<p>The averages show the deterministic <italic>drift</italic> component of the hypothesized drift-diffusion process, with the slope varying monotonically with the signed motion strength (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <italic>right</italic>). The rise begins to saturate as a consequence of the putative termination bound—a combination of dropout of trials that are about to terminate and the effect on the distribution of possible diffusion paths imposed by the very existence of a stopping bound. This saturation is evident earlier on trials with stronger motion, hence shorter RT, on average. The positive buildup rate on the 0% coherence motion represents the time-dependent, evidence-independent signal that is thought to reflect the cost of time. It leads to termination even if the evidence is weak, equivalent to collapsing stopping bounds in traditional, symmetric drift-diffusion models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Drugowitsch et al., 2012</xref>). Removal of this <italic>urgency</italic> signal, <italic>u</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), from the non-zero coherence traces renders the positive and negative coherence averages symmetric relative to zero on the ordinate (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>The single-trial responses in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> do not look like the averages but instead approximate drift-diffusion. We focus on the epoch from 200 to 500 (or 600) ms from motion onset—that is, the first 300 (or 400) ms of the period in which the averages reflect the integration of evidence. Some traces are cut off before the end of the epoch because a saccade occurred 100 ms later on the trial. However, most 0% coherence trials continue beyond 500 ms (median RT &gt; 600 ms). The single-trial traces do not rise monotonically as a function of time but meander and tend to spread apart from each other vertically. For unbounded diffusion, the variance would increase linearly, but as just mentioned, the existence of an upper stopping bound and the limited range of firing rates (<italic>e.g</italic>., non-negative) renders the function sublinear at later times (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The autocorrelation between an early and a later sample from the same diffusion trace is also clearly specified for unbounded diffusion. The theoretical values shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b &amp; c</xref> are the autocorrelations of unbounded diffusion processes that are smoothed identically to the neural signals (see Methods and Appendix). The autocorrelations in the data follow a strikingly similar pattern. These observations support the assertion that the coherence-dependent (ramp-like) firing rate averages observed in previous studies of area LIP are composed of stochastic drift-diffusion processes on single trials.</p>

<title>Single-trial drift-diffusion signals approximate the decision variable</title>
<p>We next evaluate the hypothesis that the drift-diffusion signal, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>), is the decision variable that controls the choice and response time. We have identified several coding directions that produce candidate DVs, and as we will see below, there are also other coding directions of interest that can be derived from the population. Additionally, PCA indicates that the dimensionality of the data is low, but greater than one (participation ratio = 4.4 ±1.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mazzucato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, one might wonder whether it is sensible to assume that the DV can be approximated by a scalar measure arising from a single coding direction as opposed to a higher dimensional representation. Two decoding exercises are adduced to support the assumption.</p>
<p>We constructed a logistic decoder of choice using each neuron<italic>’</italic>s spike counts in 50 ms bins between 100 and 500 ms after motion onset. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, this <italic>What</italic>-decoder (orange) predicts choice as accurately as a decoder of simulated data from a drift-diffusion model (black) using parameters derived from fits to the monkeys<italic>’</italic> choice and RT data (see Methods). The simulation establishes a rough estimate of the decoding accuracy that can be achieved, given the stochastic nature of the choice, were we granted access to the drift-diffusion signal that actually determines the decision. In this analysis, the decoder can use a different vector of weights at each point in time (<italic>time-dependent</italic> coding directions; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Peixoto et al., 2021</xref>). However, if the representation of the decision variable in LIP is one-dimensional, then a decoder trained at one time should perform well when tested at a different time. The red curve in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> shows the performance of a <italic>What</italic>-decoder with a <italic>fixed training-time</italic> (450 ms after motion onset; red arrow). This decoder performs nearly as well as the decoder trained at each time bin. The heatmap (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) generalizes this observation. It shows two main features for all times 300 &lt; <italic>t</italic> &lt; 500 ms (dashed box). First, unsurprisingly, for a <italic>What</italic> choice decoder trained on data at one time <italic>t</italic> = <italic>x</italic>, the predictions improve as the testing time advances (the decoding accuracy increases along any vertical) as more evidence is accrued. Second, and more importantly, decoders tested at time <italic>t</italic> = <italic>y</italic> perform similarly, independent of when they were trained (there is little variation in decoding accuracy along any horizontal). This observation suggests that a single vector of weights may suffice to decode the choice from the population response.</p>

<p>Two binary decoders were trained to predict the choice (<italic>What</italic>-decoder) and its time (<italic>When</italic>-decoder) using the population responses in each session.

Both training procedures achieve high levels of accuracy. The <italic>When</italic>-decoder is trained to capture the time of response only on trials terminating with a left (contraversive) choice.

<p>The second decoder is trained to predict whether a saccade to the contralateral choice target will be initiated in the next 150 ms. This <italic>When</italic>-decoder is trained by logistic regression to predict a binary output: 1 at all time-points that are within 150 ms of an upcoming saccade and 0 elsewhere (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). We validated the When-decoder by computing the area under an ROC (AUC) using the held-out (odd) trials (mean AUC over all time points: 0.84), but this is tangential to our goal. Although the <italic>When</italic>-decoder was trained only to predict the time of saccades, our rationale for developing this decoder was to test whether the <italic>When</italic> coding direction can be used to predict the <italic>choice</italic>. The green trace in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> shows the accuracy of <italic>S</italic><sup>When</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) to predict the choice. The performance is almost identical to the choice decoder, despite being trained on a temporal feature of trials ending in the same left choice. This feat is explained by the similarity of signals produced by the <italic>When</italic>- and other coding directions. Note the similarity of the trial averaged <italic>S</italic><sup>When</sup> signals displayed in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref> to those in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (see also <xref rid="figS7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7a</xref>, right). Indeed, the cosine similarity between the <italic>When</italic> and <italic>Ramp</italic> coding directions is 0.67 ± 0.03 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). In light of this, it is not surprising that the weighting vectors derived from both the <italic>What</italic>- and <italic>When</italic>-decoders also render single-trial drift-diffusion traces that resemble each other and those rendered by other coding directions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Together these analyses support the assertion that the DV is likely to be captured by a single dimension, consistent with <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">Ganguli et al. (2008</xref>).</p>
<p>If the one-dimensional signals, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>), approximate the decision variable, they should explain the variability of choice and reaction time for trials sharing the same direction and motion strength. Specifically, (<italic>i</italic>) early samples of <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>) should be predictive of choice and correlate inversely with the RT on trials that result in contraversive (leftward) choices, (<italic>ii</italic>) later samples ought to predict choice better and correlate more strongly (negatively) with RT than earlier samples, and (<italic>iii</italic>) later samples should contain the information present in the earlier samples and thus mediate (<italic>i.e</italic>., reduce the leverage) of the earlier samples on choice and RT. Each of these predictions is borne out by the data.</p>
<p>The analyses depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> allow us to visualize the influence of the single trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>), on the choice and RT on that trial. We focus on the early epoch of evidence accumulation (200–550 ms after random dot motion onset) and restrict the analyses to decisions with RT ≥ 670 ms and coherence ≤ 6.4%. The RT restriction eliminates 17% of the eligible trials. Larger values of <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>) are associated with a larger probability of a left (contraversive) choice and a shorter RT, hence negative correlation between <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>) and RT. We use the term, leverage, to describe the strength of both of these associations. The leverage on choice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, black traces) is the contribution of <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>) to the log odds of a left choice, after accounting for the motion strength and direction (<italic>i.e</italic>., the coefficients, <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq. 8</xref>). The leverage on RT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>) is the Pearson correlation between <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>) and the RT on that trial, after accounting for the effect of motion strength and direction on <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup> and RT (See Methods). The leverage is evident from the earliest sign of evidence accumulation, 200 ms after motion onset, and its magnitude increases as a function of time, as evidence accrues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>top</italic>). The filled circle to the right of the traces in each graph shows the leverage of <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup> at <italic>t</italic> = 550 ms, which is 120 ms before any of the included trials have terminated. Both observations are consistent with the hypothesis that <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup> represents the integral of noisy evidence used to form and terminate the decision. Two control analyses demonstrate that the degree of leverage on choice and RT do not arise by chance: (<italic>i</italic>) random coding directions in state space produce negligible leverage (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>, <italic>top</italic>), and (<italic>ii</italic>) breaking the trial-by-trial correspondence between neural activity and behavior eliminates all leverage (see Reviewer <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> in reply to peer review).</p>

<p>Importantly, the leverage at earlier times is mediated by the later sample at <italic>t</italic> = 550 ms. The blue traces in all graphs show the remaining leverage, once this later sample is allowed to explain the choice and RT—by including, respectively, an additional term in the logistic regression (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq. 9</xref>) and calculating the partial correlation, conditional on <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic> = 0.55).

Mediation is significant in 47 of the 48 comparisons (all p&lt;0.023, median <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−317</sup>).

The mediation is significant when this comparison is included in the combined data (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−9</sup>, Paired Samples t-test). The stark decrease in leverage is consistent with one-dimensional diffusion in which later values of the signal contain the information in the earlier samples plus what has accrued in the interim. Had we recorded from all the neurons that represent the DV, we would expect the mediation to be complete (e.g., partial correlation = 0). However, our recorded population is only a fraction of the entire population. Indeed, the observed degree of mediation is similar to values obtained from simulations of weakly correlated, noisy neurons (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>).</p>
<p>There is one additional noteworthy observation in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> that highlights the importance of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons. The top and middle rows (<italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup> and <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup>) contain a second, open symbol, which is simply a copy of the filled symbol from the bottom row<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline11.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The yellow traces show significant cross-mediation of <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup> and <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup> by the sample, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline12.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (all <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; median <italic>p</italic> &lt; 10<sup>−268</sup>; bootstrap as above). This signal, carried by 9–21% of the neurons, mediates signals produced by the full population of 54–203 neurons nearly as strongly as <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup> and <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup> mediate themselves. The observation suggests that minimal leverage is gained by sophisticated analyses of the full neuronal state space compared to a simple average of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline13.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons. This is both reassuring and disquieting: reassuring because the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons compose the dominant projection from LIP to the portions of the superior colliculus and the frontal eye field involved in the generation of saccades toward the contralateral choice target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Paré and Wurtz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ferraina et al., 2002</xref>); disquieting because the functional relevance of these neurons is not revealed by the other coding directions. The weights assigned to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline15.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons span all percentiles (mean IQR: 49–96; mean 71<sup>st</sup> percentile, <italic>AUC</italic> = 0.74±0.05) in the ramp coding direction. They contribute disproportionately to PC1 and the <italic>What</italic>- and <italic>When</italic>-decoders but not enough to stand out based on their weights. Indeed, the ability to predict that a neuron is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline16.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from its weight or percentile is remarkably poor (<xref rid="figS9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>).</p>
<p>These observations support the idea that the single-trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>, <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline17.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, approximate the DV used by the monkey to make its decision. In <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref> we show that the <italic>S</italic><sup>What</sup> and <italic>S</italic><sup>When</sup> coding directions achieve qualitatively similar results. Moreover, a late sample from <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>) mediates the earlier correlation with RT and choice of signals rendered by other coding directions, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>y</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>), at earlier times (<xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). Such cross-mediation is consistent with the high degree of cosine similarity between the coding directions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). The observation suggests that the decision variable is a prominent signal in LIP, discoverable by a variety of strategies, and consistent with the idea that it is one-dimensional. In <xref rid="figS12" ref-type="fig">Fig. S12</xref>, we show that linear and nonlinear decoders achieve similar performance, which argues against a non-linear embedding of the decision variable in the population activity.</p>

<p>Up to now, we have focused our analyses on resolving the DV on single trials, paying little attention to how it is computed or to other signals that may be present in the LIP population. The drift-diffusion signal approximates the accumulation, or integral, of the noisy momentary evidence—a signal approximating the difference in the firing rates of direction-selective (DS) neurons with opposing direction preferences (e.g, in area MT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Britten et al., 1996</xref>). DS neurons, with properties similar to neurons in MT, have also been identified in area LIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Freedman and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shushruth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fanini and Assad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bollimunta and Ditterich, 2012</xref>), where they are proposed to play a role in motion categorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freedman and Assad, 2011</xref>). We hypothesize that such neurons might participate in routing information from DS neurons in MT/MST to those in LIP that contain a choice-target in their response fields.</p>
<p>We identified such DS neurons using a passive motion viewing task (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-b</xref>, left). Neurons preferring leftward or rightward motion constitute 5–10% of the neurons in our sample populations <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows the average firing rates of 51 leftward-preferring neurons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline18.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) and 26 rightward-preferring neurons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline19.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) under passive motion viewing and decision-making. The separation of the two traces in the passive viewing task is guaranteed because we used this task to identify the DS neurons. It is notable, however, that the DS is first evident about 100 ms after the onset of random dot motion, and this latency is also apparent in mean firing rates grouped by signed coherence during decision making (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref> <italic>right</italic>). The activity of DS neurons is modulated by both the direction and strength of motion. However, unlike the T<sub>in</sub> neurons, the traces associated with different motion strengths are mostly parallel to one another and do not reach a common level of activity before the saccadic eye movement (<italic>i.e</italic>., they do not signal decision termination).</p>

<p>In addition to their shorter onset latency, the direction-selectivity of M<sub>in</sub> neurons precedes the choice-selectivity of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline20.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons by ∼100 ms (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>). The responses bear similarity to DS neurons in area MT. Such neurons are known to exhibit choice-dependent activity insofar as they furnish the noisy evidence that is integrated to form the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Britten et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Shadlen et al., 1996</xref>). We computed putative single trial direction signals by averaging the responses from the left- and right-preferring DS neurons, respectively. The resulting signals, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline21.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline22.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, have weak leverage on choice, but the leverage does not increase as a function of time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). This is what would be expected if the M<sub>in</sub> neurons represent the noisy momentary evidence as opposed to the accumulation thereof (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Mazurek et al., 2003</xref>). We failed to detect a correlation between RT and either <italic>S</italic><sub>Min</sub> signal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). This is surprising, but it could be explained by lack of power—a combination of small numbers of M<sub>in</sub> neurons, narrow sample windows (50 ms boxcar) and the focus on the long RT trials. Indeed, we found a weak but statistically significant negative correlation between RT and the difference in leftward vs. rightward signals, averaged over the epoch 0.1 ≤ <italic>t</italic> ≤ 0.4 <italic>s</italic> from motion onset (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0004; <italic>ℋ</italic><sub>0</sub> : <italic>ρ</italic> ≥ 0, see Methods).</p>
<p>We considered the hypothesis that these DS signals are integrated by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline23.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons to form the DV.

The correlations are significant in the epoch of interest, and they differ significantly from the average correlations in the rest of the graph (<italic>i.e., t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &lt; 100, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &lt; 200, or <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &lt; <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, permutation test).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have observed a neural representation of the stochastic process that gives rise to a single decision. This is the elusive drift-diffusion signal that has long been thought to determine the variable choice and response time in the perceptual task studied here. The signal was elusive because it is the integral of noisy momentary evidence, hence stochastic, and undetectable in the firing rates when they are computed as averages over trials. The averages preserve the ramp-like <italic>drift</italic> component, leaving open the possibility that the averages are composed of other stochastic processes (<italic>e.g</italic>., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Latimer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cisek et al., 2009</xref>). By providing access to populations of neurons in LIP, macaque Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Trautmann et al., 2023</xref>) allowed us to resolve, for the first time, the evolution of LIP activity during a single decision.</p>
<p>The present findings establish that the ramp-like averages arise from drift-diffusion on single trials, and this drift-diffusion signal approximates the decision variable that arbitrates the choice and RT on that trial. We used a variety of strategies to assign a weight to each neuron in the population such that the vector of weights defines a coding direction in neuronal state space. The weighted averages render population firing rate signals on single trials. Our experience is that any method of assigning the weights that captures a known feature of evidence accumulation (or its termination in a saccadic choice) reveals drift-diffusion on single trials, and this also holds for data-driven, hypothesis-free methods such as PCA. This is because the actual dimensionality of the DV is effectively one— a scalar function of time that connects the visual evidence to a saccadic choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ganguli et al., 2008</xref>). Thus a weighting established by training a decoder at time <italic>t</italic> = <italic>τ</italic> to predict the monkey<italic>’</italic>s choice performs nearly as well when tested at times other than the time the decoder was trained on (<italic>i.e., t</italic> ≠ <italic>τ</italic>; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>
<p>The different strategies for deriving coding directions lead to different weight assignments, but the coding directions are linearly dependent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). They produce traces, <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), that are similar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>) and suggestive of drift-diffusion. Traces accompanying trials with the same motion coherence meander and spread apart at a rate similar to diffusion (<italic>i.e</italic>., standard deviation proportional to<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>), and they exhibit a pattern of autocorrelation, as a function of time and lag, consistent with diffusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). The calculations applied in the present study improve upon previous applications (<italic>e.g</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Churchland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">de Lafuente et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shushruth et al., 2018</xref>) by incorporating the contribution of the smoothing to the autocorrelations. The departures from theory are explained by the fact that the accumulations are bounded. The upper bound and the fact that spike rates must be non-negative (a <italic>de facto</italic> lower reflecting bound) limits the spread of the single-trial traces.</p>
<p>The single-trial signals, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, approximate the DV that gives rise to the choice and decision time on trial <italic>i</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="figS11" ref-type="fig">Fig. S11</xref>). Support for this assertion is obtained using a conservative assay, which quantifies the leverage of the first 300 ms of the signal<italic>’</italic>s evolution on decision outcomes—choice and RT—occurring at least 670 ms after motion onset. Naturally, the signals do not explain all the variance of these outcomes. The sample size is limited to <italic>N</italic> randomly selected, often weakly correlated neurons. The sample size and correlation are especially limiting for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons (𝔼(<italic>r</italic>) = 0.067 ± 0.0036). Control analyses show that the degree of leverage on behavior and mediation of these relationships by later activity is on par with that obtained from simulated, weakly-correlated neurons (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic>). In addition, because they are identified <italic>post hoc</italic>, many have response fields that barely overlap the choice target. Presumably, that is why their responses are weak compared to previous single-neuron studies in which the choice targets were centered in the response field by the experimenter. Yet even this noisy signal, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline29.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, mediates signals produced by coding directions using the entire population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>).</p>
<p>The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline30.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons were the first to be identified as a plausible candidate neural representation of the decision variable, based on firing rate averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</xref>). This neural type is also representative of the LIP projection to the region of the superior colliculus (SC) that represents the saccadic vector required to center the gaze on the choice target. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Paré and Wurtz, 1998</xref>). In a companion study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66"><italic>Stine et al</italic>. (<italic>2023</italic></xref>) we show that the SC is responsible for cessation of integration in LIP. Features of the drift-diffusion signal from the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline31.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons are correlated with bursting events in corresponding populations of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline32.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons in the SC, including the final saccadic burst that ends the decision with a saccade to the contralateral choice target. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66"><italic>Stine et al</italic>. (<italic>2023</italic></xref>) also show that inactivation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons in the SC has little effect on<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline34.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> signals in LIP.</p>
<p>Previous studies of LIP using the random dot motion task focused primarily on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline35.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons (<italic>cf</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Meister et al., 2013</xref>). It was thus unknown whether and how other neurons contribute to the decision process. The Neuropixels probes used in the present study yield a large and unbiased sample of neurons. Many of these neurons have response fields that overlap one of the two choice targets, but the majority have response fields that overlap neither the choice targets nor the random dot motion. Our screening procedures (delayed saccades and passive motion viewing tasks) do not supply a quantitative estimate of their spatial distribution. It is worth noting that neurons with response fields that overlap neither of the two choice targets were assigned nonzero weights by the <italic>What</italic>- and <italic>When</italic>-decoders, and yet, removal of the task-related neurons that represent the choice targets and motion (<italic>i.e</italic>., T<sub>in</sub> and M<sub>in</sub>) decreases decoding accuracy more substantially than removing all but the T<sub>in</sub> neurons, especially when decoders are not retrained at every time point (<xref rid="figS13" ref-type="fig">Fig. S13</xref>). The accuracy the decoder achieves is likely explained by neurons with weak responses that simply failed to meet our criterion for inclusion in the T<sub>in</sub> and M<sub>in</sub> categories (e.g., neurons with response fields that barely overlap the choice targets or RDM). Some neurons outside these groups might reflect normalization signals from the T<sub>in</sub> and M<sub>in</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Shushruth et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</xref>), imbuing broad, decision-related co-variability across the population. It thus seems possible that higher dimensional tasks (<italic>e.g</italic>., four choices instead of two) could decrease correlations among groups of neurons with different response fields.</p>
<p>The fact that the raw averages from a small number of weakly correlated T<sub>in</sub> neurons furnish a DV on par with that furnished by the full population underscores the importance of this functional class. The role of the M<sub>in</sub> neurons is less well understood. Freedman and colleagues described direction selective neurons in LIP, similar to our M<sub>in</sub> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Freedman and Assad, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fanini and Assad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sarma et al., 2016</xref>). They showed that the neurons represent both the direction of motion and the decision in their task. In contrast, we do not observe the evolution of the decision (<italic>i.e</italic>., DV) by the M<sub>in</sub> neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The latency of the direction and coherence-dependent signal as well as its dynamics resemble properties of DS neurons in area MT. The delayed correlation between M<sub>in</sub> and T<sub>in</sub> responses evokes the intriguing possibility that M<sub>in</sub> neurons supply the momentary evidence, which is integrated within LIP itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Future experiments that better optimize the yield of M<sub>in</sub> neurons will be informative, and direct, causal support will require perturbations of functionally identified M<sub>in</sub> neurons, which is not yet feasible. A natural question is why LIP would contain a copy of the DS signals that are already present in area MT. We suspect it simplifies the routing of momentary evidence from neurons in MT/MST to the appropriate T<sub>in</sub> neurons. This interpretation leads to the prediction that DS M<sub>in</sub> neurons would be absent in LIP of monkeys that are naïve to saccadic decisions informed by random dot motion, as has been observed in the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Horwitz et al., 2004</xref>). Further, when motion is not the feature that informs the saccadic response—for example in a color categorization task (<italic>e.g</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kang et al., 2021</xref>)—LIP might contain a representation of momentary evidence for color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Toth and Assad, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sereno and Maunsell, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The capacity to record from many neurons simultaneously invites characterization of the population in neuronal state space (NSS), in which the activity of each neuron defines a dimension. Often, population activity is confined to a low-dimensional subspace or manifold within the NSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). An ever-more-popular viewpoint is that representations within these subspaces are emergent properties of the population—that is, <italic>distributed</italic>, rather than coded <italic>directly</italic> by single neurons—a dichotomy that has its roots in Barlow<italic>’</italic>s neuron doctrine (as updated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Barlow, 1994</xref>). Indeed, it is tempting to conclude that the drift-diffusion signal in LIP is similarly emergent based on our NSS analyses—the identified subspaces (<italic>i.e</italic>., coding directions) combine neurons with highly diverse activity profiles. In contrast, grouping neurons by the location of their spatial response field reveals a direct coding scheme: T<sub>in</sub> neurons directly represent the accumulated evidence for making a particular saccade and M<sub>in</sub> neurons represent the momentary evidence. We argue that this explanation is more parsimonious and, importantly, more principled. Grouping neurons based on spatial selectivity rests on the principle that neurons with similar RFs have similar projections, which is the basis for topographic maps in the visual and oculomotor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Silver and Kastner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kremkow et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Felleman and Van Essen, 1991</xref>). In contrast, there are no principles that guide the grouping of neurons in state space analyses, as the idea is that they may comprise as many dimensions as there are neurons that happen to be sampled by the recording device.</p>
<p>The present finding invites both hope and caution. It may be useful to consider a counterfactual state of the scientific literature that lacks knowledge of the properties of LIP T<sub>in</sub> neurons—a world without <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">Gnadt and Andersen (1988</xref>) and no knowledge of LIP neurons with spatially selective persistent activity. In this world we have no reason to entertain the hypothesis that decisions would involve neurons that represent the choice targets. We do know about DS neurons in area MT and their causal role in decisions about the direction of random dot motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Salzman et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fetsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Ditterich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Liu and Pack, 2017</xref>). We also know that drift-diffusion models explain the choice-response time behavior. Guided by no particular hypothesis, we obtain population neural recordings in the random dot motion task. We do not perform the saccade and passive viewing control experiments. What might we learn from such a dataset? We might apply PCA and/or train a choice decoder or possibly a <italic>When</italic>-decoder. If so, we could discover the drift-diffusion signal and we might also infer that the dimensionality of the signal is low. However, we would not discover the T<sub>in</sub> neurons without a hypothesis and a test thereof. We might notice that the coding directions that reveal drift-diffusion often render a response at the onset of the choice targets as well as increased activity at the time of saccades to the contralateral choice target. These facts might lead us to hypothesize that the population might contain neurons with visual receptive fields and some relationship to saccadic eye movements. We might then query individual neurons, <italic>post hoc</italic>, for these features, and ask if they render the drift-diffusion signal too. The inferences could then be tested experimentally by including simple delayed saccades in the next experiment. The hope in this counterfactual is that data-driven, hypothesis-free methods can inspire hypotheses about the mechanism. The caution is to avoid the natural tendency to stop before the hypotheses and tests, thus accepting as an endpoint the characterization of population dynamics in high dimensions or a lower dimensional manifold. If LIP is representative, these mathematically accurate characterizations may fail to illuminate the neurobiological parsimony.</p>

After acquiring a central fixation point and a random delay (0.25–0.7 s, <italic>λ</italic> =0.15), two red choice-targets (diameter 1 dva) appear in the left and right visual fields. The random dot motion is then displayed after a random delay (0.25 – 0.7 s, <italic>λ</italic> =0.4 s) and continues until the monkey breaks fixation. The dots are confined to a circular aperture (diameter 5 dva; degrees visual angle) centered on the fixation point (dot density 16.7 dots⋅dva<sup>−2</sup>⋅s<sup>−1</sup>). The direction and strength of motion are determined pseudorandomly from ±{0, 3.2, 6.4, 12.6, 25.6, 51.2}% coherence. The sign of the coherence indicates direction (positive for leftward, which is contraversive with respect to the recorded hemisphere). The absolute value of coherence determines the probability that a dot plotted on frame <italic>n</italic> will be displaced by Δ<italic>x</italic> on frame <italic>n</italic> + 3 (Δ<italic>t</italic> =40 ms), as opposed to randomly replaced, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline36.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> dva, consistent with 5 dva⋅s<sup>−1</sup> speed of apparent motion (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>). The monkey is rewarded for making a saccadic eye movement to the appropriate choice target. On trials with 0% coherence motion, either saccadic choice is rewarded with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline37.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Errors are punished by extending the intertrial interval by up to 3 s (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stine et al., 2023</xref>, for additional details). On approximately half of the trials, a 100 ms pulse of weak motion (±4% coherence) is added to the random dot motion stimulus at a random time (0.1–0.8 s, <italic>λ</italic> =0.4) relative to motion onset (similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kiani et al., 2008</xref>). Monkey M performed 9684 trials (5 sessions); monkey J performed 8142 trials (3 sessions). The data are also analyzed in a companion paper that focuses on the termination of the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stine et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>In the <italic>visually instructed delayed saccade task</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hikosaka and Wurtz, 1983</xref>), one target is displayed at a pseudo-random location in the visual field.

The monkey is rewarded for making a saccade to within ±2.5 dva of the location of the target. In a <italic>memory-guided</italic> variant of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>), the target is flashed briefly (200 ms) and the monkey is required to make a saccade to the remembered target location when the fixation point is extinguished. These tasks provide a rough characterization of the neural response fields during the visual, perisaccadic and delay epochs. Neurons are designated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline38.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> if they exhibit spatially selective activity at the location of the response target in the visual hemifield contralateral to the recorded hemisphere. This determination is made before analyzing the activity in the random dot motion task.

<p>The <italic>passive motion-viewing task</italic> is identical to the main task, except there are no choice targets and only the strongest motion strength (±51.2% coherence) is displayed for 500 ms (1 s on a small fraction of trials in session 1).

<p>We fit a neurally inspired variant of the drift-diffusion model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) to the choice-RT data from each session. The model constructs the decision process as a race between two accumulators: one accumulating evidence for left and against right (<italic>e.g</italic>., left minus right) and one accumulating evidence for right and against left (<italic>e.g</italic>., right minus left). The decision is determined by the accumulator that first exceeds its positive decision bound, at which point the decision is terminated. The races are negatively correlated with one another, owing to the common source of noisy evidence. We assume they share half the variance, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline42.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, but the results are robust to a wide range of reasonable values.

<p>We fit the race model described above to the combined behavioral data across all sessions (separately for each monkeys) and used the best-fitting parameters for monkey M (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) to simulate a total of 60,000 trials representing all signed coherences of the motion discrimination task.

We assume that the model-derived non-decision time (<italic>t</italic><sub>nd</sub> = 317 ms; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) comprises visual and motor processing times at the beginning and end of the decision: 200 ms from motion onset to the beginning of evidence integration, and the remaining 117 ms after termination.

<p>We used prototype <italic>“</italic>alpha<italic>”</italic> version Neuropixels1.0-NHP45 probes (IMEC/HHMI-Janelia) to record the activity of multiple isolated single-units from the ventral subdivision of area LIP (LIP<sub>v</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lewis and Van Essen 2000</xref>). We used anatomical MRI to identify LIP<sub>v</sub> and confirmed its physiological hallmarks with single-neuron recordings (Thomas Recording GmbH) before proceeding to multi-neuron recordings. Neuropixels probes enable recording from 384 out of 4416 total electrical contacts distributed along the 45 mm long shank. All data presented here were recorded using the 384 contacts closest to the tip of the probe (Bank 0), spanning 3.84 mm.

</disp-formula>
where the superscript, <italic>x</italic>, identifies the method or source that establishes the weights —that is, the coding direction in neuronal state space or the neuron type contributing to a pooled average (e.g.,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline43.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>). For visualization, the single-trial signals are smoothed by convolution with a truncated Gaussian using the Matlab function, <italic>gausswin</italic> (width = 80 ms, width-factor = 1.5, <italic>σ</italic> ≈ 26 ms). Unless otherwise specified, all other analyses employ a 50 ms boxcar (rectangular) filter; values plotted at time <italic>t</italic> include data from <italic>t</italic> − 24 to <italic>t</italic> + 25 ms.</p>
<p>We used several methods to define coding directions in the neuronal state space defined by the population of neurons in each session. For PCA and choice-decoding, we standardized the single trial firing rates for each neuron using the mean and standard deviation of its firing rate at in the epoch 200 ≤ <italic>t</italic> ≤ 600 ms after motion onset. This practice led to the exclusion of two neurons (session 1) that did not produce any spikes in the normalization window. Those neurons were assigned zero weight.</p>
<p><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>in</italic></sub> <italic>neurons</italic>. Neurons were classified <italic>post hoc</italic> as T<sub>in</sub> by visual-inspection of spatial heatmaps of neural activity acquired in the delayed saccade task. We inspected activity in the visual, delay, and perisaccadic epochs of the task. The distribution of target locations was guided by the spatial selectivity of simultaneously recorded neurons in the superior colliculus (SC; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Stine et al., 2023</xref>, for details). Briefly, after identifying the location of the SC response fields, we randomly presented saccade targets within this location and seven other, equally spaced locations at the same eccentricity. In monkey J we also included 1–3 additional eccentricities, spanning 5–16 degrees. Neurons were classified as T<sub>in</sub> if they displayed a clear, spatially-selective response in at least one epoch to one of the two locations occupied by the choice targets in the main task. Neurons that switched their spatial selectivity in different epochs were not classified as T<sub>in</sub>. The classification was conducted before the analyses of activity in the motion discrimination task. The procedure was meant to mimic those used in earlier single-neuron studies of LIP (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>) in which the location of the choice targets was determined online by the qualitative spatial selectivity of the neuron under study. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline44.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons in the present study were highly selective for either the contralateral or ipislateral choice target used in the RDM task (AUC = 0.89 ± 0.01; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 for 97% of neurons, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Given the sparse sampling of saccade target locations, we are unable to supply a quantitative estimate of the center and spatial extent of the RFs. We next describe the methods to establish the coding directions.</p>
<sec id="s4e1">
<title>Ramp direction</title>
<p>We applied linear regression to generate a signal that best approximates a linear ramp, on each trial, <italic>i</italic>, that terminates with a saccade to the choice-target contralateral to the hemisphere of the LIP recordings. The ramps are defined in the epoch spanning the decision time: each ramp begins at <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>) = −1, where <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0.2 s after motion onset, and ends at <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) = 1, where <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>t</italic><sub>sac</sub> − 0.05 s (<italic>i.e</italic>., 50 ms before saccade initiation). The ramps are sampled every 25 ms and concatenated using all eligible trials to construct a long saw-tooth function (see <xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2</xref>). The regression solves for the weights assigned to each neuron such that the weighted sum of the activity of all neurons best approximates the saw-tooth. We constructed a time series of standardized neural activity, sampled identically to the saw-tooth. The spike times from each neuron are represented as delta functions (rasters) and convolved with a non-causal 25 ms boxcar filter. The mean and standard deviation of all sampled values of activity were used to standardize the activity for each neuron (<italic>i.e</italic>., Z-transform). The coefficients derived from the regression establish the vector of weights that define <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>. The algorithm ensures that the population signal <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>(<italic>t</italic>), but not necessarily individual neurons, have amplitudes ranging from approximately −1 to 1.</p>
<p>We employed a lasso linear regression with <italic>λ</italic> = 0.005. The vector of weights assigned across the neurons defines a direction in neuronal state space, <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>, which we use to render the signal <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) on single trials by projecting the data onto this direction. To determine the effect of the regularization term in the lasso regression, we recomputed single-trial signals using standard linear regression, without regularization. We then calculated the Pearson correlation between single-trial traces generated by projecting neural data onto the two coding directions (<italic>i.e</italic>., with and without regularization). The high correlation between single trial traces (mean <italic>r</italic> = 0.99, across sessions) indicates that the findings are not a result of the regularization applied. Here and elsewhere we compute the mean <italic>r</italic> using the Fisher-z transform, such that

<title>Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</title>
<p>We applied standard PCA to the firing rate averages for each neuron using all trials sharing the same signed motion coherence in the shorter of two epochs: 200 ms to either 600 ms after motion onset or 100 ms before the median RT for the signed coherence, whichever produces the shorter interval. The results of the PCA indicate that the dimensionality of the data is low, but greater than one. The participation ratio is 4.4 ±1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mazzucato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gao et al., 2017</xref>) and the first 3 PCs explain 67.1 ±3.1 % of the variance on average (both mean ±s.e.m. across sessions). As in all other analyses of neural activity aligned to motion onset, we exclude data in the 100 ms epoch ending at saccade initiation on each trial.

<title>Choice decoder</title>
<p>For each experimental session, we trained logistic choice decoders with lasso regularization (<italic>λ</italic> = 0.01) on the population activity in 50 ms time bins spanning the first 500 ms after motion onset and the 300 ms epoch ending at saccade initiation, respectively. Each of the decoders was trained on the even-numbered trials. Decoder accuracy was cross-validated using the activity of held-out, odd trials at the same time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). For the time bins aligned to motion onset, we also assessed the accuracy of the decoders trained on each of the time bins to predict the choice on time bins on which they were not trained (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">King and Dehaene, 2014</xref>). We use the decoder trained on the bin centered on <italic>t</italic> = 450 ms to define the <italic>What</italic> coding direction. We refer to this as the <italic>fixed training-time</italic> decoder to distinguish it from the standard machine-learning decoder, which assigns a potentially distinct vector of weights at each time point. We applied a similar analysis to simulated data (see <italic>Simulated decision variables</italic>) to generate the black curve in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. Assuming a stochastic drift-diffusion process giving rise to choice and response times, the exercise establishes a rough upper bound on decoder accuracy, were the actual drift-diffusion process known precisely.</p>

<title>When decoder</title>
<p>This decoder is trained to predict whether a saccade to the left (contralateral) choice target will occur within the next 150 ms. We applied logistic regression with lasso regularization (<italic>λ</italic> = 0.01) to spike counts from each neuron in discrete bins of 25 ms, from 200 ms before motion onset to 50 ms before the saccade. We used only trials ending in a left choice (including errors) and trained the decoder on the even numbered half of those trials. The concatenation of these trials forms a sequence of step functions which are set to 1 if a saccade occurred within 150 ms of the start of the 25 ms time bin and 0 otherwise (<xref rid="figS6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
<p>The spike counts were also concatenated across these trials to construct column vectors (one per neuron) that match the vector of concatenated step functions. These concatenated vectors, one per neuron, plus an offset (<italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>), serve as the independent variables of the regression model (one <italic>β</italic> term per neuron). The proportion of <italic>β</italic> weights equal to zero, controlled by the lasso parameter, <italic>λ</italic>, was 0.8 ± 0.02 across sessions. The weights define the <italic>S</italic><sup>When</sup> coding direction, which yields single-trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sup>When</sup>(<italic>t</italic>). The When-decoder signal is <italic>S</italic><sup>When</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) + <italic>β</italic><sub>0</sub>.

<p>The leverage of single-trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic>), on choice and RT was assessed using the earliest 300 ms epoch of putative integration (0.2 &lt; <italic>t</italic> &lt; 0.5 s from motion onset), restricting analyses to trials with RTs outside this range (0.67 &lt; RT &lt; 2 s). The single-trial signals are smoothed with a 50 ms boxcar filter and detrended by subtracting the mean <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) for trials sharing the same motion strength and direction (<italic>i.e</italic>., signed coherence). The reaction times are also expressed as residuals relative to the mean RT, using trials sharing the same signed coherence and choice. We include trials with |coh| ≤ 0.064 that result in choices of the left response target in this analysis. Including trials of |coh| ≤ 0.128 produced comparable results. The leverage on RT is the Pearson correlation between the residual signals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline52.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> at each time 0.2 &lt; <italic>t</italic> ≤ 0.5, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline53.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> on that trial, where the tilde indicates residual. Correlations were computed per session and then averaged across sessions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Eq. 4</xref>). We also show the correlation at t=0.55 s, using the ordered pairs, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline54.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.We quantify mediation of the leverage of earlier samples by the later sample of <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup> by computing partial correlations <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline55.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.also notated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline56.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. We show this mediation at all time points. We also report a mediation statistic (<italic>ξ</italic><sup>RT</sup>) using the time point 200 ms after the beginning of putative integration (<italic>i.e., S</italic>(<italic>t</italic> = 0.4)):
<disp-formula id="eqn7">
<graphic xlink:href="490321v6_eqn7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The rationale for using the 400 ms time point is (<italic>i</italic>) to allow the process to have achieved enough leverage on RT so that a reduction is meaningful and (<italic>ii</italic>) to preserve a substantial gap between this time and the sample at <italic>t</italic> = 0.55 s (e.g., to avoid autocorrelations imposed by smoothing). The rare cases in which there was no negative correlation between <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic> = 0.4) and RT were excluded from this summary statistic, <italic>ξ</italic><sup>RT</sup>, because no mediation is possible (Session 2: <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp &amp;</sup> <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup>). When combining values of <italic>ξ</italic><sup>RT</sup> across sessions, we rectify any <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline57.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to 0. This occurs rarely when the mediated correlation is near zero, typically at early times.</p>
<p>We compute the leverage on choice, <italic>ξ</italic><sup>Ch</sup>, using trials with |coh| ≤ 0.064 and the same time points as for <italic>ξ</italic><sup>RT</sup>. Instead of an R-squared measure, we based <italic>ξ</italic><sup>Ch</sup> on coefficients derived from logistic regression:
<disp-formula id="eqn8">
<graphic xlink:href="490321v6_eqn8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline58.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is a set of constants that accounts for the proportion of contralateral choices at each signed motion strength and <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the simple leverage of <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) on choice, analogous to simple correlation. The regression analysis was performed separately for each session. The coefficients <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) were divided by their standard error and then averaged across sessions. This normalization step was implemented to control for potential variation in the magnitude of <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) (and therefore of <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>)) across sessions. Analogous to partial correlation, we include the later time point and fit
<disp-formula id="eqn9">
<graphic xlink:href="490321v6_eqn9.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline59.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is the amount of leverage at time <italic>t</italic> given the <italic>S</italic>(0.55). The regression coefficients <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline60.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> were averaged across sessions after dividing them by the standard error of the <italic>β</italic><sub>1</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) coefficients obtained from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn8">Eq. 8</xref>. That is, the same normalization factors were used for the mediated and unmediated leverage. The summary statistic for choice mediation is defined by
<disp-formula id="eqn10">
<graphic xlink:href="490321v6_eqn10.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
For both types of mediation, we also test whether the earlier <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is mediated by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline61.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons by substituting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline62.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for <italic>S</italic>(0.55) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn9">Eq. 9</xref> and in the expression for partial correlations.</p>
<p>Because the mediation statistics, <italic>ξ</italic><sup>RT</sup> and <italic>ξ</italic><sup>Ch</sup>, are, by their definition, non-negative, we assess statistical significance by bootstrapping. For each session, we construct 1000 surrogate data sets equal in size to the original data, by sampling with replacement. The standard deviation of the leverage and mediation values at each time approximates the standard error. We compare the distribution of the mediation statistics, <italic>ζ</italic>, to their distribution under the null hypothesis, <italic>ℋ</italic><sub>0</sub>, that the values arise by chance, instantiated by breaking the correspondence with the trial giving rise to the later sample, <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>(<italic>t</italic> = 0.55<italic>s</italic>). The permutation maintains correspondence in signed motion coherence. We compare the distributions of mediation from the bootstrap and <italic>ℋ</italic><sub>0</sub> using the Wilcoxin Ranked Sum test.</p>
<p>To test whether the observed leverage of neural activity on choice and RT is achieved by projections onto arbitrary coding directions, we generated random weight vectors by permuting the weights associated with the first PC for each session. We projected activity onto this random coding direction, applied the mediation analyses described above to this signal, and repeated this process 1000 times to produce a null distribution at each time point. The reported p-values represent the probability that the observed leverage was generated from this null distribution.</p>
<p>We performed a similar analysis to test whether the observed leverage depends on the trial-to-trial correspondence between neural activity and behavior. Here, the null distribution at each time point was generated by randomly permuting the trial indices associated with the neural activity and those associated with the behavioral measures.</p>
<p>Finally, we used the simulated data from the racing accumulator model to test the degree of leverage and mediation expected had we known the ground-truth decision variable on each trial (<xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>). Because the simulated DV is noiseless (and the process is Markovian), the mediation is expected to be complete for all time points tested in the analyses. We therefore took two steps to make the simulated data more comparable to neural data: (<italic>i</italic>) We sub-sampled the simulated data to match the number of trials in each session. (<italic>ii</italic>) We generated <italic>N</italic> noisy instantiations of the signal for each of the sub-sampled, simulated trials, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline63.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons in each session. The added noise is independent across time points and weakly correlated across all <italic>N</italic> × (<italic>N</italic> − 1)/2 neuron pairs (<italic>r</italic> ≈ 0.09). We then applied the mediation analyses to the mean of these signals and repeated this process 1000 times.</p>
<p>We performed three control analyses to determine whether the results of the mediation analysis were specific, meaningful and comparable to results obtained for the DV of a race model. To showcase that the results are specific, we generated random weight vectors by permuting the weights of the PC1 coding direction. We repeated this procedure 1000 times per session and projected the data along these directions in neuronal state space to generate <italic>S</italic><sup>rand</sup>. We then computed the mediation analyses detailed above on these signals and determined significance by comparing the leverage on choice and correlation with RT of <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>, <italic>S</italic><sup>PC1</sup>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline64.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> to the null distributions of <italic>S</italic><sup>rand</sup> at each time point.</p>
<p>To estimate an upper limit for the degree of possible leverage and mediation, we simulated 60,000 trials using the race model that best fits the behavioral data of monkey M (see <italic>Simulated decision variables</italic>.). For any noise-free representation of a Markovian integration process, the leverage of an early sample of the DV on behavior would be mediated completely by later activity as the latter sample by definition encompasses all variability captured by the earlier sample. We, therefore, took two steps to make the simulated decision variables more comparable to real neural data. (1) For each session, we first subsampled the simulated data to match the each session. (2) To evaluate a DV approximated from the activity of <italic>n</italic> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline65.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons per session rather than the true DV represented by the entire population, we then generated <italic>n</italic> noisy instantiations of the signal for each simulated trial. The added noise independent across time points and weakly correlated across neurons (<italic>r</italic> ≈ 0.09). We then computed the measured DV <italic>S</italic><sup>sim</sup> as the mean activity of these <italic>n</italic> simulated neurons. We repeated this procedure 1000 times per session and <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref>, <italic>bottom</italic> displays the mean and standard deviation across permutations of the leverage of <italic>S</italic><sup>sim</sup>(<italic>t</italic>) on behavior. The simulation results highlight that we would not expect the mediation of the leverage on behavior by a later sample to be complete (blue traces in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="figS10" ref-type="fig">Fig. S10</xref> not aligned with zero).</p>

<title>Noise correlation between neurons</title>
<p>The mean pairwise correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline66.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons, reported in Results, is based on all pairs of simultaneously recorded <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline67.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons in each session and all trials with RT &gt; 0.5 s. For each neuron and each trial, we compute the time-averaged activity over the epoch 0.2 ≤ <italic>t</italic> ≤ 0.4. These scalar values are converted to residuals by subtracting the mean (for each neuron) across all trials sharing the same signed motion coherence. The residuals from all eligible trials are concatenated for each neuron to support the calculation of <italic>N</italic> × (<italic>N</italic> − 1) Pearson <italic>r</italic> values, where N is the number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline68.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons in the session.

<title>Direction selective neurons</title>
<p>We identified direction-selective (DS) neurons (M<sub>in</sub> neurons) using the passive motion-viewing task (described above). We classified a neuron as M<sub>in</sub> if it achieved two criterion. The first criterion is a short-latency response to the onset of random dot motion, which we defined as a 5-fold increase in firing rate relative to baseline in the first 80 ms following motion onset or a steeper increase in activity in the 80 ms after than the 200 ms before motion onset. The second criterion was direction selectivity. We calculated the area under the ROC (AUC) comparing leftward versus rightward for two separate epochs:(<italic>i</italic>) 0.15 ≤ <italic>t</italic> &lt; 0.3 s and (<italic>ii</italic>) 0.3 ≤ <italic>t</italic> &lt; 0.5 s. Neurons were determined to be DS if the AUC in either epoch exceeded 0.6. We excluded one neuron from this analysis because it switched its direction preference in the two epochs. We also excluded neurons that had previously been classified as T<sub>in</sub>.</p>

<title>Latency analysis</title>
<p>We estimated the latency of direction-selective responses using the CUSUM method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ellaway, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lorteije et al., 2015</xref>). We employed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to estimate the selectivity of each M<sub>in</sub> neuron to motion direction. The AUC reflects the separation of the distributions of spike counts (100 to 400 ms after motion onset) on single trials of leftward and rightward motion, respectively. We included only correct trials with response times greater than 450 ms and motion strengths above 10% coherence. For each neuron with AUC &gt; 0.6, we computed the difference in spike counts (25 ms bins) between correct trials featuring leftward and rightward motion. Subsequently, we accumulated these differences over time, following the CUSUM method. The resulting difference is approximately zero before the onset of direction selectivity and then either increases or decreases monotonically, depending on the preferred motion direction. To identify the transition between these two regimes, we fit a dog leg function to the cumulative sum of spikes: a flat line starting at <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub> = 0 followed by a linearly increasing component beginning at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> &gt; <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. The time of the end of the flat portion (between 0 and 500 ms from motion onset) of the fit was taken as the latency. Estimating latencies based on cumulative sums of spikes helps mitigate the effect of neuronal noise. The fitting step reduces the effect of the number of trials on latency estimates compared to traditional methods that rely on t-tests in moving windows.</p>

<title>Correlations between M<sub>in</sub> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline70.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula></title>
<p>The analysis of the correlations shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref> is based on the spike counts of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline71.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline72.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons calculated in 25 ms windows. We computed residuals by subtracting from each trial and time bin its average over trials of the same signed coherence. The spike count residuals were then z-scored independently for each time bin and session. Trials from different sessions were concatenated, and the baseline activity—last 100 ms before motion onset—was subtracted from each trial. We refer to the resulting signals as<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline73.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline74.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. Trials with response time less than 0.55 s were discarded, and the correlations between the difference, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline75.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline76.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> were calculated for all pairs of time steps between 0 and 500 milliseconds (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6e</xref>). Statistical significance was assessed using permutation tests, as follows. Two regions of interest (ROI) were defined based on the time from stimulus onset for the M<sub>in</sub> (<italic>x</italic>) and T<sub>in</sub> (<italic>y</italic>) dimensions. The first region of interest, ROI<sub>1</sub>, is characterized by <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &gt; 100, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &gt; 200, and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. According to our hypothesis that the M<sub>in</sub> neurons represent the momentary evidence integrated by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline77.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons, we anticipated high correlations in this region. The second region of interest, ROI<sub>2</sub>, is defined by <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &gt; 100, <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &gt; 200, and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &lt; <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. If, contrary to our hypothesis, M<sub>in</sub>and T<sub>in</sub> signals were influencing each other bidirectionally, we would expect high correlations in this region. We calculated the difference in correlations between these two groups, ⟨<italic>ρ</italic><sub>ROI1</sub>⟩ − ⟨<italic>ρ</italic><sub>ROI2</sub>⟩, where the expectation is over the time bins within each region of interest. This difference was compared to those obtained after randomly shuffling the order of the trials for one of the dimensions before calculating the pairwise correlations (<italic>N</italic><sub>shuffles</sub> = 200). We assess significance with a z-test given the mean and standard deviation of the values obtained under shuffling. The analysis was repeated with an alternative ROI<sub>2</sub> defined by <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>x</italic></sub> &lt; 100 and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> &lt; 200, representing the times before direction selectivity is present in at least one of the two dimensions.</p>

<title>Correlations between M<sub>in</sub> signals and behavior</title>
<p>To assess the leverage of M<sub>in</sub> signals on choice and RT (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>) we performed the same logistic regression and pairwise correlation analyses as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, substituting the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline78.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline79.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> for <italic>S</italic><sup><italic>x</italic></sup>. The leverage on choice is not mediated by a later sample of either M<sub>in</sub> signal (<italic>ξ</italic><sup>Ch</sup> ≤ 9.6%; not shown), and there is negligible leverage on RT to mediate. We suspect the failure to detect leverage of M<sub>in</sub> is explained by a lack of power, owing to the focus on long RT trials, narrow sample windows (50 ms boxcar), and the small number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline80.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline81.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> neurons. We support this suspicion with a simpler correlation analysis, using the difference of the M<sub>in</sub> signals (standardized as in the previous paragraph):

<title>Variance and autocorrelation of smoothed diffusion signals</title>
<p>The analyses in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> compare the variance and autocorrelation of the single-trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sup>ramp</sup>(<italic>t</italic>), to those expected from unbounded drift-diffusion. To mitigate the effect of the bound, we focus on the earliest epoch of putative integration (200 to 506 ms after motion onset; six 51 ms counting windows) and the weakest motion strengths (|coh| ≤ 3.2%). The single trial signals are detrended by the mean across trials sharing the same signed motion coherence and baseline corrected by subtraction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline82.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> from all time points on each trial <italic>i</italic>.</p>
<p>The variance as a function of time and the autocorrelation as a function of time and lag are well specified for the cumulative sum of discrete <italic>iid</italic> random samples, but the autocorrelation is affected by the boxcar filter we applied to render the signals. We incorporated the correction in our characterization of unbounded diffusion. The derivation is summarized in Appendix 1, and we provide Matlab code in the GitHub repository. The theoretical values shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> assume a 1 kHz sampling rate and standard Wiener process (<italic>i.e</italic>., samples drawn from a normal distribution with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="490321v6_inline83.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. The evolution of variance would be a line from 0 to 1 over the first second of integration. The key prediction, shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> is that the variance of mean single-trial signals, <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) over the epoch 26 ± 25 ms should double in the epoch (26 + 51) ± 25 ms, and triple in the epoch (26 + 2 × 51) ± 25 ms), and so on for each successive non-overlapping running mean. We therefore use arbitrary units, normalized to the measured variance of the first point. We do not know the variance of the drift-diffusion signal that <italic>S</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) is thought to approximate, but we assume it can be decomposed—by the law of total variance—to a component given by drift-diffusion and components associated with spiking and other nuisance factors. We therefore search for a scalar non-negative factor <italic>ϕ</italic> ≤ 1 that multiplies all terms in the diagonal of the empirical covariance matrix (<italic>i.e</italic>., the variance) before normalizing to produce the autocorrelation matrix. We search for the value of <italic>ϕ</italic> that minimizes the sum of squares between Fisher-z transformed correlation coefficients in the theoretical and empirical autocorrelation matrices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Standard errors of the variance and autocorrelations in (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a &amp; c</xref> are estimated by a bootstrap procedure respecting the composition of motion strength and direction (the s.e. is standard deviation of each variance and autocorrelation term across 500 repetitions of the procedure.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> work quantifies the stochastic dynamics of neural population activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the macaque monkey brain during single perceptual decisions. These single-trial dynamics have been subject to intense debate in neuroscience, and they have significant implications for modelling decision-making in various fields including neuroscience and psychology. Through a combination of state-of-the-art recordings from many LIP neurons and theory-driven data analyses, the authors provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for the notion that single-trial neural population dynamics in LIP encode the decision variable postulated by the drift-diffusion model of decision-making.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Steinemann et al. characterized the nature of stochastic signals underlying the trial-averaged responses observed in lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) of non-human primates (NHPs), while these performed the widely used random dot direction discrimination task. Ramp-up dynamics in the trial averaged LIP responses were reported in numerous papers before. But the temporal dynamics of these signals at the single-trial level have been subject to debate. Using large scale neuronal recordings with Neuropixels in NHPs, allows the authors to settle this debate rather compellingly. They show that drift-diffusion like computations account well for the observed dynamics in LIP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work uses innovative technical approaches (Neuropixel recordings in behaving macaque monkeys). The authors tackle a vexing question that requires measurements of simultaneous neuronal population activity and hence leverage this advanced recording technique in a convincing way.</p>
<p>They use different population decoding strategies to help interpret the results.</p>
<p>They also compare how decoders relying on the data-driven approach using dimensionality reduction of the full neural population space compares to decoders relying on more traditional ways to categorize neurons that are based on hypotheses about their function. Intriguingly, although the functionally identified neurons are a modest fraction of the population, decoders that only rely on this fraction achieve comparable decoding performance to those relying on the full population. Moreover, decoding weights for the full population did not allow the authors to reliably identify the functionally identified subpopulation.</p>
<p>The revision addressed the minor weaknesses to our satisfaction.</p>

<p>Steinemann, Stine, and their co-authors studied the noisy accumulation of sensory evidence during perceptual decision-making using Neuropixels recordings in awake, behaving monkeys. Previous work has largely focused on describing the neural underpinnings through which sensory evidence accumulates to inform decisions, a process which on average resembles the systematic drift of a scalar decision variable toward an evidence threshold. The additional order of magnitude in recording throughput permitted by the methodology adopted in this work offers two opportunities to extend this understanding. First, larger-scale recordings allow for the study of relationships between the population activity state and behavior without averaging across trials. The authors' observation here of covariation between the trial-to-trial fluctuations of activity and behavior (choice, reaction time) constitutes interesting new evidence for the claim that neural populations in LIP encode the behaviorally-relevant internal decision variable. Second, using Neuropixels allows the authors to sample LIP neurons with more diverse response properties (e.g. spatial RF location, motion direction selectivity), making the important question of how decision-related computations are structured in LIP amenable to study. For these reasons, the dataset collected in this study is unique and potentially quite valuable. This revised manuscript addresses a number of questions regarding analyses which were unclear in the original manuscript, and as a result the study is a strong contribution toward our understanding of neural mechanisms of decision making.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, Steinemann et al. characterized the nature of stochastic signals underlying the trial-averaged responses observed in the lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) of non-human primates (NHPs), while these performed the widely used random dot direction discrimination task. Ramp-up dynamics in the trial averaged LIP responses were reported in numerous papers before. However, the temporal dynamics of these signals at the single-trial level have been subject to debate. Using large-scale neuronal recordings with Neuropixels in NHPs, allows the authors to settle this debate rather compellingly. They show that drift-diffusion-like computations account well for the observed dynamics in LIP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work uses innovative technical approaches (Neuropixel recordings in behaving macaque monkeys). The authors tackle a vexing question that requires measurements of simultaneous neuronal population activity and hence leverage this advanced recording technique in a convincing way</p>
<p>They use different population decoding strategies to help interpret the results.</p>
<p>They also compare how decoders relying on the data-driven approach using dimensionality reduction of the full neural population space compare to decoders relying on more traditional ways to categorize neurons that are based on hypotheses about their function. Intriguingly, although the functionally identified neurons are a modest fraction of the population, decoders that only rely on this fraction achieve comparable decoding performance to those relying on the full population. Moreover, decoding weights for the full population did not allow the authors to reliably identify the functionally identified subpopulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>No major weaknesses beyond a few, largely clarification issues, detailed below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer 1 (R1) for this summary. The revised manuscript incorporates R1’s suggestions, as detailed below.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Steinemann, Stine, and their co-authors studied the noisy accumulation of sensory evidence during perceptual decision-making using Neuropixels recordings in awake, behaving monkeys. Previous work has largely focused on describing the neural underpinnings through which sensory evidence accumulates to inform decisions, a process which on average resembles the systematic drift of a scalar decision variable toward an evidence threshold. The additional order of magnitude in recording throughput permitted by the methodology adopted in this work offers two opportunities to extend this understanding. First, larger-scale recordings allow for the study of relationships between the population activity state and behavior without averaging across trials. The authors’ observation here of covariation between the trial-to-trial fluctuations of activity and behavior (choice, reaction time) constitutes interesting new evidence for the claim that neural populations in LIP encode the behaviorally-relevant internal decision variable. Second, using Neuropixels allows the authors to sample LIP neurons with more diverse response properties (e.g. spatial RF location, motion direction selectivity), making the important question of how decision-related computations are structured in LIP amenable to study. For these reasons, the dataset collected in this study is unique and potentially quite valuable.</p>
<p>However, the analyses at present do not convincingly support two of the manuscript’s key claims: (1) that ”sophisticated analyses of the full neuronal state space” and ”a simple average of Tconin neurons’ yield roughly equivalent representations of the decision variable; and (2) that direction-selective units in LIP provide the samples of instantaneous evidence that these Tconin neurons integrate. Supporting claim (1) would require results from sophisticated population analyses leveraging the full neuronal state space; however, the current analyses instead focus almost exclusively on 1D projections of the data. Supporting claim (2) convincingly would require larger samples of units overlapping the motion stimulus, as well as additional control analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer (R2) for their careful reading of our paper and the many useful suggestions.</p>
<p>As detailed below, the revised manuscript incorporates new control analyses, improved quantification, and statistical rigor, which now provide compelling support for key claim #1. We do not regard claim #2 as a key claim of the paper. It is an intriguing finding with solid support, worthy of dissemination and further investigation. We have clarified the writing on this matter.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific shortcomings are addressed in further detail below:</p>
<p>(1) The key analysis-correlation between trial-by-trial activity fluctuations and behavior, presented in Figure 5 is opaque, and would be more convincing with negative controls. To strengthen the claim that the relationship between fluctuations in (a projection of) activity and fluctuations in behavior is significant/meaningful, some evidence should be brought that this relationship is specific - e.g. do all projections of activity give rise to this relationship (or not), or what level of leverage is achieved with respect to choice/RT when the trial-by-trial correspondence with activity is broken by shuffling.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not understand why R2 finds the analysis opaque, but we are grateful for the lucid recommendations. The relationships between fluctuations in neural activity and behavior are indeed “specific” in the sense that R2 uses this term. In addition to the shuffle control, which destroys both relationships (Reviewer Figure 1), we performed additional control analyses that preserve the correspondence of neural signals and behavior on the same trial. We generated random coding directions (CDs) by establishing weight vectors that were either chosen from a standard normal distribution or by permuting the weights assigned to PC-1 in each session. The latter is the more conservative measure. Projections of the neural responses onto these random coding directions render 𝑆rand(𝑡). Specifically, the degree of leverage is effectively zero or greatly reduced. These analyses are summarized in a new Supplementary Figure S10. The bottom row of Figure S10 also addresses the question, “What degree of leverage and mediation would be expected for a theoretical decision variable?” This is accomplished by simulating decision variables using the drift-diffusion model fits in Figure 1c. The simulation is consistent with the leverage and (incomplete) mediation observed for the populations of Tcon neurons. For details see Methods, Simulated decision variables and Leverage of single-trial activity on behavior.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The choice to perform most analysis on 1D projections of population activity is not wholly appropriate for this unique type of dataset, limiting the novelty of the findings, and the interpretation of similarity between results across choices of projection appears circular:</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the characterization of our argument as circular, but R2 raises several important points that will probably occur to other careful readers. We address them as subpoints 2.1–2.4, below. Importantly, we are neither claiming nor assuming that the LIP population activity is one-dimensional. We have revised the paper to avoid giving this impression. We are also not claiming that the average of Tin neurons (or the 1D projections) explains all features of the LIP population, nor would we expect it to, given the diversity of response fields across the population. Our objective is to identify the specific dimension within population activity that captures the decision variable (DV), which has been characterized successfully as a one-dimensional stochastic process—that is, a scalar function of time. We have endeavored to clarify our thinking on this point in the revised manuscript (e.g., lines 97–98, 103–104).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.1) The bulk of the analyses (Figure 2, Figure 3, part of Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6) operate on one of several 1D projections of simultaneously recorded activity. Unless the embedding dimension of these datasets really does not exceed 1 (dimensionality using e.g. participation ratio in each session is not quantified), it is likely that these projections elide meaningful features of LIP population activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now report the participation ratio (4.4 ± 0.4, mean ± s.e. across sessions), and we state that the first 3 PCs explain 67.1±3.1% of the variance of time- and coherence-dependent signals used for the PCA. We agree that the 1D projections may elide meaningful features of LIP population activity. Indeed, we make this point through our analysis of the Min neurons. We do not claim that the 1D projections explain all of the meaningful features of LIP population activity. They do, however, reveal the decision variable, which is our main focus. These 1D signals contain features that correlate with events in the superior colliculus, summarized in Stine et al. (2023), attesting to their biological relevance.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.2) Further, the observed similarity of results across these 1D projections may not be meaningful/interpretable. First, the rationale behind deriving Sramp was based on the ramping historically observed in Tin neurons during this task, so should be expected to resemble Tin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The Reviewer is correct that we would expect 𝑆ramp to resemble the ramping observed in Tin neurons. We refer to this approach as hypothesis-driven. It captures the drift component of drift-diffusion. It is true that the Tcon neurons exhibit such ramps in their trial average firing rates, but this does not guarantee in</p>
<p>that the single-trial population firing rates would manifest as drift-diffusion. Indeed Latimer et al. (2015) concluded that the ramp-like averages comprise stepping from a low to a high firing rate on each trial at a random time. Therefore, while R2 is right to characterize the similarity of Tcon to the ramp direction in in trial-averaged activity as unsurprising, their similarity on single trials is not guaranteed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.3) Second, Tin comprises the largest fraction of the neuron groups sampled during most sessions, so SPC1 should resemble Tin too. The finding that decision variables derived from the whole population’s activity reduce essentially to the average of Tin neurons is thus at least in part ’baked in’ to the approach used for deriving the decision variables.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is incorrect. The Tcon in neurons constitute only 14.5% of the population, on average, across the sessions (see Table 1). This misunderstanding might contribute to R2’s concern about the importance of these neurons in shaping PC1. It is not simply because they are over-represented. Also, addressing R2’s concern about circularity, we would like to remind R2 that the selection of Tin neurons was based only on their spatial selectivity in the delayed saccade task. We do not see how it could be baked-in/guaranteed that a simple average of these neurons (i.e. zero degrees of freedom) yields dynamics and behavioral correlations that match those produced by dimensionality-reduction techniques that (𝑖) have degrees of freedom equal to the number of neurons and (𝑖𝑖) are blind to the neurons’ spatial selectivity. We have additionally modified what is now Supplementary Figure S13 (old Supplementary Figure S8), which portrays the mean accuracy of choice decoders trained on the neural activity of all neurons, only Tin neurons, all but the Tin neurons, and all but Tin and Min neurons, respectively. Figure S13 now highlights how much more readily choice can be decoded from the small population of Tin neurons than the remainder of the population.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2.4) The analysis presented in Figure S6 looks like an attempt to demonstrate that this isn’t the case, but is opaque. Are the magnitudes of weights assigned to units in Tin larger than in the other groups of units with preselected response properties? What is their mean weighting magnitude, in comparison with the mean weight magnitude assigned to other groups? What is the null level of correspondence observed between weight magnitude and assignment to Tin (e.g. a negative control, where the identities of units are scrambled)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The revised Figure S6—what is now Figure S9—displays more clearly that the weights assigned to Tcon and Tips neurons (purple &amp; yellow, respectively) are larger in magnitude than those assigned in in to other neurons (gray). Author response table 1 shows a more detailed breakdown of the groups. Note that the length of the vector of weights is one. We are unsure what R2 means by “the null level of correspondence.” Perhaps it helps to know that the mean weight of the “other neurons” is close to zero for all four coding directions. However, it is the overlap of the weights and the relative abundance of non-Tin neurons that is more germane to the point we are making. To wit, knowing the weight (or percentile) of a neuron is a poor predictor that it belongs to the Tin category. This point is most clearly supported by the logistic regression (Fig. S9, bottom row). In other words, the large group of non-Tin neurons contribute substantially to all four coding directions examined in Figure S9. Thus, the similarity between Tin neurons and PC1 is not simply due to an over-representation of Tin neurons as suggested in item 2.3.</p>

<p>(3) The principal components analysis normalization procedure is unclear, and potentially incorrect and misleading: Why use the chosen normalization window (±25ms around 100ms after motion stimulus onset) for standardizing activity for PCA, rather than the typical choice of mean/standard deviation of activity in the full data window? This choice would specifically squash responses for units with a strong visual response, which distorts the covariance matrix, and thus the principal components that result. This kind of departure from the standard procedure should be clearly justified: what do the principal components look like when a standard procedure is used, and why was this insufficient/incorrect/unsuitable for this setting?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used the early window because it is a robust measure of overall excitability, but we now use a more conventional window that spans the main epoch of our analyses, 200–600 ms after motion onset. This method yields results qualitatively similar to the original method. We are persuaded that this is the more sensible choice. We thank R2 for raising this concern.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Analysis conclusions would generally be stronger with estimates of variability and control analyses: This applies broadly to Figures 2-6.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added estimates of variability and control analyses where appropriate.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows examples of single-trial signals. The variability is addressed in Figure 3a and the new Supplementary Figure S5.</p>
<p>Figure 3 now contains error bars derived by bootstrapping (see Methods, Variance and autocorrelation of smoothed diffusion signals). We have also added Supplementary Figure S5, which substantiates the sublinearity claim using simulations.</p>
<p>Figure 4 (i) We now indicate the s.e.m. of decoding accuracy (across sessions) by the shading in Figure 4a. (ii) The black symbols in new Supplementary Figure S8 show the mean±s.e.m. for all pairwise comparisons shown in Figure 4d &amp; e. (iii) Supplementary Figure S8 also summarizes two control analyses that deploy random coding directions (CDs) in neuronal state space. The upper row of Fig S9 compares the observed cosine similarity (CoSim)—between the CD identified by the graph title and the other four CDs labeled along the abscissa—with values obtained with 1000 random CDs established by random permutations of the weight assignments. The brown symbols are the mean±sdev of the CoSim (N=1000). The error bars are smaller than the symbols. We use the cumulative distribution of CoSim under permutation to estimate p-values (p&lt;0.001 for all comparisons). We used a similar approach to estimate the distribution of the analogous correlation statistics between signals rendered by random directions in state space (Figure S8, lower row). For additional details, please see Methods, Similarity of single-trial signals.</p>
<p>Figure 5: The rigor of all claims associated with this figure is adduced from two control analyses and a simulation. The first control breaks the trial-by-trial correspondence between neural signals and behavior (Reviewer Figure 1). The second control shows that neural activity does not have substantial leverage on behavior when projected onto random directions in state space (Supplementary Figure S10, top). Simulations of decision variables using parameters derived from the fits to the behavioral data (Figure 1) support a degree of leverage and mediation comparable to the values observed for 𝑆Tincon (Supplementary Figure S10, bottom). For additional details, please see Methods (Leverage of single-trial activity on behavior) and the reply to item 1, above.</p>
<p>Figure 6: Panels c&amp;d show estimates of variability across neurons and experimental sessions, respectively. The reported p-value is based on a permutation test (see Methods, Correlations between Min and Tconin ). The correlations shown in panel e (heatmap) are derived from pooled data across sessions. The reported p-value is based on a permutation test (see Methods, Correlations between Min and Tconin ).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper investigates which aspects of neural activity in LIP of the macaque give rise to individual decisions</p>
<p>(specificity of choice and reaction times) in single trials, by recording simultaneously from hundreds of neurons. Using a variety of dimensionality reduction and decoding techniques, they demonstrate that a population-based drift-diffusion signal, which relies on a small subset of neurons that overlap choice targets, is responsible for the choice and reaction time variability. Analysis of direction-selective neurons in LIP and their correlation with decision-related neurons (T con in [Tconin ] neurons ) suggests that evidence integration occurs within area LIP.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an important and interesting paper, which resolves conflicting hypotheses regarding the mechanisms that underlie decision-making in single trials. This is made possible by exploiting novel technology (Primatepixels recordings), in conjunction with state-of-the-art analyses and well-established dynamic random dot motion discrimination tasks.</p>
<p><bold>General recommendations:</bold></p>
<p>(1) Please tone down causal language. You presentcompelling correlativeevidencefor the idea thatLIP population activity encodes the drift-diffusion DV. We feel that claims beyond that (e.g., ”Single-trial drift-diffusion signals control the choice and decision time”) would require direct interventions, and are only partially supported by the current evidence. Further examples are provided in point 1) of Reviewer 1 below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adopted the recommendation to “tone down the causal language.” Throughout the manuscript, we strive to avoid conveying the false impression that the present findings provide causal support for the decision mechanism. However, other causal studies of LIP support causality in the random dot motion task (Hanks et al., 2006; Jeurissen et al., 2022). It is therefore justifiable to use terms that imply causality in statements intended to convey hypotheses about mechanism. We agree that we should not give the false impression that the present support for said mechanism is adduced from causal perturbations in this study, as there were none.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Please provide a commonly used, data-driven quantification of the dimensionality of the population activity – for example, using participation ratio or the number of PCs explaining 90 % of the variance. This will help readers evaluate the conclusions about the dimensionality of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Principal component analysis reveals a participation ratio of 4.4 ± 0.4 (mean ±s.e., across sessions), and the first 3 PCs explain 67.1 ± 3.1 percent of the variance. The dimensionality of the data is low, but greater than one. We state this in Methods (Principal Component Analysis) and in Results (Single-trial drift-diffusion signals approximate the decision variable, lines 200–201).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Please justify the normalization procedure used for PCA: Why use the chosen normalization window (±25ms around 100ms after motion stimulus onset) for standardizing activity for PCA, rather than the more common quantification of mean/standard deviation across the full data window? What do the first principal components look like when the latter procedure is used?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now use a more conventional window that spans the main epoch of our analyses, 200–600 ms after motion onset. This method yields results qualitatively similar to the original method. We are persuaded that this is the more sensible choice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Please provide estimates of variability for variance and autocorrelation in Fig. 3 (e.g., through bootstrapping). Further, simulations could substantiate the claim about the expected sub-linearity at later time points (Fig. 3a) due to the upper stopping bound and limited firing rate range.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for these helpful recommendations. The revised Fig. 3 now contains error bars derived by bootstrapping (see Methods, Variance and autocorrelation of smoothed diffusion signals). We have also added Supplementary Figure S5, which substantiates the sub-linearity claim using simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Please add controls and estimates of variability for decoding across sessions in Fig. 4: what are the levels of within-trial correlation/cosine similarity for random coding directions? What is the variability in the estimates of values shown in a/d/e?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have addressed each of these items. (1) Figure 4a now shows the s.e.m. of decoding accuracy (across sessions). (2) Regarding the variability of estimates shown in Figure 4d &amp; e, the standard errors are displayed in the new supplementary Figure S8. It makes sense to show them there because there is no natural way to represent error on the heat maps in Figure 4, and Figure S8 concerns the comparison of the values in Figure 4d&amp;e to values derived from random coding directions. (3) Random coding directions lead to values of cosine similarity and within-trial correlation that do not differ significantly from zero. We show this in several ways, summarized in our reply to Public Review item 4. Additional details are in the revised manuscript (Methods, Similarity of single-trial signals) and the new Supplementary Figure S8.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Please perform additional analysis to strengthen the claim from Fig. 6, that Min represents the integrand and not the integral. The analysis in Fig. 6d could be repeated with the integral (cumulative sum) of the single-trial Min signals. Does this yield an increase in leverage over time?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The short answer is, yes in part. Reviewer Figure 2a provides support for leverage of the integral on choice, and this leverage, like 𝑆Tincon (t), increases as a function of time. The effect is present in all seven sessions that have both Mleftin and Mrightin neurons (all 𝑝 &lt; 1𝑒 − 10). However, as shown in panel b, the same integral fails to demonstrate more than a hint of leverage on RT. All correlations are barely negative, and the magnitude does not increase as a function of time. We suspect—but cannot prove—that this failure arises because of limited power and the expected weak effect. Recall that the mediation analysis of RT is restricted to longer trials. Moreover, the correlation between the Min difference and the Tin signal is less than 0.1 (heatmap, Fig. 6e), implying that the Min difference explains less than 1% of the variance of 𝑆Tin(𝑡). We considered including Reviewer Figure 2 in the paper, but we feel it would be disingenuous (cherry-picking) to report only the positive outcome of the leverage on choice. If the editors feel strongly about it, we would be open to including it, but leaving these analyses out of the revised manuscript seems more consistent with our effort to deëmphasize this finding. In the future, we plan to record simultaneously from populations MT and LIP neurons (Min and Tin, of course) and optimize Min neuron yield by placing the RDM stimulus in the periphery.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Please describe the complete procedure for determining spatially-selective activity. E.g.: What response epoch was used, what was the spatial layout of the response targets, were responses to all ipsi- vs contralateral targets pooled, what was the spatial distribution of response fields relative to the choice targets across the population?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this oversight. We now explain this procedure in the Methods (lines 629–644):</p>
<p>Neurons were classified post hoc as Tin by visual-inspection of spatial heatmaps of neural activity acquired in the delayed saccade task. We inspected activity in the visual, delay, and perisaccadic epochs of the task. The distribution of target locations was guided by the spatial selectivity of simultaneously recorded neurons in the superior colliculus (see Stine 2023 for details). Briefly, after identifying the location of the SC response fields, we randomly presented saccade targets within this location and seven other, equally spaced locations at the same eccentricity. In monkey J we also included 1–3 additional eccentricities, spanning 5–16 degrees. Neurons were classified as Tin if they displayed a clear, spatially-selective response in at least one epoch to one of the two locations occupied by the choice targets in the main task. Neurons that switched their spatial selectivity in different epochs were not classified as Tin. The classification was conducted before the analyses of activity in the motion discrimination task. The procedure was meant to mimic those used in earlier single-neuron studies of LIP (e.g., Roitman &amp; Shadlen 2002) in which the location of the choice targets was determined online by the qualitative spatial selectivity of the neuron under study. The Tcon neurons in the in present study were highly selective for either the contralateral or ipislateral choice target used in the RDM task (AUC = 0.89±0.01; 𝑝 &lt; 0.05 for 97% of neurons, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Given the sparse sampling of saccade target locations, we are unable to supply a quantitative estimate of the center and spatial extent of the RFs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Please clarify if a neuron could be classified as both Tin and Min. Or were these categories mutually exclusive?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These categories are mutually exclusive. If a neuron has spatially-selective persistent activity, as defined by the method described above, it is classified as a Tin neuron and not as an Min neuron even if it also shows motion-selective activity during passive motion viewing. We now specify this in the Methods (lines 831–832).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>𝑅∗1.1a Causal language (Line 23-24): “population activity represents […] drift” and “we provide direct support for the hypothesis that drift-diffusion signal is the quantity responsible for the variability in choice and RT” reads at first sight as if the authors claim that they present evidence for a causal effect of LIP activity on choice. The authors areotherwisenuanced and carefultopointout thattheir evidence is correlational. What seems to be meant is that the population activity/drift-diffusion signal ”approximates the DV that gives rise to the choices […]” (cf. line 399). I would recommend using such alternative phrasing to avoid confusion (and the typically strong reactions by readers against misleading causal statements).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adopted the reviewer’s recommendation and have modified the text throughout to reduce causal language. See our response to General Recommendation 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>𝑅∗1.1b Relatedly, any discussion about the possibility of LIP being causally involved in evidence integration (e.g. lines 429-445 [Au: now 462–478]) should also comment on the possibility of a distributed representation of the decision variable given that neural correlates of the DV have been reported in several areas including PFC, caudate and FEF.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe this is possible. However, we hope to avoid discussions about causality given that it is not a focus of the paper. Although it is somewhat tangential, we have shown elsewhere that LIP is causal in the sense that causal manipulations affect behavior, but it is also true that causality does not imply necessity, and similarly, lack of necessity does not imply “only correlation.” Regarding distributed representations, it is worth keeping in mind the cautionary counter-example furnished by the SC study (Stine et al., 2023). The firing rates measured by averaging over trials are similar in SC and LIP; both manifest as coherence and direction-dependent ramps, leading to the suggestion that they form a distributed representation of the decision variable. With single-trial resolution, we now know that LIP and SC exhibit distinct dynamics—drift-diffusion and bursting, respectively. It remains to be seen if single-trial resolution achievable by simultaneous Neuropixels recordings from prefrontal areas and LIP reveal shared or distinct dynamics.</p>

<p>𝑅∗1.4 Contrary to the statement on line 121, the trial averages in Fig. 2a, 2b show coherence dependency at the time of the saccade in saccade-aligned traces for the coding strategies, except for STin (fig. 2c). Is this a result of the choice for t1 (= 0.1s)? (The authors may want to change their statement on line 121.) Relatedly, do the population responses for the two coding strategies Sramp and SPC1 depend on the epoch used to derive weights for individual neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the description to accommodate R2’s observation. 𝑆ramp retains weak coherence-dependence before saccades towards the choice target contralateral to the recording site. This was true in four of the eight sessions. For 𝑆PC1, there is no longer a coherence dependency for the Tin choices, owing to the change in normalization method (see revised Figure 2b).</p>
<p>We also corrected an error in the Methods section. Specifically, the ramp ends at 𝑡1 = 0.05 s before the time of the saccade, not 𝑡1 = 0.1 s. While we no longer emphasize the similarity of traces aligned to saccade, it is reasonable to find issue with the observation that they retain a dependency on coherence (𝑆ramp only) because, according to theory, traces associated with Tin choices should reach a common positive threshold at decision termination. That said, for the Ramp direction there may be a reason to expect this discrepancy from theory. The deterministic part of drift-diffusion includes an urgency signal that confers positive convexity to the deterministic drift. This accelerating nonlinearity is not captured by the ramp, and it is more prominent at longer decision times, thus low coherences. We do not share this interpretation in the revised manuscript, in part because retention of coherence dependency is present in only half the sessions (see Reviewer Figure 3) The correction to the definition of 𝑡1 also provides an opportunity to address R2’s final question (“Relatedly,…?”). For 𝑆ramp this particular variation in 𝑡1 does not affect 𝑆ramp, and 𝑆PC1 no longer retains coherence dependency for Tin choices. Note that our choice of 𝑡0 and 𝑡1 is based on the empirical observation that the ramping activity in response averages of Tin neurons typically begins 200 ms after motion onset and ends 50–100 ms before initiation of the saccadic choice. The starting time (𝑡0) is also supported by the observation that the decoding accuracy of a choice-decoder begins to diverge from chance at this time (Figure 4a).</p>

<p>Great question! We can only speculate, but it seems possible that a more complex, “higher dimensional” task could make it easier to identify Tin neurons. For example, a task with four choices instead of two may decrease correlations among groups of neurons with different response fields. We have added this caveat to the discussion (lines 459-–461).

<p>𝑅∗2.1 (Figure 2) Determine whether restricting the analysis to 1D projections of the data is a suitable approach given the actual dimensionality of the datasets being analyzed:</p>
<p>- Should show some quantification of the dimensionality of the recorded activity; could do this by quantifying the dimensionality of population activity in each session, e.g. with participation ratio or related measures (like # PCs to explain some high proportion of the variance, e.g. 90 %). If much of the variation is not described in 1 dimension, then the paper would benefit from some discussion/analysis of the signals that occupy the other dimensions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now report the participation ratio (4.4 ± 0.4, mean ±s.e. across sessions), and we state that the first 3 PCs explain 67.1 ± 3.1% of the variance of the time- and coherence-dependent signals used for the PCA (mean ±s.e). We agree that the 1D projections may elide meaningful features of LIP population activity. Indeed, we make this point through our analysis of the Min neurons. To reiterate our response above, we do not claim that the 1D projections explain all of the meaningful features of LIP population activity. They do, however, reveal the decision variable, which is our main focus. These 1D signals contain features that correlate with events in the superior colliculus, summarized in Stine et al. (2023), attesting to their biological relevance.</p>
<p>The Reviewer is correct that our approach presupposes a linear embedding of the 1D decision variable inthepopulationactivity. Inotherwords, anonlinearrepresentationofthe1Ddecisionvariableinpopulation activity could have an embedding dimensionality greater than 1, and there may well be a non-linear method that reveals this representation. To test this possibility, we decoded choice on each trial from population activity using (1) a linear decoder (logistic classifier) or (2) a multi-layer neural network, which can exploit non-linearities. We found that, for each session, the two decoders performed similarly: the neural network outperforms the logistic decoder (barely) in just one session. The analysis suggests that the assumption of linear embedding of the decision variable is justified. We hope this analysis convinces the reviewer that “sophisticated analyses of the full neuronal state space” and “a simple average of [Tcon ] neurons” do in indeed yield roughly equivalent representations of the decision variable. We have included the results of this analysis in Supplementary Figure S12. See also item 2 of the Public response.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have added two control analyses. In addition to a shuffle control, which destroys the relationship (Review Figure 1) we performed additional analyses that preserve the correspondence of neural signals and behavior on the same trial. We generated random coding directions (CDs) by establishing weight-vectors that were either chosen from a Normal distribution or by permuting the weights assigned to PC-1 in each session. The latter is the more conservative measure. Projections of the neural responses onto these random coding directions render 𝑆rand(𝑡). Specifically, the degree of leverage is effectively zero or very much reduced. These analyses are summarized in a new Supplementary Figure S10. The distributions of our test statistics (e.g., leverage on choice and RT) under the variants of the null hypothesis also support traditional metrics of statistical significance. Figure S10 (bottom row) also provides an approximate answer to the question: What degree of leverage and mediation would be expected for a theoretical decision variable? Briefly, we simulated 60,000 trials using the race model that best fits the behavioral data of monkey M. For any noise-free representation of a Markovian integration process, the leverage of an early sample of the DV on behavior would be mediated completely by later activity as the latter sample—up to the time of commitment—subsumes all variability captured by the earlier sample. We, therefore, generated 𝑆sim(𝑡) by first subsampling the simulated data to match the trial numbers of each session. To evaluate a DV approximated from the activity of 𝑁 Tconin neurons per session rather than the true DV represented by the entire population, we generated 𝑁 noisy instantiations of the signal for each of the subsampled, simulated trials. The noisy decision variable, 𝑆sim (t) is the mean activity of these 𝑁 noise-corrupted signals. The simulation is consistent with the leverage and incomplete mediation observed for the populations of Tcon neurons. For in additional details, see Methods, §Leverage of single-trial activity on behavior) and Supplementary Figure S10, caption. See also our response to item 1 of the Public Response.</p>

<p>𝑅∗2.5 The analysis is performed across several signed coherence levels, with data detrended for each signed coherence and choice to enable comparison of fluctuations relative to the relevant baseline; are results similar for the different coherences?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results are qualitatively similar for individual coherences. There is less power, of course, because there are fewer trials. The analyses cannot be performed for coherences ≥ 12.8% because there are not enough trials that satisfy the inclusion criteria (presence of left and right choice trials with RT ≤ 670 ms). Nonetheless, leverage on choice and RT is statistically significant for 27 of the 30 combinations of motion strengths &lt; 12.8% × three signals (𝑆ramp, 𝑆PC1 and 𝑆Tin) × behavioral measures (RT and choice) (RT: all 𝑝 &lt; 0.008, Fisher-z; choice: all 𝑝 &lt; 0.05, t-test ). The three exceptions are trials with 6.4% coherence rightward motion, which do not correlate significantly with RT on leftward choice trials.

<p>𝑅∗2.6 (Figure 6) Additional analysis to strengthen the claim that Min represents the integrand and not the integral:</p>
<p>a. Repeating the analysis in Figure 6d with the integral (cumulative sum) of the single-trial Min signals and instead observing a significant increase in leverage over time would be strong evidence for this interpretation. If you again see no increase, then it suggests that the activity of these units (while direction selective) may not be strongly yoked to behavior. This scenario (no increasing leverage of the integral of Min on behavior through time) also raises an intriguing alternative possibility: that the noise driving the ’diffusion’ of drift-diffusion here may originate in the integrating circuit, rather than just reflecting the complete integration of noise in the stream of evidence itself.</p>
<p>b. Repeating the analysis in Figure 6d with the projection of the M subspace onto its own first PC (e.g. take the union of units {Mrightin, Mleftin} [our <inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-90859-inf2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/>], do PCA just on those units’ single</p>
<p>trial activities, identify the first PC, and project those activities on that dimension to obtain SPC1-M.</p>
<p>c. Ameliorating the sample-size limitation by relaxing the criteria for inclusion in Min - performing the same analyses shown, but including all units with visual RFs overlapping the motion stimulus, irrespective of their direction selectivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>a. Reviewer Figure 2a provides support for leverage of the integral on choice, and this leverage, like <inline-formula id="sa3equ1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-90859-sa3-equ1.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, increases as a function of time. The effect is present in all seven sessions that have both <inline-formula id="sa3equ2"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-90859-sa3-equ2.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="sa3equ3"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-90859-sa3-equ3.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> neurons (all 𝑝 &lt; 1𝑒 − 10). However, as shown in panel b, the same integral fails</p>
<p>to demonstrate more than a hint of leverage on RT (all correlations are negative) and the magnitude does not vary as a function of time. We suspect—but cannot prove—that this failure arises because of limited power and the expected weak effect. Recall that the mediation analysis of RT is restricted to longer trials and that the correlation between the Min difference and the signal is less than 0.1 over the heatmap in Fig. 6e, implying that the Min difference explains less than 1% of the variance of 𝑆Tin(𝑡). We considered including Reviewer Figure 2 in the paper, but we feel it would be disingenuous (cherrypicking) to report only the positive outcome of the leverage on choice. If the editors feel strongly about it, we would be open to including it, but leaving these analyses out of the revised manuscript seems more consistent with our effort to deëmphasize this finding. In the future, we plan to record simultaneously from populations MT and LIP neurons (Min and Tin, of course) and optimize Min neuron yield by placing the RDM stimulus in the periphery. We also provide this information in response to Recommendation (6) above.</p>
<p>b.  We tried the R’s suggestion to apply PCA to the union of Min neurons <inline-formula id="sa3equ4"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-90859-sa3-equ4.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula id="sa3equ5"><inline-graphic xlink:href="elife-90859-sa3-equ5.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"/></inline-formula> , fully expecting PC1 to comprise weights of opposite sign for the right and left preferring neurons, but that is not what we observed. Instead, the direction selectivity is distributed over at least two PCs. We think this is a reflection of the prominence of other signals, such as the strong visual response and normalization signals (see Shushruth et al., 2018). In the spirit of the R’s suggestion, we also established an “evidence coding direction” using a regression strategy similar to the Ramp CD applied to the union of Min neurons. The strategy produced a coding direction with opposite signed weights dominating the right and left subsets. The projection of the neural data on this evidence CD yields a signal similar to the difference variable used in Fig. 6e (i.e., signals that are approximately constant firing rates vs time and scale as a function of signed coherence). These unintegrated signals exhibit weak leverage on choice and RT, consistent with Figure 6d. However, the integrated signal has leverage on choice but not RT, similar to the integral of the difference signal in Reviewer Figure 2.</p>
<p>c.   We do not understand the motivation for this analysis. We could apply PCA or dPCA (or the regression approach, described above) to the population of units with RFs that overlap the motion stimulus, but it is hard to see how this would test the hypothesis that direction-selective neurons similar to those in area MT supply the momentary evidence. As mentioned, we have very few Min neurons (as few as two in session 3). Future experiments that place the motion stimulus in the periphery would likely increase the yield of Min neurons and would be better suited to study this question. As such, we do not see the integrand-like responses of Min neurons as a major claim of the paper. Instead, we view it as an intriguing observation that deserves follow-up in future experiments, including simultaneous recordings from populations of MT and LIP neurons (Min and Tin, of course). We have softened the language considerably to make it clear that future work will be needed to make strong claims about the nature of Min neurons.</p>

If the dataset really does reflect the decision variable with single-trial resolution, eliminating the baseline subtraction when visualizing single-trial activity might actually help to make the point clearer: trials which (for any reason) begin with a higher projection on the particular direction that furnishes the DV would be predicted to reach the decision bound, at any fixed coherence, more quickly than trials with a smaller projection onto this direction.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. For each trial, the mean activity between 175 ms and 225 ms after motion onset was subtracted when generating the single-trial traces. The baseline subtraction was only applied for visualization to better portray the diffusion component in the signal.

</disp-quote>
<p>We have rephrased and added clarifying detail to the section describing the derivation of the ramp signal in the Methods (Ramp direction).</p>
<p>We applied linear regression to generate a signal that best approximates a linear ramp, on each trial, 𝑖, that terminates with a saccade to the choice-target contralateral to the hemisphere of the LIP recordings. The ramps are defined in the epoch spanning the decision time: each ramp begins at 𝑓𝑖(𝑡0) = −1, where 𝑡0 = 0.2 s after motion onset, and ends at 𝑓𝑖(𝑡1) = 1, where 𝑡1 = 𝑡sac − 0.05 s (i.e., 50 ms before saccade initiation). The ramps are sampled every 25 ms and concatenated using all eligible trials to construct a long saw-tooth function (see Supplementary Figure S2). The regression solves for the weights assigned to each neuron such that the weighted sum of the activity of all neurons best approximates the saw-tooth. We constructed a time series of standardized neural activity, sampled identically to the saw-tooth. The spike times from each neuron are represented as delta functions (rasters) and convolved with a non-causal 25 ms boxcar filter. The mean and standard deviation of all sampled values of activity were used to standardize the activity for each neuron (i.e., Z-transform). The coefficients derived by the regression establish the vector of weights that define 𝑆ramp. The algorithm ensures that the population signal 𝑆ramp(𝑡), but not necessarily individual neurons, have amplitudes ranging from approximately −1 to 1.</p>
