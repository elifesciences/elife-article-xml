<title>Abstract</title><p>Sperm motility is crucial for male reproduction and relies on the structural integrity of the sperm axoneme, which has a “9+2” microtubule configuration. This structure includes nine outer doublet microtubules (DMTs) that house various macromolecular complexes. The nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) forms a crossbridge between adjacent DMTs, stabilizing them and facilitates sperm tail bending. Our study of ANKRD5, which is highly expressed in the sperm axoneme, reveals its interaction with DRC5/TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, both critical components of the N-DRC, and these interactions were found to be independent of calcium regulation. ANKRD5<sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited reduced sperm motility and male infertility. Cryo-electron tomography analysis reveals typical “9+2” axoneme and intact DMT structures in <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse sperm, but the DMTs displayed significant morphological variations and greater structural heterogeneity. Furthermore, ANKRD5 deficiency did not affect ATP level, ROS levels, or mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings suggest that ANKRD5 may weaken the N-DRC’s “car bumper” role, reducing the buffering effect between adjacent DMTs and thereby destabilizing axoneme structures during intense axoneme motility.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>Male infertility affects 8%-12% of men globally, with defects in sperm motility accounting for 40%-50% of these cases. The axoneme, serving as the sperm’s motor apparatus, features a 9+2 microtubule arrangement, with the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) providing essential structural support between outer microtubule doublets. Understanding the synergistic relationship between the N-DRC’s structure and its protein composition is crucial for advancing male reproductive biology. In this study, we identify the protein ANKRD5 as a component of the axoneme that can interact with N-DRC components, which is crucial for sperm motility. This discovery enhances our understanding of sperm motility mechanisms and suggests potential targets for male contraceptive development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The interaction between sperm and egg, leading to embryo formation, is fundamental for life reproduction and species continuity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Male infertility impacts 8%-12% of the global male population, with sperm motility defects contributing to 40%-50% of these cases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>] Fertilization relies on successful spermatogenesis and normal sperm motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Mammalian sperm gain motility and fertilization capabilities when they pass through the epididymis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The maturation of sperm in the epididymis is necessary for the production of fertile sperm. Asthenospermia caused by poor sperm motility is the main symptom of clinical infertility, yet its precise pathogenesis remains largely unclear[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Individuals with poorly motile or immobile sperm are typically infertile unless advanced assisted reproductive techniques, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), in vitro fertilization (IVF), or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), are employed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. However, these common assisted reproductive technologies may pass genetic defects to offspring. A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying sperm motility could lead to more effective clinical interventions for hypofertility caused by asthenospermia. Rather than bypassing the issue with ICSI, infertility from poor sperm motility could potentially be treated or even cured through stimulation of specific signaling pathways or gene therapy.</p>
<p>Sperm motility is driven by flagellar beating. The flagellum consists of three main parts: the midpiece, principal piece, and endpiece[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. These three parts share a common central axoneme composed of approximately 250 proteins that are major components of the flagellum[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The axoneme features a 9+2 architecture, comprising nine doublet microtubules (DMTs) encircling a central pair of singlet microtubules, with the N-DRC forming connections between adjacent DMTs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Both the structure and molecular composition of N-DRC are evolutionarily conserved and play a central role in regulating sperm motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. The N-DRC is a large, complex structure with a molecular weight of approximately 1.5 MDa and can be divided into two regions: the linker and the base plate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The N-DRC is a large, complex structure with a molecular weight of approximately 1.5 MDa and can be divided into two regions: the linker and the base plate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Additionally, the N-DRC interacts with the outer dynein arms (ODA) via outer-inner dynein (OID) linkers, functioning as a regulatory component for both ODA and inner dynein arms (IDA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>].</p>
<p>It was previously believed that N-DRC comprised 11 protein components[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. However, a new component CCDC153 (DRC12) was found to interact with DRC1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. In situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) has significantly advanced understanding of the N-DRC architecture in Chlamydomonas, demonstrating that DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, and DRC4/GAS8 constitute its core framework[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], while proteins DRC3/5/6/7/8/11 associate with this framework and engage with other axonemal complexes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Biochemical experiments corroborate these findings and validate this structural model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. The N-DRC functions between the DMTs to convert sliding into axonemal bending motion by restricting the relative sliding of outer microtubule doublets[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Mutations of N-DRC subunits demonstrate that the structural integrity of the N-DRC is crucial for flagellar movements. Mutations in DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, and DRC4/GAS8 are linked to ciliary motility disorders, causing primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Biallelic truncating mutations in DRC1 induce multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF), including outer DMT disassembly, mitochondrial sheath disorganization, and incomplete axonemal structures in human sperm[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Similarly, CCDC65 loss disrupts N-DRC stability, leading to disorganized axonemes, global microtubule dissociation, and complete asthenozoospermia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Homozygous frameshift mutations in DRC3 impair N-DRC assembly and intraflagellar transport (IFT), resulting in severe motility defects despite normal sperm morphology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. TCTE1 knockout mice maintain normal sperm axoneme structure but show impaired glycolysis, leading to reduced ATP levels, lower sperm motility, and male infertility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Both Drc7 and Iqcg (Drc9) knockout mice exhibit disrupted ‘9+2’ axonemal architecture, sperm immotility, and male infertility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. <italic>Drc7</italic> knockout sperm also display head deformities and shortened tails[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. While N-DRC is critical for sperm motility, but the existence of additional regulators that coordinate its function remains unclear. Our findings indicate that ANKRD5 (Ankyrin repeat domain 5; also known as ANK5 or ANKEF1) interacts with N-DRC structure, serving as an auxiliary element to facilitate collaboration among DRC members. The absence of ANKRD5 results in diminished sperm motility and consequent male infertility.</p>

<p>The auxiliary factors required for the N-DRC structure to function effectively have not been fully elucidated. As an important structural component of the axoneme, the functionality of the N-DRC relies on protein interactions. The ANK domain is one of the crucial domains for protein interactions. Based on an analysis of the NCBI database and relevant single-cell sequencing data, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> expression is predominantly localized to the male reproductive system, with a relatively high expression specificity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. However, the impact of ANKRD5 on the functionality of the N-DRC remains unclear. In mice, ANKRD5 is a protein comprising 775 amino acids with a molecular weight of 86.9 kDa. Comparative analysis of the ANKRD5 protein sequence across various species revealed that it is relatively conserved (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). Sequence alignment using Clustal Omega demonstrated an 86% similarity between ANKRD5 sequences in mice and humans (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>), suggesting that studying ANKRD5 in mice has significant translational relevance for human applications. We further confirmed this tissue-specific expression in mice through qPCR, demonstrating that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> was highly expressed in the testes, with no detectable levels in the brain, liver, spleen, kidney, ovary, intestine, or stomach (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Further investigation into the temporal expression of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> in mouse testes indicated that its expression begins on postnatal day 21 and reaches peak levels by postnatal day 35 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which coincides with the emergence of mature sperm.</p>

<title>Due to decreased sperm motility, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm were unable to penetrate the zona pellucida</title>
<p>To investigate the cause of infertility in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> knockout mice, we performed in vitro fertilization (IVF) experiments. Control sperm successfully fertilized both cumulus-intact eggs and cumulus-free eggs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm failed to fertilize the cumulus-intact eggs despite normal binding to the zona pellucida (ZP) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). However, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm were able to fertilize zona pellucida-free eggs and develop to blastocyst (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). These results indicate that the infertility observed in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm is primarily due to the sperm’s inability to penetrate the zona pellucida. Sperm penetration through the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) is influenced by two key factors: the acrosome reaction and sperm motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Notably, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm exhibit a normal acrosome reaction when stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), suggesting that the reproductive defects are not attributable to an acrosome reaction deficiency.</p>

<p>Sperm motility is critical for penetrating the cumulus oophorus and zona pellucida, which are softened by the acrosome reaction. Computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) revealed significant reductions in curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), and straight line velocity (VSL) in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, forward progression parameters such as straightness (STR) and linearity (LIN) were also diminished (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Sperm were categorized into four motility grades: rapid, medium, slow, and static. Significant differences were observed in the distribution of rapid, slow, and static grades, while no significant difference was noted in the medium grade (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). The proportions of total and progressive motility decreased with the loss of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> function (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the tracking of sperm trajectories over time revealed that <italic>Ankr5<sup>-</sup></italic> null sperm exhibited lower motility compared to controls (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Moreover, sperm migration experiments revealed a significantly lower presence of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm in the female uterus and oviducts six hours after mating (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E-G</xref>), further supporting the observed motility defects.

<title>ANKRD5 localized in the sperm axoneme and tracheal motile cilia</title>
<p>To explore the biological function of ANKRD5, we generated <italic>Ankrd5-FLAG</italic> mice by inserting a FLAG tag at the C-terminus using homologous recombination (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>).

Western blot analysis was employed to examine ANKRD5 protein expression across multiple organs and tissues, including liver, lung, kidney, heart, testis, spleen, brain, small intestine, skin, and sperm. The data revealed that ANKRD5 was predominantly expressed in mouse sperm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), with lower expression levels in the testis. To further investigate ANKRD5 localization within sperm, we subjected sperm to repeated freeze-thaw cycles followed by density gradient centrifugation to separate the head and tail.

<p>The sperm tail comprises three sections: midpiece, principal piece, and end piece. Immunofluorescence staining of adult mouse sperm revealed that ANKRD5 was primarily localized in the midpiece (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). As reported in previous studies, proteins from different regions of the sperm tail can be extracted with varying lysate intensities[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. To determine the precise localization of ANKRD5, we used specific markers, including BASIGIN, Acetylated Tubulin, and AKAP4, representing the Triton X-100 soluble, SDS soluble, and SDS resistant fractions, respectively. These three fractions contain, respectively, membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins, axonemal proteins, as well as fibrous sheath and outer dense fiber proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. The results indicated that ANKRD5 was primarily located in the SDS soluble fraction, suggesting its association with the sperm axoneme (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). These findings suggest that the infertility associated with the reduced motility in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm may be linked to impaired axoneme function in the sperm tail. Given that mouse respiratory cilia also possess a canonical axonemal structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], our immunostaining analysis confirmed the expression of ANKRD5 in respiratory cilia (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). However, <italic>Ankrd5</italic>-KO mice exhibited no significant survival defects or locomotor impairments beyond male infertility, suggesting a tissue-specific functional dependency of ANKRD5.</p>

<title>ANKRD5 interacts with axoneme N-DRC components</title>
<p>In order to explore the function of ANKRD5 in the axoneme, we explored the interactome of ANKRD5 using LC-MS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We identified the presence of several N-DRC components, including TCTE1, DRC3/LRRC48, DRC7/CCDC135, and DRC4/GAS8, with TCTE1 ranking highly in the mass spectrum (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). TEM analysis indicates that <italic>Tcte1</italic> null sperm maintain a normal DMT structure yet exhibit reduced motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>], a phenotype similarly observed in ANKRD5 knockout (ANKRD5-KO) sperm. ANKRD5 was identified in the TCTE1 mass spectrum with a high ranking, but their interaction had not been experimentally validated before our study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We performed immunoprecipitation in 293T cells and validated protein interactions with 11 DRC components, except for DRC6, which failed to express (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Our results confirmed that ANKRD5 interacts with TCTE1 and DRC4/GAS8, but no interaction with other DRC components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3 A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). ANKRD5 consists of two ANK domains and one EF-hand domain. The ANK domain is classic mediator of protein interactions, and the EF-hand domain typically functions as a calcium sensor; however, approximately one-third of EF-hand domains lack calcium-binding capability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Through protein truncation experiments, we found that the ANK2 domain mediates the interaction between ANKRD5 and TCTE1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). But, the interaction between ANKRD5 and DRC4/GAS8 requires the presence of both the ANK1 and ANK2 domains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). The EF-Hand domain is not necessary for the interaction between ANKRD5 and TCTE1 or DRC4/GAS8. Western blot results indicated that calcium ions do not affect the interaction between ANKRD5 and DRC4/GAS8 or TCTE1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).</p>

<p>As for other proteins in the LC-MS results, KRT77 is a classic protein that maintains cytoskeletal stability. It may enhance the physical connection between the N-DRC and adjacent DMTs through interaction with ANKRD5. Recent studies indicate that ANKRD5, a newly identified component in the distal lobe of the N-DRC, has a positively charged surface, which may facilitate binding to glutamylated tubulin on adjacent DMTs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Thus, KRT77 may also regulate its interaction with ANKRD5 via post-translational modifications (PTMs, e.g., phosphorylation), thereby strengthening sperm resistance to shear forces during flagellar movement. Rab family proteins participate in intraflagellar transport and membrane dynamics. RAB2A may promote targeted transport of ANKRD5 or other N-DRC components to axonemal assembly sites by recruiting vesicles, and its GTPase activity might link cellular signals to ANKRD5-mediated axoneme remodeling. However, the observed signals could be false positives due to nonspecific factors such as electrostatic adsorption, high-abundance protein interference, detergent-induced membrane disruption, or protein aggregation tendencies.</p>
<p>As is well known, energy metabolism is crucial for sperm motility. The TCTE1 null sperm showed a decrease in ATP levels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The loss of ANKRD5 does not change ATP levels in the sperm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). This result indicates that ANKRD5 can interact with N-DRC components without impacting energy metabolism. The mitochondrial sheath is located in the midpiece of sperm, where mitochondria play a key role in energy production and serve as a significant source of reactive oxygen species (ROS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. A balanced level of ROS is crucial for several essential sperm functions, including motility, capacitation, the acrosome reaction, fertilization, and hyperactivation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) is correlated with sperm motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Decreased MMP (depolarization) indicates mitochondrial dysfunction, while increased MMP (hyperpolarization) leads to excess ROS. MMP in spermatozoa was assessed using TMRM staining and fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 A</xref> and <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). ROS levels were measured using DCFH-DA staining, followed by fluorescence imaging (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5 C</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). We found no significant differences between <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm and control. Thus, ANKRD5 deficiency did not significantly affect sperm ATP levels and mitochondrial function.</p>

<title>The ANKRD5-KO sperm axoneme retains <bold>”</bold>9+2<bold>”</bold> configuration</title>
<p>The absence of certain DRC components has been shown to alter the expression of other N-DRC proteins. For instance, DRC2/3/4 expression is reduced in DRC1 mutant mice[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], while DRC1/3/5/11 expression is downregulated in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> DRC2 mutants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. To assess the impact of ANKRD5 deletion on sperm protein composition, we conducted quantitative proteomics using 4D-SmartDIA. Mass spectrometry identified 4,880 quantifiable proteins, of which 126 were differentially expressed (1.5 fold change), including 10 upregulated and 116 downregulated proteins (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). DRC components were not included in the differentially expressed proteins list. In order to better understand the expression changes of these key proteins, the intensity data of DRC components were extracted and normalized, then performed the T-test. Due to technical limitations, DRC6 and DRC12 were not detected. However, the analysis revealed a significant difference in DRC11(IQCA1). As no effective commercial antibody was available, DRC11 was not tested using Western blotting (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). TCTE1 deficiency has been associated with abnormalities in glycolysis, leading to decreased ATP levels and reduced sperm motility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. We conducted a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) focusing on this term, but the results were not significant, which is consistent with our ATP measurement results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). To further investigate the RS, IDA, and ODA structures of the axonemes, we conducted immunofluorescence assays in both <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and the control group. No significant differences were detected between the two groups (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>).</p>
<p>The sperm axoneme follows a typical 9+2 structural arrangement, composed of nine outer DMTs surrounding two central microtubules.

To further explore the effects of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> knockout on each component of mouse sperm axoneme, we collected about 160 tilt series of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm axoneme using cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>).

Among the 89 tomograms with good quality, we carried out manual particle selection of DMT fiber and applied RELION, Dynamo and Warp/M to carry out sub-tomogram averaging (STA) analysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>].

<title>ANKRD5 depletion may impair buffering effect between adjacent DMTs in the axoneme</title>

We could retain only ∼10% of the DMT particles to obtain the final density map for ANKRD5-KO sperm (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9E</xref>), whereas ∼70% were usable in WT dataset as reported previously[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. The mutant DMT density map also displayed roughness at its periphery, indicating substantial structural heterogeneity (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9E</xref>). Even after discarding a large fraction of deformed particles, the final density map still showed evident artifacts, implying that although the mutant DMT preserves the fundamental features of both tubes, its shape is highly heterogeneous (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9E</xref>). Furthermore, attempts to classify the 96-nm repeats did not yield a clear density for radial spokes (RSs) (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9F</xref>), indicating that ANKRD5 deficiency may affect the stability of other accessory structures, such as RSs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In the raw tomograms, RSs in ANKRD5-KO sperm appeared less regularly arranged than those in WT (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9A</xref> and <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">C</xref>).</p>
<p>Most recently, following the submission of this work, ANKRD5 was reported to localize at the head of the N-DRC, simultaneously binding DRC11, DRC7, DRC4, and DRC5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. This structural insight agrees with our in vitro findings that ANKRD5 interacts with DRC4 and DRC5 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C-F</xref>). However, that study used isolated and purified DMT samples, leaving the precise positioning of ANKRD5 between adjacent axonemal DMTs unconfirmed. We therefore fitted the published structure (PDB entry: 9FQR) into the in situ DMT structure of mouse sperm 96-nm repeats (EMD-27444), revealing that ANKRD5 lies a mere ∼3 nm from the adjacent DMT (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>). Notably, the N-DRC is often likened to a “car bumper”, buffering two neighboring DMTs during vigorous axonemal motion. Given the extensive DMT deformation observed in our cryo-ET data (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9E</xref>), we propose that ANKRD5 contributes to this buffering function at the N-DRC. The loss of ANKRD5 may weaken the “bumper” effect and consequently increase structural damage to adjacent DMTs under intense conditions, while also compromising the stability of associated DMT accessory structures[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>].</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During natural fertilization, males could ejaculate millions of sperm, but most are expelled by contractions in the female reproductive tract. Freshly ejaculate sperm exhibit activate movements, and only a few hundred activated sperm reach the isthmus of the fallopian tube, where they attach to the mucosal epithelium to form a sperm reservoir, remaining dormant until ovulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Then, upon release from the reservoir, sperm transition to a hyperactivated state to approach the egg. Activation sperm exhibit symmetrical flagellar oscillations and swim along near-linear trajectories, whereas hyperactivated sperm display high-amplitude, asymmetrical flagellar oscillations[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Activation is the prerequisite for hyperactivation. The outer layer of the COC is rich in hyaluronic acid, which gives it highly viscoelastic[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]. Acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase, which softens the cumulus cell layer and facilitate sperm-egg interaction. Sperm motility plays an important role in penetrate the COC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. It has been reported that vole sperm can penetrate the zona pellucida of mice and hamsters without acrosome reaction, underscoring the importance of mechanical forces in sperm penetration of the COC[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>].</p>
<p>N-DRC is critical for sperm motility. The auxiliary factors required for the N-DRC structure to function effectively have not been fully elucidated. As an important structural component of the axoneme, the functionality of the N-DRC relies on protein interactions. ANKRD5 is evolutionarily conserved and features a helix-turn-helix repeat structure known as the ANK domain, which is a common motif involved in protein-protein interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. Given the high expression of ANKRD5 in the testes and its presence in the LC-MS results of TCTE1, we are concerned about the potential synergistic role of ANKRD5 in the function of N-DRC. Previous studies have found that ANKRD5 plays a critical role in cell adhesion and protrusion, contributing to the normal formation of the Xenopus gastrula[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Ankrd5</italic> has been identified as differentially expressed in normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic males[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>].</p>
<p><italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> male mice exhibit normal spermatogenesis and are able to mate and produce mating plugs, but failed to produce offspring. Histological and morphological of the <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> appeared normal. The IVF results found that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm could penetrate cumulus cells, but they could not fertilize cumulus-intact eggs, even after granulosa cell were removed. Interestingly, zona pellucida free eggs were successfully fertilized, and the resulting embryos developed normally to the blastocyst stage. Our findings indicate that the absence of ANKRD5 results in male infertility due to the inability of <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida during fertilization. Acrosome reaction and sperm motility is important for sperm to penetrate the ZP. We used A23187 to induce the acrosome reaction and found that <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm exhibited normal acrosome reaction. However, CASA revealed reduced motility in <italic>Ankrd5</italic> null sperm, suggesting that their inability to penetrate the zona pellucida is linked to abnormal motility rather than defective acrosome function. Our sperm migration results support this conclusion.</p>
<p>The sperm axoneme, a 9+2 motor apparatus, is critical for motility. Dynein arms on A-tubules hydrolyze ATP to “walk” along adjacent B-tubules, driving microtubule sliding. The N-DRC helps convert this sliding into flagellar bending[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Mass spectrometry identified several N-DRC members, including DRC5/TCTE1, DRC3/LRRC48, DRC7/CCDC135, and DRC4/GAS8. ANKRD5 knockout sperm shows a phenotype similar to TCTE1 knockout sperm, suggesting ANKRD5 may have a similar role to TCTE1. <italic>Drc3/Lrrc48</italic> knockout mice can grow up to adult and are capable of mating, but they are unable to produce offspring[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. In chlamydomonas, <italic>Drc3/Lrrc48</italic> mutations cause flagellar motility defects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. <italic>Drc7/Ccdc135</italic> knockout mice exhibit short-tailed sperm, leading to male infertility[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], while DRC4/GAS8[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] is associated with PCD in humans. Immunoprecipitation validated the mass spectrometry results, and GSEA analysis along with ATP measurements confirmed that ANKRD5 deficiency does not impact energy metabolism. Thus, ANKRD5 likely acts as a structural component aiding N-DRC function without involvement in metabolism.</p>
<p>The recently reported 96nm repeats DMT structure of bovine sperm axoneme provides a better understanding of the location of ANKRD5 (ANKEF1) and its interaction with other proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. However, the current structure of N-DRC is still incomplete, especially the binding structure between N-DRC and adjacent DMT. In the future, high-resolution structures of N-DRC at the cellular level are still needed to help us further explore the mechanism of interaction between N-DRC and adjacent DMT, which will also provide us with new insights into the motility mechanism of mammalian sperm.</p>
<p>Asthenospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility, is a major cause of clinical infertility, yet its precise pathogenesis remains unclear. Investigating the infertility observed in <italic>Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may provide insights into the underlying causes of asthenospermia. While current birth control pills primarily target women, they can have adverse side effects such as dizziness, chest pain, decreased libido, and vision impairment. As a result, the development of a male contraceptive has become an urgent priority. Currently, no oral contraceptive is available for men, but our study offers new perspectives for male contraceptive research.</p>
<p>The potential for male contraceptive development arises from ANKRD5’s critical structural role mediated through its ANK domain, which facilitates interaction with the N-DRC complex in sperm flagella. Recent structural evidence suggests the protein’s positively charged surface may engage with glutamylated tubulin in adjacent microtubules[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], presenting a druggable interface. Targeted disruption of this interaction through small-molecule inhibitors could transiently impair sperm motility. Sperm function relies more on ANKRD5 than respiratory cilia, so inhibiting ANKRD5 has less impact on the latter. This makes ANKRD5 a promising drug target. This tissue-specific phenotypic uncoupling is not uncommon among axonemal-associated proteins, such as DNAH17 and IQUB[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>].</p>

Peptide separation was followed by analysis on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer, with full MS scans at a 60,000 resolution and MS/MS scans at 15,000 resolution using HCD at 27% NCE. DIA data were processed using the DIA-NN software. Spectra were searched against the Mus_musculus_10090_SP_20231220.fasta database, with Trypsin/P specified as the enzyme and up to one missed cleavage allowed. Fixed modifications included N-terminal methionine removal and carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues. The false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled below 1%.</p>

<title>Evaluation of ROS level</title>
<p>Spermatozoa were obtained from the cauda epididymis and incubated for 50 minutes in preheated TYH medium (manufacturer, catalog number) with or without Rosup. Subsequently, the samples underwent a gentle centrifugation at 300Xg for 4 minutes, followed by resuspension in 1 mL of DCFDA mix. The DCFDA mix was prepared by diluting DCFH-DA (Beyotime, S0033S) in a 1:1000 ratio with TYH medium. After an incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 20 minutes, inversion mixing was performed every 5 minutes to ensure proper distribution. The samples were then subjected to another centrifugation step at 300Xg for 4 minutes to remove the supernatant. Pellets were washed three times with DPBS to eliminate any residual DCFH-DA that had not penetrated the intracellular compartments. Following this, the pellets were resuspended, mixed with DAPI, and subsequently spread onto slides. Fluorescence images were captured using a DAPI filter (405nm) and an FITC filter (510-580nm).</p>

<title>Sample preparation of mouse sperm axoneme</title>
<p>Freshly extracted sperm were centrifuged at 400 G (Thermo Scientific Legend Micro 17 R) for 5 min at 4 °C.

<title>Cryo-ET tilt series acquisition</title>
<p>The grid after the reduction of cryo-FIB was mounted onto Autoloader in Titan Krios G3 (Thermofisher Scientific) 300 KV TEM, equipped with a Gatan K2 direct electron detector (DED) and a BioQuantum energy filter. Tilt series were collected at a magnification of ×42,000, resulting in a physical pixel size of 3.4 Å in K2 DED and 3.4 Å in counting mode. Before data collection, the pre-tilt of the sample was determined visually, and the pre-tilt was set to 10° or -9° to match the pre-determined geometry induced by loading grids. The total dose for each tilt was set to 3.5 electrons per angstrom squared, divided into 10 frames over a 1.2-s exposure, and the tilt range was set to -9° pre-tilt of -66° to +51°, or +10° pre-tilt of -50° to +67°, in steps of 3°, resulting in 40 tilts and 140 electrons per tilt series. The slit width was set to 20 eV, zero loss peaks were refined after the collection of each tilt series, and nominal defocus was set from -1.8 to -2.5 μm. All tilt series used in this study were collected using a beam-image-shift facilitated acquisition scheme based on a dose symmetry strategy using a script developed in-house in SerialEM software[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>].</p>

<title>Mouse sperm axoneme <italic>in situ</italic> data processing</title>
<p>After data collection, all fractioned movies were imported into Warp for essential processing, including motion correction, 2-x Fourier segmentation of super-resolution frames, CTF estimation, masking platinum islands or other high-contrast features, and tilt series generation. Subsequently, the tilt series was automatically aligned using AreTOMO[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Aligned tilt series were visually inspected in IMOD and any low-quality frames (such as those blocked by the sample stage or grid bars, containing obvious crystalline ice or showing obvious jumps) were removed to create new sets of tilt series in Warp. The new tilt series underwent a second round of AreTOMO alignment. Then, low-quality frames were removed again using the same criteria as in the first round. The new tilt series was then subjected to a third round of automatic alignment, continuing the process until there were no frames to remove. After tilt series alignment, those tilt series that were less than 30 frames or failed were not further processed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The alignment parameters of all remaining tilt series were passed back to Warp, and initial tomogram reconstruction was performed in Warp at 27.2 Å pixel size, resulting in a total of 160 Bin8 tomograms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Among the total 160 tomograms, we used the filament picking tool in Dynamo to manually pick DMT particles from 89 of all tomograms. By selecting the starting and ending points of each DMT fiber, and separating each cutting point by 8 nm along the fiber axis, we were able to obtain 89 sets of DMT particles[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. The 3D coordinates and two of the three Euler angles (except for in-plane rotation) are automatically generated by Dynamo and then transferred back to Warp for exporting sub-tomograms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>].</p>

First, all particles were reconstructed into the box size of 48<sup>3</sup> voxels with a pixel size of 27.2 Å, and all extracted particles were directly averaged and low-pass filtered at 80 Å to generate an initial reference. Then 3D classification with K = 1 was performed under the constraints of the first two Euler angles (—sigma_tilt 3 and —sigma_psi 3 in RELION), and 3D automatic refinement was performed after 25 iterations. After alignment, manually cleaned the particles in Chimerax-1.6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], and then transferred these aligned parameters back to Warp to export the sub-tomograms with a box size of 84<sup>3</sup> voxels and a pixel size of 13.6 Å. The particles were automatically refined in RELION. After removing any duplicate particles in Dynamo, we transferred these aligned parameters back to Warp to export the sub-tomograms with the box size of 128<sup>3</sup> voxels and the pixel size of 6.8 Å.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Asthenospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility, is one of the major causes of male infertility. The &quot;9 + 2&quot; arranged MTs and over 200 associated proteins constitute the axoneme, the molecular machine for flagellar and ciliary motility. Understanding the physiological functions of axonemal proteins, particularly their links to male infertility, could help uncover the genetic causes of asthenospermia and improve its clinical diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors generated Ankrd5 null mice and found that ANKRD5-/- males exhibited reduced sperm motility and infertility. Using FLAG-tagged ANKRD5 mice, mass spectrometry, and immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses, they confirmed that ANKRD5 is localized within the N-DRC, a critical protein complex for normal flagellar motility. However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of sperm from Ankrd5 null mice did not reveal significant structural abnormalities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotypes observed in ANKRD5-/- mice, including reduced sperm motility and male infertility, are conversing. The authors demonstrated that ANKRD5 is an N-DRC protein that interacts with TCTE1 and DRC4. Most of the experiments are well designed and executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The last section of cryo-ET analysis is not convincing. &quot;ANKRD5 depletion may impair buffering effect between adjacent DMTs in the axoneme&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;In WT sperm, DMTs typically appeared circular, whereas ANKRD5-KO DMTs seemed to be extruded as polygonal. (Fig. S9B,D). ANKRD5-KO DMTs seemed partially open at the junction between the A- and B-tubes (Fig. S9B,D).&quot; In the TEM images of 4E, ANKRD5-KO DMTs look the same as WT. The distortion could result from suboptimal sample preparation, imaging or data processing. Thus, the subsequent analyses and conclusions are not reliable.</p>
<p>This paper still requires significant improvements in writing and language refinement. Here is an example: &quot;While N-DRC is critical for sperm motility, but the existence of additional regulators that coordinate its function remains unclear&quot; - ill-formed sentences.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript investigates the role of ANKRD5 (ANKEF1) as a component of the N-DRC complex in sperm motility and male fertility. Using Ankrd5 knockout mice, the study demonstrates that ANKRD5 is essential for sperm motility and identifies its interaction with N-DRC components through IP-mass spectrometry and cryo-ET. The results provide insights into ANKRD5's function, highlighting its potential involvement in axoneme stability and sperm energy metabolism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ a wide range of techniques, including gene knockout models, proteomics, cryo-ET, and immunoprecipitation, to explore ANKRD5's role in sperm biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Limited Citations in Introduction: Key references on the role of N-DRC components (e.g.,DRC2, DRC4) in male infertility are missing, which weakens the contextual background.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Asthenospermia, characterized by reduced sperm motility, is one of the major causes of male infertility. The &quot;9 + 2&quot; arranged MTs and over 200 associated proteins constitute the axoneme, the molecular machine for flagellar and ciliary motility. Understanding the physiological functions of axonemal proteins, particularly their links to male infertility, could help uncover the genetic causes of asthenospermia and improve its clinical diagnosis and management. In this study, the authors generated Ankrd5 null mice and found that ANKRD5-/- males exhibited reduced sperm motility and infertility. Using FLAG-tagged ANKRD5 mice, mass spectrometry, and immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses, they confirmed that ANKRD5 is localized within the N-DRC, a critical protein complex for normal flagellar motility. However, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of sperm from Ankrd5 null mice did not reveal any structural abnormalities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotypes observed in ANKRD5-/- mice, including reduced sperm motility and male infertility, are conversing. The authors demonstrated that ANKRD5 is an N-DRC protein that interacts with TCTE1 and DRC4. Most of the experiments are thoughtfully designed and well executed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The cryo-FIB and cryo-ET analyses require further investigation, as detailed below. The molecular mechanism by which the loss of ANKRD5 affects sperm flagellar motility remains unclear. The current conclusion that Ankrd5 knockout reduces axoneme stability is not well-supported. Specifically, are other axonemal proteins diminished in Ankrd5 knockout sperm? Conducting immunofluorescence analyses and revisiting the quantitative proteomics data may help address these questions.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript investigates the role of ANKRD5 (ANKEF1) as a component of the N-DRC complex in sperm motility and male fertility. Using Ankrd5 knockout mice, the study demonstrates that ANKRD5 is essential for sperm motility and identifies its interaction with N-DRC components through IP-mass spectrometry and cryo-ET. The results provide insights into ANKRD5's function, highlighting its potential involvement in axoneme stability and sperm energy metabolism.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ a wide range of techniques, including gene knockout models, proteomics, cryo-ET, and immunoprecipitation, to explore ANKRD5's role in sperm biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Limited Citations in Introduction: Key references on the role of N-DRC components (e.g., DRC1, DRC2, DRC3, DRC5) in male infertility are missing, which weakens the contextual background.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Functional Insights: While interacting proteins outside the N-DRC complex were identified, their potential roles and interactions with ANKRD5 are not adequately explored or discussed.</p>
<p>(3) Mitochondrial Function Uncertainty: Immunofluorescence suggests possible mitochondrial localization for ANKRD5, but experiments on its role in energy metabolism (e.g., ATP production, ROS) are insufficient, especially given the observed sperm motility defects.</p>
<p>(4) Glycolysis Pathway Impact: Proteomic analysis indicates glycolysis pathway disruptions in Ankrd5-deficient sperm, but the link between these changes and impaired motility is not well explained.</p>
<p>(5) Cryo-ET Data Limitations: The structural analysis of the DMT lacks clarity on how ANKRD5 influences N-DRC or RS3. The low quality of RS3 data hinders the interpretation of ANKRD5's impact on axoneme structure.</p>
<p>(6) Discussion of Findings: The manuscript could benefit from a deeper discussion on the broader implications of ANKRD5's interactions and its role in sperm energy metabolism and motility mechanisms.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>EMD-35210/35211 are 16-nm maps while the Ankrd5 null map is 8-nm repeat. To generate a difference map, the authors should use maps of the same periodicity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have replaced the old 16-nm maps with an 8nm map and updated the images (Fig. 7). The 8nm repeats DMT density map we used was obtained by summing two 16nm repeats DMTs that were staggered 8nm apart from each other (EMD-35229). The replacement of the 16nm repeats DMT density map with the 8nm repeats DMT density map has no effect on our scientific findings and experimental conclusions.</p>
<p>&quot;We were able to detect the N-DRC structure in WT sperm, but we failed to find the density of N-DRC adjacent to RS3 in Ankrd5 null sperm&quot;. Do the authors imply that the N-DRC is lost in Ankrd5 null sperm? To draw a conclusion, they need to compare the 96-nm map of WT sperm axoneme with that of Ankrd5 null sperm axoneme. Quantitative proteomics shows that the levels of most N-DRC components in Ankrd5 null sperm are comparable with those of WT sperm. Why are the quantitative proteomics results not consistent with the structural observation?</p>
<p>We are very sorry for this improper description. Our original description was not rigorous, which led to misunderstanding. Our original intention is to say that the quality of the density map causes the N-DRC to be difficult to recognize, rather than that the N-DRC has disappeared. In addition, attempts to classify 96nm repeats DMT structure during our data processing failed. In the process of classification, we found that the density of RS was not good. So we changed the picture and the description.</p>
<p>We have changed the description in the text: &quot;During the STA process, many particles were misaligned or deformed in the classification results, revealing various degrees of deformation—particularly affecting the B-tube (Figure 9,Fig. S9E). We could retain only ~10% of the DMT particles to obtain the final density map for ANKRD5-KO sperm (Fig. S9E), whereas ~70% were usable in WT dataset as reported previously [59]. The mutant DMT density map also displayed roughness at its periphery, indicating substantial structural heterogeneity (Fig. S9E). Even after discarding a large fraction of deformed particles, the final density map still showed evident artifacts, implying that although the mutant DMT preserves the fundamental features of both tubes, its shape is highly heterogeneous (Fig. S9E). Furthermore, attempts to classify the 96-nm repeats did not yield a clear density for radial spokes (RSs) (Fig. S9F), indicating that ANKRD5 deficiency may affect the stability of other accessory structures, such as RSs [24-26]. In the raw tomograms, RSs in ANKRD5-KO sperm appeared less regularly arranged than those in WT(Fig. S9A and C).&quot;</p>

<p>Figure S9. The states of DMT particles in sperm of Ankrd5-KO mouse. (A) and (C) Tomogram slices of WT and Ankrd5-KO in Dynamo (The data for WT mouse sperm was EMPIARC-200007). DMT and RS are marked with white dashed lines and white arrows, respectively. (B) and (D) Comparison of DMT particle states between WT and Ankrd5-KO in Dynamo. The visual angles of the DMT particles shown in (B) and (D) show that the DMT fibers within the white box in (A) and (B) are divided equally into 10 slices along the direction of the white arrow, respectively. The DMT particle shapes of WT and Ankrd5-KO are marked by white dashed lines on the right of (B) and (D). The white arrow in (D) identifies the junction of A-tube and B-tube that is suspected to be disconnected. (E) Deformed particles discarded in 3D classification and final aligned DMT artifacts. (F) 3D classification of attempted RS locations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the process of obtaining DMT with a period of 8nm, we discarded about 90% of the particles (some were mis-aligned particles and some were deformed particles). Although the final DMT density showed complete A-tube and B-tube, both the particles in our calculation process and the projection of the final structure showed strong particle heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Our results show that in ANKRD5-KO mice, the structure of sperm DMT itself has no apparent effect in tube A and tube B, and we found that DMT in the original tomography were not smooth. We speculate that loss of ANKRD5 may reduce the interaction between N-DRC and neighboring DMTs, resulting in nonuniform force on the axoneme during sperm swimming, which may limit our ability to obtain an average structure of the more dynamic components (RS, N-DRC, ODA, IDA). Therefore, when trying to classify 96nm repeat DMTS, we can only see the density of suspected RS3 and RS2, but it is difficult to obtain the confident 96nm repeat DMT density. It is difficult to further discuss the effects of ANKRD5 on RS3 and N-DRC. To test this conjecture, we further classified the density of suspected RS3, and the results obtained exhibited a variety of mixed states (Fig. S9). To avoid confusion, we have already removed the discussion of RS3 and the related images from the original text.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether N-DRC proteins and ODA, IDA, RS proteins are affected in DMT of Ankrd5 null sperm. Immunofluorescence staining would help to resolve this problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion. The levels of N-DRC proteins and ODA, IDA, RS were detected by immunofluorescence, and no difference was found between ANKRD5-null sperm and control. We added figure S6 as a new figure and added the following description in red font on page 7 of the article:</p>

<p>Abstract, &quot;These findings establish that ANKRD5 is critical for maintaining axoneme stability, &quot;Page 7, &quot;This suggests that the knockout of Ankrd5 may affect the structural stability of the axoneme,&quot; I do not see direct evidence that Ankrd5 KO reduces the axoneme stability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our phrasing was not sufficiently precise. These findings suggest that ANKRD5 plays a crucial role in limiting the relative sliding between adjacent microtubule doublets during axoneme bending, rather than directly contributing to the stability of the axoneme. This sentence has already been modified in the abstract and marked in red. We have added the description in the text: &quot;These findings suggest that ANKRD5 may weaken the N-DRC’s &quot;car bumper&quot; role, reducing the buffering effect between adjacent DMTs and thereby destabilizing axoneme structures during intense axoneme motility.&quot; and &quot;To further investigate the RS, IDA, and ODA structures of the axonemes, we conducted immunofluorescence assays in both Ankrd5<sup>-/-</sup> mice and the control group. No significant differences were detected between the two groups (Fig. S6).&quot;</p>

<p>Page 8, &quot;but our study offers new perspectives for male contraceptive research&quot;. Could the authors expand this a bit - how this study may offer new perspectives for male contraceptive research?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer's insightful feedback regarding the translational potential of our findings. This is indeed a critical aspect that we sought to highlight. In response, we have added a paragraph on page 9 (marked in red) to further emphasize this point. We have added the description in the text: &quot;The potential for male contraceptive development arises from ANKRD5's critical structural role mediated through its ANK domain, which facilitates interaction with the N-DRC complex in sperm flagella. Recent structural evidence suggests the protein's positively charged surface may engage with glutamylated tubulin in adjacent microtubules[41], presenting a druggable interface. Targeted disruption of this interaction through small-molecule inhibitors could transiently impair sperm motility. Sperm function relies more on ANKRD5 than respiratory cilia, so inhibiting ANKRD5 has less impact on the latter. This makes ANKRD5 a promising drug target. This tissue-specific phenotypic uncoupling is not uncommon among axonemal-associated proteins, such as DNAH17 and IQUB[65，66].&quot;</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Several components of the N-DRC complex (e.g., DRC1, DRC2, DRC3, DRC5) have been reported to be associated with male infertility in both humans and mice. However, the introduction lacks proper citations for these studies. Adding these references would provide a more comprehensive background for readers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion to strengthen the comprehensiveness of the research background by incorporating additional literatures. More literatures related to DRC1, DRC2, DRC3, and DRC5 were cited in the background of this paper. We have rewritten and reorganized the language of the last paragraph of the introduction, and the entire paragraph is highlighted in red. The content of the paragraph is as follows:</p>
<p>&quot;It was previously believed that N-DRC comprised 11 protein components[13，18]. However, a new component CCDC153 (DRC12) was found to interact with DRC1[19]. In situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) has significantly advanced understanding of the N-DRC architecture in Chlamydomonas, demonstrating that DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, and DRC4/GAS8 constitute its core framework[16], while proteins DRC3/5/6/7/8/11 associate with this framework and engage with other axonemal complexes[20]. Biochemical experiments corroborate these findings and validate this structural model[12，21，22]. The N-DRC functions between the DMTs to convert sliding into axonemal bending motion by restricting the relative sliding of outer microtubule doublets[23，24，25]. Mutations of N-DRC subunits demonstrate that the structural integrity of the N-DRC is crucial for flagellar movements. Mutations in DRC1, DRC2/CCDC65, and DRC4/GAS8 are linked to ciliary motility disorders, causing primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)[12，26]. Biallelic truncating mutations in DRC1 induce multiple morphological abnormalities of sperm flagella (MMAF), including outer DMT disassembly, mitochondrial sheath disorganization, and incomplete axonemal structures in human sperm[22，27，28]. Similarly, CCDC65 loss disrupts N-DRC stability, leading to disorganized axonemes, global microtubule dissociation, and complete asthenozoospermia[12，29].  Homozygous frameshift mutations in DRC3 impair N-DRC assembly and intraflagellar transport (IFT), resulting in severe motility defects despite normal sperm morphology[30，31]. TCTE1 knockout mice maintain normal sperm axoneme structure but show impaired glycolysis, leading to reduced ATP levels, lower sperm motility, and male infertility[32]. Both Drc7 and Iqcg (Drc9) knockout mice exhibit disrupted '9+2' axonemal architecture, sperm immotility, and male infertility[21，33]. Drc7 knockout sperm also display head deformities and shortened tails[21]. While N-DRC is critical for sperm motility, but the existence of additional regulators that coordinate its function remains unclear. Our findings indicate that ANKRD5 (Ankyrin repeat domain 5; also known as ANK5 or ANKEF1) interacts with N-DRC structure, serving as an auxiliary element to facilitate collaboration among DRC members. The absence of ANKRD5 results in diminished sperm motility and consequent male infertility.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While many N-DRC components were identified as interacting with ANKRD5, other proteins outside the N-DRC complex were also detected. Notably, GAS8 (DRC4) ranked 165th among the identified proteins. What are the functions of the higher-ranking proteins, and why do they interact with ANKRD5? Discussing their potential roles would enhance the mechanistic understanding of ANKRD5's function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the importance of non-N-DRC proteins interacting with ANKRD5 (ANKEF1). Below, we provide a detailed analysis of the roles and interaction mechanisms of the top-ranked non-N-DRC proteins (Krt77, Rab2a, Gm7429) to elucidate their functional relevance to ANKRD5. We have added the following text to page 6 to clarify and highlight this in red:</p>
<p>As for other proteins in the LC-MS results, KRT77 is a classic protein that maintains cytoskeletal stability. It may enhance the physical connection between the N-DRC and adjacent DMTs through interaction with ANKRD5. Recent studies indicate that ANKRD5, a newly identified component in the distal lobe of the N-DRC, has a positively charged surface, which may facilitate binding to glutamylated tubulin on adjacent DMTs[41]. Thus, KRT77 may also regulate its interaction with ANKRD5 via post-translational modifications (PTMs, e.g., phosphorylation), thereby strengthening sperm resistance to shear forces during flagellar movement. Rab family proteins participate in intraflagellar transport and membrane dynamics. RAB2A may promote targeted transport of ANKRD5 or other N-DRC components to axonemal assembly sites by recruiting vesicles, and its GTPase activity might link cellular signals to ANKRD5-mediated axoneme remodeling. However, the observed signals could be false positives due to nonspecific factors such as electrostatic adsorption, high-abundance protein interference, detergent-induced membrane disruption, or protein aggregation tendencies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The immunofluorescence localization of ANKRD5-Flag appears more aligned with the mitochondrial sheath rather than the axoneme. There is a finer red fluorescent signal extending from the mitochondrial sheath that might correspond to the axoneme. Could this suggest that ANKRD5 has a functional role in the mitochondria? While the authors measured ROS levels, this might not fully clarify whether ANKRD5 is involved in sperm energy metabolism. Considering the motility defects in Ankrd5 knockout mice, further experiments to explore ANKRD5's potential involvement in energy metabolism are necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The increased detection of ANKRD5 in the midpiece region of the sperm axoneme does not necessarily indicate its localization in mitochondria. Immunofluorescence signals of multiple axonemal Nexin-Dynein Regulatory Complex (N-DRC) components (e.g., TCTE1, DRC1, CCDC65, DRC3, GAS8, and DRC7) are also non-uniformly distributed along the entire flagellum[1]. Similar localization patterns are observed in other structural components, such as radial spoke protein NME5[2] and outer dynein arm protein DNAH5[3]. Furthermore, mitochondria are membrane-bound organelles, and ANKRD5 predominantly resides in the SDS-soluble fraction under varying lysis conditions, confirming its association with the axoneme rather than mitochondria. Thus, the spatial distribution of ANKRD5 does not support a functional role in mitochondria. Importantly, we validated intact mitochondrial function through measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (Figure S5C, D), ATP content (Figure 6E), and mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure S5A, B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Proteomic analysis of Ankrd5-deficient sperm revealed disruptions in the glycolysis pathway. While these changes do not appear to affect ATP production, the mechanism by which these disruptions impact sperm motility remains unclear. Further investigation into how glycolysis pathway alterations contribute to impaired motility is warranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's careful consideration of our proteomic data. However, our Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways showed no significant enrichment (p-value=0.089, NES=0.708; Fig.6D), which does not meet the statistical thresholds for biological significance (|NES|&gt;1, pvalue&lt;0.05). This observation is further corroborated by our direct ATP measurements showing no difference between genotypes (Fig.6E). We agree that further studies on metabolic regulation could be valuable, but current evidence does not support glycolysis disruption as a primary mechanism for the motility defects observed in Ankrd5-null sperm. This misinterpretation likely arose from the reviewer's overinterpretation of non-significant proteomic trends. We request that this specific claim be excluded from the assessment to avoid misleading readers.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Cryo-ET Data Limitations: The structural analysis of the DMT lacks clarity on how ANKRD5 influences NDRC or RS3. The low quality of RS3 data hinders the interpretation of ANKRD5's impact on axoneme structure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tried to further calculate the DMT at 96nm period using the present data to analyze the effect of ANKRD5 deletion on RS and N-DRC, however, due to the heterogeneity of the data, we were only able to obtain DMT at 8nm period (we have added a figure in the supplementary material for presentation). And in the process of obtaining DMT with a period of 8nm, we throw away about 90% of the particles (some are misaligned particles, some are deformed particles). Although we were not able to obtain the structure of 96nm repeats DMT, we noticed the enhanced heterogeneity of DMT caused by ANKRD5 knockout, as shown by the 3D classification and other results of the new supplementary images (Fig. S9), and the graphic description was added in the original article.</p>
<p>We have changed the description in the text: &quot;During particle picking of DMT fibers, we observed that transverse sections of axonemal DMT particles from ANKRD5-KO sperm differ markedly from those in WT sperm. Although both A- and B-tubes were visible in both samples, the DMTs in ANKRD5-KO sperm showed a more irregular profile. In WT sperm, DMTs typically appeared circular, whereas ANKRD5-KO DMTs seemed to be extruded as polygonal. (Fig. S9B,D). Notably, ANKRD5-KO DMTs seemed partially open at the junction between the A- and B-tubes (Fig. S9B,D).</p>
<p>During the STA process, many particles were misaligned or deformed in the classification results, revealing various degrees of deformation—particularly affecting the B-tube (Fig. S9E). We could retain only ~10% of the DMT particles to obtain the final density map for ANKRD5-KO sperm (Fig. S9E), whereas ~70% were usable in WT dataset as reported previously [59]. The mutant DMT density map also displayed roughness at its periphery, indicating substantial structural heterogeneity (Fig. S9E). Even after discarding a large fraction of deformed particles, the final density map still showed evident artifacts, implying that although the mutant DMT preserves the fundamental features of both tubes, its shape is highly heterogeneous (Fig. S9E). Furthermore, attempts to classify the 96-nm repeats did not yield a clear density for radial spokes (RSs) (Fig. S9F), indicating that ANKRD5 deficiency may affect the stability of other accessory structures, such as RSs [23，24，25]. In the raw tomograms, RSs in ANKRD5-KO sperm appeared less regularly arranged than those in WT (Fig. S9A and C).</p>
<p>Most recently, following the submission of this work, ANKRD5 was reported to localize at the head of the N-DRC, simultaneously binding DRC11, DRC7, DRC4, and DRC5 [46]. This structural insight agrees with our in vitro findings that ANKRD5 interacts with DRC4 and DRC5 (Fig. 8C-F). However, that study used isolated and purified DMT samples, leaving the precise positioning of ANKRD5 between adjacent axonemal DMTs unconfirmed. We therefore fitted the published structure (PDB entry: 9FQR) into the in situ DMT structure of mouse sperm 96-nm repeats (EMD-27444), revealing that ANKRD5 lies a mere ~3 nm from the adjacent DMT (Fig. 8G). Notably, the N-DRC is often likened to a &quot;car bumper&quot;, buffering two neighboring DMTs during vigorous axonemal motion. Given the extensive DMT deformation observed in our cryo-ET data (Fig. S9E), we propose that ANKRD5 contributes to this buffering function at the N-DRC. The loss of ANKRD5 may weaken the &quot;bumper&quot; effect and consequently increase structural damage to adjacent DMTs under intense conditions, while also compromising the stability of associated DMT accessory structures [19，46，60].&quot;</p>

<p>Although the loss of ANKRD5 did not affect the density of DMT itself in A Tube and B Tube, we found that DMT particles were not smooth in the original tomogram. We speculate that the loss of ANKRD5, a component of the N-DRC that is close to the neighboring DMT, may reduce the interaction between N-DRC and the neighboring DMT, resulting in uneven force on the axoneme during sperm swimming, which may limit our ability to obtain the average structure of the more dynamic components (RS, N-DRC, ODA, IDA). Therefore, when trying to classify 96nm repeat DMT, we could only see the density of suspected RS3 and RS2, but it was difficult to obtain the complete 96nm repeat DMT density, so that we could not further analyze the effect of ANKRD5 deletion on RS and N-DRC. To test this conjecture, we further classified the density of suspected RS3, and the results obtained exhibited a variety of mixed states (which have been added to the supplementary material). To avoid confusion, we have already removed the discussion of RS3 and the related images from the original text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The cryo-ET data on the internal structure of the DMT seems to have limited relevance to the N-DRC complex. Additionally, the quality of the RS3 data appears suboptimal, making it difficult to understand how the absence of ANKRD5 influences RS3. Further refinement of the data or alternative approaches may be needed to address this question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your suggestions. For the 96 nm periodic DMT, we have conducted multiple rounds of classification, including applying different masks at the positions of ODA, RS, and DMT. We have also tried classifying with both a single reference and multiple references. However, we were unable to obtain a suitable 96 nm periodic DMT. Regarding the heterogeneity of the particles, we have added a discussion in the manuscript. Following your advice, we have reanalyzed the data, but unfortunately, we still could not further optimize the experimental results.</p>
<p>In the process of obtaining the 8 nm periodic DMT, we discarded approximately 90 percent of the particles through multiple rounds of classification and alignment, in order to obtain high-quality 8 nm periodic DMT. We classified the remaining particles and found that the densities of RS3 and RS2 were not in their normal states. RS3 might be a mixture of different states of RS3, which makes it difficult for us to further discuss the effects of ANKRD5 on RS3.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, we have already removed the discussion of RS3 and the related images from the original text.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of ANKRD5 deficiency, we speculate that as the head of the N-DRC, its absence might affect the interaction between the N-DRC and the adjacent DMT, thereby influencing the forces experienced by the DMT during sperm movement. The uneven and irregular forces on the nine pairs of DMTs do not affect the structure of the A and B tubes of the DMT itself, but result in some heterogeneity in the peripheral microtubule parts of the DMT particles. We have added a discussion on these hypotheses in the manuscript. In addition, our 3D classification results demonstrate the structural heterogeneity of DMT caused by ANKRD5 knockdown. We have changed the description in the text:&quot;During particle picking of DMT fibers, we observed that transverse sections of axonemal DMT particles from ANKRD5-KO sperm differ markedly from those in WT sperm. Although both A- and B-tubes were visible in both samples, the DMTs in ANKRD5-KO sperm showed a more irregular profile. In WT sperm, DMTs typically appeared circular, whereas ANKRD5-KO DMTs seemed to be extruded as polygonal. (Fig. S9B,D). Notably, ANKRD5-KO DMTs seemed partially open at the junction between the A- and B-tubes (Fig. S9B,D).</p>
<p>During the STA process, many particles were misaligned or deformed in the classification results, revealing various degrees of deformation—particularly affecting the B-tube (Figure 9, Fig. S9E). We could retain only ~10% of the DMT particles to obtain the final density map for ANKRD5-KO sperm (Fig. S9E), whereas ~70% were usable in WT dataset as reported previously [59]. The mutant DMT density map also displayed roughness at its periphery, indicating substantial structural heterogeneity (Fig. S9E). Even after discarding a large fraction of deformed particles, the final density map still showed evident artifacts, implying that although the mutant DMT preserves the fundamental features of both tubes, its shape is highly heterogeneous (Fig. S9E). Furthermore, attempts to classify the 96-nm repeats did not yield a clear density for radial spokes (RSs) (Fig. S9F), indicating that ANKRD5 deficiency may affect the stability of other accessory structures, such as RSs [23，24，25]. In the raw tomograms, RSs in ANKRD5-KO sperm appeared less regularly arranged than those in WT (Fig. S9A and C).</p>
<p>Most recently, following the submission of this work, ANKRD5 was reported to localize at the head of the N-DRC, simultaneously binding DRC11, DRC7, DRC4, and DRC5 [46]. This structural insight agrees with our in vitro findings that ANKRD5 interacts with DRC4 and DRC5 (Fig. 8C-F). However, that study used isolated and purified DMT samples, leaving the precise positioning of ANKRD5 between adjacent axonemal DMTs unconfirmed. We therefore fitted the published structure (PDB entry: 9FQR) into the in situ DMT structure of mouse sperm 96-nm repeats (EMD-27444), revealing that ANKRD5 lies a mere ~3 nm from the adjacent DMT (Fig. 8G). Notably, the N-DRC is often likened to a &quot;car bumper&quot;, buffering two neighboring DMTs during vigorous axonemal motion. Given the extensive DMT deformation observed in our cryo-ET data (Fig. S9E), we propose that ANKRD5 contributes to this buffering function at the N-DRC. The loss of ANKRD5 may weaken the &quot;bumper&quot; effect and consequently increase structural damage to adjacent DMTs under intense conditions, while also compromising the stability of associated DMT accessory structures [19，46，60].&quot;</p>
<p>To further enhance the readability of our manuscript, we created a Graphic Abstract to visually illustrate the biological functions of ANKRD5. The figure is placed immediately after the Abstract section and has been designated as Figure 9.</p>
