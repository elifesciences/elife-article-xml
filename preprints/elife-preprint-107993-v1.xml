<abstract>
<p>Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a common consequence of right-hemisphere stroke, traditionally attributed to structural lesions and dysfunctional attention networks. However, the brain is fundamentally a rhythmic and dynamical system, and how disrupted neural synchronization underlies USN remains unknown. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs; 3 - 30 Hz flicker) in stroke patients with USN, without USN, and healthy controls. Only the USN group exhibited significant hemispheric asymmetry at 9 Hz, driven by exaggerated responses in the intact hemisphere rather than suppression in the lesioned hemisphere. This effect appeared only during stimulation, not at rest, indicating its specificity to sensory processing. The enhanced 9 Hz entrainment in the intact hemisphere was accompanied by increased phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) between alpha phase and gamma amplitude, reflecting systematic coordination of high-frequency activity. Transfer entropy analysis further revealed increased feedforward information flow from the right visual to the left frontal cortex, highlighting large-scale asymmetry. To explore the mechanism underlying this frequency-specific bias, we implemented a coupled-oscillator model. The model showed that the hemispheric asymmetry arises from resonance between intrinsic alpha rhythms and external input, amplified by asymmetric right-to-left interhemispheric coupling. These findings suggest that USN arises from a selective impairment of alpha-band synchrony capacity. This study offers a novel framework conceptualizing USN as a disorder of disrupted oscillatory dynamics underlying spatial attention, and points toward frequency-specific neuromodulatory intervention as a potential therapeutic approach.</p>

<title>Significant statement</title>
<p>The brain behaves as a metronome-like oscillator ensemble. When a rhythmic flicker—a cortical “tuning fork” matching the visual system’s intrinsic alpha frequency—is applied, it serves as a probe that visualizes the brain’s internal state. Under normal conditions, neuronal oscillations in both hemispheres are moderately entrained at this frequency. In unilateral spatial neglect (USN), this resonance displays a distinctive asymmetry: the intact hemisphere becomes over-amplified, whereas the lesioned hemisphere shows no enhancement. A coupled-oscillator model shows that asymmetric interhemispheric coupling selectively boosts this intrinsic alpha resonance unilaterally. This biased resonance reflects a destabilization of the dynamic coordination of attention networks, offering a novel mechanistic view of spatial neglect in USN and pointing toward frequency-specific neuromodulation as a promising therapeutic strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Left unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a neurological disorder in which patients fail to perceive stimuli on the left side of space despite an intact visual field. This condition is associated with damage to the right dorsal attention network, particularly the right inferior parietal lobule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), and the superior temporal gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), as well as disconnection in occipital and frontal white matter pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The dorsal attention network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), which includes the frontal eye fields and bilateral parietal sulci, encodes spatial maps of the contralateral visual field in each hemisphere. These maps are typically balanced through reciprocal inhibitory interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Disruption of this network leads to hyperactivity of the structurally intact left hemispheric circuits, which influences bottom-up sensory responses and causes a rightward bias in perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>
<p>Traditionally, USN has been understood in terms of structural or static disconnection. However, the brain is fundamentally a dynamical and frequency-organized system, and neural oscillations, generated by the synchronized activity of neuronal populations, are a key mechanism for temporally coordinating information flow across brain regions. Indeed, neural oscillations flexibly regulate sensory and attentional processing by dynamically adjusting intrinsic and stimulus-driven phase relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). From this perspective, USN may not only involve anatomical disconnection but also an imbalance in the hemispheric capacity for oscillatory synchronization. Yet, despite the critical role of rhythmic synchronization in brain function, such frequency-specific asymmetries have not been systematically investigated in USN.</p>
<p>To address this, we employed steady-state evoked responses (SSERs) to visual stimuli as a probe to visualize the brain’s frequency-dependent synchronization capacity. SSERs are elicited by rhythmic sensory stimulation and reflect neural entrainment—the periodic alignment of endogenous oscillations to external input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). This response is strongest when the stimulus frequency matches the system’s intrinsic resonance frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Moreover, prior studies have shown frequency-specific reductions in SSERs, both visual and auditory, in individuals with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Consequently, SSER abnormalities may reflect impairments in underlying oscillatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>In this study, we presented 3–30 Hz flickering stimuli and recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in stroke patients with and without USN, as well as in healthy controls. None of the patients exhibited clinically evident hemianopsia, and early-stage visual responses in the lesioned hemisphere were not expected to be significantly impaired. These factors minimized the possibility that observed differences could stem from low-level visual deficits. We hypothesized that frequency-specific entrainment of neural oscillations would be selectively disrupted in one hemisphere, resulting in an interhemispheric imbalance in USN. Furthermore, motivated by the empirical asymmetry, we developed a computational model of coupled neural oscillators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) to test which factors could account for the emergence of frequency-specific differences in oscillatory responses.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The study consisted of three groups: USN patients (n = 21), stroke patients without USN (n = 38), and healthy control participants (n = 17). We recruited patients who had been admitted to the Kaifukuki (convalescent) Rehabilitation Ward of Morinomiya Hospital. The inclusion criteria for stroke patients were: (1) male, (2) first-episode stroke, and (3) right hemisphere cortical/subcortical infarction (representative lesions shown in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>), without clinically evident hemianopsia evaluated by the confrontation method. While lesions partially extended to the posterior region in two patients, they exhibited preserved neurophysiological responses to light stimulation, and were therefore included in the analysis. For healthy participants, the inclusion criteria were: (1) male to match the patient group, (2) no history of stroke, and (3) full scores on all neuropsychological assessments. All participants provided written informed consent. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of RIKEN, the National Institutes of Natural Sciences, and Morinomiya Hospital.</p>

<title>Clinical assessment of stroke</title>
<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) measurements and clinical assessments were performed by trained investigators approximately 1 month after stroke onset. The diagnosis of USN was comprehensively determined by the attending physician based on regular clinical examinations, including the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Motor impairment was assessed using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity (FMA-UE) and lower extremity (FMA-LE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), and activities of daily living were assessed using the Functional Independence Measure motor (FIM-M) and cognitive (FIM-C) scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). All clinical assessments were performed by trained healthcare professionals before EEG analysis, so the evaluators were blind to the EEG analysis results. For all scales, a lower score indicates greater disability. To match the severity of the USN and non-USN groups, we selected 21 non-USN patients in ascending order of the Mahalanobis square distance, <italic>d<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>, to the USN patient within a four-dimensional space of the clinical score:

<title>Experimental Design</title>
<p>EEG was recorded from 19 Ag/AgCl electrodes in the 10-20 system configuration using a NeuroFax EEG 1224 system (Nihon Kohden, Tokyo, Japan; sampling rate: 500 Hz; bandpass filter: 0.53–120 Hz; ground electrode: forehead; reference: left earlobe). Visual stimulation was delivered under an eyes-closed resting condition to minimize blink artifacts and reduce direct exposure to the high-intensity strobe light. A strobe light flickered at frequencies ranging from 3 to 30 Hz in 3-Hz steps. Each frequency flicker stimulus was presented for 10 s with a 10-s interval (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Preprocessing</title>
<p>The EEG signals were first re-referenced offline to the average of the right and left earlobe signals. We applied wavelet-enhanced independent component analysis (wICA) to eliminate intermittent high-amplitude artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This method decomposes the EEG signals into independent components (ICs), and a discrete wavelet transform is applied to each IC. Wavelet coefficients defined as artifacts based on the level-dependent threshold of the wavelet decomposition are zeroed, and artifact-free ICs are extracted from the inverse wavelet transform on this result. Thus, the entire IC, which contains a significant amount of neural signals, need not be excluded, as in the case of conventional ICA denoising.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)</title>
<p>To evaluate the neural response during the flickering stimulation, the frequency power spectrum for each stimulus condition was obtained using the Fourier transform (Hanning window, frequency range: 1–35 Hz). The Fourier transform was applied to the data with a 1-s window during the 10-s flicker interval and averaged for each stimulus frequency condition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC)</title>
<p>We evaluated PAC using the modulation index (MI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) to determine how high-frequency oscillations are co-modulated by a low-frequency phase when neural oscillations are entrained to rhythmic external stimuli. Instantaneous phase and amplitude were extracted via wavelet transform at the center frequency, <italic>f</italic>, and time, <italic>t</italic>, with the standard deviation (SD), <italic>σ<sub>f</sub> = 4f/m</italic>, <italic>σ<sub>t</sub> = m/2</italic>π<italic>f</italic>, and constant, <italic>m,</italic> set to 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We focused on the PAC between the alpha (6–12 Hz) phase and the gamma (30–55 Hz) amplitude for 10 s during the 9-Hz flickering stimulus.</p>
<p>To derive the MI for each frequency pair of α phase and γ amplitude, the given α frequency phase was divided into 20 bins, and the mean γ amplitude in each bin was calculated. This provided a phase-amplitude distribution for each frequency pair, and the MI was obtained according to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the observed distribution and the circular uniform distribution. An MI of 0 indicates that the amplitudes are the same for all phase bins (i.e., a circular uniform distribution) and that there is zero PAC, whereas an MI of 1 indicates maximum coupling.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Transfer entropy (TE)</title>
<p>To quantitatively investigate the direction and strength of information transfer between brain regions in response to flickering stimuli, we performed TE analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). After applying an 8.5–9.5 Hz FIR bandpass filter to the EEG responses to 9-Hz flickering stimuli, we extracted the instantaneous amplitude from the analytic signal using the Hilbert transform. TE was calculated for all pairs of electrodes for these amplitude data during the flickering stimulus interval. To estimate the probability distributions required for TE calculation, we generated histograms for the amplitude data, with bin sizes according to Sturges’ rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). <italic>T<sub>Y→X</sub></italic>quantifies the extent to which knowledge of the state of system <italic>Y</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> contributes to predicting the one-step future state of system <italic>X</italic> at time <italic>t+τ</italic>, beyond the predictability provided by the state of <italic>X</italic> at time <italic>t</italic> alone. The formula for TE is given by:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="619765v3_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>+<italic>τ</italic></sub>, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) denotes the joint probability of observing the future state of <italic>X</italic> at time <italic>t+τ</italic> along with the states of <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> at time <italic>t.</italic> Here, <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> represent the observed data derived from the systems <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>, respectively. The terms <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>+<italic>τ</italic></sub>|<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>, <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic>+<italic>τ</italic></sub>|<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>) denote the conditional probabilities of the one-step future state of <italic>X,</italic> given its state at time <italic>t</italic> with and without considering the state of <italic>Y</italic> at time <italic>t</italic>.</p>
<p>In this analysis, amplitude data from the first 0.5 s of the flickering stimulus interval were used as past observations, <italic>x<sub>t</sub></italic>, <italic>y<sub>t</sub></italic>, and amplitude data from one sample ahead in time were used as future observations, <italic>x<sub>t+τ</sub></italic>. TE was calculated by varying the delay, <italic>τ</italic>, from 0 to 5 s in 0.1-s steps. The optimal delay <italic>τ</italic> was determined as the value that maximized <italic>T</italic>(<italic>τ</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>To statistically test for differences in SSVEP between the left and right hemispheres, we used a linear mixed model with hemisphere (left and right), flicker frequency (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 Hz), and group (USN patients, non-USN patients, and healthy controls) as fixed factors and subjects as random factors, with the exclusion of outliers 1.5 times over the interquartile range.</p>
<p>To statistically test for differences in PAC between the left and right hemispheres, we performed a cluster-based permutation test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The MI was calculated for each permutation dataset generated by random reassignment of O1 and O2 electrode labels. For each permutation, clusters were identified from adjacent data points showing statistically significant hemispheric differences in MI, and the sum of the <italic>t</italic>-values within these clusters was determined as a cluster-level statistic. Only the largest value of the cluster-level statistic obtained for each permutation was selected, and this procedure was repeated 1000 times to construct the distribution of the cluster-level statistic under the null hypothesis. A cluster of hemispheric differences in the original data was considered statistically significant if it exceeded the 95th percentile of this distribution.</p>

<title>The coupled phase oscillator model</title>
<p>To investigate potential mechanisms underlying our experimental findings, we employed the Kuramoto model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) as a theoretical framework for neural synchronization. The model consists of bilateral coupled phase oscillators and an external periodic force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). Two coupled populations of oscillators (<italic>N</italic> = 50 each) are represented by phase vectors <bold><italic>Φ</italic><sub>L</sub></bold>= (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>L,1</sub>, …, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>L,n</sub>) and <bold><italic>Φ</italic><sub>R</sub></bold> = (<italic>ϕ</italic><sub>R,1</sub>, …, <italic>ϕ</italic><sub>R,n</sub>) for the left and right hemispheres, respectively. The dynamics of each oscillator are given by:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="619765v3_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The natural frequencies <italic>ω<sub>h,i</sub></italic> follow a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 9 Hz and a standard deviation of 2 Hz. In one configuration, we set the mean natural frequency of the right hemisphere to 7 Hz to examine the effect of altered intrinsic frequency in the affected hemisphere. The intrahemispheric coupling <italic>H</italic><sub>intra</sub> and interhemispheric coupling <italic>H</italic><sub>inter</sub> terms are defined as:

<title>SSVEP power in the affected hemisphere</title>
<p>To confirm the visual cortex of the affected (right) hemisphere could respond to visual stimuli, we plotted SSVEP power at the O2 electrode as a function of the flicker and response frequencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).

<title>Hyperactivity of the intact hemisphere</title>

<title>Hemispheric imbalance of PAC</title>
<p>We investigated PAC given that higher frequency oscillations may be cooperatively modulated when neural oscillations are entrained by rhythmic external stimuli. PAC was assessed using the MI for 9-Hz flickering stimuli (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). We hypothesized that the intact left hemisphere, which showed enhanced SSVEP, would exhibit stronger PAC. Thus, we performed a cluster-based permutation test to examine hemispheric differences. Results showed a significant hemispheric bias in PAC between the alpha (7–12 Hz) phase and gamma (35–45 Hz) amplitude in the USN group.

<title>Hemispheric imbalance of TE</title>
<p>In USN and non-USN patients with right hemisphere damage, we aimed to clarify how information is transferred from the responsive visual cortex to other brain regions. Here, we used TE to examine the pattern of information transfer from the O1 and O2 electrodes to the left and right frontal electrodes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Results showed that in the USN group, there was significantly greater information flow from the right visual area (O2 electrode) than from the left visual area (O1 electrode) to the intact left frontal areas (<italic>t</italic> = −2.7, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, paired <italic>t</italic>-test).

<title>Hemispheric Imbalance in Model Simulations</title>
<p>To explain the observed hemispheric imbalance in USN patients (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, middle), we explored three potential mechanisms using a computational model. From a base configuration (<italic>ω<sub>L</sub>= ω<sub>R</sub>=</italic> 9±2 Hz, <italic>K<sub>L</sub> = K<sub>R</sub> = K<sub>L➔R</sub> = K<sub>R➔L</sub></italic> = 0.2), we modified specific parameters. In the first configuration, we introduced asymmetric interhemispheric coupling (<italic>K<sub>R➔L</sub></italic> = 0.8). This configuration most closely reproduced our experimental findings, showing a significant hemispheric bias specifically at 9 Hz (p &lt; 0.05, FDR corrected), while maintaining balanced responses at other frequencies (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>). In the second configuration, we increased intrahemispheric coupling strength in the intact hemisphere (<italic>K<sub>L</sub></italic> = 0.8) while maintaining the baseline coupling in the affected hemisphere (<italic>K<sub>R</sub></italic> = 0.2), based on our experimental observation of enhanced activity specifically in the intact hemisphere. This resulted in a persistent left hemispheric bias across frequencies, with a particularly pronounced effect at 9 Hz (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B</xref>). In the third configuration, we set different natural frequencies by lowering the right hemisphere (ω<sub>R</sub> = 7 Hz). This configuration showed a significant right hemispheric bias at 6 Hz, close to the natural frequency of the right hemisphere, and a left hemispheric bias at 9 Hz (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). Notably, when we removed the external periodic force in the first configuration, no hemispheric bias was observed (see red bar in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>), indicating that the asymmetric coupling manifests its effects only through interaction with external stimulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our experiments revealed that while SSVEPs can be reliably elicited by flickering stimuli at various frequencies, only the USN group exhibited a significant hemispheric difference in SSVEP at 9 Hz. The computational model demonstrated that this hemispheric bias could arise from both the resonance between intrinsic and stimulus frequencies and stronger right-to-left interhemispheric coupling. In contrast to the healthy control group, this difference was attributed to an increase in activity within the intact hemisphere rather than a decrease in the affected hemisphere. The enhanced response in the intact hemisphere was accompanied by increased phase-amplitude coupling between alpha and gamma oscillations, suggesting that the entrained alpha oscillations systematically modulated local high-frequency neural activity. Furthermore, the increased information flow from the right visual cortex to the left frontal cortex revealed by TE analysis is consistent with the model predictions, and these results indicate an imbalance in information flow between hemispheres in addition to changes in local activity.</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Alpha frequency-specific hemispheric bias and entrainment in USN patients</title>
<p>We observed hemispheric bias in entrainment to flickering stimuli in USN patients in the alpha band, which corresponds to the natural frequency of the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The entrainment of the oscillatory system to an external stimulus is caused by the periodic phase shift of neural oscillations to the delivered pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). At the EEG level, this is expressed as an increase in amplitude at the stimulus frequency as multiple oscillators begin to cycle in synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, entrainment is particularly effective when the stimulation period closely matches the oscillator’s natural frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). This principle also applies to neural oscillations: rhythmic stimulation at frequencies that resonate with physiological rhythms influences cognitive and neural function by synchronizing task-related oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Our previous research demonstrated that entrainment is most effective when the stimulation frequency closely matches the individual alpha frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). We also observed that different brain regions have distinct natural frequencies, with entrainment being most pronounced in the alpha band in the visual cortex. Therefore, the observed bias in the 9-Hz frequency-specific SSVEP in USN patients does not merely reflect a hemispheric difference in evoked visual responses to rhythmic external stimuli but, rather, a bias in the synchronous function of intrinsic neural oscillators in the visual area at a specific frequency band (i.e., the alpha band).</p>
<p>Our computational model provides a theoretical framework for understanding these hemispheric differences. Among the three potential mechanisms explored, the model with asymmetric interhemispheric coupling (<italic>K<sub>R→L</sub> &gt; K<sub>L→R</sub></italic>) best reproduced the frequency-specific hemispheric bias observed in our experiments. While the coupling parameter <italic>K</italic> in our phase oscillator model simply determines the strength of phase synchronization between hemispheres, this asymmetry might reflect the underlying imbalance in interhemispheric inhibition. Indeed, paired-pulse TMS studies have directly demonstrated enhanced inhibitory influence from the intact to the affected hemisphere in stroke patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). This interhemispheric imbalance has been further supported by evidence of altered functional connectivity and hyperexcitability in the intact hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>
<p>In this model, both hemispheres with a natural frequency of 9 Hz resonate with stimulation at the same frequency, but due to the stronger right-to-left coupling, the resonant response in the right hemisphere more strongly drives oscillations in the left hemisphere. This suggests that the hemispheric bias observed in USN patients is driven by asymmetric interhemispheric coupling of neural networks underlying alpha oscillations. This model prediction also aligns with our experimental observation of enhanced transfer entropy from the right visual cortex to the left frontal areas in USN patients.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it demonstrates that while the system maintains balanced activity between hemispheres in the absence of external stimulation, the underlying asymmetry becomes apparent with external input. This explains why spontaneous alpha oscillations remain normal despite the emergence of a specific bias in response to 9 Hz stimulation, providing a theoretical basis for why USN symptoms become more pronounced during sensory processing and attentional demands.</p>

<title>Local hemispheric bias of entrainment and attentional dysfunction in USN patients</title>
<p>Hyperactivity of the SSVEP and PAC in the left visual cortex in stroke patients may result from a lack of hemispheric reciprocal inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). This scenario is consistent with the concept that in USN, decreased inhibition from the affected right hemisphere causes overactivity of the visual cortex within the intact left hemisphere, which results in a left hemisphere bias in visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). However, the hemispheric bias observed in the present study was frequency-specific and was not observed in non-USN patients (who also had right hemisphere damage), suggesting that it may reflect not only the overactivity of the visual cortex but also alterations in the neural networks’ capacity to synchronize with external stimuli at specific frequencies. The entrainment of neural oscillations to external stimuli is achieved via consistent phase alignment, which, in turn, systematically influences the timing of the higher frequency components of neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). This is evidenced by our observation of enhanced PAC between alpha phase and gamma amplitude in the intact hemisphere of USN patients, suggesting a systematic modulation of high-frequency activity by the entrained alpha oscillations.</p>
<p>This phase coordination is influenced by both external factors and internal processes, such as attention in anticipatory contexts. Attention adjusts the temporal sequence of excitatory and inhibitory phases in neural oscillations, thereby influencing perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Given the importance of alpha-band oscillations in attentional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), the hemispheric bias in oscillatory synchrony observed in USN patients may reflect critical abnormalities in cortical excitability coordination. Therefore, the hemispheric bias in synchronization capacity at frequencies relevant to attention likely disrupts the coordinated oscillatory activity necessary for balanced spatial attention processing. This may contribute to the attentional deficits observed in patients with USN.</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>Biased information transfer in USN patients</title>
<p>Locally, the USN group showed a higher SSVEP and greater PAC in the left visual cortex, whereas TE from the right visual cortex to the left frontal cortex was higher than TE from the left visual cortex to the left frontal cortex. Given that right frontal damage is one of the common causes of USN, this difference may be an adaptive neural response to maintain hemispheric communication and compensate for attentional dysfunction. Specifically, input from the right visual cortex may bypass the affected right frontal cortex to enable enhanced information flow to the intact left frontal cortex, thereby supporting attentional functions. This compensatory strategy of increased information flow is consistent with functional imaging study findings on the reorganization of functional networks following stroke; moreover, it supports the idea of neuroplasticity, whereby patients can recover functions and maintain cognitive abilities following neurological injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct neural responses in non-USN and USN patients</title>
<p>Although both the non-USN and USN groups had right hemisphere damage, they exhibited distinct neural responses to alpha-band rhythmic stimulation. In non-USN patients, additional neural resources were recruited from both hemispheres in response to the damage in the right hemisphere, resulting in enhanced neural synchronization to external stimuli across both hemispheres. In contrast, the neural responses in USN patients are more asymmetric, with a local increase in alpha-band SSVEP primarily observed in the intact left visual cortex. This asymmetry may result from the damaged right hemisphere being less effectively engaged, leading to an over-reliance on the left hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). This suggests that the right hemisphere damage in USN patients might affect more critical parts of the attentional network.</p>
<p>In non-USN patients, the observed bilateral enhancement of alpha-band synchrony likely reflects a compensatory recruitment of residual right-hemisphere circuits that are still able to cooperate with the intact left hemisphere. Neuroimaging studies have reported that patients who show this kind of bilateral reorganization pattern early after stroke tend to achieve better recovery outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Thus, the bilateral pattern seen in the non-USN group may correspond to such a favorable reorganization profile, and we propose that engaging both hemispheres in parallel helps maintain frequency-specific rhythm coordination and protects against the development of spatial neglect.</p>
<p>Importantly, this distinct pattern of hemispheric imbalance cannot be explained merely by differences in lesion extent between USN and non-USN patients. While patients with USN may have larger lesions than those without USN, such differences alone would predict generalized alterations in neural responses across all frequencies in the affected hemisphere. However, our results demonstrate a highly specific effect: the hemispheric imbalance is observed exclusively at 9 Hz, while responses to other frequencies remain balanced between the hemispheres. This frequency specificity, coinciding with the intrinsic alpha frequency of the visual system, suggests a more complex mechanism involving the selective disruption of oscillatory networks, rather than a simple consequence of lesion size. This interpretation is supported by our computational model, which demonstrates how the interaction between intrinsic frequency and asymmetric coupling can produce such frequency-specific effects.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although right-hemisphere alpha-band SSVEP power did not differ significantly between the USN group and healthy controls, it showed a significant positive correlation with BIT scores within the USN group. This result indicates that, even when the quantitative power of right-hemisphere alpha oscillations appears normal, their qualitative contribution to the spatial-attention network is altered in USN. Such a qualitative dissociation, together with compensatory hyperactivity in the intact left hemisphere and a rerouting of information flow from the right visual cortex to the left frontal cortex, likely skews the overall balance of spatial attention. The interplay among these quantitative factors, and between these dynamics and their behavioral consequences, is probably nonlinear, and the present data cannot fully unravel their complex interactions; nevertheless, the principle that “normal power ≠ normal function” strongly suggests that USN arises from a qualitative breakdown in rhythm coordination, offering a new perspective on the neural basis of unilateral spatial neglect.</p>

<sec id="s4e">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations that must be acknowledged. First, although we revealed a 9-Hz-specific hemispheric bias in USN, the study does not pinpoint where within the cortical network the abnormal synchrony originates. Higher spatial-resolution techniques, such as magnetoencephalography or high-density intracranial recordings, could map the generators and propagation pathways of alpha-band entrainment more precisely and thus identify the circuit nodes in which synchrony breaks down. Second, the precise extent and topography of brain lesions could not be fully homogenized across patients. Differences in cortical versus subcortical involvement or the degree of white-matter disruption may influence oscillatory responses. Future work with a larger cohort—encompassing a broader range of lesion characteristics—will be necessary to combine detailed lesion mapping with frequency-resolved measures of neural synchrony. Third, the cross-sectional design precludes definitive causal inferences. Longitudinal studies that track changes in alpha-band asymmetry and behavioral recovery over time, or before and after rehabilitation interventions, will be essential to determine how dynamic reorganization of neural synchrony relates to the evolution and remediation of spatial neglect.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates fundamental differences in neural responses between stroke patients with USN and without USN. Empirical data and computational modeling together show that asymmetric interhemispheric coupling, resonating with the brain’s intrinsic alpha rhythm, selectively amplifies 9-Hz entrainment in the intact hemisphere of USN patients. This amplification is accompanied by stronger α–γ phase–amplitude coupling and asymmetric information flow, indicating that the effect propagates beyond local oscillations to reconfigure cross-frequency interactions and large-scale network dynamics. Thus, USN can be regarded as a disorder in which a qualitative breakdown of alpha-band rhythm coordination destabilizes the dynamic equilibrium of the attention network. Longitudinal studies that track the plastic evolution of these synchrony patterns during recovery and refine frequency-specific neuromodulation strategies will be crucial for translating these insights into therapy.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study uses EEG and computational modeling to investigate hemispheric oscillatory asymmetries in unilateral spatial neglect. The work benefits from rare patient data and a careful multimethod approach. However, the evidence is <bold>incomplete</bold> because key assumptions about alpha‑band entrainment and methodological confounds such as lesion variability and eye‑movement artifacts remain insufficiently addressed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Okazaki et al. showed flickering stimuli to patients with unilateral spatial neglect (USN) and measured EEG responses. They compared this with another patient group (post-stroke, but no USN) and healthy controls. The author's rationale was to entrain intrinsic brain rhythms using the flicker of different frequencies (3-30 Hz). Effects found unique to the 9-Hz stimulation condition differentiate USN patients from the other groups, leading them to conclude that USN can be characterized by increased hemispheric alpha asymmetry, driven by a relatively increased response in the intact hemisphere.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is principled empirical work that benefits from access to special patient groups of considerable size (about 60 stroke patients in total, and 20 USN). The authors use state-of-the-art established methods to (1) deliver and (2) quantify the responses to the flicker stimulation in the EEG recordings. In addition, they use phase-coupling measures to investigate cross-frequency coupling (here: alpha-gamma) and a measure of directed connectivity between brain areas, transfer entropy. The results are supported by means of simulations using a coupled-oscillators model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In my eyes, the major conceptual weakness of the study is that the authors make the a priori assumption that the flicker stimulation entrains intrinsic brain rhythms, especially alpha (9 Hz). To date, there is no direct (and only equivocal indirect) evidence that alpha rhythms can be entrained with periodic visual stimulation. In the present study, the assumption of alpha entrainment permeates some analytical decisions - where it would be possible to separate stimulus-driven from intrinsic rhythms more strongly than is currently the case, potentially yielding deeper insights into the oscillopathy of USN - and, ultimately, the interpretation of the results. Another potential issue to consider here is the analysis of gamma rhythms in EEG data, absent a control of miniature eye movements, a known problem (Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.03.027">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2008.03.027</ext-link>) that may be exacerbated here, given that USN patients could show different auxiliary gaze behaviour.</p>

<p>This study investigates how altered neural oscillations may contribute to unilateral spatial neglect (USN) following right-hemisphere stroke. By combining steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs), phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), transfer entropy (TE), and computational modeling, the authors aim to show that USN arises from disrupted hemispheric synchronization dynamics rather than simply from lesion extent. The integration of empirical EEG data with a mechanistic model is a major strength and offers a valuable new perspective on how frequency-specific neural dynamics relate to clinical symptoms.</p>
<p>The work has several notable strengths. The combination of experimental and modeling approaches is innovative and powerful, and the findings provide a coherent mechanistic framework linking abnormal neural entrainment to attentional deficits. The study also provides concrete evidence to support the potential for frequency-specific neuromodulatory interventions, which could have translational relevance.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are areas where the evidence could be clarified or contextualized further. The manuscript would benefit from more detailed characterization of lesions, since differences in lesion topography (white vs. gray matter, occipital vs. parietal areas) could greatly improve our understanding of the physiopathology causing unilateral spatial neglect and the altered neural oscillations reported. Methodological choices, such as focusing analyses on occipital electrodes rather than parietal sites, and the potential influence of volume conduction in transfer entropy analyses, also need clearer justification/elaboration. In addition, while the authors report several neural metrics, it is not always clear why SSVEP power was chosen as the primary correlate of clinical severity over other measures. More broadly, the manuscript would be strengthened by clearer definitions of dependent variables and reporting of software and toolboxes used.</p>
<p>Overall, the study makes a significant contribution by demonstrating that USN can be conceptualized as a disorder of disrupted oscillatory dynamics. With some clarifications and expansions, the paper will provide readers with a clearer understanding of both the strengths and the limitations of the evidence, and it will stand as a valuable reference for future work on oscillatory mechanisms in stroke and attention.</p>

<p>Reviewer #1 expressed concern that alpha entrainment is assumed a priori; however, our interpretation is based on the empirical observation of frequency-specific (9 Hz) hemispheric asymmetry, not on a prior assumption. This 9 Hz specificity is difficult to explain by a simple summation of stimulus-evoked responses and is more appropriately interpreted as a resonance phenomenon in the alpha band, which is close to the intrinsic resonance frequency of the visual system [1, 2]. In the revision, we will strengthen the conceptual distinction between stimulus-driven and intrinsic components and clarify that entrainment is a conclusion supported by our data and modeling.</p>
<p>Gamma contamination by eye movements is a valid theoretical concern. However, it is unlikely that saccadic spike potentials explain our α-γ coupling findings, due to several factors including timing constraints and spectral properties. In the revision, we will add explicit discussion of this limitation while explaining why our coupling patterns are more consistent with physiological neural coupling than with artifacts.</p>

<p>We agree that further lesion characterization would be generally useful. However, as shown in Supplementary Figure 1, lesions in our USN cohort involved both cortical and subcortical regions, and cortical damage often extended into adjacent white matter. Therefore, a strict gray-versus-white-matter classification was not feasible. This anatomical diversity suggests that the frequency-specific hemispheric asymmetry observed here cannot be fully explained by lesion location or size alone, but rather may reflect altered network dynamics following right-hemisphere damage. We will clarify this point in the revised Discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding transfer entropy (TE) and volume conduction, TE is theoretically insensitive to zero-lag correlations and quantifies temporally directed information transfer. Furthermore, we used amplitude envelopes rather than raw oscillations as input, which should greatly reduce the risk of spurious causal estimation due to sinusoidal autocorrelation structure. Moreover, if such spurious connectivity due to autocorrelation had occurred, it would have been expected to appear equally in both feedforward and feedback directions. Therefore, the feedforward-limited (visual→frontal) asymmetry observed in our study cannot be explained by volume conduction or autocorrelation effects. We will maintain this position clearly in the revision.</p>
<p>Regarding other methodological points: we focused on occipital electrodes (O1/O2) because visual stimuli primarily drive the visual system (we also analyzed parietal sites but found no significant hemispheric differences; Figure 4). We chose SSVEP power for clinical correlation because it was the primary phenomenon distinguishing USN from non-USN patients. In the revision, we will clarify these points and include software and toolbox information.</p>
<p>We believe these revisions will substantially strengthen the manuscript and clarify the conceptual and methodological contributions of our study.</p>
