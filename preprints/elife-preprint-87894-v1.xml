<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Recognizing the early signs of cancer risk is vital for informing prevention, early detection, and survival. To investigate whether changes in circulating metabolites characterise the early stages of colorectal cancer (CRC) development, we examined associations between a genetic risk score (GRS) associated with CRC liability (72 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and 231 circulating metabolites measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N=6,221). Linear regression models were applied to examine associations between genetic liability to colorectal cancer and circulating metabolites measured in the same individuals at age 8, 16, 18 and 25 years. The GRS for CRC was associated with up to 28% of the circulating metabolites at FDR-P&lt;0.05 across all time points, particularly with higher fatty acids and very-low- and low-density lipoprotein subclass lipids. Two-sample reverse Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses investigating CRC liability (52,775 cases, 45,940 controls) and metabolites measured in a random subset of UK Biobank participants (N=118,466, median age 58y) revealed broadly consistent effect estimates with the GRS analysis. In conventional (forward) MR analyses, genetically predicted polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations were most strongly associated with higher CRC risk. These analyses suggest that higher genetic liability to CRC can cause early alterations in systemic metabolism, and suggest that fatty acids may play an important role in CRC development.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the fourth most common cause of death from cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> There is a genetic component to risk of the disease, which is thought to explain up to 35% of variability in CRC risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> In addition, modifiable lifestyle factors, including obesity, consumption of processed meat, and alcohol are thought to increase CRC risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> However, the underlying biological pathways remain unclear, which limits targeted prevention strategies. Whilst CRC has higher mortality rates when diagnosed at later stages, early-stage CRC or precancerous lesions are largely treatable, meaning colorectal cancer screening programmes have the potential to be highly effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> Due to the lack of known predictive biomarkers for CRC, wide-scale screening (if implemented at all) is expensive and often targeted crudely by age range. Identifying biomarkers predictive of CRC, or with causal roles in disease development, is therefore vital.</p>
<p>One potential source of biomarkers for CRC risk is the circulating metabolome, which offers a dynamic insight into cellular processes and disease states. It is increasingly clear from mechanistic studies that both systemic and intracellular tumour metabolism play an important role in CRC development and progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Interestingly, several major risk factors for CRC are known to have profound effects on metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> For instance, obesity has been shown via conventional observational and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to strongly alter circulating metabolite levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> This suggests that the circulating metabolome may play a mediating role in the relationship between at least some common risk factors, such as obesity, and CRC – or at least might be a useful biomarker for disease or intermediates thereof. Investigating the relationship between CRC and circulating metabolites may therefore provide powerful insights into the causal pathways underlying disease risk, or alternatively may be valuable in prediction and early diagnosis.</p>
<p>MR is a genetic epidemiological approach used to evaluate causal relationships between traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> This method uses genetic variation as a proxy measure for traits in an instrumental variable framework to assess the causal relevance of the traits in disease development. As germline genetic variants are theoretically randomised between generations and fixed at conception, this approach should be less prone to bias and confounding than conventional analyses undertaken in an observational context. Conventionally, MR is used to investigate the effect of an exposure on a disease outcome. In reverse MR, genetic instruments proxy the association between liability to a disease and other traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> This approach can identify biomarkers which cause the disease, are predictive for the disease, or have diagnostic potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Given the suspected importance of the circulating metabolome in CRC development, employing both reverse MR and conventional forward MR for metabolites in the same study may be an efficient approach for revealing causal and predictive biomarkers for CRC. Although previous observational studies have investigated associations between the circulating metabolome and CRC risk, these studies may have been influenced by confounding bias which should be less relevant to MR analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> Additionally, these studies focussed on adults, who commonly take medications which may confound metabolite associations, further complicating interpretations.</p>
<p>Here, we applied a reverse MR framework to identify circulating metabolites which are associated with CRC liability across different stages of the early life course (spanning childhood to young adulthood, when use of medications and CRC are both rare) using data from a birth cohort study. We then attempted to replicate these results using reverse two-sample MR in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults (UK Biobank). We then performed conventional ‘forward’ MR of metabolites onto CRC risk using large-scale cancer consortia data to identify metabolites which may have a causal role in CRC development.</p>

<title>Study populations</title>
<p>This study uses data from 2 cohort studies: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) offspring (generation 1) cohort (individual-level data) and the UK Biobank cohort (summary-level data); plus summary-level data from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of CRC comprising the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), Colorectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT), and Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR).</p>
<p>ALSPAC is a population-based birth cohort study in which 14,541 pregnant women with an expected delivery date between 1 April 1991 and 31 December 1992 were recruited from the former Avon County of southwest England.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> Since then, 13,988 offspring alive at one year have been followed repeatedly with questionnaire- and clinic-based assessments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of Bristol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies. Offspring genotype was assessed using the Illumina HumanHap550 quad chip platform. Quality control measures included exclusion of participants with sex mismatch, minimal or excessive heterozygosity, disproportionately missing data, insufficient sample replication, cryptic relatedness, and non-European ancestry. Imputation was performed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium (HRC) panel. Offspring were considered for the current analyses if they had no older siblings in ALSPAC (203 excluded) and were of white ethnicity (based on reports by parents, 604 excluded) to reduce the potential for confounding by genotype. Written informed consent was provided and ethical approval was obtained from the ALSPAC Law and Ethics Committee and the local research ethics committee. Consent for biological samples has been collected in accordance with the Human Tissue Act (2004). Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics was obtained from participants following the recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time. The study website contains details of all available data through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>UK Biobank is a population-based cohort study based in 22 centres across the UK.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> The cohort is made up of around 500,000 adults aged 40-80 years old, who were enrolled between 2006 and 2010. Genotyping data is available for 488,377 participants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Participants were genotyped using one of two arrays – either the Applied Biosystems UK BiLEVE Axiom Array by Affymetrix (now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific), or the closely related Applied Biosystems UK Biobank Axiom Array. Approaches based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were used to account for population structure. Individuals were excluded: if reported sex differed from inferred sex based on genotyping data; if they had sex chromosome karyotypes which were not XX or XY; if they were outliers in terms of heterozygosity and missing rates; or if they had high relatedness to another participant. Multiallelic SNPs or those with a minor allele frequency of below 1% were removed. Imputation was performed using the UK10K haplotype and HRC reference panels.</p>
<p>The GWAS meta-analysis for CRC included up to 52,775 cases and 45,940 controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> This sample excluded cases and controls from UK Biobank to avoid potential bias due to sample overlap which may be problematic in MR analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> Cases were diagnosed by a physician and recorded overall and by site (colon, 28,736 cases; proximal colon, 14,416 cases; distal colon, 12,879 cases; and rectal, 14,150 cases). Colon cancer included proximal colon (any primary tumour arising in the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, or transverse colon), distal colon (any primary tumour arising in the pleenic flexure, descending colon or sigmoid colon), and colon cases with unspecified site. Rectal cancer included any primary tumour arising in the rectum or rectosigmoid junction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Approximately 92% of participants in the overall CRC GWAS were white-European (∼8% were East Asian). All participants included in site-specific CRC analyses were of European ancestry. Imputation was performed using the Michigan imputation server and HRC r1.0 reference panel. Regression models were further adjusted for age, sex, genotyping platform, and genomic principal components as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Ethics were approved by respective institutional review boards.</p>

<title>Assessment of CRC genetic liability</title>
<p>Genetic liability to CRC was based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CRC case status at genome-wide significance (P&lt;5×10<sup>−8</sup>). 108 independent SNPs reported by two major GWAS meta-analyses were eligible for inclusion in a CRC genetic risk score (GRS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> The set of SNPs was filtered, excluding 36 SNPs that were in linkage disequilibrium based on R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>&gt;0.001 using the TwoSampleMR package (SNPs with the lowest P-values were retained).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> This left 72 SNPs independently associated with CRC (<bold>Supplementary Table (ST) 1</bold>), 65 of which were available in imputed ALSPAC genotype data post quality control. As GWAS of site-specific CRC have identified marked heterogeneity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> GRS describing site-specific CRCs were constructed for sensitivity analyses using the same process outlined above. The GRS for colon cancer, rectal cancer, proximal colon cancer and distal colon cancer were comprised of 38, 25, 20 and 24 variants, respectively (<bold>ST1</bold>). For overall CRC and site-specific CRC analyses, sensitivity analyses excluding any SNPs in the FADS cluster (i.e. within the gene regions of <italic>FADS1</italic>, <italic>FADS2</italic>, or <italic>FADS3</italic>) (<bold>ST1</bold>) were performed given a likely role for these SNPs in influencing circulating metabolite levels directly, in particular via lipid metabolism (i.e., not primarily due to CRC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup></p>

<title>Assessment of circulating metabolites</title>
<p>Circulating metabolite measures were drawn from ALSPAC and UK Biobank using the same targeted metabolomics platform. In ALSPAC, participants provided non-fasting blood samples during a clinic visit while aged approximately 8y, and fasting blood samples from clinic visits while aged approximately 16y, 18y, and 25y. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopy was performed on Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma (stored at or below −70 degrees Celsius pre-processing) to quantify a maximum of 231 metabolites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> Quantified metabolites included the cholesterol and triglyceride content of lipoprotein particles; the concentrations and diameter/size of these particles; apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein A-1 concentrations; as well as fatty acids and their ratios to total fatty acid concentration, branched chain and aromatic amino acids, glucose and pre-glycaemic factors including lactate and citrate, fluid balance factors including albumin and creatinine, and the inflammatory marker glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA). In UK Biobank, EDTA plasma samples from 117,121 participants, a random subset of the original ∼500,000 who provided samples at assessment centres between 2006 and 2013, were analysed between 2019 and 2020 for levels of 249 metabolic traits (168 concentrations plus 81 ratios) using the same high-throughput <sup>1</sup>H-NMR platform. Data pre-processing and QC steps are described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> To allow comparability between MR and GRS estimates all metabolite measures were standardised and normalised using rank-based inverse normal transformation. For descriptive purposes in ALSPAC, body mass index (BMI) was calculated at each time point as weight (kg) divided by squared height (m<sup>2</sup>) based on clinic measures of weight to the nearest 0.1 kg using a Tanita scale and height measured in light clothing without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm using a Harpenden stadiometer.</p>
<p>CRC liability variants were combined into a GRS using PLINK 1.9, specifying the effect (risk raising) allele and coefficient (logOR) with estimates from the CRC GWAS used as external weights.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> GRSs were calculated as the number of effect alleles (or dosages if imputed) at each SNP (0, 1, or 2) multiplied by its weighting, summing these, and dividing by the total number of SNPs used. Z-scores of GRS variables were calculated to standardize scoring.</p>

<title>Statistical approach</title>
<p>An overview of the study design is presented in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></bold>. To estimate the effect of increased genetic liability to CRC on circulating metabolites we conducted a GRS analysis in ALSPAC and reverse two-sample MR analyses in UK Biobank. Estimates were interpreted within a ‘reverse MR’ framework,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> wherein results are taken to reflect ‘metabolic features’ of CRC liability which could capture causal or predictive metabolite-disease associations. To clarify the direction of metabolite-CRC associations, we additionally performed conventional ‘forward’ two-sample MR analyses to estimate the effect of circulating metabolites on CRC risk using large-scale GWAS data on metabolites and CRC.</p>

<caption><p>Study design. First, linear regression models were used to examine the relationship between genetic susceptibility to adult colorectal cancer and circulating metabolites measured in ALSPAC participants at age 8, 16, 18 and 25 years. Next, we performed a reverse Mendelian randomization analysis to identify metabolites influenced by CRC susceptibility in an independent population of adults. Finally, we performed a conventional (forward) Mendelian randomization analysis of circulating metabolites on CRC to identify metabolites causally associated with CRC risk. Consistent evidence across all three methodological approaches was interpreted to indicate a causal role for a given metabolite in CRC etiology.</p></caption>

<p>In the GRS analysis, there was no strong evidence of association of CRC liability with metabolites at age 8y (<bold>ST3</bold>). At age 16y, there was evidence for association with several lipid traits including higher cholesteryl esters to total lipids ratio in large low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (SD change per SD higher CRC liability = 0.060, 95% CI = 0.024 to 0.096) and higher cholesterol in very small very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) (SD change per SD higher liability = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.10). There was strong evidence for association with several traits at age 18y including higher non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) lipids, e.g., a 1 SD higher CRC liability was associated with higher levels of total cholesterol (SD change = 0.05 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.09), VLDL-cholesterol (SD change = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.09), LDL-cholesterol (SD change = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.09)), apolipoproteins (apolipoprotein B (SD change = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.09)), and fatty acids (omega-3 (SD change = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.11), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (SD change = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.09)) (<bold>ST3</bold>). <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></bold> shows results for all clinically validated metabolites.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we used a reverse MR framework to identify circulating metabolites which are associated with genetic CRC liability across different stages of the early life course and attempted to replicate results in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults. We then performed forward MR to characterise the causal direction of the relationship between metabolites and CRC. Our GRS analysis provided evidence for an association of genetic liability to CRC with higher circulating levels of lipoprotein lipids (including total cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol), apolipoproteins (including apolipoprotein B), and fatty acids (including omega-3 and DHA) in young adults. These results were largely consistent in direction (though smaller in magnitude and weaker in strength of evidence) in a two-sample MR analysis in an independent cohort of middle-aged adults. Results were attenuated, but consistent in direction, when potentially pleiotropic SNPs in the <italic>FADS</italic> gene regions were excluded. However, it should be noted that use of a narrow window for exclusion based on being within one of the three <italic>FADS</italic> genes may mean that some pleiotropic SNPs remain. Our subsequent forward MR analysis highlighted polyunsaturated fatty acids as potentially having a causal role in the development of CRC.</p>
<p>Our analyses highlight a potentially important role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in colorectal cancer liability. However, these analyses may be biased by substantial genetic pleiotropy among fatty acid traits. SNPs which are associated with levels of one fatty acid are generally associated with levels of many more fatty acid (and non-fatty acid) traits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> For instance, genetic instruments within the FADS cluster of genes will likely affect both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, given <italic>FADS1</italic> and <italic>FADS2</italic> encode enzymes which catalyse the conversion of both from shorter chain into longer chain fatty acids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> In addition, the NMR metabolomics platform utilised in the analyses outlined here has limited coverage of fatty acids, meaning many putative causal metabolites for CRC, for example arachidonic acid, could not be investigated. Therefore, although our results indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids may be important in colorectal cancer risk, given the pleiotropic nature of the fatty acid genetic instruments and the limited coverage of the NMR platform, we are unable to determine with any certainty which specific classes of fatty acids may be driving these associations.</p>
<p>Our analyses featured evaluating the effect of genetic liability to CRC on circulating metabolites across repeated measures in the ALSPAC cohort. The mean ages at the time of the repeated measures were 8y, 16y, 18y, and 25y, representing childhood, early adolescence, late adolescence, and young adulthood respectively, and therefore individuals in this cohort are unlikely to be taking metabolite-altering medication such as statins, and unlikely to have CRC. The strongest evidence for an effect of liability to CRC on metabolite levels was seen in late adolescence. The reason for this remains unclear. It is possible that this represents a true biological phenomenon if late adolescence is a critical window in CRC development or metabolite variability, which may be likely given the limited variance in metabolite levels at the later age of 25y (<bold>ST2</bold>). The lack of an effect at the younger ages could be explained by the fact that the CRC GRS may capture many key life events or experiences which could impact the metabolome (e.g., initiation of smoking, higher category of BMI reached, educational attainment level set, etc) but may not have yet happened at younger ages, thus obscuring an effect of genetic liability to CRC on the metabolome. Our results suggest that puberty could be important, with an effect seen seemingly particularly at the end of puberty. Repeating our analysis with sex-stratified data may aid in determining whether this is likely to be the case; sex-stratified GWAS for metabolites are not currently available to replicate such analyses. An alternative explanation is selection bias due to loss of follow-up, leading to a change in sample characteristics over time.</p>
<p>Another key finding in the reverse MR analysis was that genetic liability to CRC was associated with increased levels of total cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, though we find little evidence for a causal effect of these traits on risk of CRC in the forward MR, replicating previous forward MR analyses for total and LDL-cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> This suggests that these traits may either be only predictive of (i.e., non-causal for) later CRC development, or may be influenced by the development of CRC and could have diagnostic or predictive potential. Given that the participants in the ALSPAC cohort are many decades younger than the average age of diagnosis for CRC (mean age 25 years in the latest repeated measure analysed in ALSPAC; whereas the median age at diagnosis of CRC is 64 years),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> the former seems the most likely scenario. Previous conventional observational studies have presented conflicting results when investigating the association between measures of cholesterol and CRC risk with some finding an inverse association and others a positive association, possibly reflecting residual confounding in conventional observational analyses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup> Previous MR studies have had similar findings to our forward MR analysis, in that there seems to be little evidence for a causal effect of cholesterol on CRC development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> One possible explanation for how circulating levels of total cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B could predict (without necessarily causing) future CRC development could be linked to diet. A previous MR analysis suggested an effect of increased BMI on several measures of circulating cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> Consuming a diet which is high in fat may increase CRC risk both through and possibly independently of adiposity, alongside increasing levels of circulating cholesterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup> The potential for lipoprotein or apolipoprotein lipid measures in future CRC risk prediction should be further investigated.</p>
<p>Our analyses stratified by anatomical subsite highlighted fatty acids as being affected by genetic liability to colon and proximal colon cancer, with the forward MR confirming that fatty acid traits may be particularly important in the development of these subsites of CRC as well as distal colon cancer.</p>
<p>In our forward MR analyses we were unable to replicate the findings of three previous MR studies which found evidence for a causal effect of circulating linoleic acid levels on CRC development in terms of strength of evidence, though the direction of the effect estimate was similar to previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> This is surprising as all three previous analyses had a much smaller sample size than that included in our analysis (the largest had sample size of 24,748 for exposure vs 118,466 presently; and 11,016 cases and 13,732 controls for outcome vs 52,775 cases and 45,940 controls presently). Our analysis using updated genetic instruments to proxy fatty acids may be more successful in accurately instrumenting heterogenous phenotypes such as metabolite levels compared with previous analyses. All other findings in our forward MR analysis are consistent with previous MR studies where they exist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The limitations of this study include firstly the relatively small sample size included in the ALSPAC analysis, which may have implications for power and precision. Secondly, our analyses involving genetic instruments for CRC liability may have suffered from horizontal pleiotropy, even after excluding genetic variants in or near the <italic>FADS</italic> gene. Thirdly, our analyses were mostly restricted to white Europeans, which limits the generalisability of our findings to other populations. Fourthly, our analysis would benefit from being repeated with sex-stratified data, although such GWAS results for metabolites are not currently available. Fifthly, for our forward MR analysis, we used the UK Biobank for our exposure data. The UK Biobank has a median age of 58 at the time these measurements were taken, meaning statin use may be widespread in this population, which could be attenuating our effect estimates. Future work could attempt to replicate our analysis in a population with lower prevalence of statins intake. Finally, we included only metabolites measured using NMR. Confirming whether our results replicate using metabolite data measured with an alternative method would strengthen our findings.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our analysis provides evidence that genetic liability to CRC alters levels of metabolites at certain ages, some of which may have a causal role in CRC development. Further investigating the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in CRC risk and circulating cholesterol in CRC prediction may be promising avenues for future research.</p>

<p>Bull et al aimed to use data from observational studies and mendelian randomisation to explore if changes in circulating metabolites are associated with colorectal cancer development. As Mendelian randomisation uses information on genetic variations which are fixed at birth, it is less vulnerable to confounding than standard observational studies.</p>
<p>Overall, a major strength of the study is that it uses data from large cohort studies, one from childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood when the incidence of colorectal cancer is very low (reducing the likelihood of reverse causation) and before medication (such as statins which have the potential to affect metabolite levels) has been initiated.</p>
<p>This study has some weaknesses which have been acknowledged by the authors. Although the findings of this study indicate the potentially significant role that polyunsaturated fatty acids may have in colorectal cancer risk, the genes and therefore also the genetic variations (SNPs) associated with fatty acids often produce an effect for more than one fatty acid which may introduce bias. This together with the fact that there was limited information available on many specific fatty acids which are known causative metabolites for colorectal cancer, makes it difficult to establish with confidence which specific classes of fatty acids could potentially play a causative role in these associations. Also, the study populations are majority white European descent which may limit the applicability of these findings to other populations.</p>
<p>The methodology used was largely acceptable to achieve the aims set out and the findings have shown an association between polyunsaturated fat and colorectal cancer. However, I feel that the conclusion should be tempered slightly as although this study alongside other similar MR studies provides evidence of an association between genetic liability to CRC and levels of metabolites at certain ages, I do not think there is enough evidence at this stage to say that genetic liability for CRC actually alters the levels of metabolites.</p>
<p>Overall, this is an important piece of work that has the potential to contribute to our understanding of the causal relationship between circulating metabolites at different stages of the life cycle and colorectal cancer risk as it would be extremely difficult to gather such evidence using other study designs. It opens the door for future research aiming to better understand the role that these metabolites could play in colorectal cancer risk prediction and in turn help identify groups of individuals who would benefit most from prevention and early detection interventions.</p>
<p>This work will be of interest not only to epidemiologists working in the area of GI tract cancers but also those interested in the different applications for mendelian randomisation within cancer epidemiology research.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Bull et al investigates the relationship between metabolic features, in particular different lipoproteins and fatty acids, and colorectal cancer. They combine different data sources to analyze forward and reverse Mendelian Randomization associations in children and adults. Their results indicate that polyunsaturated fatty acids may be implicated in the risk for colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>Overall, the paper is well-written, and the methods used are solid. The use of different data (cohort individual data and summary stats) and stratifications strengthens the analyses. The conclusions drawn from the results are balanced and supported by the data although the novelty of the findings is modest.</p>
