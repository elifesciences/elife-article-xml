<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Robust control of DNA replication is fundamental to bacterial proliferation. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, replication initiation is thought to be regulated by oscillations in DnaA activity, driven by DnaA-chromosome interactions that differ among leading models. However, direct evidence linking these oscillations to replication initiation has been lacking, and existing models fail to explain the observed decoupling of replication initiation from <italic>dnaA</italic> expression. Here, we establish a direct link between DnaA activity and replication initiation by demonstrating robust oscillations in DnaA activity, which peak precisely at replication initiation across diverse growth conditions and genetic perturbations. Notably, these oscillations persist even when <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription remains constant, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that modulates DnaA activity independently of its expression. Additionally, we propose an extrusion model in which DNA-binding proteins sense biomass-DNA imbalance and extrude DnaA from the chromosome to trigger replication, overcoming limitations of existing models. Consistent with this model, perturbation of the nucleoid-associated protein H-NS modulates DnaA activity and replication timing, supporting its mechanistic validity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacterial proliferation requires precise coordination between DNA replication and biomass growth to maintain cellular homeostasis. While biomass accumulates exponentially, DNA synthesis proceeds in a stepwise manner, creating temporal imbalances that demand continuous correction throughout the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). Failure to synchronize these processes risks catastrophic outcomes, such as growth defects, incomplete replication, unequal genetic segregation, and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Boye et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Khodursky et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mäkelä et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zaritsky &amp; Pritchard, 1971</xref>). Central to this synchronization in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the initiator protein DnaA, a DNA-binding protein that binds specifically to an asymmetric 9-bp DnaA-box, whose consensus sequence is TTWTNCACA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hansen &amp; Atlung, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Speck et al., 1999</xref>). Although DnaA binding to the replication origin (<italic>oriC</italic>) triggers replication initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kaguni, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ohbayashi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ozaki &amp; Katayama, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Sekimizu et al., 1987</xref>), how DnaA activity is dynamically regulated to align replication initiation with cellular growth, particularly when DNA content and biomass diverge, remains a fundamental unresolved question in cell cycle biology.</p>

<p>Two competing models have dominated the field. The titration model posits that DnaA activity is governed by the availability of free DnaA, which accumulates until it surpasses the buffering capacity of chromosomal DnaA-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Christensen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hansen et al., 1991</xref>). Here, replication initiation resets the system by increasing DNA content (and thus DnaA-boxes), titrating excess DnaA. In contrast, the switch model emphasizes the ATP/ADP-bound states of DnaA: DnaA-ATP, synthesized during biomass growth, triggers initiation, while hydrolysis to DnaA-ADP following replication resets the cycle(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berger &amp; Wolde, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Donachie &amp; Blakely, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hansen &amp; Atlung, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Katayama et al., 2017</xref>). Crucially, the titration model depends on ongoing DnaA synthesis to reflect biomass accumulation, whereas the switch model relies on nucleotide-state transitions, independent of total DnaA levels. Despite these mechanistic differences, both models consider that replication initiation is regulated by oscillations in DnaA activity, driven by DnaA-chromosome interactions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, direct evidence linking these oscillations to replication initiation remains lacking. Moreover, neither model fully explains recent experimental observations: replication initiation persists for multiple generations even when <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription is completely inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knöppel et al., 2023</xref>). This discrepancy suggests an uncharacterized mechanism that senses biomass-DNA imbalance and directly modulates DnaA activity.</p>
<p>Here, using a synthetic reporter coupled with single-cell mRNA fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (FISH), we demonstrate that DnaA activity peaks precisely at initiation across diverse growth conditions and genetic backgrounds, even when <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription is held constant. DnaA activity oscillations persist independently of transcriptional feedback, pointing to a post-translational regulatory mechanism. We propose an extrusion model in which nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) sense biomass-DNA imbalance and dynamically extrude DnaA from the chromosome, liberating it to activate <italic>oriC</italic>. This model not only explains the decoupling of replication timing from <italic>dnaA</italic> expression but also integrates disparate experimental findings. Perturbations of the NAP, H-NS for instance, modulate DnaA activity and replication timing, directly supporting the model’s predictions. By unifying regulatory principles across transcription, protein activity, and chromosome dynamics, our findings redefine the paradigm for bacterial replication control.</p>

<title>Development of a DnaA activity reporter system</title>
<p>It has been known that changing DnaA expression levels affects DnaA activity, and further changes initiation mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berger &amp; Wolde, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Løbner-Olesen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). To investigate this further, we engineered a <italic>dnaA</italic>-titratable strain, where <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription is controlled by an inducible <italic>P</italic><sub>tet</sub> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lutz &amp; Bujard, 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This system enabled precise modulation of <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA levels (0.25 to 6 times the wild-type level) via anhydrotetracycline (aTc) induction (0.75– 20 ng ml<sup>−1</sup>) without altering growth rate or cell size (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B–D</xref>). Strikingly, increasing DnaA expression doubled population-averaged <italic>oriC</italic> copy numbers and reduced initiation mass (the cell volume per <italic>oriC</italic> at replication initiation) by 50 % (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-F</xref>). The observed relationship between DnaA expression and initiation mass deviated significantly from both the titration and switch models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>), suggesting unaccounted regulatory mechanisms.</p>

<p>To dissect DnaA activity dynamics, we constructed a library of synthetic promoters (<italic>n</italic> = 67) by replacing <italic>tetO</italic> operators in <italic>P</italic><sub>tet</sub> with DnaA-boxes (Fig. S1). To assess the degree of DnaA activity-mediated repression, we measured the fold change in GFP expression driven by each synthetic promoter under low and high levels of <italic>dnaA</italic> induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Six synthetic promoters exhibited over 8-fold DnaA-mediated repression, whereas the promoter lacking DnaA-boxes (<italic>P</italic><sub>con</sub>) showed none, and the well-characterized native <italic>dnaA</italic> promoter (<italic>P</italic><sub>native</sub>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Braun et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Saggioro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Speck et al., 1999</xref>) displayed approximately two-fold repression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>; Fig. S1). <italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub>, which contains three strong and one weak DnaA-box, exhibited &gt;8-fold repression under high DnaA induction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). <italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub>’s design enables responsiveness to both free DnaA levels (via strong boxes) and the ATP/ADP ratio (via differential binding to the weak box)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Grimwade &amp; Leonard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Katayama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Speck et al., 1999</xref>).

<title>Decoupling DnaA activity oscillations from <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription fluctuations</title>
<p>To investigate DnaA activity dynamics throughout the cell cycle, we linked <italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub> activity to cell size, a surrogate for cell-cycle progression, using single-cell mRNA FISH(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Skinner et al., 2013</xref>) to quantify <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA levels in MG1655<italic>Δlac</italic> cells harboring the <italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> plasmid (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). A control strain harboring a promoter-less <italic>lacZ</italic> construct (<italic>P</italic><sub>neg</sub>) showed undetectable fluorescence signals (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), confirming the specificity of <italic>lacZ</italic> mRNA detection. Quantitative analysis revealed that <italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub>-driven mRNA levels fluctuated approximately 3-fold over the cell cycle, whereas the DnaA-unresponsive constitutive promoter (<italic>P</italic><sub>con</sub>) exhibited stable expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). However, fluctuations in mRNA concentration may not directly correspond to changes in DnaA activity due to global factors such as plasmid copy number and RNA polymerase concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balakrishnan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bintu et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bintu et al., 2005b</xref>). To account for these variables, we used a <italic>P</italic><sub>con</sub>-<italic>lacZ</italic> plasmid to estimate global effects on mRNA concentration and calculated DnaA activity as inversely proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. In wild-type cells (MG1655<italic>Δlac</italic>) harboring the synthetic reporter system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), fluctuations in DnaA activity, as denoted by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, displayed approximately a 3-fold variation across the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), underscoring the substantial cell cycle-dependent oscillations in DnaA activity.</p>

<title>An extrusion model reconciles paradoxical initiation events</title>
<p>Very recently, Knöppel <italic>et al</italic>. reported that multiple rounds of initiation occurred even after DnaA synthesis is shut down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knöppel et al., 2023</xref>). In their experiment, DnaA was supplied in excess before expression ceased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knöppel et al., 2023</xref>), potentially allowing continued replication initiation due to residual DnaA.

<p>Both the titration and switch models predict a close relationship between DnaA activity oscillations and replication initiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berger &amp; Wolde, 2022</xref>). However, they fail to account for the multiple rounds of initiation observed after DnaA synthesis was shut down. According to the titration model, initiation should cease immediately once DnaA expression is shut down, as the reduction in DnaA concentration would prevent it from reaching the threshold required to trigger new rounds of replication. In contrast, the switch model predicts infinite initiations following the cessation of DnaA expression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). This is because the cessation of DnaA synthesis only reduce the production rate of DnaA-ATP and had no effect on the conversion rates between DnaA-ATP and DnaA-ADP. As a result, the ratio of DnaA-ATP to DnaA-ADP would temporarily decrease, causing a brief lag before initiation resumes indefinitely (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>The failure of both models prompts us to revisit the regulatory mechanisms of replication initiation. In the titration model, a substantial fraction of DnaA proteins binds to DnaA-boxes along the chromosome, raising the possibility that these bound proteins serve as a reservoir of free DnaA, sustaining replication initiation even after DnaA synthesis ceases. We thus considered the possibility of some extruder(s) alongside DnaA to sense biomass-DNA deviation, and flush DnaA proteins away from the DnaA-boxes, thus releasing free DnaA to dynamically restore DnaA activity, even in the absence of ongoing DnaA synthesis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In this proposed “extrusion model”, the extruder is constitutively expressed, synthesized at a constant rate throughout the cell cycle, accumulating in proportion to biomass growth, enabling replication initiation when free DnaA concentrations exceed the critical threshold, as described in the titration model(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hansen &amp; Atlung, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hansen et al., 1991</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). This model guarantees the long-term coordination of biomass growth and <italic>oriC</italic> abundance, as well as stable oscillations in free DnaA and <italic>oriC</italic> concentrations (Fig. S3 A). Notably, the extrusion model accounts for the persistence of replication initiation and free DnaA oscillations over multiple cell cycles after DnaA synthesis is halted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>; Fig. S3 B). Moreover, since the extruder mitigates the impact of perturbations on DnaA synthesis, the model predicts a quantitative relationship between initiation mass and DnaA expression levels that aligns with experimental observations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Furthermore, a stochastic implementation of the extrusion model shows the lack of correlation between successive replication initiation events (Fig. S3 C), as observed in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Si et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Witz et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Perturbation of H-NS validates the extrusion mechanism</title>
<p>The extrusion model could be validated by changing the expression level of the extruder, which modulates DnaA activity by releasing DnaA from DnaA-boxes. Given their DNA binding properties, NAPs(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dillon &amp; Dorman, 2010</xref>) are likely candidates for this extruder role. Therefore, we selected H-NS(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dorman, 2004</xref>), a major NAP, which is capable of promoting the release of DnaA from bound DnaA-boxes <italic>in vitro</italic> (Fig. S4), to experimentally assess the validity of the extrusion model. To this end, we constructed a <italic>hns</italic>-titratable strain, incorporating a reporting plasmid to capture changes in DnaA activity across various H-NS expression levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>).

<p>Since H-NS is a global transcriptional regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hommais et al., 2001</xref>), we wonder whether its effect on DnaA activity was mediated through <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription. To test this, we measured DnaA activity and <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA levels during an H-NS shift-up. Upon addition of 50 ng·ml-1 aTc, <italic>hns</italic> levels increased more than 20-fold within a short period, followed by approximately 80 % increase in DnaA activity, with no significant change in <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Additionally, cellular <italic>oriC</italic> content increased significantly within 30 minutes, while cell mass remained unchanged (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>).

<p>Leveraging the <italic>hns</italic>-titratable strain, we re-examined the tight correlation between DnaA activity oscillations and replication initiation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we proposed chromosome-driven DnaA activity oscillations as a post-translational “rheostat” coordinating DNA replication with biomass growth in <italic>E. coli</italic>. By developing a SeqA-independent synthetic promoter reporter (<italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub>) on a plasmid, we circumvented confounding factors inherent to native systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pountain et al., 2024</xref>), thereby achieving the direct quantification of DnaA activity dynamics. Crucially, these oscillations persist when <italic>dnaA</italic> transcription is fixed, operate independently of SeqA-mediated repression, and peak precisely at replication initiation across all tested growth conditions. This reveals an essential paradigm: bacteria bypass transcriptional control to synchronize genome duplication with growth through spatial regulation of DnaA-chromosome interactions.</p>
<p>Very recently, Iuliani <italic>et al</italic>. also reported DnaA activity oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Iuliani et al., 2024</xref>), which is a significant milestone, innovatively using a chromosomal promoter-reporter system and microfluidics for single-cell DnaA activity observations. They revealed key relationships between DnaA activity, cell size, and division. Our work, however, differs in multiple ways. Methodologically, we engineered a <italic>dnaA</italic>-titratable strain and synthetic promoters like <italic>P</italic><sub>syn66</sub>, enabling precise <italic>dnaA</italic> expression control and cleaner DnaA activity reporting. Our mRNA FISH approach uniquely compares DnaA activity and transcription at the single-cell level. By decoupling initiation volume measurement from DnaA monitoring, we resolve a 1:1 coupling between DnaA activity thresholds and replication initiation events. Regarding research questions, while Iuliani <italic>et al</italic>. focused on DnaA-cell size-division relationships, we addressed the decoupling of replication initiation from <italic>dnaA</italic> expression with our novel extrusion model.</p>
<p>Recently, an integrated “titration-switch” model has been proposed to improve replication cycle stability across different growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berger &amp; Wolde, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fu et al., 2023</xref>). Although this integrated model predicts a relationship between initiation mass and <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA levels that aligns closely with steady-state experimental data (Fig. S6 A), it fails to account for the additional replication initiation observed after <italic>dnaA</italic> shutdown (Fig. S6 B). By incorporating an extruder into this model, we successfully reproduced the additional replication initiation (Fig. S6 C), thus validating the extrusion concept and aligning with experimental observations. These findings highlight the critical role of extrusion in refining our mechanistic understanding of biomass-DNA coordination.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, we propose that NAPs sense biomass-DNA imbalances and extrude DnaA from chromosomal sites, converting physical displacement into biochemical activation, a spatial control strategy mirroring eukaryotic chromatin regulation. H-NS emerges as a prime extruder candidate given its DNA-condensing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dame et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zimmerman, 2006</xref>) and replication-timing effects (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This functional multiplicity likely enhances robustness, allowing cells to maintain replication homeostasis despite fluctuating environments, an evolutionary advantage paralleling eukaryotic checkpoint system.</p>
<p>These findings redefine bacterial cell cycle control as a dynamic interplay between physical chromosome remodeling and metabolic sensing. By tethering DnaA activation to biomass accumulation through extrusion, cells achieve a critical feat: noise suppression via spatial filtering of transcriptional fluctuations. Such mechanistic parsimony, using chromosome structure to both store genetic information and regulate replication timing, may represent a fundamental principle of cellular organization. Indeed, parallels to eukaryotic systems are striking: DnaA extrusion resembles ORC licensing through chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fragkos et al., 2015</xref>), while biomass-DNA coupling evokes yeast size-control checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Xie et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Future studies could map the complete extruder interactome and elucidate how metabolic signals modulate their activity. Our synthetic reporter system provides a blueprint for dissecting the spatial regulation of DNA-binding proteins, with translational potential in antimicrobial development (targeting pathogen-specific extruders) and synthetic biology (engineering tunable replication circuits). More broadly, this work establishes physical chromosome remodeling as a central coordinator of cellular homeostasis, a concept bridging prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell cycle paradigms.</p>

<p>Cells for strain construction were grown in in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with appropriate antibiotics: ampicillin (100 μg·ml<sup>-1</sup>), kanamycin (50 μg·ml<sup>-1</sup>), spectinomycin (50 μg·ml<sup>-1</sup>), chloramphenicol (25 μg·ml<sup>-1</sup>), based on plasmid presents. For titratable strains, 10 ng·ml<sup>−1</sup> anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was added during strain construction and seed culture preparation. Seed cultures were initiated by inoculating 3–6 individual colonies from an LB agar plate into 14 ml round-bottom test tubes containing 2 ml of the desired medium for overnight growth.</p>
<p>For physiological phenotypic characterization, all cells were cultivated at 37°C with shaking at 150 rpm in a water bath shaker. The <italic>dnaA</italic>-, <italic>seqA</italic>- and <italic>hns</italic>-titratable cells were characterized under varying aTc concentrations in rich defined medium supplemented with glycerol (M6). <italic>hns</italic>-titratable cells were also characterized in rich defined medium supplemented with glucose (M1). When strains contained reporter plasmid, 25 μg·ml<sup>−1</sup> chloramphenicol was added. The autoregulated-<italic>dnaA</italic> strain (MGCL1) with a reporter plasmid, was tested in seven different media: M1 (MOPS + EZ + AUCG + Glucose), M2 (MOPS + EZ + Glucose), M3 (MOPS + EZ + AUCG + Gluconate), M6 (MOPS + EZ + AUCG + Glycerol),</p>
<p>M12 (MOPS + EZ + Glycerol), M13 (MOPS + CAA + Glycerol), and M18 (MOPS + Glucose). Detailed medium compositions were provided previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>). Steady-state growth was established as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>) by culturing cells for ∼10 generations in exponential growth phase with ∼15-fold dilution at OD<sub>600</sub> ∼0.2, using the same medium supplemented with antibiotic or aTc as required. OD<sub>600</sub> measurements were taken at consecutive time points using a spectrometer (Genesys 10s, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the growth rate (or doubling time) was calculated by fitting the data to an exponential growth curve. Samples for determination of population-averaged cell mass <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and cellular origin number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, quantification of mRNA levels, and mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were collected when OD<sub>600</sub> reached ∼0.2.</p>

Cell number concentration was measured by counting the DAPI-stained particles using flow cytometry equipped with 405 nm laser (CytoFLEX, Beckman Coulter Life Sciences).

Following approximately 4 hours of pre-cultivation, the cultures were diluted 1:180 in fresh medium with the same aTc concentration. The OD<sub>600</sub> and GFP fluorescence intensity were continuously monitored during cell growth using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek). The non-fluorescent strain (MG1655) cultured in 180ul of M6 medium for each experiment was used to subtract the background fluorescence. For OD<sub>600</sub> between 0.1 and 0.2, the repression fold change was calculated by dividing the mean fluorescence intensity per OD<sub>600</sub> of the cells grown with 0.5 ng·ml<sup>-1</sup> aTc induction by the corresponding intensity for cells grown with 50 ng·ml<sup>-1</sup> aTc induction.</p>

The fixed cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 g for 8 minutes, and washed twice with 1 ml RNase-free PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 300 μl DEPC water, and 700 μl precooled absolute ethanol was added to permeabilize the cells for 1 hour at room temperature in the nutator. After permeabilization, the cells were divided into two equal parts for characterization of <italic>lacZ</italic> or <italic>dnaA</italic> mRNA as needed.

<title>Cell imaging and cell size parameters measurement</title>
<p>For imaging, 3 μl of cell suspension was pipetted onto the center of a 24×60-mm coverslip. A thin 1.5 % agarose pad (prepared with 1xPBS) was then placed on top of the cell suspension droplet. Fluorescent and phase images were acquired using an inverted microscope (IX-83, Olympus) equipped with a 100x oil objective (Olympus), an automated xy-stage (ASI, MS2000), and a sCMOS camera (Prime BSI, photometrics). Fluorescence excitation was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xia et al., 2022</xref>). Solid-state lasers (Coherent OBIS: 405–100 LX, 561–100 LS) and Semrock emission bandpass filters (445/40 nm for DAPI and 598/25 nm for RFP) were used for excitation and collecting fluorescent signals.</p>
<p>Images were aligned with phase contrast channel by selecting at least six pairs of common control points and applying a geometric transformation using the MATLAB imwarp function. This allowed for adjustment of the cell masks in the RFP or DAPI channel. A customized ImageJ -based image-processing package, MicrobeJ (v5.13l<sub>1</sub>) plugin for Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ducret et al., 2016</xref>), was used to contour cells and calculate cell size parameters and fluorescence intensity, including the mean cell width, cell length, and cell area from phase-contrast images. The cell volume was calculated using a cylinder-plus-two-hemispheres geometry. The total RFP intensity, corrected for background subtraction per cell volume, was then used to estimate the concentration of the related mRNA level.</p>

<title>Characterization of cell cycle-dependent fluctuations in DnaA activity</title>
<p>Data filtering was first performed based on the intensity of the DAPI fluorescence signal. To eliminate non-cell regions resulting from incorrect segmentation of the phase contrast images, only DAPI-positive cells were included in the analysis. To further minimize the potential impact of variability in fixation, permeabilization, and wash efficiencies, which could affect the TAMRA fluorescence signal (representing the mRNA FISH signal), only cells with mean DAPI signals within the 95% confidence intervals were included in the subsequent analysis.</p>

<title>Titration model</title>
<p>In the titration model, we posit that the cell mass grows exponentially according to the differential equation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline26.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>V</italic> represents the volume of the cell and λ = 1.54 <italic>hr</italic><sup>−1</sup>(corresponding to doubling time of 27 min) is the growth rate. Concurrently, DnaA protein synthesis occurs at a rate proportional to the cell’s mass, described by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline27.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline28.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> denoting the synthesis rate per unit volume. The chromosome’s structure is abstracted as a vector representing the copy numbers of uniformly distributed sites along its length. Specifically, DnaA-boxes, which are binding sites for DnaA proteins, are quantified by summing the copy numbers at their respective locations. In this model, 300 DnaA-boxes (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>) are evenly distributed on the chromosome while an additional 100 DnaA-boxes are located near the origin of replication. This arrangement approximates a head-weighted distribution of DnaA-boxes and helps prevent over-initiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hansen et al., 1991</xref>). Binding of DnaA proteins to these DnaA-boxes allows us to calculate the concentration of free DnaA as [<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>f</italic></sub>] = (<italic>A</italic> − <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>)/<italic>V</italic>, under condition of (<italic>A</italic> − <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub>) ≥ 0.

The additional extruder competes the DnaA-boxes with DnaA proteins, with higher affinity to DnaA-boxes.

<p>To get the DnaA repression simulation at the population level, we introduced cell division by the assumption of Cooper and Helmstetter that a cell divides at a constant time (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>cyc</italic></sub> = 60 mins) after DNA replication initiation.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Berger &amp; Wolde, 2022</xref>). According to this framework, the lipid and DARS systems facilitate the conversion of DnaA-ADP to DnaA-ATP at constant rates, while the <italic>datA</italic> site and RIDA systems also play a role in converting DnaA-ATP to DnaA-ADP, again at fixed rates. Additionally, the synthesis of new DnaA proteins provides another source of DnaA-ATP. For the parameters governing DnaA-ATP dynamics, we adhere to those specified by Berger <italic>et al</italic>., ensuring consistency with established research. To get a best fit of the initiation mass-<italic>dnaA</italic> expression relation, high threshold of free DnaA-ATP concentration was applied, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline33.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To simulate the titration-switch-extrusion model, we incorporated the extruder as described in the extrusion model, where its amount was given by <italic>H</italic> = α<sub><italic>H</italic></sub><italic>V</italic>. The concentration of free DnaA-ATP was then calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="653648v1_inline33a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, under condition of (<italic>Abox</italic> − <italic>H</italic>) ≥ 0 and (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>ATP</italic></sub> − (<italic>A</italic><sub><italic>b</italic></sub> − <italic>H</italic>)) ≥ 0. To explore the best fit of continuous DNA replication rounds following <italic>dnaA</italic> shut-down, α<sub><italic>H</italic></sub> = 400 <italic>ml</italic><sup>−1</sup> is used.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Li and coworkers addresses the important and fundamental question of replication initiation in Escherichia coli, which remains open, despite many classic and recent works. It leverages single-cell mRNA-FISH experiments in strains with titratable DnaA and novel DnaA activity reporters to monitor DNA activity peaks versus size. The authors find oscillations in DnaA activity and show that their peaks correlate well with the estimated population-average replication initiation volume across conditions and imposed dnaA transcription levels. The study also proposes a novel extrusion model where DNA-binding proteins regulate free DnaA availability in response to biomass-DNA imbalance. Experimental perturbations of H-NS support the model validity, addressing key gaps in current replication control frameworks.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I find the study interesting and well conducted, and I think its main strong points are:</p>
<p>(1) the novel reporters obtained with systematic synthetic biology methods, and combined with a titratable dnaA strain.</p>
<p>(2) the interesting perturbations (titration, production arrest, and H-NS).</p>
<p>(3) the use of single-cell mRNA FISH to monitor transcripts directly.</p>
<p>The proposed extrusion model is also interesting, though not fully validated, and I think it will contribute positively to the future debate.</p>
<p>Weaknesses and Limitations:</p>
<p>(1) A relevant limitation in novelty is that DnaA activity and concentration oscillations have been reported by the cited Iuliani and coworkers previously by dynamic microscopy, and to a smaller extent by the other cited study by Pountain and coworkers using mRNA FISH.</p>
<p>(2) An important limitation is that the study is not dynamic. While monitoring mRNA is interesting and relevant, the current study is based on concentrations and not time variations (or nascent mRNA). Conversely, the study by Iuliani and coworkers, while having the drawback of monitoring proteins, can directly assess production rates. It would be interesting for future studies or revisions to monitor the strains and reporters dynamically, as well as using (as a control) the technique of this study on the chromosomal reporters used by Iuliani et al.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the mathematical models, a lot of details are missing regarding the definitions and the use of such models, which are only presented briefly in the Methods section. The reader is not given any tools to understand the predictions of different models, and no analytical estimates are used. The falsification procedures are not clear. More transparency and depth in the analysis are needed, unless the models are just used as a heuristic tool for qualitative arguments (but this would weaken the claims). The Berger model, for example, has many parameters and many regimes and behaviors. When models are compared to data (e.g., in Figure 2G), it is not clear which parameters were used, how they were fixed, and whether and how the model prediction depends on parameters.</p>
<p>(4) Importantly, the main statement about tight correlations of peak volumes and average estimated initiation volume does not establish coincidence, and some of the claims by the authors are unclear in these respects (e.g., when they say &quot;we resolve a 1:1 coupling between DnaA activity thresholds and replication initiation&quot;, the statement could be correct but is ambiguous). Crucially, the data rely on average initiation volumes (on which there seems to be an eternally open debate, also involving the authors), and the estimate procedure relies on assumptions that could lead to biases and uncertainties added to the population variability (in any case, error bars are not provided).</p>
<p>(5) The delays observed by the authors (in both directions) between the peaks of DnaA-activity conditional averages with respect to volume and the average estimated initiation volumes are not incompatible with those observed dynamically by Iuliani and coworkers. The direct experiment to prove the authors' point would be to use a direct proxy of replication initiation, such as SeqA or DnaN, and monitor initiations and quantify DnaA activity peaks jointly, with dynamic measurements.</p>
<p>(6) While not being an expert, I had some doubt that the fact that the reporters are on plasmid (despite a normalization control that seems very sensible) might affect the measurements. Also, I did not understand how the authors validated the assumptions that the reporters are sensitive to DnaA-ATP specifically. It seems this assumption is validated by previous studies only.</p>
<p>Overall Appraisal:</p>
<p>In summary, this appears as a very interesting study, providing valuable data and a novel hypothesis, the extrusion model, open to future explorations. However, given several limitations, some of the claims appear overstated. Finally, the text contains some self-evaluations, such as &quot;our findings redefine the paradigm for replication control&quot;, etc., that appear exaggerated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that in E. coli, the initiator protein DnaA oscillates post-translationally: its activity rises and peaks exactly when DNA replication begins, even if dnaA transcription is held constant. To explain this, they propose an &quot;extrusion&quot; mechanism in which nucleoid-associated proteins such as H-NS, whose amount grows with cell volume, dislodge DnaA from chromosomal binding sites; modelling and H-NS perturbations reproduce the observed drop in initiation mass and extra initiations seen after dnaA shut-down. Together, the data and model link biomass growth to replication timing through chromosome-driven, post-translational control of DnaA, filling gaps left by classic titration and ATP/ADP-switch models.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Introduces an &quot;extrusion&quot; model that adds a new post-translational layer to replication control and explains data unexplained by classic titration or ATP/ADP-switch frameworks.</p>
<p>(2) A major asset of the study is that it bridges the longstanding gap between DnaA oscillations and DNA-replication initiation, providing direct single-cell evidence that pulses of DnaA activity peak exactly at the moment of initiation across multiple growth conditions and genetic perturbations.</p>
<p>(3) A tunable dnaA strain and targeted H-NS manipulations shift initiation mass exactly as the model predicts, giving model-driven validation across growth conditions.</p>
<p>(4) A purpose-built Psyn66 reporter combined with mRNA-FISH captures DnaA-activity pulses with cell-cycle resolution, providing direct, compelling data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) What happens to the (C+D) period and initiation time as the dnaA mRNA level changes? This is not discussed in the text or figure and should be addressed.</p>
<p>(2) It is unclear what is meant by &quot;relative dnaA mRNA level.&quot; Relative to what? Wild-type expression? Maximum expression? This should be explicitly defined.</p>
<p>(3) It would be helpful to provide some intuition for why an increase in dnaA mRNA level leads to a decrease in initiation mass per ori and an increase in oriC copy number.</p>
<p>(4) The titration and switch models do not explicitly include dnaA mRNA in the dynamics of DnaA protein. Yet, in Figure 2G, initiation mass is shown to decrease linearly with dnaA mRNA level in these models. How was dnaA mRNA level represented or approximated in these simulations?</p>
<p>(5) Is Schaechter's law (i.e., exponential scaling of average cell size with growth rate) still valid under the different dnaA mRNA expression conditions tested?</p>
<p>(6) The manuscript should explain more explicitly how the extrusion model implements post-translational control of DnaA and, in particular, how this yields the nonlinear drop in relative initiation mass versus dnaA mRNA seen in Figure 6E. Please provide the governing equation that links total DnaA, the volume-dependent &quot;extruder&quot; pool, and the threshold of free DnaA at initiation, and show - briefly but quantitatively - how this equation produces the observed concave curve.</p>
<p>(7) Does this Extrusion model give well well-known adder per origin, i.e., initiation to initiation is an adder.</p>
<p>(8) DnaA protein or activity is never measured; mRNA is treated as a linear proxy. Yet the authors' own narrative stresses post-translational (not transcriptional) control of DnaA. Without parallel immunoblots or activity readouts, it is impossible to know whether a six-fold mRNA increase truly yields a proportional rise in active DnaA.</p>
<p>(9) Figure 2 infers both initiation mass and oriC copy number from bulk measurements (OD₆₀₀ per cell and rifampicin-cephalexin run-out) instead of measuring them directly in single cells. Any DnaA-dependent changes in cell size, shape, or antibiotic permeability could skew these bulk proxies, so the plotted relationships may not accurately reflect true initiation events.</p>
