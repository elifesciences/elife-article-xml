<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Unraveling synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within rhythmic neural circuits, such as central pattern generation (CPG) circuits for rhythmic motor behaviors, is critical for deciphering circuit interactions and functional architecture, which is a major problem for understanding how neural circuits operate. Here we present a general method for extracting and separating patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances at high temporal resolution from single neuronal intracellular recordings in rhythmically active networks. These post-synaptic conductances reflect the combined synaptic inputs from the key interacting neuronal populations and can reveal the functional connectome of the active circuits. To illustrate the applicability of our analytic technique, we employ our method to infer the synaptic conductance profiles in identified rhythmically active interneurons within key microcircuits of the mammalian (mature rat) brainstem respiratory CPG and provide a perspective on how our approach can resolve the functional interactions and circuit organization of these interneuron populations. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach, which can be applied to any other rhythmic circuits where conditions allow for neuronal intracellular recordings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Rhythmic neural circuits, which are ubiquitous in nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buzsáki, 2006</xref>), generate spatiotemporal patterns of activity by synaptic interactions between neuronal populations, and unraveling the synaptic inputs to circuit neurons at high temporal resolution in the active networks is a major experimental problem in neurobiology for understanding circuit functional dynamics and architecture. Solving this problem ultimately requires electrophysiological methods to extract dynamic patterns of synaptic conductances in post-synaptic neurons from intracellular recordings during network activity. These patterns often involve temporally complex excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs, and thus methods to extract these inputs must be able to delineate the excitatory and inhibitory components, which can be superimposed during circuit activity, complicating the problem. This study presents a robust and versatile method to extract and separate inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductance patterns from intracellular recordings. The technique is applicable to any periodically active network where the oscillation period much exceeds the interspike intervals and membrane time constant of individual neurons. A synaptic conductance pattern refers to its temporal profile within a single network oscillation cycle. We designed our method to be compatible with various experimental setups, including current-clamp and voltage-clamp protocols, by focusing on the fundamental principles of electrophysiology and network dynamics. Our technique ensures high-resolution temporal profiling of synaptic inputs, making it adaptable to a wide range of rhythmically active neuronal circuits such as vertebrate and invertebrate motor pattern generation (CPG) networks (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calabrese &amp; Marder, 2024</xref>)), and cortical circuit rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Yuste <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). This generalizability highlights the potential of our approach to provide new insights into the functional organization and dynamics of diverse rhythmic neural circuits. Our approach extends previously proposed methods for extracting dynamic patterns of input synaptic conductances from intracellular recordings from neurons in a variety of circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borg-Graham <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Shu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berg <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Endo &amp; Kiehn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Wright &amp; Calabrese, 2011</xref>) by providing nearly continuous, high-resolution readouts of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that are essential for deciphering circuit functional interactions.</p>
<p>To illustrate the utility of our technique, we applied this to circuits in the mammalian brainstem respiratory CPG, which is the fundamental rhythmic neural system that generates and controls breathing movements that are critical for homeostatic regulation of oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH in the brain and body (Feldman &amp; Smith, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Richter &amp; Smith, 2014</xref>). These circuits are continuously active in various experimental preparations and the experimental accessibility of these circuits provides the opportunity to apply our methods to investigate cellular and network electrophysiological processes underlying rhythmic motor pattern generation in a physiologically important mammalian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Richter &amp; Spyer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). The rhythmic patterns of alternating inspiratory and expiratory phase neuronal activities that coordinate activity of spinal and cranial motoneurons during breathing originate within interacting pontine-medullary excitatory and inhibitory circuits in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cohen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bianchi <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>; Feldman &amp; Smith, 1995; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Richter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). We have targeted specific respiratory microcircuits in the medulla of mature rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations <italic>in situ</italic> containing a variety of neuronal phenotypes and synaptic interactions that are key to the operation of the respiratory CPG. This allowed us to perform single neuron intracellular recordings from various neuronal types in different microcircuits, test different recording protocols to assess the robustness of our approach, and provides examples of how our technique can extract complex patterns of synaptic conductances at high temporal resolution in different types of rhythmic neurons. We illustrate how the synaptic conductance profiles throughout the respiratory cycle imply a “functional connectome” of respiratory circuit interactions, demonstrating the efficacy of our technique to provide novel information on circuit dynamic organization and operation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The general theoretical aspects of our approach for analyzing neuronal excitatory and inhibitory conductances from intracellular recordings in rhythmic circuits, and their specific application to the rhythmically active respiratory circuits, are delineated below. Our objective was to extract synaptic conductance dependence on the phase of the network activity cycle (hereinafter referred to as <italic>synaptic conductance profiles</italic>) representing nearly continuous readouts of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from the neuronal recordings throughout a cycle of periodic neural activity— the respiratory cycle in our illustration. Any periodic activity can be analyzed in the same way that we describe in this illustration below.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Reconstruction of synaptic inputs from intracellular recordings</title>
<p>The reconstruction of synaptic conductance profiles is based on the current balance equation:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<graphic xlink:href="607656v3_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>C</italic> is the membrane capacitance, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> is the membrane potential, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>leak</italic></sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>leak</italic></sub> are the conductance and the reversal potential of the leak current respectively, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) are inhibitory and excitatory conductances (subject to retrieval), <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> are reversal potentials of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic currents, and <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>inj</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the injected current. We assume that the membrane potential of the cell is in instantaneous equilibrium (<italic>dV</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>/<italic>dt</italic> =0), which implies that the membrane time constant <italic>C</italic>/<italic>g</italic><sub><italic>leak</italic></sub>is much shorter than the time scale of the synaptic conductance variations. This assumption defines the time resolution of our method. For example, <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>leak</italic></sub> /<italic>C</italic> ratio in the respiratory interneurons was found to be in the range of 80 to 120 pS/pF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Koizumi &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>) corresponding to the membrane time constant values of about 10 ms. Synaptic inputs originate from the periodically active network. The respiratory cycle period in our <italic>in situ</italic> rat brainstem-spinal cord preparation typically spans approximately 3–4 seconds (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> <italic>and</italic> <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), yielding a time resolution of roughly 1/300 of the period. This approach to determining time resolution can be similarly applied to other systems.</p>

The red trace shows a moving median (MM) filtration with a 0.1s window of the voltage at higher voltage resolution in the 3<sup>rd</sup> trace. The MM filters out the spikes while preserving slow voltage waves.

(2) and (11)). Thick black lines are zero excitation (upper boundary) and zero inhibition (lower boundary) lines, respectively (see Eqs. (13) and (14)). The slopes of the lines correspond to the reversal potentials for inhibition and excitation. (<bold>D</bold>) Calculated dynamic components of synaptic conductances from the same recording using Eqs.

</fig>
<p>Another important assumption is that Equation (1) does not include voltage-dependent currents. This means that the equation is simplified to only consider the passive properties of the membrane, such as resistance and capacitance. To ensure that voltage-dependent currents are minimized during the recording, a hyperpolarizing current injection protocol is employed. This involves injecting a negative current into the neuron, which drives the membrane potential to a more negative value. In our test recordings the membrane potential typically held between -100 and -60 mV, and we primarily analyzed the data for these hyperpolarized voltages. At this hyperpolarized state, most voltage-gated ion channels are closed and do not significantly contribute to the neuronal current-voltage (I-V) relationships and affect interpretations of our conductance analyses. We note that there may be hyperpolarization-activated currents in the neurons studied, and in current-clamp recordings, non-linearity from such currents such as h-currents could introduce voltage-dependent changes in total conductance unrelated to synaptic inputs, potentially skewing the reconstruction. However, our data as detailed below consistently demonstrate linear I-V relationships across the voltage range tested for the set of neurons analyzed, indicating a minimal influence from such voltage-dependent currents.</p>
<p>The phase of the respiratory cycle was defined as a piece-wise linear function of time in the following way: <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) =(<italic>t</italic> − <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>)/(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic>+1</sub> − <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>), for times <italic>t</italic> between the time moments of two consecutive inspiratory phase onsets <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic>+1</sub>. Our approach was based on the idea that in a network exhibiting periodic dynamics, the synaptic conductances depend on the cycle phase, so that <italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i,e</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic>) =<italic>g</italic><sub><italic>i,e</italic></sub>(<italic>φ</italic>(<italic>t</italic>)). That is, for a periodic system, specifying that synaptic conductance depends on phase is mathematically equivalent to saying that the conductance depends on time in a periodic manner, and thus, a phase-based representation—where conductances are expressed as functions of the cycle’s phase—is a justified and effective approach for capturing their behavior. The respiratory cycle was divided into 100 bins of phase values, and for each bin the time moments {<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>ik</italic></sub>: <italic>φ</italic>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>ki</italic></sub>) ∈ [<italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>]} that correspond to phases in the bin were collected. For each phase bin <italic>ii</italic> of the respiratory cycle, the relationship between the injected current <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>inj</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>ik</italic></sub>) and the membrane potential <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>ik</italic></sub>), where <italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> are the times that correspond to the phase bin, appears fairly linear (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 Supplemental Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, by linear regression we can find the slope and <italic>V</italic>-intercept of this dependence in the form:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="607656v3_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>φφ</italic> =(<italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> + <italic>φ</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+1</sub>)/2 is the center of the bin. The slope <italic>R</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>) represents the total resistance, the intercept <italic>V</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>φ</italic>) is the effective resting potential for the phase of the cycle <italic>φ</italic>, and <italic>δV</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>(<italic>t</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub>) are random fluctuations of the membrane voltage. Total conductance <italic>G</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>) was calculated as the reciprocal of the total resistance, <italic>G</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>) =1/<italic>R</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>). The total conductance has static (phase-independent) and dynamic (phase-dependent) components. The latter is assumed to be a sum of dynamic components of the inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances. Synaptic conductances can also have static components whose combination cannot be distinguished from a static conductance of any other nature. Accordingly, we can think of the total conductance as a superposition of inhibitory and excitatory conductances whose static components form a static component of the total conductance, and their dynamic components underlie dynamic changes in the total conductance. Hence, the total current can be thought as a combination of the inhibitory and excitatory currents:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="607656v3_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> (<italic>φ</italic>) and <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>(<italic>φ</italic>) are inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances, and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> are corresponding reversal potentials. This equation must be fulfilled for any <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, therefore

<disp-formula id="eqn5">
<graphic xlink:href="607656v3_eqn5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>

<title>Reversal potential estimation</title>
<p>It is possible that during a certain part of the cycle, a neuron receives only one type of synaptic input, inhibitory or excitatory. Below is how this fact can be exploited for obtaining the estimates of reversal potentials for inhibition or excitation. For inhibition, after introducing

<p>Since the total excitatory synaptic conductance <italic>G</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>(<italic>φ</italic>) is greater or equal to its static component</p>
<p><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607656v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, from (12) it follows that a straight line on the (<italic>G, I</italic><sub>0</sub>)-plane described by

serves as an upper boundary of the reconstructed trajectory {<italic>G</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>), <italic>I</italic><sub>0</sub>(<italic>φ</italic>), <italic>φ</italic> ∈ [0,1]}. If we suppose that the neuron receives only phase-dependent inhibition in a certain range of phase, i.e., the excitatory synaptic conductance is equal to its static component in this range,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607656v3_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, then the trajectory moves strictly along the line described by (13) which can be referred to as a <italic>zero excitation line</italic>. By identifying the upper portion of the trajectory with nearly linear behavior we can perform linear regression of this portion to find its slope −<italic>E</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, and thus estimate the reversal potential for inhibition (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, for the phases of the cycle where only excitatory input is present, we can derive:
<disp-formula id="eqn14">
<graphic xlink:href="607656v3_eqn14.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="607656v3_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> is a static component of the inhibitory conductance and call it the <italic>zero inhibition line</italic>.

Together the zero excitation and zero inhibition lines form a wedge that bounds the trajectory, so hereinafter we refer to such plots as <italic>wedge diagrams</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the linear upper boundary of the trajectory was seen in almost all recordings processed implying that, first, during certain phase(s) of the respiratory cycle the interneurons indeed receive only inhibitory input, and second, we could use the identified parameters of the zero-excitation line to measure the inhibitory reversal potential. The same approach might be applied for the determination of the reversal potential for excitation if there was a certain range of phases when a cell received the excitatory input only. Since <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is expected to be close to 0 mV, this would be clearly identifiable by the presence of a nearly horizontal part of the curve serving as a lower boundary of the same. This kind of behavior was not found in most of the recordings, so, as commonly accepted, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> was set to -10 mV in those cases. However, as we demonstrate below, variation of reversal potentials over a wide range of possible values does not affect the shape of synaptic conductance profiles qualitatively.</p>

<p>Thus, targeting these regional microcircuits allowed us to test our methods for extracting various patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in two functionally distinct microcircuits. Also, there are various electrophysiological phenotypes of respiratory neurons with different patterns of neuronal spiking activity during the respiratory cycle in these regions, thus providing a diversity of rhythmic neuronal types to correlate with synaptic input patterns from our analysis, which is useful for illustrating the utility of our techniques for delineating various functional synaptic interactions. We have used sharp microelectrode intracellular recordings in mature rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations <italic>in situ</italic> (see Materials and methods) for our analysis since this approach allowed us to readily record deep in the brainstem in these targeted regions from multiple neurons under current- and voltage-clamp with a single electrode. This provides complementary information to test the robustness of our approach, which should be insensitive to the mode of intracellular recording. Although our techniques can be applied to any type of rhythmic neuron, we specifically targeted and analyzed interneurons, verified by immunochemistry (as described below and in Material and methods), which are the most technically challenging to record from due to small neuronal sizes and potential recording instability, but are functionally critical for analyzing synaptic mechanisms of neural activity pattern generation. Thus, we could test how our technique performs for important neuronal populations under recording conditions that would likely be encountered for many rhythmic interneuronal circuits in nervous systems.</p>

<title>Firing patterns of respiratory interneurons</title>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions the neuronal activity during the respiratory cycle consists of three main activity phases [inspiratory (I), post-inspiratory (post-I), and stage 2 or late expiratory (E2)] that are well documented in the literature (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lindsey <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Richter &amp; Smith, 2014</xref>). Previously described respiratory populations based on their specific firing patterns in relation to these different phases of the cycle (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) include pre-inspiratory/inspiratory (pre-I/I), ramping inspiratory (ramp-I), early-inspiratory (early-I), late inspiratory (late-I), post-inspiratory (post-I) and augmenting expiratory (aug-E, active during E2) neurons. We have recorded neurons from all these populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) and have analyzed and presented representative synaptic input patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) for each electrophysiological phenotype. In some cases, as an informative addition to our electrophysiological analyses, we labeled the recorded neurons by intracellular injection of biocytin contained in the electrode recording solution (see Materials and methods) for subsequent histological verification (<xref rid="fig2_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 1</xref>) of the recording location, interneuron identification, and in some cases neurotransmitter phenotype by immunohistochemistry (n=34 neurons total labeled). The latter enabled us to identify inhibitory neurons (glycinergic or GABAergic) (e.g., see <xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 2</xref>) for five of the neuron types (pre-I/I, ramp-I, early-I, post-I, aug-E) as described below, which aids in circuit analysis and the corroboration of inhibitory inputs from neurons with particular firing patterns.</p>

Within one population of the same electrophysiological phenotype, patterns of synaptic inputs were qualitatively similar, although there was neuron-to-neuron variability in calculated conductance values and details of the conductance profiles could vary (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) among multiple examples of each type of recorded neurons. From these temporal patterns of synaptic conductances, as explained below we infer functional connectomes or circuit motifs for each electrophysiological phenotype as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, which is an important outcome of our analyses. In general, these circuit connections motifs are constructed by considering that the different components of the synaptic conductance profiles are formed by convergent inputs from neuronal populations of specific firing phenotypes and, therefore, can be interpreted as reflecting activity patterns of these pre-synaptic populations. By matching these activity patterns with patterns of synaptic conductances in the recorded post-synaptic neurons, we can suggest functional connections between neuronal populations. The information on inhibitory transmitter phenotype for neurons with different firing patterns was also collected and indeed corroborates that subsets of the presynaptic neurons are inhibitory as inferred from the conductance profiles, which gives additional confidence in the correlation between pre-synaptic firing patterns and likely post-synaptic interactions.</p>

<caption><title>Inferred connections between different respiratory interneuronal populations.</title>
<p>By matching the firing phenotype of the receiver neuron and its synaptic inputs we infer possible motifs of interactions between the functional populations of the active network. In this representation, we assume that the functional connection between populations is present, if a post-synaptic neuron of a particular firing phenotype has a dynamic component of the synaptic conductance statistically significantly different from zero (see Materials and methods: Statistical significance) in the phase range corresponding to the activity pattern of the pre-synaptic population. Here we show two examples of such inferences for each phenotype representing the most straightforward interpretation of synaptic inputs (<bold><italic>A1, B1, C1, D1, E1 and F1</italic></bold>) as well as interactions involving the least number of populations (<bold><italic>A2, B2, C2, D2, E2 and F2</italic></bold>), reflecting the cell-to-cell variability in conductance profiles with some neurons within a given electrophysiological phenotype exhibiting the smaller set of synaptic inputs. Possible inhibitory/excitatory connections are shown by blue/red lines ending with blue circles/red arrows originating from presynaptic neurons and terminating at the post-synaptic neurons. Inhibitory sources are shown in blue, and the excitatory sources are shown in red. These circuit motifs are consistent with the patterns of synaptic inputs to the various neurons, as described in the text for each electrophysiological phenotype, and account for our immuno-histochemical identification of inhibitory neurons as subpopulations of most of the electrophysiological types as indicated in the text.</p></caption>

This schematic incorporates all of the possibilities inferred from our conductance analyses, and includes sets of mutual inhibitory interactions between inhibitory populations (post-I and aug-E; early-I and post-I, early-I and aug-E populations), inhibitory inputs to excitatory populations (post-I to pre-I/I and ramp-I; aug-E to ramp-I), and the pre-I/I and ramp-I excitatory synaptic drives. <bold>B</bold>. A functionally minimal circuit schematic previously suggested by Smith <italic>et al</italic>.

Similarities of the circuit interactions depicted in these two schematics include the inhibitory connectome with post-I and aug-E inhibition distributed throughout the network, the sets of mutual inhibitory interactions, and the strong pre-I/I excitatory inspiratory drive, while there are clearly additional features in our more elaborate circuit connectome in the new combinatorial schematic (<bold>A</bold>), including the inhibitory and excitatory neuronal counterparts and associated circuit interactions for post-I, aug-E, pre-I/I, and ramp-I neuron populations that were not included in the previous models. This connectivity suggests the idea that the excitatory subpopulations could drive the activity during their respective cycle phases and could synchronize activity of their inhibitory counterparts, whereas the inhibitory subpopulations appear to be important participants in orchestrating phase transitions and maintaining inhibition to other circuit populations during the active phases driven by the excitatory subpopulations.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>To illustrate in more detail how we have reconstructed the circuit connection motifs in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, we describe how we interpret and translate the synaptic conductance profiles for each electrophysiological phenotype.</p>
<p>Pre-I/I cells (n=25 neurons recorded in the preBötC) in all cases received decrementing expiratory inhibition, and augmenting excitation during late expiration as well as strong ramping inspiratory excitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A1-5</xref>). As shown In <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A1</xref>, a straight-forward interpretation of this pattern of conductances is that the pre-I/I population receives inhibitory inputs from post-I spiking neurons and excitatory inputs from aug-E and ramp-I populations. Alternatively, since a combination of aug-E and ramp-I excitatory inputs is qualitatively similar to an input from the pre-I/I population itself, it is also possible that excitatory pre-I/I neurons are recurrently interconnected within this population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A2</xref>). These possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and both connectivity patterns could be expressed in the respiratory circuits. We labeled 13 of these pre-I/I neurons during recording, two of which were identified as inhibitory neurons by neurotransmitter immuno-labeling for glycine or GABA (1 glycinergic and 1 GABAergic neuron identified), which is incorporated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F1</xref>.</p>
<p>Neurons with the ramp-I spiking patterns (n=24 recorded in preBötC) also received ramping inspiratory phase excitation, but unlike some pre-I/I cells, they generally showed strong synaptic inhibition throughout the post-inspiratory and late-expiratory (E2) phases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B1-5</xref>). Some of these neurons also received excitatory input during the E2 expiratory/pre-inspiratory phase. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that ramp-I neurons receive inhibitory inputs from post-I and aug-E populations as well as an excitatory input from pre-I/I neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B1</xref>). Another possibility is that the excitatory ramp-I neurons not receiving excitation during the pre-inspiratory phase have recurrent excitation within their population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B2</xref>). Four out of 7 of these neurons were labeled in the preBötC and identified as inhibitory (glycinergic) neurons (incorporated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4D1&amp;4E1</xref>).</p>
<p>All early-I spiking neurons (n=6 in preBötC) showed decrementing expiratory phase inhibition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C1-5</xref>). Most of these cells also received pre-inspiratory/late expiratory and inspiratory excitation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C1, 3-5</xref>), while some of them did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C2</xref>), which we interpret as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C1 and 4C2</xref>, respectively. The excitatory pre-I/I input can also be a combination of aug-E and ramp-I excitation as in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A1</xref>. One of the three labeled early-I neurons was identified as an inhibitory (GABAergic) neuron (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure2 Supplemental Figure 2</xref>), corroborating the early-I inhibitory inputs inferred from conductance profiles shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4 D1&amp;2, 4E1&amp;E2, 4F1&amp;F2</xref>.</p>
<p>Synaptic inputs to late-I cells (n=6 in preBötC) were similar to ramp-I neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D1-5</xref>) plus concurrent, inspiratory phase inhibition. So, in addition to inhibitory inputs from post-I and aug-E neurons and pre-I/I (in some cases) and ramp-I excitation, they likely receive inhibitory inputs from early-I spiking neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D1</xref>). Some of these cells showed neither inhibition nor excitation at the end of expiration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D2</xref>), so they might receive no aug-E inhibition and ramp-I rather than pre-I/I excitation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D2</xref>). These neurons were infrequently recorded, and none were successfully labeled for neurotransmitter type identification.</p>
<p>Post-I spiking neurons (n=40: 25 in preBötC, 15 in BötC), that always exhibit a decrementing firing pattern during expiration, received strong decrementing inhibition during inspiration, and incrementing inhibition during late expiration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E1-5</xref>). They also showed a relatively weak excitation during post-inspiration, usually accompanied by comparable in magnitude ramping excitation during inspiration. The corresponding circuit elements representing inputs to the post-I neurons are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E1</xref>. Since post-I neurons receive post-I excitation, it is possible that excitatory post-I cells form a population with recurrent excitatory interconnections. Besides, some of these neurons did not have any significant excitatory input during inspiration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E3</xref>). The latter possibilities are shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E2</xref>. Eight of the 20 post-I neurons labeled (5 in preBötC and 3 BötC neurons) were identified as glycinergic (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 2</xref>), consistent with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Ezure <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), and corroborating the post-I inhibitory inputs shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A1&amp;2, 4B1&amp;2, 4C1&amp;2, 4D1&amp;2, 4F1&amp;2</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, all the aug-E spiking neurons (n=19 recorded: 9 neurons in preBötC, 10 in BötC) received decrementing inhibitory inputs during expiratory and inspiratory phases as well as an excitatory input that started in the middle of expiration and incremented towards the end of expiration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F1-5</xref>). Some of these neurons received pre-inspiratory inhibition. We interpret this as the aug-E population receiving inputs from early-I, post-I and pre-I/I inhibitory populations and the excitatory input from aug-E neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F1</xref>). Similar to other interpretations, it is also possible that the excitatory aug-E neurons form a population with recurrent excitation with an augmenting pattern that matches their activity profile, while some of these neurons do not receive pre-I inhibition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F2</xref>). Three out of 6 of these neurons labeled were identified as glycinergic neurons (1 preBötC neuron and 2 BötC neurons) (<xref rid="fig2_S2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 Supplemental Figure 2</xref>), as inferred from the synaptic conductance profiles in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B1&amp;2, 4C1, 4D1, 4E1</xref>.</p>

<title>Synaptic conductance profiles from current- and voltage-clamp recordings</title>
<p>The traditional way to measure transmembrane currents is by voltage-clamp intracellular recordings. Using this experimental protocol, the membrane potential of the neuron is held at a constant level thus maintaining all voltage-dependent membrane currents at their steady states. Therefore, in voltage-clamp conditions any total current variations result exclusively from time-varying synaptic inputs, while in the current-clamp protocol variations of the voltage can potentially be contaminated by transient dynamics of the voltage-gated channels. However, the implementation of the voltage-clamp protocol is technically far more challenging with sharp high-impedance microelectrodes than injecting a constant current. By design, our technique is indifferent to what strategy is used for the injected current variations, so we performed both current- and voltage-clamp recordings from select neurons (n=10) where the voltage-clamp could be satisfactorily established following the current-clamp recording in each of these neurons and compared the results of the synaptic input interferences as a test of the reliability of our methods.</p>
<p><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance profiles extracted from current-(left) and voltage-clamp (right) segments of the intracellular recordings for 3 different types of representative neurons. It is evident that the shapes of the conductance profiles as well as the relationship between the excitatory and inhibitory conductances extracted are very similar. Quantitative variations in the amplitude of the synaptic inputs are similar to those observed when using different epochs of the same current-clamp recordings (see below). Thus, we conclude that our synaptic conductance inferences obtained by current clamp recordings favorably match the conductance profiles obtained from direct recordings of synaptic currents during voltage clamp.</p>

<title>Uncertainties concerned with estimates of synaptic reversal potentials</title>
<p>As noted, it was not always possible to identify linear portions of GI-contours suitable for reliable estimation of the reversal potentials. In addition, the procedure described does not imply an unequivocal way for finding the errors for the reversal potential estimates. Accordingly, for the synaptic input classification purposes, we varied the reversal potentials in the predefined ranges when using Eqs. (6) and (7) to calculate the synaptic conductances. We used the following ranges: [-20, 0] mV and [-110, -90] mV for the reversal potentials for excitation and inhibition, respectively. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> illustrates that although the absolute values of the conductances vary to some extent as we vary the reversal potentials, the shape of their reconstructed profiles remains consistent.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our analyses of synaptic conductance profiles in rhythmically active neurons from neuronal intracellular recordings, we propose that these profiles represent the convergent synaptic inputs from many neurons, and therefore represent the synaptic interactions of key functional populations operating in the active networks, which provides a basis for functional network reconstruction. Accordingly, a main objective of this study was to establish the utility and reliability of our technique, based on theoretical analyses and experimental validation, for extracting and separating profiles of inhibitory and excitatory conductances at high temporal resolution from intracellular recording data. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our technique by applying our analyses to infer synaptic inputs to rhythmically active respiratory neurons comprising key microcircuits within the medullary preBötC and BötC regions of the brainstem respiratory CPG, which provided a diversity of neuronal electrophysiological phenotypes in various rhythmic microcircuits to test the performance of our technique. Our approach extends previously proposed methods for extracting dynamic patterns of synaptic conductances in post-synaptic neurons in various other neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Borg-Graham <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Shu <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Berg <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Endo &amp; Kiehn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Wright &amp; Calabrese, 2011</xref>), by providing higher temporal resolution with nearly continuous readouts of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances, in our illustration throughout the respiratory cycle for different respiratory interneuron types. We have obtained previously unavailable synaptic conductance profiles for the different neuron populations, and illustrate how this analysis can be used to infer functional interactions and circuit configurations of interneuron populations, which demonstrates the utility of our technique. Below we further address technical issues affecting the robustness of our approach, and then discuss the general applicability to rhythmically active circuits.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Estimation of reversal potentials and errors in conductance analysis</title>
<p>We have noted above and evaluated uncertainties concerned with synaptic reversal potentials and assumptions about stability of the cellular properties and recordings on the inferred synaptic conductance profiles, but it is important to elaborate certain points. We have used an experimental preparation and setup that provides optimal stability for sharp electrode intracellular recordings. We used strict criteria for assessing and accepting the quality and stability of the recordings. For the most part, our analysis results for a given neuron that meets our criteria were reproducible for different recording epochs and conditions. We also generated continuous error estimates for each example shown and confirmed the statistical significance of conductance values. Regarding stationarity, our results suggest that any differences between the inferred conductance profiles for different recording epochs and conditions in most cases were comparable to those between recordings obtained by current- and voltage-clamp protocols.</p>
<p>Most neurons that we have analyzed receive inhibition only during certain parts of respiratory cycle regardless of whether they are inspiratory or expiratory neuron types. This allowed retrieving their reversal potentials for inhibition using the approach described in Materials and methods. Interestingly, the inhibitory synaptic reversal potentials retrieved turned out to vary significantly among cells between -62 mv and -116 mV. The reversal potential estimates were in good correspondence with actual reversals of inhibitory events when a cell was hyperpolarized below the reversal potential. Therefore, regarding the analysis, the results were reliable. Nevertheless, on average, reversal potentials were much more negative than what would have been expected. It is well known that in intracellular recordings, the length constant of the neuron and the distance of the microelectrode from the synaptic inputs determine the measured reversal potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calvin, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Spruston <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Wehr &amp; Zador, 2003</xref>). For the precise extraction of inhibitory and excitatory conductances from the total conductance, reversal potential values may be critical. The variability of the inhibitory reversal potential emphasizes the need to determine the reversal potential for each neuron separately. Otherwise, a wrong inhibitory reversible potential value used for the reconstruction may lead to incorrect conductance profiles. For example, a large positive bias in the inhibitory reversal potential will have the effect that a part of the inhibitory conductance may be mislabeled as excitatory conductance and therefore show a pattern of concurrent inhibition and excitation. Our method for the estimation of inhibitory reversible potential appeared very reliable when compared to the experimental estimates of the inhibitory reversal potential and essentially excluded the occurrence of this excitatory conductance artifact.</p>
<p>The absolute values of inhibitory and excitatory conductance calculated by the analysis are contaminated with an error depending on the length constant of the neuron and the distance of the microelectrode from the synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Calvin, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Wehr &amp; Zador, 2003</xref>). Importantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Wehr and Zador (2003)</xref> show that the estimate of timing of synaptic conductances is reliable and not influenced by the length constant of the neuron. Therefore, the conductance profiles extracted with our analysis are qualitatively reliable and the overall time course of inhibitory and excitatory conductances reflect the overall inhibitory and excitatory inputs to the different electrophysiological classes of active neurons analyzed.</p>

<title>Implications of reconstructed synaptic conductance profiles for respiratory functional circuit architecture</title>
<p>Our analysis revealed different sets of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances that are characteristic for the different populations of respiratory neurons. Indeed, our results suggest that phasic excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs that result from network interactions of these respiratory neuron populations shape membrane potential trajectories and spiking patterns of the neurons throughout the respiratory cycle. What can we learn from these results about the organization and operation of the underlying pattern generation networks?</p>
<p>We have suggested circuit motifs that are consistent with the patterns of synaptic inputs to the various neurons, and which also account for our immuno-histochemical identification of inhibitory neurons as subpopulations of most of the electrophysiological types. However, these circuit elements do not explain the overall dynamical operation of the circuits, particularly how the rhythm and the orderly generation of the multiple activity phases occurs. A more comprehensive synthesis of circuit interactions as illustrated below, and ultimately computational simulation studies (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lindsey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Molkov et al., 2017</xref>), are required. In <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1</xref> we illustrate the construction of a combinatorial circuit schematic of the functional connectivity from the neuronal population interactions suggested by our collection of circuit motifs.</p>
<p>Previously, computational models for core circuits of the respiratory CPG including interacting microcircuits in the preBötC and BötC regions have proposed a network organization with respiratory neuron population interactions that are capable from simulation studies with models incorporating circuit architectures (e.g., <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>) and neuronal and synaptic biophysical properties to generate a realistic respiratory rhythm and the three-phase rhythmic pattern of neuron and neuronal population activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lindsey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Molkov et al., 2017</xref>; Rubin, Shevtsova, Ermentrout, Smith, &amp; Rybak, 2009; Rybak et al., 2007). These include the model proposed by Smith, Abdala, Koizumi, Rybak, and Paton (2007) based on regional circuit mapping and electrophysiological studies with the mature rat <italic>in situ</italic> experimental preparation used in the present studies. Despite its plausibility, this and other models remain speculative because the experimental evidence for functional connectivity is mostly indirect.</p>
<p>Our cellular-based analysis provides a way of untangling functional connections within the respiratory CPG and testing computational models. By assuming the origin of these inputs according to the phase in which they occur, we can draw conclusions on the functional connections between the key respiratory neuron populations recorded here. Our synaptic conductance profiles are consistent with multiple features of the network architecture and interactions proposed by Smith et al. (2007) as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1B</xref>, which was suggested to be a minimal and sufficient circuit configuration to explain how the three-phase rhythmic respiratory pattern, including activity patterns of key interneuron populations in the medulla, can be generated. As reconstructed from our synaptic conductance profiles and collection of circuit motifs, there are new features in our more elaborate circuit connectome in the new combinatorial circuit schematic in <xref rid="fig4_S1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 Supplemental Figure 1A</xref> as noted in the supplemental figure legend. There are likely additional connectivity features that remain to be uncovered as the catalogue of intracellular recording data and inferred functional interactions is expanded from further studies. We note that the profiles of neuronal synaptic interactions that we consider are specific for the <italic>in situ</italic> reduced rat brainstem-spinal cord system, which has proven to be an important model system for understanding the operation of core CPG respiratory circuits in the medulla and pontine reticular formation that are operational in our experimental set-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Paton <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>), but cannot account for the supra-brainstem and peripheral circuit inputs in the nervous system <italic>in vivo</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lindsey <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Smith <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Paton <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>). Our objective here was to illustrate how our techniques can delineate the functional circuit interactions in an established core set of circuits in the respiratory CPG as an example of the utility of our approach that can be generally applied to rhythmic neural circuits as discussed below.</p>

<title>Applicability to other rhythmically active networks</title>
<p>Our method for extracting and separating phasic patterns of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic conductances from single neuronal intracellular recordings is broadly applicable to rhythmic circuits which are ubiquitous in nervous systems. Our approach involves phase-based analysis, where the network activity cycle is divided into activity phases to capture dynamic changes of synaptic input conductances throughout the activity cycle. This approach is relevant for any circuits with repetitive activity cycles, such as rhythmic CPG motor networks (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Calabrese &amp; Marder, 2024</xref>)) and circuits generating cortical rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Yuste <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The method is based on the general mathematical framework presented, involving current balance equations and linear regression to separate excitatory and inhibitory conductances, and therefore is applicable to different rhythmic neuron types and circuits and is suitable for diverse experimental setups. By providing high-resolution temporal profiles of synaptic inputs and outputs (below, based on neuronal spiking patterns), this method enables researchers to infer the functional connectivity and dynamic interactions within any rhythmically active network.</p>
<p>Applying this method, as we have illustrated for respiratory circuits, to other rhythmic networks such as locomotor or cortical circuits including sensory processing networks, follows a similar process for extracting neuronal excitatory and inhibitory inputs during different oscillatory phases of endogenous or sensory-driven periodic activity. This allows for the inference of functional synaptic input connections for any targeted neuron populations based on the timing and strength of the extracted synaptic inputs. In this context, functional populations are defined as groups of neurons with similar firing patterns with respect to the cycle phase. If the synaptic conductance profile of a recorded neuron contains a component that mirrors the firing pattern of a specific population, it can be inferred that there is a functional connection from that population to the recorded neuron. Similarly, in sensory processing networks, it can reveal how sensory inputs are synaptically integrated in neurons by examining synaptic conductance patterns in response, for example, to repetitive stimuli.</p>
<p>The approach that we have described is versatile since it is compatible with various recording protocols, such as current-clamp and voltage-clamp and different modes of intracellular recording (sharp electrode or whole-cell patch clamp). We note that our approach to defining functional connectivity does not provide information on locations of the sources of the synaptic inputs, although we can infer spiking patterns of the source neurons from the temporal features of the synaptic conductance profiles. These profiles represent the total synaptic inputs that can arise from many neurons possibly with short and long-range axonal projections to a given neuron. The capability of our approach to readout the total synaptic conductance and separate the excitatory and inhibitory components from all sources at high temporal resolution is a strength of our approach. These inferred neuronal population connections from the electrophysiological analyses provided by our technique can be further mapped and corroborated with other functional and anatomical approaches.</p>
<p>In summary, the versatility of our technique lies in its foundation on basic electrophysiological principles and adaptability to different rhythmic activities making it a powerful tool for investigating a wide range of rhythmically active neuronal networks and potentially offering insights into their functional organization and dynamic operations.</p>

Briefly, preheparinzed (1,000 units, given intraperitoneally) rats (Sprague-Dawley, 45-70g; male) were anaesthetized deeply with 5% isoflurane and the portion of the body caudal to the diaphragm was removed. The head and thorax were immersed in ice-chilled carbogenated Ringer solution and the brain was decerebrated at a precollicular level. The descending aorta, phrenic nerve, central vagus and hypoglossal nerves were surgically isolated. The dorsal brainstem was exposed by craniotomy and cerebellectomy. To achieve the mechanical stability necessary for intracellular recordings, the great veins and heart were removed. The preparation was transferred to a recording chamber and the descending aorta cannulated with a double lumen catheter for perfusion and recording of perfusion pressure with a pressure transducer. A hydraulic damping Windkessel chamber was used in the perfusion circuit immediately downstream from the output of the roller pump (Watson-Marlow, Wilmington, MA) to eliminate peristaltic flow pulsations that affect stability of the sharp electrode intracellular recordings.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recordings and neuron labeling</title>
<p>Efferent activity of the phrenic (PN) and central vagus (VN) nerves were recorded simultaneously with glass suction electrodes and their activities were amplified, filtered (0.3–6.0 KHz), rectified and integrated (50 ms time constant). Sharp microelectrode somatic intracellular recordings were made in the preBötC and BötC regions. The brainstem was mapped by recording population activity of neurons in the medulla oblongata with an extracellular electrode (5–10 MOhm) prior to intracellular recording. The position of the electrode was monitored by software that kept track of the micromanipulator mechanical coordinates. Once the region of the preBötC or BötC was identified by rhythmic inspiratory/expiratory population activity, coordinates were saved and in some cases the brainstem surface was marked with pontamine sky blue dye. Intracellular recordings were made with fine tipped glass microelectrodes (45 to 70 MOhm) pulled from borosilicate glass capillaries. The microelectrodes for intracellular recording were driven into the recording site by a combination DC motor driven micromanipulator with an integrated piezotranslator (PM10-1, Marzhauser Wetzlar, Germany), allowing high stepping speeds for cell penetration. A dual current clamp-voltage clamp amplifier (SEC-05X, NPI, Tamm, Germany) was used to amplify the signals in bridge and discontinuous current clamp (DCC) recording modes. Discontinuous single electrode voltage clamp (SEVC) recordings were obtained by exploiting the high switching frequencies and electrode capacity compensation of the SEC-05X system, allowing high fidelity SEVC recordings with the high resistance sharp microelectrodes used. The microelectrodes were filled with a solution of 2 M potassium acetate (KAc) and 0.1 M potassium chloride (KCl) and 4% neurobiotin. During recordings some neurons were labeled by ionophoresis of neurobiotin into the cell. All recordings were digitized via a CED 1401-plus multi-channel interface and acquired (6–12 kHz digitization rates) using CED Spike 2 software.</p>

The period of time from the onset of the phrenic burst to the beginning of the next phrenic burst was used as reference cycle. The beginning of a phrenic burst was determined as 10% of phrenic amplitude in the rectified and low pass filtered (time constant = 0.05s) extracellular recording. We only analyzed recordings from respiratory neurons that fulfilled the following criteria: (1) The coefficient of variation of the respiratory cycle period was &lt;10%; (2) At least three steps of current injections were made during intracellular recording that were kept constant for at least 5 respiratory cycles each.</p>

The electrophysiological techniques and results are of high quality, and the analytical work is novel and potentially powerful, yet with several untested assumptions underlying the approach.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>By measuring intracellular changes in membrane voltage from a single neuron of the medulla the authors attempted to develop a method for determining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive onto a single neuron.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This data-driven approach to explore neural circuits is described well in this study and could be valuable in identifying microcircuits that generate rhythms. Importantly, perhaps, this inference method could enable microcircuits to be studied without the need for time-consuming anatomical tracing or other more involved electrophysiological techniques. Therefore, I can see the value in developing an approach of this type.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The implications of several assumptions associated with this inference technique have been considered by the authors.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it is my understanding that this approach assumes a linear I-V when extracting information about the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances (see equations 6 and 7). In Figure 6, the authors explore the impact of varying the reversal potential for the extraction of information about synaptic drive, but this still assumes that the underlying conductance is linear. However, open rectification will be a feature of any conductance generated by asymmetric distributions of ions (see the GHK current equation) and will therefore be a particular issue for the inhibition resulting from asymmetrical Cl- ion gradients across GABA-A receptors as well as the K+ conductance indirectly activated by GABA-B receptor activation. The mixed cation conductance that underlies most synaptic excitation will also generate a non-linear I-V relationship due to the inward rectification associated with polyamine block of AMPA receptors. The authors present evidence that the I-V relationship is linear over most of the voltage range examined, and this is a helpful addition. The authors have discussed the absence of active conductances contributing to the I-V, but I still wonder how the extraction of information concerning the excitatory and inhibitory conductances relies on the assumption of a linear I-V for these conductances.</p>
<p>This approach has similarities to earlier studies undertaken in the visual cortex that estimated the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductance changes that contributed to membrane voltage changes during receptive field stimulation. However, these approaches also involved the recording of transmembrane current changes during visual stimulation that were undertaken in voltage-clamp at various command voltages to estimate the underlying conductance changes. Molkov et al have attempted to essentially deconvolve the underlying conductance changes without this information and I am concerned that this simply may not be possible. However, I appreciate the efforts taken by the authors to address this issue.</p>
<p>The current balance equation (1) cited in this study is based upon the parallel conductance model developed by Hodgkin &amp; Huxley. One key element of the HH equations is the inclusion of an estimate of the capacitive current generated due to the change in voltage across the membrane capacitance. While the present study considers the impact of membrane capacitance, a deeper discussion on how variations in capacitance across different neuron types might affect inference accuracy would be useful. Differences in capacitance could introduce variability in inferred conductances, potentially influencing model predictions.</p>
<p>Studies using acute slicing preparations to examine circuit effects have often been limited to the study of small microcircuits, especially feedforward and feedback interneuron circuits. It is widely accepted that any information gained from this approach will always be compromised by the absence of patterned afferent input from outside the brain region being studied. In this study, descending control from the Pons and the neocortex will not be contributing much to the synaptic drive and ascending information from respiratory muscles will also be absent completely. This may not have been such a major concern if this study had been limited to demonstrating the feasibility of a methodological approach. However, this limitation does need to be considered when using an approach of this type to speculate on the prevalence of specific circuit motifs within the medulla (Figure 4). Therefore, I would argue that some discussion of this limitation should be included in this manuscript.</p>

<p>I still believe the case for the method is not as convincing as it would have been if the method had been validated first on oscillations produced by a known CPG model. Why would the inference of synaptic types from the model CPG voltage oscillations be predetermined? Such inverse problems are quite complicated and their solution is often not unique or sufficiently constrained. Recovering synaptic weights (or CPG parameters) from limited observations of a highly nonlinear system is not warranted (Gutenkunst et al., Universally sloppy parameter sensitivities in systems biology models, PLoS Comp. Biol. 2007; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030189">www.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030189</ext-link>) especially when using surrogate biological models like Hodgkin-Huxley models.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The model of the CPG is irrelevant for such a test of validity because what we reconstruct are postsynaptic conductances of an individual neuron. The network creates a periodic input to this neuron and thus forms a periodic pattern of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The nature of this input, whether autonomously generated or created artificially (say by periodic optogenetic stimulation), is generally not important. To illustrate this, we used a one-compartment conductance-based (Hodgkin-Huxley style) model neuron incorporating a certain common set of channels (fast sodium (<italic>I<sub>NaF</sub></italic>), potassium delayed rectifier (<italic>I<sub>Kdr</sub></italic>), persistent sodium (<italic>I<sub>NaP</sub></italic>), calcium-dependent potassium (<italic>I<sub>KCa</sub></italic>), and cationic non-specific current (<italic>I<sub>CAN</sub></italic>)), as well as excitatory and inhibitory synaptic channels whose conductances were implemented as predefined periodic functions. The test suggested by the reviewer would be to implement a current-step protocol similar to the experiments and apply our technique to see if the reconstructed conductance profiles match those predefined functions. Below we show the reconstruction steps for the following arbitrarily chosen pattern:</p>
<p>𝑔<sub>𝐸𝑋𝐶</sub>(𝑡) /𝑔<sub>𝐿𝐸𝐴𝐾</sub> = 0.1(1 + sin(π𝑡)) and 𝑔<sub>𝐼𝑁𝐻</sub>(𝑡)/𝑔<sub>𝐿𝐸𝐴𝐾</sub> = 0.1 (1 + cos(π𝑡)). Author response image 1 below shows the baseline activity of this model neuron in the absence of the injected current.</p>
<fig id="sa2fig1">
<label>Author response image 1.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-101959-sa2-fig1.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>Then we applied a current-step protocol with four steps producing different levels of hyperpolarization and applied our method by calculating the total conductance using linear regression (see the current-voltage plots below) and then decomposing it into the excitatory and inhibitory components.</p>
<fig id="sa2fig2">
<label>Author response image 2.</label>
<graphic mime-subtype="jpg" xlink:href="elife-101959-sa2-fig2.jpg" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>As one can see, the reconstructed conductances in Author response image 3 below are nearly identical to their theoretical profiles. This is not surprising because all voltage-dependent currents in the model neuron were inactive in the range of voltages matching our experimental conditions. Therefore, the model could be reduced to just the leak current, synaptic currents and the injected current, which matches precisely the model we used in our manuscript.</p>

<p>In p.2, the edited section refers to the interspike interval being much smaller than the period of the network. More important is to mention the relationship between the decay time of inhibitory synapses and the period of the network.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This interpretation misunderstands the focus of our method. The edited sections (including in the theory section of Results) highlight the conditions under which the capacitive current becomes negligible, emphasizing that the membrane time constant must be much smaller than the network oscillation period. This separation of time scales ensures that the membrane potential adjusts quickly to changes in postsynaptic conductance, rendering the capacitive current insignificant over the network’s rhythm. In contrast, the synaptic decay time governs how presynaptic inputs are transduced into postsynaptic conductances—a process relevant to understanding synaptic dynamics but not directly tied to our method’s core objective. Our approach reconstructs postsynaptic conductances from intracellular recordings, not presynaptic spike trains. While interpreting these conductance profiles in terms of specific synaptic connections would indeed involve synaptic decay dynamics, such an analysis exceeds the scope of our paper. Thus, the condition emphasized in the edited sections—concerning the membrane time constant and network period—is the critical one for our method’s applicability, and the synaptic decay time, while relevant to broader synaptic modeling, does not undermine our conclusions.</p>
<p>We have added the requirement for a much smaller membrane time constant in the Introduction on page 2. The Results theory section already incorporates an extensive discussion of this requirement.</p>

<p><bold>Comments from the editors:</bold></p>
<p>We apologize for the delay in coming to this decision, but there was quite a bit of post-review discussion that needed to be resolved. There are two issues that the reviewers agree should be addressed. They remain unconvinced that the simplifying assumptions of the approach are valid. 1) The main issue with the phase argument is that the biological synaptic conductance depends on time and not on the phase of the respiratory cycle as mentioned in the first round of reviews. The approximation g(t)=g(phase) seems to be far too simple to be biologically realistic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As we elaborate below,  time and phase are fundamentally and mathematically equivalent representations of the same underlying dynamics in a periodic system, and thus, a phase-based representation—where conductances are expressed as functions of the cycle’s phase—is a justified and effective approach for capturing their behavior. We have added this explanation to the theory section of Results. Below are the bases for our assertion.</p>
<p>In a periodic system, such as the respiratory CPG, the system’s behavior repeats at regular intervals, defined by a period T. For the respiratory cycle in our experimental preparation, this period is approximately 3–4 seconds, encompassing phases like inspiration, post-inspiration, and expiration. In such systems:</p>
<p>Time (t) is a continuous variable that progresses linearly.</p>
<p>Phase (φ) represents the position within one cycle, typically normalized between 0 and 1 (or 0 to 2π in some contexts). It can be mathematically related to time via: φ(t) = (t mod T)/T, where (t mod T) is the time elapsed within the current cycle.</p>
<p>Because the system is periodic, any variable that repeats with period T—such as synaptic conductance in a rhythmically active network—can be expressed as a function of either time or phase. Specifically, if g(t) is periodic with period T, then g(t) = g(t+T). This periodicity allows us to redefine g(t) in terms of phase: g(t) = g(φ(t)), where φ(t) maps time onto a repeating cycle. Thus, in a periodic system, time and phase are fundamentally equivalent representations of the same underlying dynamics. Saying that synaptic conductance depends on phase is mathematically equivalent to saying it depends on time in a periodic manner.</p>
<p>In a rhythmically active network like the respiratory central pattern generator (CPG), the synaptic conductances, regardless of the specific mechanisms by which they are formed, exhibit periodicity that matches the network’s oscillatory cycle. This occurs because the conductances are driven by the repetitive activity of presynaptic neurons, which are synchronized to the network’s overall rhythm. As a result, the synaptic conductances vary with the same period as the network, making a phase-based representation—where conductances are expressed as functions of the cycle’s phase—a justified and effective approach for capturing their behavior. In our study, we utilized the in situ arterially perfused brainstem-spinal cord preparation from mature rats, which is known to produce a highly periodic respiratory rhythm. To ensure the consistency of this periodicity, we carefully selected recordings where the coefficient of variation of the respiratory cycle period was less than 10%, as outlined in our methods. This strict selection criterion confirms the stability and regularity of the rhythm, supporting the validity of using a phase representation to analyze the synaptic conductances.</p>

<p>(2) Figure S1 is problematic. First, the currents injected appear to be infinitesimally small.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There was a typo in the current units, which should be nA and not pA, as evident from the injected current–membrane potential plots in Figure 1B. Figure S1 has been corrected.</p>

<p>Second, the input resistance is completely independent of voltage, as though there was little or no contribution from hyperpolarization activated currents, which would be surprising.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While hyperpolarization-activated currents are indeed present in many neuronal types and could theoretically affect input resistance, our data consistently show linear I-V relationships across the voltage range tested (-60 to -100 mV) for the neurons analyzed (see Figure S1 and Author response image 4-9 below). This linearity suggests that, under our experimental conditions, the contribution of voltage-dependent currents, such as h-currents, is negligible within this range.</p>
<p>Additionally, we now indicate in the manuscript in the theory section of Results how the presence of significant hyperpolarization-activated h-currents would impact our synaptic conductance reconstruction method. In current-clamp recordings, non-linearity from h-currents could introduce voltage-dependent changes in total conductance unrelated to synaptic inputs, potentially skewing the reconstruction. However, this concern does not apply to voltage-clamp recordings, where the membrane potential is held constant, eliminating contributions from voltage-dependent intrinsic currents. As strong evidence of the minimal influence of h-currents, we directly compared synaptic conductance reconstructions using both current-clamp and voltage-clamp protocols in a subset of neurons. The results from these two approaches were highly consistent, indicating that h-currents do not significantly affect our findings. This robustness across experimental methods reinforces the reliability of our conclusions.</p>
<p>Together, the linear I-V relationships and the agreement between current- and voltage-clamp reconstructions provide compelling evidence that our method accurately captures synaptic conductances without interference from h-currents.</p>
<p>Typical examples of I-V relationships for each respiratory neuron firing phenotype:</p>
