<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Temperature determines the geographical distribution of organisms and affects the outbreak and damage of pests. Insects seasonal polyphenism is a successful strategy adopted by some species to adapt the changeable external environment. <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li) showed two seasonal morphotypes, summer-form and winter-form, with significant differences in morphological characteristics. Low temperature is the key environmental factor to induce its transition from summer-form to winter-form. However, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we firstly confirmed that low temperature of 10°C induced the transition from summer-form to winter-form by affecting the cuticle thickness and chitin content. Subsequently, we demonstrated that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> functions as a temperature receptor to regulate this transition. In addition, miR-252 was identified to mediate the expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> to involve in this behavioral transition. Finally, we found <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>, two rate-limiting enzymes of insect chitin biosyntheis, act as the critical down-stream signal of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> in mediating this behavioral transition. Taken together, our results revealed that a novel signal transduction cascade mediates the seasonal polyphenism in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. These findings not only lay a solid foundation for fully clarifying the ecological adaptation mechanism of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> outbreak, but also broaden our understanding about insect polymorphism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Currently, global climate change is the most important environmental problem facing with mankind, and also one of the most complex challenges in the 21st century. Insects, as the largest animal population on the earth, adapt to the complex and changeable external environment by displaying polyphenism, thus achieving the purpose of survival and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). Insect polyphenism is the phenomenon allows them within a given genotype to produce two or more distinct phenotypes under the challenges posed by environmental variability via beneficial shifts in morphology, behavior, or physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cridge et al., 2015</xref>). Polyphenism is commonly observed in many insect species, for examples: the solitary and gregarious phases of <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ma et al., 2011</xref>), the short-winged and long-winged morph of <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), the wingless and winged aphid of <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>), and the catkin and twig morphs in caterpillars of the moth <italic>Nemoria arizonaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). With the global climate problems are increasingly prominent, the study of insect polyphenism has become a new hotspot in insect ecology, epigenetics and developmental biology.</p>
<p>Pear psylla is a serious pest of pear trees worldwide, including <italic>Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Yang &amp; Li), <italic>Psylla Betulaefoliae</italic>, <italic>Psylla Pyri</italic>, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, belongs to Hemiptera: Psyllidae, which exclusively feeds on pear trees, harms the young shoots and leaves with adult and nymph, and secretes a large amount of honey dew to breed coal pollution bacteria of <italic>Gloeodes pomigena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). It is also an important vector of the destructive disease of pear trees, <italic>Erwinia amovora</italic>, and currently one of the key pests in the major pear production areas in many East Asian countries, including China and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hildebrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ge et al., 2019</xref>). In most pear production areas of China, the summer-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> are usually present from April to September, whereas winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> are present during the rest of the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). The summer-form has lighter body color and stronger activity ability, and causes more serious damage compare with winter-form. For better adapt to the harsh environmental conditions, the eggs of summer-form develop to the winter-form before the pear fallen leaves. The winter-form has brown to dark brown body color and larger body size, but has the weaker activity ability and stronger resistance ability compare with summer-form. With the gradual increase of temperature in early spring, the winter-form lays eggs at the tender buds of pear trees and then develop into summer-form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ge et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, the transition between summer-form and winter-form is a significant ecological strategy for <italic>C. chinensis</italic> to avoid adverse environmental conditions and then burst into disaster, which has prominence biological and ecological significance. The seasonal polyphenism of summer-form and winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> has been recognized for many years and could be induced by low temperature and short day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oldfield, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Tougeron et al., 2021</xref>), but until recently no molecular mechanism had been advanced.</p>
<p>Temperature is a significant factor limiting the geographic ranges of species, which determines the distribution and diffusion area of species. As a type of small poikilothermic animal, insect is sensitive to temperature changes and temperature stress response is one of the most conservative mechanism to resist extreme environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Teets et al., 2023</xref>). Different environmental conditions affect the polyphenism of many kinds of insects, for examples, wing dimorphism of Hemiptera <italic>Schizaphis graminum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">An et al., 2012</xref>), diapause of Lepidoptera <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tsuchiya et al., 2021</xref>) and Coleoptera <italic>Colaphellus bowringi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Guo et al., 2021</xref>). Under the low temperature conditions, insects can improve cold tolerance by regulating their internal energy metabolism and external exoskeleton system. Such as: darken their cuticles with melanin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fedorka et al., 2013</xref>), thickened wax layer or chorion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kreß et al., 2016</xref>), and store more lipids to increase energy supply and increase the accumulation of antifreeze protective substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Terblanche et al., 2011</xref>). However, studies about how insect temperature receptor response to temperature change and then activates the downstream signal molecules to regulate the polyphenism have been very limited.</p>
<p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family gene was firstly found in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Minke et al., 1975</xref>). The TRP channel genes involved in temperature sensing are called “thermo-sensitive TRP” or “temperature receptor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, there are six thermo-sensitive TRP receptor genes, of which TRPV1-4 mainly feel moderate high temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>) and TRPM8 can be activated by low temperature (8°C-28°C) or cooling substances, such as menthol and borneol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Peier et al., 2002</xref>). The activation mode is mainly due to the depolarization of cell membrane caused by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">McKemy et al., 2002</xref>). Presently, researches on the function of temperature receptor gene TRP were mainly focused on some model insects, but very few on the agricultural pests. For example, <italic>D. melanogaster TRPM</italic> is highly expressed in dendritic sensory neurons and can sense cold stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>B. mori</italic>, high temperature receptor <italic>BmTRPA1</italic> regulates the diapause of offspring eggs by acting on the neuroendocrine hormone signal of GABAergic-GnRH/Crz-DH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Sato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Tsuchiya et al., 2021</xref>). However, studies on agricultural insects, such as <italic>Apolygus lucorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2016</xref>), <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>a), <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai et al., 2018</xref>), and <italic>Tuta absoluta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>b), also only focused on the identification of the related temperature receptor gene TRPs and its correlation with temperature, no detailed molecular mechanism were reported. In agricultural insects, members of TRPA subfamily are mainly responsible for answering the high-temperature stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Neely et al., 2011</xref>), while members of TRPM subfamily are mainly involved in low-temperature stimulation as temperature receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rosenzweig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Turner et al., 2016</xref>). Temperature significantly affected the annual generations, adult survival rate, hibernation period and egg laying period of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Butt and Stuart, 1986</xref>). Our preliminary research results found that low temperature is the key factor to induce the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. Therefore, we speculated that <italic>TRPM</italic>, functions as a temperature receptor gene, may participate in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature, but the specific molecular mechanism needs to be further explored.</p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA molecules, were encoded by endogenous genes in a length of about 18-25 nt. They mainly regulate many life processes, including cell differentiation, organ development, cell apoptosis, biological rhythm and metamorphosis development in animals and plants at the post-transcriptional level by inhibiting the translation process of target genes or degrading the mRNA of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Asgari, 2013</xref>). In recent years, more and more studies reported that miRNAs are involved in regulating the insect polymorphism, such as the caste differentiation of honeybees, the phenotypic plasticity of <italic>L. migratoria</italic> and the wing pleomorphism of <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ye et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, miRNAs also play important roles in insect adaptation to temperature stress. For examples, miR-7 and miR-8 involved in the process of temperature adaptation of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kennell et al., 2012</xref>). MiRNAs were also found in responding to low temperature stress in rice water weevil (<italic>Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus</italic>) and gall midge (<italic>Epiblema Scudderiana</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yang et al., 2017</xref>a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lyons et al., 2015</xref>). There were also reported that miR-204 targeted <italic>TRPM3</italic> to regulate mammalian eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shiels, 2020</xref>), and miR-135a targeted <italic>TRPC1</italic> to participate in podocyte injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yang et al., 2017</xref>b). Here, we screened and validated miR-252, a miRNA whose expression was down-regulated under low temperature, negatively targeted <italic>CcTRPM</italic> to modulate the transition from summer-form to winter-form by acting on the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Chitin biosynthesis signal was also proved to involve in the transition from summer-form to winter-summer in response to <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and miR-252. Our work not only promotes the comprehensive understanding of the adaptation mechanism for <italic>C. chinensis</italic> outbreak at the physiological and ecological level as well as the insect polymorphism, but also helpful in identifying potential target genes in pest control through blocking temperature adaptation of pests.</p>

<title>Low temperature induced the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title>
<p><italic>C. chinensis</italic> was displayed as seasonal polyphenism along with seasonal changes: the summer-form and the winter-form. The significant differences in morphological characteristics are as following: (1) Eggs are long oval shape with a thin tip and a blunt end. Eggs of summer-form are milky white at the initial stage and gradually become yellow white at the later stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Eggs of winter-form are mostly yellowish brown or orange (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>’). (2) The nymph has five instars and its body size is gradually increasing with age. The body of the newly hatched nymph is oval and the compound eyes are red. The 1st instar nymph of summer-form is light yellow and transparent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The 3rd and 5th instar nymphs of summer-form are yellow-green or blue-yellow, and the wing buds are oblong, protruding and sticking to both sides of the body (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). The 1st instar nymph of winter-form has many black stripes on the chest back plate, and the end of the abdomen and back are black (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>’). The 3rd and 5th instar nymphs of winter-form are overall black brown, with dark brown stripe on the left and right sides of each section on the chest and back of the abdomen, and the end of the abdomen and back becomes a large piece with black brown color (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>’ and 1D’). (3) The antennae of adults are filamentous with 10 nodes, and the front wings are translucent and oblong. The body color of summer-form adult is green or yellow-green with yellow-brown stripes on the shield of the chest and back plate, and no stripes on the wings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The body color of winter-form adult is brown or dark brown, with dark brown stripes on the whole body, and clearly brown stripes on the rear edges of the front wings (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>’).</p>

<p>To clarify the effect of temperatures on the transition from summer-form to winter-form, the newly-hatched 1st instar summer-form nymphs were treated with four different temperatures (25°C, 20°C, 15°C, and 10°C). The results indicated that all the survived treated nymphs develop to the 3rd instar summer-form nymphs at 25°C, approximately 17% and 40% of survived treated nymphs develop to the 3rd instar winter-form nymphs at 20°C and 15°C, but all the survived treated nymphs develop to the 3rd instar winter-form nymphs at 10°C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). It meant that low temperature (especially 10°C) was the key environment factor to induce the transition from summer-form to winter-form and 10°C was selected for the following study. In addition, two cooling agents, menthol and borneol, were also used to mimic the low temperature effect of 10°C. We observed that about 49% and 37% of the survived treated nymphs develop to the 3rd instar winter-form nymphs after menthol and borneol treatment at 25°C, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>
<p>To further explore the differences between summer-form and winter-form nymphs, cuticle thicknesses and cuticle chitin content were determined. The ultrastructure results of transmission electron microscopy assays showed that cuticle thicknesses of 3rd instar winter-form (about 3.86 μm) were obviously higher than 3rd instar summer-form (about 1.82 μm) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1I</xref>). We also found that winter-form nymphs exhibited higher chitin level in cuticle compared to the summer-form nymphs by using the WGA-FITC staining and chitin content determination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1K</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that low temperature of 10°C induced the transition of summer-form to winter-form by affecting the cuticle thicknesses and cuticle chitin content.</p>

<title><italic>CcTRPM</italic> is a conventional cold-sensing TRP channel activated by 10°C in <italic>C. chinensis</italic></title>
<p>A cDNA fragment, which was putatively encoded a cold-sensing TRPM channel gene, was identified as <italic>CcTRPM</italic> from <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. The full-length sequence of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was amplified and verified by RT-PCR with specific primers (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>) and sequencing. Sequence analysis displayed that the ORF of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was 4566 bp with a 455 bp 3’UTR and encoded a deduced polypeptide of 1521 amino acids with six transmembrane domains. Multiple alignment analysis of the amino acid sequence indicated that the transmembrane domains of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> shared very high amino acid identity with TRPM sequences from other five selected insect species (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>).

<p>The results of temperature treatment indicated that the mRNA expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was obviously induced by 10°C treatment at 3, 6, and 10 days compared with 25°C treatment by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). It is well known that the TRPM subfamily channels in vertebrates are activated by a variety of chemical compounds, including menthol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Peier et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore attempted to identify chemical compounds that either activate or inhibit <italic>CcTRPM</italic>. qRT-PCR results revealed that menthol treatment with all three concentrations significantly increased the mRNA expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and antagonist (HY-112430, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) treatment with all three concentrations markedly reduced <italic>CcTRPM</italic> transcription (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F</xref>-<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2G</xref>). To further confirm <italic>CcTRPM</italic> is a cold-sensing TRP channel gene, fluorescence detection of Fluo-4 AM and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging was performed to determine whether CcTRPM-expressing cells increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration upon menthol treatment. The results of fluorescence detection of Fluo-4 AM indicated that there was no change of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in CcTRPM-expressing cells was treated with DMSO, but a clear increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was observed when treated with menthol which was similar with the trend of pcDNA-expressing cells was treated with the positive control of ionomycin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The effect of menthol on <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was further tested using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and showed that menthol obviously elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in CcTRPM-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). We therefore concluded that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> is a cold-sensitive ion channel activated by 10°C low temperature and menthol.</p>

<title><italic>CcTRPM</italic> modulated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> in response to low temperature</title>
<p>Temporal expression profiles by qRT-PCR revealed that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> mRNA expressed in all determined stages, with the highest expression level in the 1st instar nymph, and showed a decreased trend from 2nd instar nymph to adult 1 day (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>).

<p>To study whether <italic>CcTRPM</italic> modulated the transition from summer-form to winter-form of <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, the newly-hatched 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with dsCcTRPM or dsEGFP. For the RNAi efficiency under 10°C condition, feeding of dsCcTRPM reduced the transcription level of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> by about 61% and 62% compare to dsEGFP feeding at 3 d and 6 d by qRT-PCR (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>), and decreased the CcTRPM-Cy3 signal at 6 d by FISH (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Both results of cuticle ultrastructure and cuticle chitin content determination showed that cuticle thicknesses (about 1.97 μm) and cuticle chitin content of dsCcTRPM-treated nymphs were markedly lower than dsEGFP-treated nymphs (about 3.71 μm) under 10°C condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Additionally, dsCcTRPM feeding and <italic>CcTRPM</italic> antagonist treatment both significantly decreased the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form, but menthol feeding only partially rescued the transition percent and morphological phenotype under dsCcTRPM feeding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). To exclude the effect of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> itself on the transition percent and nymph development, we also performed the RNAi assays under 25°C condition.

<title>Confirming of miR-252 targeted <italic>CcTRPM</italic></title>
<p>To explore the regulation mechanism of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> at the post-transcriptional level, two software programs of miRanda and Targetscan were used to predict the potential miRNAs. There are four miRNAs (miR-252, miR-5728, PC-3p-173924, and PC-3p-137568) were predicted to have the corresponding target-binding sites with the 3’UTR of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and S4A). miR-252 showed the opposite expression patterns with <italic>CcTRPM</italic> after 25°C and 10°C treatments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). To further determine whether miR-252 specifically targeted <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, the following four experimental approaches were performed: (1) The dual-luciferase reporter assays were carried out by cloning a 419 bp 3’UTR fragment of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> containing the predicted target binding sites of the miRNAs. The relative luciferase activities were obviously decreased when the agomir-252 and CcTRPM-3’UTR-pmirGLO were cotransfected, while the activity recovered to the control when using the mutated 3’UTR sequence without the binding sites of miR-252 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, the relative luciferase activities were no change when the construct of CcTRPM-3’UTR-pmirGLO was cotransfected with the agomir of other three miRNAs, respectively (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). (2) An RNA immunoprecipitation assay indicated that the transcripts of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and miR-252 increased 6.35-fold and 9.21-fold from the agomir-252 feeding nymphs of the Ago-1 antibody-mediated RNA complex compared to an IgG control, separately (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and S5). (3) FISH results showed that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and miR-252 were co-expressed in the nymphs and displayed an opposite expression trend along with the increasing instar (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). (4) qRT-PCR results indicated that agomir-252 feeding significantly inhibited <italic>CcTRPM</italic> mRNA expression and antagomir-252 feeding markedly increased <italic>CcTRPM</italic> mRNA expression compare to their controls, separately (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>).

<p>To deeply decipher the role of miR-252 in the transition from summer-form to winter-form, 1st instar nymphs of summer-form were fed with agomir-NC or agomir-252 under 10°C condition. Results of cuticle ultrastructure indicated that cuticle thickness of agomir-252 treated nymphs (about 1.85 μm) was markedly lower than agomir-NC treated nymphs (about 3.70 μm) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Both WAG-FITC staining and chitin content determination revealed that cuticle chitin content of agomir-252 treated nymphs were obviously lower than agomir-NC treated nymphs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).

<title>Chitin biosynthesis signaling involved in the transition from summer-form to winter-summer of <italic>C. chinensis</italic> in response to low temperature and <italic>CcTRPM</italic></title>
<p>Since cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content were obviously affected by dsCcTRPM treatment and agomir-252 treatment, we speculated that chitin biosyntheis signaling pathway participated in the transition from summer-form to winter-form. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a total of 14 transcripts corresponding to 8 genes involved in chitin biosyntheis were identified in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, with several genes were present in two or more paralogous forms (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we used qRT-PCR to determine the expression profiles of these 14 chitin biosyntheis transcripts after 25°C and 10°C treatments at 3 d, 6 d, and 10 d. Based on the relative gene expression in the heat map, we found that the expression of 13 transcripts exhibited overall up-regulation under 10°C condition at 3 d, 6 d, and 10 d compared to those under 25°C condition, while levels for CcUAP2 were almost unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Polyphenism offers the opportunity for insects to deploy different phenotypes generated from the same genome to best suit the extreme environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Simpson et al., 2011</xref>). In recent years, studies on insect polyphenism have mainly focused on the molecular regulation by endocrine hormones, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters, while the regulation mechanism by external environmental factors remains poorly understood. For examples, ecdysone signaling and insulin/IGF signaling pathway regulated the wing polyphenism of pea aphid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>) or planthoppers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), neuropeptide F was essential for shaping locomotor plasticity in locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hou et al., 2017</xref>), and dopamine metabolic pathway modulated the behavioral phase changes of the migratory locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Ma et al., 2011</xref>). Temperature is important in defining the distribution of insects, but how it activates the temperature receptor and then regulates polyphenism need further deeply study. Here, we firstly demonstrated that the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> was “temperature-dependent pattern”, and low temperature of 10°C completely induced this transition. Just like people wear more clothes in the winter, we also proved that 10°C induced the summer-form change to winter-form by increasing the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Several similar phenotype changes have been reported in other insects: the cricket of <italic>Allonemobius socius</italic> exhibited darker cuticles to improve thermo-regulation in colder environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fedorka et al., 2013</xref>), the mosquito of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> increased the thickness of the egg middle serosa cuticle and wax layer as an adaptation strategy for cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kreß et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>TRPM8, a member of the TRP family, has been reported as the principal sensor of environmental cold in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Peier et al., 2002</xref>). As a kind of poikilothermic animals, insects also have an evolutionarily conserved TRPM gene which is homologous to mammalian temperature receptor of TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Venkatachalam and Montell, 2007</xref>). In this study, we identified a classical TRPM gene in <italic>C. chinensis</italic> which was designated as <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and functioned as a low temperature receptor by using qRT-PCR and calcium imaging. After knockdown of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> by feeding dsCcTRPM, the treated nymphs displayed thinner cuticle thickness and less cuticle chitin content compared with the control of dsEGFP treatment under 10°C condition. In addition, <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown by RNAi or <italic>CcTRPM</italic> antagonist feeding both caused obvious defect of the transition percent from summer-form to winter-form, but this defect could be partially rescued by a cooling agent menthol treatment. To exclude the developmental defect or genetic background, we also knocked down <italic>CcTRPM</italic> under 25°C condition, and not found any death defect and cuticle defect. These results were the first report about <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was essential for insect polyphenism in response to low temperature. Until now, the researches about TRPM on other agricultural insects only focused on the description of its correlation with temperature, but no deeply molecular function was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2021</xref>a). Therefore, the molecular regulation mechanism of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> in response to low temperature needs further study.</p>
<p>miRNAs played significant roles in insect polyphenism and cold acclimation. For example, miR-34 and miR-9b mediated the wing dimorphism of <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ye et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>A. citricidus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shang et al., 2020</xref>), miR-133 inhibited behavioral aggregation by controlling dopamine synthesis in <italic>L. migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and miR-31-5p via asc-C9 to regulate cold acclimation in <italic>Monochamus alternatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that a key regulator, miR-252, targets <italic>CcTRPM</italic> via a negative feedback loop to control the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature. Interestingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> also decreased the expression of miR-252. This result implied that up-regulation of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> in response to low temperature may be have a feedback to miR-252, then miR-252 inhibits the expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic> under low temperature condition to avoid its excessive expression. Upon miR-252 agomir feeding, the treated nymphs showed thinner cuticle thickness and less cuticle chitin content compared with the control of agomir-NC feeding under 10°C condition. Besides, miR-252 antagomir feeding could rescue the transition percent defect and morphological phenotype defect caused by <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown. These results were the first report about miR-252 functions as the up-stream regulator to control the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature via acting on the insect cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Similar result was reported in <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic>, miR-252 might increase cadmium tolerance by switching cellular growth and cuticle protein pathways to detoxification processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Leptinotarsa decemlineata</italic>, 42 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified following cold exposure including miR-9a-3p, miR-210-3p, miR-276-5p and miR-277-3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Morin et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the regulatory network of miRNAs is need further investigating in the transition between two phases in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>, especially transboundary miRNAs from host plant.</p>
<p>Insect cuticle serves as a protective barrier and plays significant roles in supporting the body, resisting the adverse environmental conditions, preventing predators from predation, and preventing pathogens from invading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evans and Sanson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Vargas et al., 2014</xref>). Chitin as an extremely important structural component of insects and represents up to 60% of the dry weight in some species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Richards, 1978</xref>). Many studies have reported that insect cuticles are essential for cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Fedorka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kreß et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content were the major differences between summer-form and winter-form. We have demonstrated that <italic>CcTRPM</italic> and miR-252 function as the up-stream signaling to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature via affecting the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. Therefore, it is necessary to study whether chitin biosynthesis pathway acting as the down-stream signaling in this transition. Further RNAi results showed that two rate-limiting enzyme genes, <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>, play essential roles in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in response to low temperature and affect the cuticle thickness and cuticle chitin content. In addition, <italic>CcTRPM</italic> knockdown and miR-252 agomir feeding both markedly decreased the mRNA expression of <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>. These results proved our hypothesis and were the first report that chitin biosynthesis pathway functions as the down-stream signaling to control the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, this study reported a novel signaling pathway of low temperature-miR-252-<italic>CcTRPM</italic> acting on cuticle chitin biosynthesis genes to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. We proposed a working model to describe this novel mechanism in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>. Under 25°C condition, the expression of temperature receptor <italic>CcTRPM</italic> was depressed by miR-252, so the 1st instar nymphs of summer-form normally developed into 3rd instar nymphs of summer-form. However, under 10°C condition, low temperature greatly activated the expression of <italic>CcTRPM</italic>, but miR-252 functioned as a negative feedback regulator to mediate <italic>CcTRPM</italic> expression to avoid its excessive expression in response to low temperature. Then, <italic>CcTRPM</italic> obviously improved the expression of two rate-limiting enzyme genes from cuticle chitin biosynthesis pathway, <italic>CcTre1</italic> and <italic>CcCHS1</italic>, to increase cuticle thickness and raise cuticle chitin content. Lastly, the 1st instar nymphs of summer-form developed to 3rd instar nymphs of winter-form as an ecological adaptation strategy under low temperature stress. Future researches will focus on the following directions: (1) Whether and how transboundary miRNAs and hormones from host plant involve in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>. (2) How neuropeptides and endocrine hormones response to low temperature and <italic>CcTRPM</italic> to mediate the transition from summer-form to winter-form in <italic>C. chinensis</italic>.</p>

<p>Previous studies have demonstrated that cuticle thickness and hardness are important parameters for adapting to environment and natural enemies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Evans and Sanson, 2005</xref>). Therefore, cuticle chitin staining with WGA-FITC (Cat# F8520, Solarbio, Beijing, China) and cuticle chitin content were measured to analyze the difference between the summer-form and winter-form nymphs, or dsRNA treatment and miRNA agomir treatment. For the WGA-FITC staining, nymph samples were firstly fixed with 4% PFA for 48 h and dehydrated with a series of sucrose solution with varied concentrations (10% for 4 h, 20% for 4 h, 30% for 12 h), then rinsed three times for 15 min per rinse with sterile PBS buffer. The dehydrated samples were gradually embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Cat# 4583, SAKURA, Ningbo, China) after the pre-embedding stages under −25°C. The ultra-thin sections (approximately 70 nm thickness) of embedded material were cut using Leica freezing ultra-cut microtome (CM1850, Leica, Weztlar, Germany). The sections were stained with WGA-FITC (50 μg/mL) and DAPI (10 μg/mL) for 15 min and then rinsed three times for 15 min per rinse with sterile PBS buffer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farnesi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Xie et al., 2022</xref>).

In short, each 50 nymphs for one sample were homogenized in 0.2 mL distilled water using an electric homogenizer. The testing samples and standard samples were hatched in enzyme-labeled plates at 37°C for 30 min, separately. The washing buffer was used to rinse the enzyme-labeled plates five times for 30 s per time. Then, enzyme labeling reagent was added to the plates for hatching and washing. Finally, chromogenic agent A solution and B solution were mixed in holes for coloration at 37°C and protect from light. The absorbance (OD value) of each hole was measured at 450nm wavelength and zeroed with a blank hole.</p>

<p>Here, the authors describe, in detail, the transition between the summer form and the winter form of the pear psyllid, Cacopsylla chinensis. While the authors explore many components of this transition, the central hypotheses they seek to test are (i) that a protein they deem CcTRPM is a cold-sensitive Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin (TRPM) channel, and (ii) that this channel is involved in the summer-to-winter transition, in response to cold.</p>
<p>The authors demonstrate that: both cold and menthol can initiate the summer-to-winter transition; that the protein of interest is required for the summer-to-winter transition (in vivo); that the protein of interest is involved in menthol-dependent Ca2+ transients (in vitro); that miR-252 expression is temperature-dependent, modulates the seasonal transition, and affects the expression of the transcript of interest; and finally, somewhat separately, that the chitin biosynthesis pathway is linked to the summer-to-winter transition.</p>
<p>Although I generally found the evidence to be convincing, I note a few critical weaknesses in the manuscript as it is currently presented. Firstly, there is insufficient methodological detail to understand how the genes/transcripts/proteins in this work were identified. Further, the structural and phylogenetic analyses are incompletely described and the results are inconsistent with our previous understanding of the structure and evolution of TRPMs. It is thus possible (although unlikely) that this protein has been misidentified. Alternatively, this could be a structurally aberrant TRPM from a lineage previously presumed to be lost in insects, but there is not sufficient evidence to conclude this. Perhaps more importantly, the authors conclude that the protein of interest is cold sensitive (i.e., a &quot;temperature receptor&quot;) primarily based on menthol sensitivity. Although menthol and cold activate the same receptors in other species, there is no demonstrated reason to think that menthol sensitivity necessitates cold sensitivity, or vice-versa. Thus, the authors' conclusions are, in my opinion, incomplete and overstated. Below are specific comments giving further context to the criticisms summarized above:</p>
<p>1. The method used to identify the various genes/proteins described herein is not described. Relatedly, the alignment in Figure S1 lacks Trpms from non-hemipteran taxa, making it difficult to judge sequence similarity to other more well-characterized Trpms (e.g., from human, mouse, fly, nematode, etc.), and thus difficult to assess homology from the manuscript alone.</p>
<p>2. The authors suggest that the CcTrpm has ankyrin repeats. To my knowledge, this would be the first description of ankyrin repeats in TRPM. It's not stated how the authors identified these putative ankyrin repeats. There's also no description of the absence or presence of previously identified Melastatin Homology Regions (MHRs), a C-terminal coiled-coil that is typically present, other C-terminal domain motifs, or the TRP domain. In the absence of methodological detail, and given the proposed presence of ankyrin repeats, it seems possible that this may not be TRPM.</p>
<p>3. The authors suggest that, because mRNA abundance for CcTRPM is increased in response to cold, it is cold-sensitive. However, this says nothing as to whether cold actually activates the ion channel -- a critical distinction. The authors finally conclude that CcTRPM encodes a cold-sensitive ion channel because menthol elicits Ca2+ activity in vitro. However, this experiment only demonstrates that the protein is likely menthol sensitive. This experiment does not support the authors' conclusion that this is a cold-sensitive receptor (although their later knockdown experiments do, albeit indirectly).</p>
<p>4. The lack of taxonomic representation in the phylogenetic analysis makes it difficult to interpret, especially in the context of methodological detail concerning the initial identification of the gene/transcript/protein of interest. Further, it's not stated if the tree is rooted (if it is, the rooting methodology is not described), the branch lengths are not shown, and the branch support methodology is not described. Many previous phylogenetic analyses have concluded--implicitly or explicitly--that there are at least two ancestral animal TRPM paralogs. From the perspective of vertebrates, one ancestral copy went on to diversify into TRPMs 1, 3, 6, and 7, and the other ancestral copy went on to diversify into TRPMs 2, 8, 4, and 5. The insect Trpms are generally thought to be more closely related to vertebrate TRPMs 1,3,6, and 7. If this phylogeny is rooted, it implies that the hemipteran Trpms are more closely related to vertebrates 2, 8, 4, and 5 (or at least 8, since that is all that is present here), and quite distantly related to other insect Trpms (and presumably, to vertebrates 1,3,6, and 7, which are not present). To my knowledge, this would be the first description of this Trpm subfamily in insects, but there is insufficient evidence or phylogenetic rigor here to conclude that. The most likely explanation is that the tree is unrooted, incorrectly rooted, or that the protein of interest is not TRPM.</p>

<p>The pear psylla Cacopsylla chinensis has two morphologically different forms, winter- and summer-forms depending on the temperatures. The authors provided solid data showing that the cold sensor CcTRPM is responsible for switching summer- to winter forms, which is in turn regulated by the miRNA miR-252. This finding is interesting and novel.</p>
