<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Type 4 Secretion Systems are a main driver for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors in bacteria. In Gram-positives, these secretion systems often rely on surface adhesins to enhance cellular aggregation and mating pair formation. One of the best studied adhesins is PrgB from the conjugative plasmid pCF10 of <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, which has been shown to play major roles in conjugation, biofilm formation and importantly also in bacterial virulence. Since <italic>prgB</italic> orthologs exist on a large number of conjugative plasmids in various different species, this makes PrgB a model protein for this widespread virulence factor. Here we report structures for almost the entire PrgB, in the presence or absence of DNA, using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. These reveal that PrgB undergoes a large conformational change upon DNA-binding and that it contains four immunoglobulin-like domains. We re-evaluate previously studied variants and present new <italic>in vivo</italic> data where specific domains or conserved residues have been mutated. For the first time we can show a decoupling of cellular aggregation from biofilm formation and conjugation in <italic>prgB</italic> mutant phenotypes. Based on the presented data, we propose a new functional model to explain how PrgB mediates its different functions. We hypothesize that the Ig-like domains act as a rigid stalk that both protect the previously studied polymer adhesin domain from proteolysis, as well as presenting it at the right distance from the cell wall.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis</italic>) is one of the leading causes of hospital acquired infections, such as urinary tract infections and endocarditis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. These infections are difficult to treat as <italic>E. faecalis</italic> has the tendency to form biofilms and is often resistant to various antibiotics. They are also notorious for spreading antibiotic resistance and other fitness advantages by transfer of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which can be located on conjugative plasmids or in the chromosome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Conjugative plasmids usually also encode a Type 4 Secretion System (T4SS) that mediates its transfer, via conjugation, from a donor cell to a recipient cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. However, conjugative plasmids and their T4SS have almost exclusively been studied in Gram-negative model systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One of the few well-characterized Gram-positive conjugative plasmids is pCF10 from <italic>E. faecalis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This conjugative plasmid contains a ~27 kbp operon that is tightly regulated by the P<sub>Q</sub> promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and that encodes all proteins needed for conjugation. This operon also encodes three cell-wall anchored proteins: PrgA, PrgB, and PrgC. PrgA is a conjugation regulator that provides surface exclusion to prevent unwanted conjugation. We have previously shown that PrgA consists of a protease domain that is presented far away from the cell wall via a long stalk and that it’s likely mediating the proteolytic cleavage of PrgB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. PrgC is a virulence factor, but its function and structure remain unknown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. PrgB is the main adhesin produced by pCF10 and has been studied for well over 3 decades. This protein is around a 140 kDa in size and possesses an N-terminal signal sequence and a C-terminal LPXTG cell wall anchor motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. PrgB distributes over the entire surface of the cell-wall and increases cellular aggregation, biofilm formation and the efficiency of plasmid transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Several mammalian infection model systems have shown that PrgB is a strong virulence factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. One reason for this virulence is that PrgB mediates biofilm formation in an extracellular DNA (eDNA) dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Homologs of PrgB have been identified in many other conjugative plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, suggesting that PrgB-like proteins confer important roles in a large number of bacterial species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>PrgB was initially identified as one of the driving forces in cellular aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To understand how it mediated this process, previous research has tried to identify the various protein domains that are present in PrgB and evaluate their function(s). Two RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs were identified (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1A</xref>), and found to be important for vegetation and biofilm formation in the host tissue environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The N-terminal half of PrgB was found to be required for aggregation and to bind lipoteichoic acid (LTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, which is a major constituent of the cell-wall in Gram-positive bacteria. In 2018, we solved the structure of PrgB246-558 and showed that it has a lectin-like fold that was most similar to adhesins from various oral Streptococci. As these adhesins are known to bind various polymers, we subsequently referred to PrgB246-558 as the polymer adhesin domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. We have shown that this domain can bind both LTA and eDNA in a competitive manner. Bound eDNA is thereby strongly compacted as it is wrapped around the domains positively charged surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We therefore proposed that PrgB could use eDNA to promote cell-to-cell contacts, as an alternative to direct binding to the LTA from a recipient cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>). As all described polymer adhesin domains, PrgB has a central ridge with a conserved cation binding site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. In the homologous GbpC, from <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, this site has been suggested to bind glucans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, no interaction with glucans has been observed for PrgB or any other homologs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, the importance of this conserved motif remains an open question.</p>

<p>Schematic overview of PrgB domain organization and function. A) Updated schematic overview of the domain organization of PrgB. SS: Signal sequence, COI: Coiled-coil, PAD: Polymer adhesin domain, CSA: adhesin isopeptide-forming adherence domain, CSC: cell-surface antigen C-terminal domain, LPXTG: cell wall anchor sequence. B) In a setting with a donor cell (green) and multiple recipient cells (brown), PrgB is produced and sits on the cell wall. There it enhances cellular aggregation and/or biofilm formation, either by directly binding LTA from the cell-wall of a recipient or first to eDNA to. PrgB compacts the eDNA, and thereby likely pulls the recipient cells closer. Once close enough, PrgB binds to the LTA of the recipient bacteria and facilitates mating-pair formation and conjugation.</p>

<p>The polymer adhesin domain plays an important role in the function of PrgB, but it only accounts for around a quarter of the entire protein. No structural data has been available for the remainder of PrgB. Here we present the structure of almost full-length PrgB, based on both X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. This allows us to put the large amount of available phenotypic data into a structural context and explain a lot of previous observations. We also constructed several new mutants of <italic>prgB</italic> that better fitted the found domain organization and analyzed their <italic>in vivo</italic> effects on cellular aggregation, biofilm formation and conjugation efficiency. Based on our findings, we conclude with an updated model of how PrgB mediates its different functions.</p>

<title>Cloning and mutagenesis</title>
<p>To insert a multiple cloning site in pMSP3545S, DNA oligos of MCS_fwd and MCS_rev were resuspended in miliQ to 100 μM, mixed 1:1, denatured at 95°C for 15 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed MCS oligo was ligated into the gel-purified backbone fragment from pMSP3545S-<italic>prgK</italic> vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> digested with NcoI and XbaI (removing the <italic>prgK</italic> insert). This was done in a 30 μL ligation mixture with 90 ng of the digested vector and a 9 times molar access of insert. 5 μL of this ligation mixture was transformed into Top10 competent cells and plated on LB agar plates with spectinomycin (50 μg/ml), and erythromycin (150 μg/ml). The constructed plasmid was analyzed by restriction digestion and sequenced to confirm the correct insertion of the multiple cloning site and is further called pMSP3545S-MCS.</p>
<p>pMSP3545S-<italic>prgB</italic> was constructed by PCR of <italic>prgB</italic> from pCF10 with the NcoI-prgB-F and BamHI-stop-prgB-R primer pair and placement into the pMSP3545S-MCS vector via NcoI/BamHI restriction, gel-purification of the correct DNA fragments and subsequent ligation. The constructed pMSP3545S-<italic>prgB</italic> was subsequently used as a template for mutagenesis creating pMSP3545S-<italic>prgB</italic> deletion or point mutation variants. This was carried out with inverse PCR (iPCR) using partially overlapping primer pairs. The iPCR products were gel-purified with the DNA clean-up kit and digested with DpnI to remove residual template plasmid DNA. The processed iPCR products were then transformed to Top10 competent cells. For overexpression, <italic>prgB</italic><sub>188-1233</sub> was cloned into the p7XC3GH vector using the FX cloning system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Mutations were introduced to p7XC3GH-<italic>prgB</italic><sub>188-1233</sub> with the same iPCR approach to obtain the derivative plasmid with <italic>prgB</italic><sub>188-1233: S442A, N444A</sub>.

<p>PrgB was produced as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Briefly, PrgB<sub>188-1233</sub> was expressed with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag from pET-<italic>prgB</italic><sub>188-1233</sub> or a C-terminal deca-histidine and GFP tag from p7XC3GH-<italic>prgB</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3). The cells were grown at 37 °C in TB medium until they reached an OD<sub>600</sub> of 1.5. Then the temperature was lowered to 18 °C and protein production was induced by adding 0.5 mM IPTG. Cells were grown for 16 hours before harvesting by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.0), 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM Imidazole and 0.02 mg/ml DNase I and broken with a Constant cell disruptor at 4 °C and 25 kPsi (Constant Systems). The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 30 minutes at 30,000 x g, 4°C and incubated at 4 °C with Ni-NTA (Macherey-Nagel). The Ni-NTA column was washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mM HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.0), 300 mM NaCl, 30-50 mM imidazole and bound proteins were eluted from the column with the same buffer supplemented with 500 mM Imidazole. The histidine affinity tags and the GFP when present, were cleaved off from the purified protein fractions by incubation with TEV protease (for pET-<italic>prgB</italic>) or Prescission protease (for p7XC3GH-<italic>prgB</italic>) in a 1:100 ratio for 20 h at 4 °C. The cleaved proteins were loaded on a Superdex-200 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) equilibrated in 20 mM HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.0) and 150 mM NaCl. The elution profile showed two peaks corresponding to a PrgB dimer and monomer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. These two peak fractions were pooled separately and concentrated on an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter with a 30 kDa cut-off (Merck-Millipore). 10% glycerol was added to the concentrated protein fractions, which were subsequently flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.</p>

<title>Structure determination via X-ray crystallography</title>
<p>Purified PrgB<sub>188-1233</sub> from the monomeric fraction, with a protein concentration of 15 mg/mL, were thawed and used in crystallization trials. Crystals of PrgB<sub>188-1233</sub> were grown in 8-12 weeks, at 20 °C by sitting drop vapor diffusion in a condition with 0.2 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 20% PEG 3350 and a protein to reservoir ratio of 1:1 in the drop.

The PrgB<sub>188-1234</sub> crystals belong to the monoclinic space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> and contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic phase problem was solved using molecular replacement using PHASER, using the SspB homology model of the Ig-domains as search models (PDB: 2WOY)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Further building of the model was conducted in COOT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.

Protein peak fractions, corresponding to the dimer, were diluted to 0.1-0.3 mg/mL and for the DNA-bound structures 120 bp ssDNA (Table S1) was added in 1: 1.2 molar ratio (protein:DNA) and samples were incubated for 15 minutes on ice. For both apo and DNA-bound samples, 4 μl of sample was applied to glow discharged Quantifoil 300 mesh 1.2/1.3 (Quantifoil) grids at 4 °C and 90-100% humidity, blotted for 1 s with blot force −5, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p>

<title>Cryo-EM data processing</title>
<p>Cryo-EM data of apo PrgB and DNA-bound PrgB were processed in the same way, but separately using cryoSPARC (v3.2.0-3.3.1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Beam-induced motion was corrected using standard settings, where start frame 1 was excluded, followed by per-micrograph contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation. For apo PrgB a subset of 170,826 particles from 500 micrographs were extracted with a box size of 384 Å. They were then picked using the blob picking tool with a 100-300 Å particle diameter. Picked particles were subjected to consecutive rounds of 2D classifications. Template particles were selected from representative 2D classes, and the subsequent full dataset was picked using the template picker tool and the input of the subset processing. PrgB with DNA was directly picked using blob picker with a 100-300 Å particle diameter and standard settings and extracted with 384 pix. PrgB without and with DNA were then separately subjected to 2D classifications resulting in a final number of 283,630 and 163,566 particles respectively. Particles from selected classes were combined and used in ab-initio reconstruction.

<title>PrgB<sub>584-1233</sub> contains 4 immunoglobulin-like domains</title>
<p>Previous bioinformatics and structural analysis of PrgB proposed that PrgB consisted of 3 domains; the previously crystallized polymer adhesin domain responsible for eDNA and LTA binding, and two domains with RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, when we reanalyzed the PrgB sequence with the new structure-prediction tools that are available, such as AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, it became clear that this model was partially incorrect. PrgB seems to consist of an N-terminal disordered region (residues 35-197), followed by a newly identified coiled-coil (COI) domain (residues 198-257), the previously crystallized polymer adhesin domain (residues 261-558), a linker region (residues 559-582), 4 immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (residues 583-1232) and finally the C-terminal disordered region containing the LPXTG motif (residues 1263-1305) that gets anchored to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The Ig-like domains seem to come in pairs of two slightly different structures, denoted as CSA1-CSC1 (first pair) and CSA2-CSC2 (second pair), as named in InterPro (CSA from IPR026345; adhesin isopeptide-forming adherence domain, and CSC from IPR032300; cell-surface antigen C-terminal). To verify this updated domain organization of PrgB, we set out to experimentally determine its structure using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM methods.</p>
<p>As described in Schmitt <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we were not able to produce full-length PrgB in <italic>E. coli</italic>, but instead produced and purified PrgB<sub>188-1233</sub>. This version of the protein only lacks the disordered N-terminal region and the LPXTG anchor and elutes from size exclusion chromatography in two peaks corresponding to dimeric and a monomeric PrgB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The monomeric fraction was successfully used for crystallization trials. Crystals belonging to space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> appeared after 8-12 weeks, diffracted to 1.85 Å and contained 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. The crystallographic phase problem was solved using molecular replacement with SspB (PDB: 2WOY) as a search model. Surprisingly, the resulting electron density lacked the previously crystallized polymer adhesin domain of PrgB, and instead only contained residues 584-1233. Likely, the polymer adhesin domain had been cleaved off in the crystallization drop before the crystals were formed. The modelled protein indeed consists of four Immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains: two CSA and two CSC domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Previous bioinformatics analysis showed that various homologous adhesin proteins contain different numbers of Ig-like domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, but a DALI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> analysis of PrgB<sub>584-1233</sub> showed that there is no previously solved structure in the PDB that contains four of these Ig-domains coupled together. There are, however, homologous structures available with either 2 or 3 Ig-domains. The closest structural homologs are the C-terminal parts of Antigen I/II proteins from oral Streptococci, e.g. the surface protein AspA from <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (PDB code: 4OFQ), which has 3 Ig-domains and an r.m.s.d. to the Ig-like domains from PrgB of 3.2 Å over 337 residues or the BspA protein from <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>(PDB code: 4ZLP) which has 2 Ig-domains and an r.m.s.d. of 3.3 Å over 334 residues (see Table S3 for an overview of the highest ranked DALI hits). The r.m.s.d. decreases to ca. 1 Å if the individual Ig-like domains are superimposed upon each other.</p>

<title>DNA binding leads to large displacement of the polymer adhesin domain of PrgB</title>
<p>As we didn’t manage to crystallize PrgB<sub>188-1233</sub> without the loss of the polymer adhesin domain, we determined its structure via cryo-EM and single particle analysis. To determine the conformational changes of PrgB upon DNA binding, we collected two datasets: one without and one with ssDNA (120 bp). This yielded volumes with an average resolution of 8 and 11 Å, respectively. Even though dimeric fractions of PrgB were used for the grid preparations, the resulting maps of PrgB are monomeric, indicating that the dimer fell apart. Despite the relatively low resolution of the EM volume, mainly due to a preferred orientation of the protein on the cryo-EM grids, we could dock in the X-ray structures: the previously solved polymer adhesin domain (PDB code: 6EVU)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and the newly solved structure of PrgB<sub>584-1233</sub>. The resulting model of apo-PrgB shows that the polymer adhesin domain is folded back on top of the Ig-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). In the DNA-bound PrgB model the polymer adhesin domain has undergone a large displacement away from the Ig-like domains.

<p>We found that PrgB without the newly identified coiled-coil domain could not rescue the aggregation phenotype of the deletion strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, column 4). Western blot analysis showed reduced levels of PrgB<sub>ΔCOI</sub> as compared to wild type (Fig. S2) probably due to a decreased stability, which could explain the observed decrease in aggregation. Deletion of either the CSA1 or the CSC2 domain did not affect PrgB-mediated aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, column 8 and 9). However, complementation with PrgBΔCSA2-CSC2 could only partially rescue the aggregation phenotype of the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF pCF10Δ<italic>prgB</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, column 7) and no rescue at all was seen in the PrgB variants with both the CSA1 and CSC1 domain deleted or without any Ig-like domains (CSA1-CSC1-CSA2-CSC2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A</xref>, column 5, and 6).</p>
<p>As expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, deletion of <italic>prgB</italic> also lead to a large decrease in biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<title>The conserved binding cleft in the polymer adhesin domain is essential for conjugation and biofilm formation, but not for aggregation</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The presented data provides important insights for a widespread virulence factor in Gram-positive bacteria, since genes encoding PrgB homologs exists on a large number of conjugative plasmids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In this study, we expand our structural knowledge of PrgB beyond the polymer adhesin domain, to now encompass almost the entire protein.</p>
<p>The crystal structure of PrgB<sub>583-1233</sub> shows that this part of PrgB consists of four tandemly arranged immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains. These Ig-like domains show a high degree of structural homology to Streptococcal surface proteins, usually found in the oral cavity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These homologous proteins have been indicated to bind various molecules, such as fimbria, collagen and salivary agglutinin (SAG, also designated as glycoprotein 340), and these binding interactions have been shown to be vital for their function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. However, we have not found any evidence that the Ig-like domains of PrgB bind to a specific substrate in our own experiments, nor have we found this in other reports. PrgB also does not contain a BAR domain, which is crucial for stable interactions between e.g. SspB from <italic>S. gordonni</italic> and Mfa-1 of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. However, since Ig-like domains are known to bind a large variety of ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, we don’t exclude the possibility that ligands for the Ig-like domains in PrgB will be found in the future. However, the only ligands that have been verified to interact with PrgB so far are eDNA and LTA, which have high affinity to the polymer adhesin domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The crystal structure of the Ig-like domains from PrgB, PrgB<sub>583-1233</sub>, was complemented by single particle analysis of PrgB<sub>188-1233</sub> via cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Despite the low resolution of the EM volumes, we could dock in the high-resolution crystal structures of the Ig-like domains and the polymer adhesin domain. eDNA binding is a key step in PrgB mediated cellular aggregation and biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, and the models obtained from our cryo-EM volumes provided the first mechanistical insight into the conformational changes that occur during this step. The polymer adhesin domain is nestled to the side of the Ig-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>), likely reflecting how PrgB is present on the outside of the cell wall in the absence of a binding partner. Possibly, the folding back of the polymer adhesin domain is protecting it from proteolytic cleavage (see below). Our model of PrgB bound to DNA suggests that the polymer adhesin domain gets displaced from the Ig-like domains upon eDNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). This would expose the positively charged surface of the polymer adhesin domain and allow it to wrap the eDNA around itself to condense it, as we observed in previous experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We speculate that this in turn could also expose the PrgA-binding site, predicted to be located in the flexible region between the polymer adhesin domain and the CSA1 domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This would allow PrgA-mediated cleavage and removal of the polymer adhesin domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. How this cleavage is regulated is not yet understood, but the folding back of the polymer adhesin domain onto the Ig-like domains in the absence of substrate could be part of this regulation.</p>
<p>We have now obtained a structural basis to interpret almost all phenotypic data that is available for PrgB. Unfortunately, most of the mutants that were previously described did not correlate well with the newly determined domain boundaries. Therefore, we decided to create specific deletion mutants that were based on the new PrgB structure to determine the role of the various domains. At the N-terminus of PrgB, before the polymer adhesin domain, there is a predicted coiled-coil region (Fig. S4A) that we wanted to investigate. To our surprise, the expression of PrgB<sub>ΔCOI</sub> could not rescue any of the aggregation, biofilm formation or conjugation phenotypes from a <italic>prgB</italic> deletion strain. However, in our experiments PrgB<sub>ΔCOI</sub> was only produced at low levels (Fig. S2), indicating that the coiled-coil region might be important for protein production and/or stability. Deletion of all Ig-like domains (PrgB<sub>ΔCSA1-ΔCSC2</sub>) renders the protein incapable to support aggregation, biofilm formation and conjugation. However, exogenous expression of <italic>prgB</italic> with single Ig-like domain deletions, <italic>prgB</italic><sub>ΔCSA1</sub> and <italic>prgB</italic><sub>ΔCSC2</sub> in the pCF10Δ<italic>prgB</italic> background, restore cellular aggregation, while they do not rescue biofilm formation and conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). This was unexpected, as the polymer adhesin domain is predicted to mediate all the functions that were tested in these assays: aggregation, biofilm formation and conjugation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Our results, however, indicate that it is important to have all Ig-like domains present and properly folded. The cellular aggregation assays seem to indicate that PrgB can function when at least 3 Ig-like domains are present, as expression of both <italic>prgB</italic>ΔCSA1 and <italic>prgB</italic>ΔCSC2 can complement pCF10Δ<italic>prgB</italic>, but unfortunately this assay is not suitable to detect small changes. Based on the biofilm formation and conjugation efficiency assays, which are more sensitive, we therefore conclude that even removing a single Ig-like domain strongly decreases the function of PrgB.</p>
<p>The conserved Ser-Asn-Glu site in the negatively charged cleft of the polymer adhesin domain intrigued us, as its function is unknown. Any changes that we made in these conserved residues resulted in a PrgB variant that didn’t facilitate biofilm formation or conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Surprisingly these PrgB variants did fully support cellular aggregation. This is thought-provoking, since various literature has shown that the PrgB functions in cellular aggregation, biofilm formation and conjugation are strongly correlated. However, even a single point mutation in this conserved site produced a PrgB variant that completely separates the cellular clumping phenotype from biofilm formation and conjugation. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments showed that these point mutations did not impair PrgB binding to eDNA (Fig S3). A similar phenotypic pattern was observed with PrgB<sub>ΔCSA1</sub> and PrgB<sub>ΔCSC2</sub> which both could fully rescue aggregation but not biofilm formation. Our data therefore strongly indicates that PrgB has additional role(s), besides mediating cellular aggregation, to further support conjugation and biofilm formation. We therefore propose that PrgB performs at least one, currently unknown, additional function besides binding to eDNA and/or LTA from the cell wall of the recipient cell. It is highly likely that at least one of these additional functions is mediated by the conserved site in the polymer adhesin domain.</p>
<p>As described in the introduction, there is a plethora of <italic>prgB</italic> mutants made (see Fig. S4) and phenotypically analyzed, predominantly by the group of Prof. Gary Dunny. In supplementary table S4 we provide a summary of all <italic>prgB</italic> mutants that we have identified in the literature and our brief reinterpretation based on our new structural knowledge. Below, we will discuss a selected number of these mutants in detail.</p>
<p>As expected, most mutants that have an insertion or a mutation in the polymer adhesin domain (Fig. S4A) show a loss of protein function. Shortly, insertions at amino acids (a.a.) 358 and 359 are on the surface of the protein and likely leads to steric clashes that prevent the domain from binding to eDNA and LTA, whereas insertions at a.a. 439, 473, 517, and 546 are all in secondary structures that are central parts of the polymer adhesin domain and therefore are likely to disrupt folding of this domain.</p>
<p>The RGD motifs in PrgB were previously proposed to be involved in integrin binding and to promote adherence to human neutrophils, as well as internalization in cultured intestinal epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. The new domain classification showed that these two RGD motifs are in CSA1 and CSA2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). The structure that we determined shows that these two sequence motifs are not surface exposed, but instead play an important role in the structural integrity of the interfaces between CSA1 and CSC1, and between CSA2 and CSC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Mutations in these motifs would thus very likely destabilize the folding of the tandem Ig-domains, which would explain the decreased PrgB biofilm formation observed in these strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, our new data strongly argues against the previously proposed direct binding interaction between the RGD sequences and integrins of host origin.</p>

<p>Deletion of residues 993-1138 leads to a loss of about half of both the CSA2 and CSC2 domains. Therefore, we were surprised to find that this mutant was described to behave like wild type in aggregation assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Possibly the remaining parts of CSA2 and CSC2 form a (unfolded) linker region of similar length to the tandem CSA2-CSC2 structure, which allows PrgB to retain its function of promoting aggregation. Similarly, PrgB<sub>Δ668-1138</sub>, corresponding to a complete removal of CSC1 and CSA2 and approximately half of both CSA1 and CSC2 domains, could still support PrgB mediated aggregation. Potentially the remaining residues (ca 180 amino acids) could also form an unfolded linker region allowing for the variant to retain its aggregation phenotype. For PrgB<sub>Δ993-1138</sub> and PrgB<sub>Δ668-1138</sub>, unfortunately no biofilm formation or conjugation efficiency were reported, but based on our results it is likely that those capabilities would have been severely compromised.</p>
<p>Taking past and present results into account combined with our new structural insights, we propose a new mechanistic model for the function of PrgB. Our EM data indicates that the Ig-domains provide structural support for the polymer adhesin domain in the absence of bound ligand(s) and our <italic>in vivo</italic> data show that removal of one of the Ig-like domains does not largely affect PrgB function. Previous data also indicates that parts of the Ig-like domains can be deleted without affecting the function of PrgB. We therefore hypothesize that the Ig-like domains provide two important features to the protein. First, a rigid stalk that is needed to present the polymer adhesin domain at the correct distance from the cell wall. Second, providing protection from PrgA-mediated cleavage when the polymer adhesin domain is folded on top of the Ig-like domains. Binding of eDNA (and likely also LTA) releases the polymer adhesin domain from this stalk domain, and with that likely also exposes the predicted PrgA proteolysis site in the linker region between the polymer adhesin domain and the CSA1 domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. The exact distance of the polymer adhesin domain from the cell wall does not seem important for LTA-binding, since aggregation can still take place even with partially disrupted Ig-like domains. However, the length of the stalk may be very important when it comes to facilitating both biofilm formation and conjugation. This indicates that effective mating-pair formation in conjugation may require a PrgB-mediated function distinct from pure aggregation, something that is further shown by the findings of the mutations in the conserved site in the polymer adhesin domain.</p>
<p>Besides providing a structural basis to explain about 30 years of work on PrgB, we here also uncovered that the conserved Ser-Asn-Glu site in the polymer adhesin domain likely provides additional functionality to PrgB that is needed for optimal biofilm formation and conjugation, but that does not affect cellular aggregation. To fully investigate the function of this conserved site in PrgB and other homologous virulence factors from Gram-positive bacteria, remains an exciting question to address in future research.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> combination of X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the bacterial adhesin PrgB, an atypical microbial cell surface-anchored polypeptide that binds DNA. There is <bold>convincing</bold> support for the claims regarding the overall function and importance of individual domains. The model for PrgB's binding of eDNA is thought-provoking, but the evidence for it based on low-resolution volumes of cryoEM data is <bold>incomplete</bold>. If additional experimental evidence for the model is produced, this work will be impactful in the field of bacterial adhesins, conjugation, and biofilm formation, as it focuses on a clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogen, whereas most work in the field has been focused on Gram-negative model systems.</p>

<p>Sun and colleagues outline structural and mechanistic studies of the bacterial adhesin PrgB, an atypical microbial cell surface-anchored polypeptide that binds DNA. The manuscript includes a crystal structure of the Ig-like domains of PrgB, cryo-EM structures of the majority of the intact polypeptide in DNA-bound and free forms, and an assessment of the phenotypes of E. faecalis strains expressing various PrgB mutants.</p>
<p>Generally, the study has been conducted with a good level of rigor, and there is consistency in the findings. However, I do have some specific technical concerns relating to the study. Although the PX work has been expertly undertaken, the Cryo-EM structures reported are both at ~10-angstrom resolution. Visual inspection indicates that the positioning of the PrgB domains into the EM envelopes is somewhat questionable and this needs to be addressed. The narrative of the manuscript very much hinges on this being correct. In addition, wrt the PrgB mutant studies, it could be that the loss of function observed in specific mutants is simply a consequence of mutation-induced misfolding of those polypeptides. Experimental evidence supporting the direct interaction between the PAD and the stalk domains in PrgB is also lacking.</p>

<p>Having previously solved the X-ray crystallographic structure of the polymer adhesin domain (PAD) of PrgB from E. faecalis, the authors looked to build on that work by crystallizing a nearly full-length construct of PrgB. Though they were successful in their crystallization endeavors, the crystal contained only what was previously thought to be two domains with RGD motifs. The authors' high-resolution structure shows that in fact the C-terminal portion of PrgB is made up of four immunoglobulin-like domains. The authors then set out to collect single-particle cryoEM data in a bid to obtain a full-length structure of PrgB, both in the presence and absence of ssDNA. The authors were only able to obtain quite low-resolution data, which they fit their crystal structures into. The authors then used these structures to inform the design of novel deletion mutants and point mutations, as well as to rationalize years of phenotypic data from other published mutants.</p>
<p>The X-ray crystallographic structure is beautiful and in combination with their in vivo data allowed them to propose a model where PrgB positions cells at an appropriate distance for conjugation. The cryoEM data are not convincing in their current state, and I, therefore, don't believe that their model of the immunoglobulin domains acting to protect the PAD domain of PrgB from PrgA is well supported. Perhaps there are 2D classes or other data that make a case for the fit of the crystal structures into the cryoEM volumes, but without a PAD deletion or perhaps a dataset including a PAD-specific antibody, I don't feel the fit is supported.</p>
<p>The in vivo experiments appear to be done well and the authors' discovery that the Ser-Asn-Glu is not important for generalized aggregation but has an additional yet unknown role in conjugation and biofilm formation is exciting and well supported by their data.</p>

<p>First of all, we would like to thank the reviewers for their work. We appreciate the constructive review comments and useful suggestions to further improve our article.</p>
<p>The main criticism on our manuscript, from both reviewers, is that the cryo-EM structures are of low resolution and that the fit of the crystallographic structures of the PAD and the stalk domain into these low-resolution structures is questionable. We would like to point out that the cryo-EM data, and the conclusions from it, are not essential for the main conclusions of the article. All mutants that we made in this study were designed based on the structural data obtained from the high-resolution X-ray structures, with no input from the low-resolution cryo-EM docked models. We chose to include the cryo-EM data since it allowed us to speculate about the interaction between the PAD and the stalk domain of PrgB, domains that we have separately determined the structures of via X-ray crystallography. We agree with the reviewers that further experiments are needed to verify this potential interaction. Therefore, we will perform additional biochemical assays to investigate the proposed interaction. We will also try to optimize the cryo-EM data to hopefully allow for a more reliable fit of our high-resolution crystallographic structures. Once that is done, we will submit a revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>On behalf of all authors,</p>
<p>Ronnie Berntsson</p>
