<title>Abstract</title><p>Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for specifying binary neuronal fates, yet how it specifies different fates in different contexts remains elusive. In our accompanying paper, using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina neuron types (L1-L5) as a model, we show that the primary homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF) Bsh activates secondary HDTFs Ap (L4) and Pdm3 (L5) and specifies L4/L5 neuronal fates. Here we test the hypothesis that Notch signaling enables Bsh to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates. We show asymmetric Notch signaling between newborn L4 and L5 neurons, but they are not siblings; rather, Notch signaling in L4 is due to Delta expression in adjacent L1 neurons. While Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent, Notch is necessary and sufficient for Bsh to specify L4 fate over L5. The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4, compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. We propose a novel model in which Notch signaling is integrated with the primary HDTF activity to diversify neuron types by directly or indirectly generating a distinct open chromatin landscape that constrains the pool of genes that a primary HDTF can activate.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The extraordinary computational power of our brain depends on the vast diversity of neuron types characterized initially by transcription factor (TF) combinatorial codes, followed by neuron type-specific functional attributes such as cell surface molecules, neurotransmitters, and ion channels. It has been well documented how initial neuronal diversity is generated: in both invertebrate and vertebrate, spatial and temporal factors act combinatorially in progenitors to generate diverse and molecularly distinct progeny, and asymmetric Notch signaling between two newborn sister neurons further diversifies neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bello-Rojas and Bagnall, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Erclik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holguera and Desplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pierfelice et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Spana and Doe, 1996</xref>). Yet, it remains unclear how Notch signaling controls binary neuronal fate. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that controls many aspects of nervous system development, and the outcome of Notch signaling often depends on its context-dependent integration with other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>). While most progenitor spatial and temporal factors are not maintained in neurons, our companion paper shows that the primary HDTF Bsh (Brain-specific homeobox) is persistently expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina neurons, allowing it to couple initial fate decision to subsequent circuit formation and expression of a spectrum of neuronal functional genes, such as neurotransmitters and ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). This leads to the hypothesis that Notch signaling integrates with the primary HDTF activity to diversify neuron types. To test this, we use the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina, the first ganglion in the optic lobe, to ask whether and how Notch signaling acts with the Bsh HDTF to diversify lamina neuron types.</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> lamina has only five intrinsic neuron types (L1-L5), which are analogous to bipolar cells in the vertebrate visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Sanes and Zipursky, 2010</xref>). During late larval and early pupal stages, lamina progenitor cells (LPCs) give rise to L1-L5 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang et al., 1998</xref>). The cell bodies of each lamina neuron type are localized in a layer-specific manner. L2/L3 cell bodies are intermingled in the most distal layer while L1, L4, and L5 form distinct layers progressively more proximal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Each lamina neuron type expresses unique TF markers: L1, L2 and L3 neurons express Zfh1/Svp, Bab2 and Zfh1/Erm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>), while L4 and L5 neurons express the HDTFs Bsh/Ap and Bsh/Pdm3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Our accompanying paper shows that Bsh is initiated in LPCs and maintained in L4 and L5 neurons, while Ap and Pdm3 are initiated in L4 and L5 neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Based on their initiation order, we refer to Bsh as a “primary” HDTF and Ap/Pdm3 as “secondary” HDTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Bsh activates Ap and Pdm3 and specifies L4 and L5 fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). However, it remains unknown how a single primary HDTF Bsh activates two different secondary HDTFs and specifies two distinct neuron types (L4 and L5). Could Notch signaling distinguish L4 and L5 fates?</p>
<p>Here, we elucidate the role of Notch and the primary HDTF Bsh in specifying L4 and L5 neuronal fates, resulting in the following findings. (1) Differential Notch signaling distinguishes L4 and L5 neurons. Unlike in the medulla, central brain, and ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark et al., 2021</xref>), this is not due to an asymmetric partition of a Notch pathway component between sister neurons. Newborn L4 and L5 neurons are differentially exposed to the Notch ligand Delta expressed in L1, leading to asymmetric Notch activation in L4 but not L5. (2) Previously, the relationship between the primary HDTF Bsh and Notch signaling was unknown. Here we show while Notch and Bsh expression are mutually independent, they act together to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates. (3) How Notch controls binary neuronal fates has remained elusive. We hypothesize that Notch signaling might regulate chromatin accessibility. Indeed, we find that compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5 neurons, Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4 neurons exhibit a distinct open chromatin landscape which shapes distinct Bsh genome-binding loci, resulting in L4-specific gene transcription. We propose that Notch signaling regulates the chromatin landscape in L4 neurons, leading to L4-distinct Bsh genomic binding and L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene expression.</p>

<title>Notch signaling is activated in newborn L4 neurons but not L5</title>
<p>Binding of a Notch ligand in one cell to Notch in an adjacent cell results in the translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (N-ICD) into the nucleus and the subsequent transcription of Notch target genes, including Hey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Monastirioti et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). To test whether Notch signaling is activated in newborn lamina neurons, we stained for Hey as a reporter of active Notch signaling. We found that Hey is colocalized with Bsh<sup>+</sup> L4 newborn neurons but not Bsh<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-B’’, D</xref>). We also examined the expression of another Notch target gene, <italic>E(spl)-mγ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almeida and Bray, 2005</xref>), and found that it was not expressed in lamina neurons (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The primary HDTF Bsh activates the secondary HDTFs Ap and Pdm3 in L4 and L5, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Here we show that Notch signaling is activated prior to the initiation of these secondary HDTFs, suggesting a potential causal relationship between asymmetric Notch signaling and differential secondary HDTF activation in L4 and L5 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>). Together, we conclude that there is differential Notch activity, with newborn L4, but not L5, expressing the Notch reporter Hey.</p>

<p>In most regions of the central nervous system, ganglion mother cells (GMCs) undergo asymmetric terminal divisions to make Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup> sibling neurons with distinct cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether L4 and L5 are Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup> siblings, we used twin-spot MARCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yu et al., 2009</xref>) to trace two sibling neurons, which are divided from a single LPC cell, as a GFP and RFP pair. If L4 and L5 neurons are siblings generated from an LPC asymmetric division, we predict L4 and L5 to be an invariant RFP and GFP pair. In contrast, we found the GFP and RFP pair are either both L4 neurons or both L5 neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-H</xref>). This rules out an obligate asymmetric division to produce L4/L5 siblings and suggests that differential Hey expression is due to differential contact with an extrinsic Notch ligand.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>L1 neurons express Delta and activate Notch signaling in adjacent L4 neurons</title>
<p>We tested the possibility that the asymmetric Notch signaling between L4 and L5 is due to an extrinsic exposure of L4 to Delta expression, one of the two Notch ligands in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Muskavitch, 1994</xref>). We found that during lamina neurogenesis, Delta is specifically expressed in L1 neurons which are adjacent to L4 neurons but not L5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Furthermore, we found that Delta is also expressed in the Tailless<sup>+</sup> (Tll<sup>+</sup>) LPCs in the same row as the L1 neurons, suggesting that LPCs may be more heterogeneous than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Apitz and Salecker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Huang et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C-D</xref>). To test whether the L1-specific transcription factor Svp is required to activate or maintain Delta expression in L1, we knocked down Svp expression in the lamina. We found that Svp expression is indeed almost gone following Svp-knockdown (Svp-KD), yet Delta and Hey expression remains unaffected (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that Delta expression in L1 neurons might be inherited from Delta-expressing LPCs instead of being activated by Svp. Together, we found that L1 neurons and a subset of LPCs express Delta, and Delta expression in L1 neurons does not depend on Svp.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we asked whether Delta expression in L1 neurons is required to activate Notch signaling in adjacent newborn L4 neurons. We knocked down Delta expression in lamina using the LPC driver 27G05-Gal4 and Delta-RNAi. Indeed, Delta-KD shows the absence of Delta expression in the lamina (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E’, F’</xref>). Importantly, reduced Delta expression abolished Hey expression in the newborn L4, showing that Delta expression in L1 neurons is required for activating Notch in L4 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E-F’’</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that Delta expressed in L1 neurons activates Notch signaling in L4 but not L5 neurons, making the Delta-Notch pathway a strong candidate for acting together with Bsh activity to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Bsh without Notch signaling activates Pdm3 and specifies L5 neuronal fate</title>
<p>To test whether the asymmetric Notch signaling between newborn L4 and L5 enables Bsh to differentially specify distinct L4 and L5 fates, we first performed Notch loss of function in the lamina using 27G05-Gal4 and UAS-Notch-RNAi. We found that this genotype caused embryonic lethality, so to preserve Notch function during early development, we performed conditional Notch-KD (N-KD) using Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. We inactivated the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> activity, which abrogates the suppression of 27G05-Gal4, from the beginning of the third instar stage to ensure the N-KD during lamina neurogenesis. During lamina neurogenesis, in controls, the Notch reporter Hey is expressed in newborn L4 neurons, followed by Bsh activation of Ap and Pdm3 and specification of L4 and L5 fates, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-B’’</xref>). In contrast, in N-KD, Hey expression becomes absent, and Bsh now activates Pdm3 but not Ap and specifies L5 fate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-C’’</xref>). During late pupal stages after the completion of lamina neurogenesis, control Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons include both Ap<sup>+</sup> L4 neurons and Pdm3<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>). In N-KD, however, Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons are mainly Pdm3<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons, though the number of Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons remains unaffected, suggesting that more L5 neurons are generated at the expense of L4 in N-KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-J</xref>). Interestingly, Bsh<sup>+</sup> cell bodies in N-KD settle together to mix in a single layer, in contrast to Bsh<sup>+</sup> cell bodies in controls segregating into two distinct layers with L4 distal to L5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-H</xref>). This suggests that L4 and L5 cell bodies in controls might express different cell surface molecules to achieve their neuron type-specific settling layer.</p>

<p>(A-D) N-KD in lamina (27G05-Gal4, tubP-GAL80[ts], UAS-Notch-RNAi) shows Hey expression is absent, and Bsh only activates Pdm3 and specifies L5 neuronal fate during lamina neurogenesis (19h APF).

</fig>
<p>Similarly, Delta-KD results in more L5 neurons generated at the expense of L4 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3— figure supplement 2</xref>). Note that ectopic Ap expression in L5 is caused by the 27G05-Gal4 line alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-G’’</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-B’’</xref>), probably due to its genome insertion site in the Notch target gene <italic>E(spl)m4-BFM</italic> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but this does not affect our conclusion that Bsh without Notch signaling activates Pdm3 and specifies L5 fate. Taken together, we conclude that in the absence of Notch signaling, the primary HDTF Bsh activates the secondary HDTF Pdm3 and specifies L5 neuronal fate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>Bsh with Notch signaling activates Ap and specifies L4 neuronal fate</title>
<p>To test whether Notch signaling is sufficient for Bsh to activate Ap and specify L4 neuronal fate, we first performed Notch gain of function broadly in the LPCs and lamina neurons. We used 27G05-Gal4 and Gal80<sup>ts</sup> to express the Notch intracellular domain (N-ICD; a constitutively active form of Notch) from the middle of lamina neurogenesis at 0h APF (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Following Notch misexpression, we observed ectopic Hey expression in newborn L5 neurons generated after 0h APF, showing that Notch signaling was active in L5 neurons (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C’’</xref>). Furthermore, Notch misexpression results in ectopic Bsh<sup>+</sup> Pdm3<sup>-</sup> L4 neurons and a loss of Bsh<sup>+</sup> Pdm3<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-G</xref>). Thus, broad activation of Notch signaling in lamina is sufficient for Bsh to activate Ap and specify L4 neuronal fate at the expense of L5 neuronal fate.</p>

<p>Next, we wanted to activate Notch signaling precisely in newborn L5 neurons using Bsh-Gal4. We confirmed that Bsh-Gal4 is turned on in newborn L5 and prior to Pdm3 initiation, making it the perfect driver for Notch gain of function in newborn L5 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-B’’</xref>). In controls, newborn L4 neurons express Hey followed by Ap, whereas newborn L5 neurons lack Hey expression and subsequently express Pdm3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-C’’</xref>). In contrast, expression of N-ICD in newborn &quot;L5 neurons&quot; resulted in ectopic expression of Hey followed by expression of the L4 marker Ap (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement D-D”). During late pupal stages after the completion of lamina neurogenesis, control Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons include both Ap<sup>+</sup> L4 neurons and Pdm3<sup>+</sup> L5 neurons (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-F</xref>). In N-ICD, however, Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons are mainly Ap<sup>+</sup> L4 neurons, though the number of Bsh<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons remains unaffected, suggesting that more L4 neurons are generated at the expense of L5 in N-ICD (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-J</xref>). These data support our conclusion that Notch signaling in newborn neurons is sufficient for Bsh to specify L4 neuronal fate at the expense of L5 neuronal fate (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether Bsh with Notch signaling specifies L4 morphology and connectivity, we took advantage of a Hey-ORF-Flp transgene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark et al., 2021</xref>) to trace the morphology of Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons with myristoylated Tomato and the Hey<sup>+</sup> neuron presynaptic sites with Bruchpilot (Brp) using the STaR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). L4 neurons are the only lamina neurons that express Hey (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B’</xref>). Indeed, in controls, Tomato+ neurons, which trace Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons, exhibit L4-specific morphology and connectivity in lamina: neurites and presynaptic Brp in the proximal lamina (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B-C</xref>). Following N-ICD misexpression in newborn L5, Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons, which trace the endogenous and ectopic Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons, have L4-like morphology and connectivity: neurites and presynaptic Brp in the proximal lamina (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D-E</xref>). The slight deviations from control L4 morphology following N-ICD misexpression in newborn L5 might be due to a higher Notch signaling level in N-ICD misexpression compared to control. Taken together, we conclude that in the presence of Notch signaling, the primary HDTF Bsh activates the secondary HDTF Ap and specifies L4 TF marker, morphology, and connectivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>).</p>

<title>Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent</title>
<p>Notch signaling is widely used in newborn neurons to specify binary neuronal fates, and HDTFs are broadly expressed in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jukam and Desplan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Spana and Doe, 1996</xref>), yet the relationship between Notch signaling and HDTF expression has remained elusive.

To test the relationship between Notch signaling and the primary HDTF Bsh expression, we performed conditional N-KD during lamina neurogenesis. This knockdown was highly effective, with Hey becoming undetectable, yet the number of Bsh<sup>+</sup> cells remains unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). Thus, Bsh expression is independent of Notch signaling. Conversely, we used 27G05-Gal4 and Bsh-RNAi to knock down Bsh in LPCs. This resulted in Bsh becoming undetectable, yet Hey expression was unaffected (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D-F</xref>). Thus, Notch signaling and Bsh expression are independent. Taken together, we conclude that while the expression of the secondary HDTFs depends on Notch signaling, the expression of primary HDTF Bsh and Notch signaling are mutually independent.</p>

<title>Notch signaling without Bsh specifies L3 neuron type</title>
<p>Our observation that Notch signaling remains unaffected following the loss of Bsh raises an interesting question: what is the identity of the Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons in the absence of Bsh? To address this question, we used genetic methods (schematic in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>) to trace Hey<sup>+</sup> lamina neurons with myristoylated GFP. L4 neurons are the only lamina neurons expressing Hey. Indeed, in controls, GFP+ cells, which trace Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons, express the L4 marker Bsh but not L3 markers Zfh1 or Erm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-H’’</xref>). In Bsh-KD, Bsh expression is lost, and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells instead express the L3 markers Zfh1 and Erm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I-I’’</xref>). Zfh1 is required for L1 and L3 fates, and Bsh suppresses Zfh1 to inhibit ectopic L1 and L3 fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Together, we conclude that in the absence of Bsh, Notch signaling with ectopic Zfh1 specifies L3 neuronal fate.</p>
<p>We next tested whether Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons in Bsh-KD adopt L3 morphology. In controls, GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons express the L4 marker Ap and exhibit L4-specific morphology; they project neurites into the proximal lamina, and their axons target two layers in medulla (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). In Bsh-KD, GFP<sup>+</sup> neurons express the L3 marker Erm and adopt L3-specific morphology: one-direction (comb-like) neurites in lamina and axon targeting to a single layer in medulla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K, L</xref>). We conclude that in the absence of Bsh, Notch signaling with ectopic Zfh1 specifies L3 neuronal fate and L3-specific morphology.</p>
<p>To test whether Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons in Bsh-KD adopt L3 connectivity, we examined the location of presynaptic sites of Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons. We took advantage of Hey-ORF-Flp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark et al., 2021</xref>) to label the presynaptic marker Brp of Hey<sup>+</sup> neurons with the STaR method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) (schematic in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref>). In controls, Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons in lamina exhibit L4-specific morphology and connectivity, with neurites and presynaptic Brp in the proximal lamina (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N</xref>). In contrast, following Bsh-KD, the Tomato<sup>+</sup> neurons adopt L3-specific morphology and connectivity: comb-like neurites in lamina and no significant Brp in lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5O</xref>).

<title>The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4 has correlated open chromatin, Bsh-bound loci, and transcription profile that is distinct from the Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5</title>
<p>Bsh specifies two distinct neuron types: Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4 and Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5. How are Notch signaling and Bsh activity integrated to specify L4 neuron type over L5? Bsh binds numerous L4 feature genes: ion channels, synaptic organizers, cytoskeleton regulators, synaptic recognition molecules, neuropeptide/receptor, and neurotransmitter/receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). This raises the hypothesis that Notch signaling might generate an L4-distinct open chromatin landscape which determines the accessibility of Bsh target genes, resulting in L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene transcription. To determine if L4 and L5 have differing open chromatin regions and Bsh genome-binding sites, we used Targeted DamID (TaDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Southall et al., 2013</xref>) to profile both open chromatin (Dam-alone binding) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Aughey et al., 2018</xref>) and Bsh genome-binding loci (Dam:Bsh binding) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We performed these experiments with precise spatial and temporal control: only in L4 neurons (using L4-Gal4), which we reported in our accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>) or L5 neurons (using L5-Gal4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Luo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nern et al., 2008</xref>) at the time of synapse formation (46-76h APF; <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-B’’</xref>). We confirmed the function of the Bsh:Dam fusion protein previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>).

<p>Our data show that the Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4 neurons, compared to the Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, have distinct open chromatin regions, which is consistent with the known role of Notch signaling driving histone acetylation, a marker of active enhancers, in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oswald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Skalska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, Supplementary File 1). Indeed, we found the canonical binding motif of Suppressor of Hairless (Su(H)), the DNA-binding partner of Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bray and Furriols, 2001</xref>), is more likely to be enriched in L4-distinct open chromatin regions (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). To test whether L4-distinct open chromatin regions result in L4-specific gene transcription, we took advantage of recently published lamina neuron single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jain et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, our data show the significant enrichment of L4-specific transcribed genes in L4-distinct open chromatin regions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, Supplementary File 2). Similarly, we found that L5-specific transcribed genes are enriched in L5-distinct open chromatin regions (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>, Supplementary File 3). Together, our data suggest that Notch signaling directly or indirectly generates an L4-distinct open chromatin landscape which correlates with L4-specific gene transcription (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we tested the hypothesis that L4-distinct open chromatin landscape leads to L4-distinct Bsh genome-binding loci, which in turn results in L4-specific gene transcription. We found that L4 and L5 neurons indeed show distinct Bsh genome-binding loci (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Supplementary File 4). Furthermore, L4-distinct Bsh-bound loci, similar to L4-distinct open chromatin, are enriched for L4-specific transcribed genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, Supplementary File 2). This suggests that L4-distinct open chromatin, via L4-distinct Bsh-bound loci, leads to L4-specific gene transcription. Interestingly, we did not see the significant enrichment of L5-specific transcribed genes in L5-distinct Bsh-bound loci, suggesting another unknown factor, e.g., the secondary HDTF Pdm3, might be required for L5-specific gene transcription (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, Supplementary File 3). Taken together, we propose that Notch signaling creates a distinct open chromatin landscape leading to distinct Bsh-bound loci in L4 neurons, and thus generating L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene transcription (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>

<p>Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for controlling binary cell fates in worms, flies, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ehebauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jukam and Desplan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pierfelice et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pinto-Teixeira et al., 2018</xref>), yet its mechanism has been unclear.

The primary HDTF Bsh with Notch signaling specifies L4 fate, while Bsh alone specifies L5 fate. The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4, compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent. In the absence of Bsh, the Notch<sup>ON</sup> and Notch<sup>OFF</sup> neurons with ectopic HDTF Zfh1 adopt L3 and L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>) fates, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). Together, based on our findings, we propose a novel model in which the unique combination of the primary HDTF and open chromatin landscape specifies distinct neuron types.</p>

<p>Does Notch signaling regulate chromatin landscape independently of a primary HDTF? It seems likely based on the following observation: in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval ventral nerve cord, motor and sensory hemilineages are generated in a Notch-dependent manner; all premotor neurons are Notch<sup>ON</sup>, with Notch<sup>ON</sup> neurons sharing similar anatomical and functional properties, despite expressing distinct HDTFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Heckscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mark et al., 2021</xref>), possibly due to the common chromatin landscape regulated by Notch signaling. An important future direction would be to test whether Notch<sup>ON</sup> neurons retain the same chromatin landscape in the absence of the primary HDTF, e.g., Bsh.</p>
<p>Despite the important roles of Notch signaling in development, its function in lamina development was unknown. Here we discovered that L1 neurons express Delta and activate Notch signaling in adjacent newborn L4 but not in the more distant L5. L3 is also adjacent to the Delta<sup>+</sup> L1; might L3 be a Notch<sup>ON</sup> neuron? If so, it would use a different effector, as Hey is not expressed in newborn L3 neurons. Yet, it seems likely for several reasons: (1) like L4, newborn L3 neurons are strictly adjacent to Delta<sup>+</sup> L1; (2) Asymmetric Notch signaling between L3 and L1 would allow Zfh1 to differentially specify L3 and L1 neuronal fates; (3) in Bsh-KD, Notch signaling with ectopic Zfh1 specifies ectopic L3 neuron type. To tackle this, an intriguing approach would be profiling the genome-binding targets of endogenous Notch in newborn neurons. This will identify novel genes as Notch signaling reporters in neurons. Besides lamina neurons, we also detected Delta expression in a small pool of LPCs in the L1 row and the Notch target E(spl)-mγ expression in the L4 row, raising the hypothesis that Delta-expressing LPCs may rise to L1 neurons while E(spl)-mγ-expressing LPCs may rise to L4 neurons. This also suggests that LPCs are more heterogeneous than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Apitz and Salecker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fernandes et al., 2017</xref>). It would be interesting to characterize the molecular heterogeneity of LPCs using scRNA-seq and explore the potential role of Notch signaling in this population.</p>
<p>It is well-known that Notch signaling controls binary cell fates. Yet, its mechanism remains unclear. We found that Notch signaling and primary HDTF Bsh activity are integrated to specify two distinct neuron types: L4 and L5. Notch signaling directly or indirectly generates an L4-distinct open chromatin landscape which specifies L4-distinct Bsh-bound loci, resulting in L4-specific Bsh-dependent gene transcription. This is consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> findings of Notch function. In cultured mammalian cells, upon Notch activation, Notch transcription complexes recruit p300, which acetylates H3K27 and produce a large increase in H3K27 acetylation levels, an active enhancer marker, across the entire breadth of super-enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oswald et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, Notch activation induces a robust increase in H3K56 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Skalska et al., 2015</xref>). One intriguing future direction would be testing whether Notch signaling directly generates an open chromatin landscape <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Our brain function depends on the vast diversity of neuron types. The role of TFs in specifying neuron types has been well-studied. For example, each temporal transcription factor (TTF) acts transiently in progenitors to generate specific neuron types during its expression window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2013</xref>). While most TTFs are not maintained in neurons, their function is likely maintained by another TF, e.g., HDTF, which is persistently expressed in neurons. Indeed, HDTFs function as terminal selectors and control the expression of neuronal identity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cros and Hobert, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hobert, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Howell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Reilly et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">2020</xref>). The primary HDTF Bsh specifies L4 and L5 neuronal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). However, the role of open chromatin in specifying neuron type is less well characterized. <italic>In vitro</italic>, during the programming of mouse embryonic stem cells to neurons, proneural factors Ascl1 and Neurogenin2 establish distinct chromatin landscapes, resulting in induced neurons with different subtype identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Aydin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we found that Bsh with Notch signaling specifies L4 fate, while Bsh alone specifies L5 fate. The Notch<sup>ON</sup> L4, compared to Notch<sup>OFF</sup> L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. Furthermore, in Bsh-KD, L3 and L1 are ectopically generated at the expense of L4 and L5, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). This elegant one-to-one fate switch (L4&gt;L3; L5&gt;L1) raises an open question: would newborn L4 and L3 share the open chromatin landscape, which is distinct from the one shared by newborn L5 and L1? Our findings provide a testable model that the unique combination of the primary HDTF and open chromatin landscape specifies distinct neuron types.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Fly brains were dissected in Schneider’s medium and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 25 min. After fixation, brains were quickly washed with PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBT) and incubated in PBT for at least 2 hr at room temperature. Next, samples were incubated in blocking buffer (10% normal donkey serum, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) overnight at 4°C. Brains were then incubated in primary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) at 4°C for at least two nights. Following primary antibody incubation, brains were washed with PBT. Next, brains were incubated in secondary antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) at 4°C for at least one day.</p>
<p>Following secondary antibody incubation, brains were washed with PBT and mounted in SlowFade Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 800 confocal and processed with Image J, Adobe Illustrator (San Jose, CA) and Adobe Photoshop (San Jose, CA).</p>

<title>TaDa in L4 and L5 neurons at the time of synapse formation</title>
<p>For TaDa in L4, homozygous tubP-GAL80[ts]; 31C06-Gal4, UAS-myristoylated-tdTomato males were crossed to homozygous virgin females (FlyORF-TaDa line for Dam; Bsh-TaDa line for Bsh:Dam). For TaDa in L5, homozygous tubP-GAL80[ts]; 6-60-Gal4 UAS-myristoylated-tdTomato males were crossed to homozygous virgin females (FlyORF-TaDa line for Dam; Bsh-TaDa line for Bsh:Dam). Crosses were reared at 18°C. To perform TaDa in L4 and L5 neurons during the synapse formation window, we collected pupae with the age of 46h APF and moved them to 29°C to activate 31C06-Gal4 (L4) or 6-60-Gal4 (L5) for 24 hours (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then lamina were dissected (age equivalent at 25°C: 76h APF) in cold PBS within one hour and stored at −20°C immediately until sufficient laminae were collected for each group—about 70 lamina from 35 pupae. The published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>) TaDa experimental pipeline was followed with a few modifications. Briefly, DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) digested with DpnI (NEB, Ipswich, MA) overnight, and cleaned up using Qiagen PCR purification columns. DamID adaptors were ligated using T4 DNA ligase (NEB, Ipswich, MA) followed by DpnII (NEB, Ipswich, MA) digestion for 2 h and PCR amplification using MyTaq HS DNA polymerase (Bioline, Memphis, Tennessee). The samples were sequenced on the NovaSeq at 118 base pairs and 27-33 million single-end reads per sample.</p>

<title>Bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>DamID-seq NGS sequencing reads were processed using damidseq_pipeline v1.5.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Marshall and Brand, 2015</xref>). For generating Bsh binding profile bedGraphs, the default settings were used. For generating Dam-alone coverage bedGraphs, the pipeline was run on the Dam-alone sequencing files with the --just_coverage setting. For both datasets (Bsh binding and Dam-alone), peaks were identified using find_peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>) on separate replicates.</p>
<p>All downstream analyses were conducted using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Team, 2016</xref>). Significant peaks from all replicates were combined using the GenomicRanges R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>), and the average occupancy over each significant peak was determined for each replicate. As the overall Bsh binding profiles between L4 and L5 neurons were highly correlated, the binding profiles of all replicates were quantile normalized prior to further analysis.</p>
<p>Differentially open regions in the Dam-alone dataset, and differentially-bound regions in the Bsh binding dataset, were identified using NOIseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tarazona et al., 2015</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hatch et al., 2021</xref>) at a threshold of q=0.85. Separately, peaks were assigned to genes, with all genes within 1kb of a peak assigned as putative regulatory targets of that peak.</p>
<p>Tests for enrichment were conducted using Fisher’s exact test, with contingency tables derived from differentially open or bound regions and the overlap of these with lineage-specific gene expression targets. The alternative hypothesis was that Bsh-bound targets or open chromatin would be enriched for genes expressed in the same lineage. Odds ratios were expressed as L4/L5 for all samples.</p>
<p>Motif searches were conducted using the core YGTGRGAAM motif, obtained as a PWM from CisBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Weirauch et al., 2014</xref>) (Motif ID: M10415_2.00), using the R Biostrings package (Pagès et al., 2022). For motif searches, open chromatin regions were limited to a maximum size of 1kb around the center of the region. Motifs with a match score &gt;= 85% were counted as a match.</p>

<p>Like the &quot;preceding&quot; co-submitted paper, this is again a very strong and interesting paper in which the authors address a question that is raised by the finding in their co-submitted paper - how does one factor induce two different fates. The authors provide an extremely satisfying answer - only one subset of the cells neighbors a source of signaling cells that trigger that subset to adopt a specific fate. The signal here is Delta and the read-out is Notch, whose intracellular domain, in conjunction with, presumably, SuH cooperates with Bsh to distinguish L4 from L5 fate (L5 is not neighbored by signal-providing cells). Like the back-to-back paper, the data is rigorous, well-presented and presents important conclusions. There's a wealth of data on the different functions of Notch (with and without Bsh). All very satisfying.</p>
<p>I have again one suggestion that the authors may want to consider discussing. I'm wondering whether the open chromatin that the author convincingly measure is the CAUSE or the CONSEQUENCE of Bsh being able to activate L4 target genes. What I mean by this is that currently the authors seem to be focused on a somewhat sequential model where Notch signaling opens chromatin and this then enables Bsh to activate a specific set of target genes. But isn't it equally possible that the combined activity of Bsh/Notch(intra)/SuH opens chromatin? That's not a semantic/minor difference, it's a fundamentally different mechanism, I would think. This mechanism also solves the conundrum of specificity - how does Notch know which genes to &quot;open&quot; up? It would seem more intuitive to me to think that it's working together with Bsh to open up chromatin, with chromatin accessibility than being a &quot;mere&quot; secondary consequence. If I'm not overlooking something fundamental here, there is actually also a way to distinguish between these models - test chromatin accessibility in a Bsh mutant. If the author's model is true, chromatin accessibility should be unchanged.</p>
<p>I again finish by commending the authors for this terrific piece of work.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors explore how Notch activity acts together with Bsh homeodomain transcription factors to establish L4 and L5 fates in the lamina of the visual system of Drosophila. They propose a model in which differential Notch activity generates different chromatin landscapes in presumptive L4 and L5, allowing the differential binding of the primary homeodomain TF Bsh (as described in the co-submitted paper), which in turn activate downstream genes specific to either neuronal type. The requirement of Notch for L4 vs. L5 fate is well supported, and complete transformation from one cell type into the other is observed when altering Notch activity. However, the role of Notch in creating differential chromatin landscapes is not directly demonstrated. It is only based on correlation, but it remains a plausible and intriguing hypothesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors are successful in characterizing the role of Notch to distinguish between L4 and L5 cell fates. They show that the Notch pathway is active in L4 but not in L5. They identify L1, the neuron adjacent to L4 as expressing the Delta ligand, therefore being the potential source for Notch activation in L4. Moreover, the manuscript shows molecular and morphological/connectivity transformations from one cell type into the other when Notch activity is manipulated.</p>
<p>Using DamID, the authors characterize the chromatin landscape of L4 and L5 neurons. They show that Bsh occupies distinct loci in each cell type. This support their model that Bsh acts as a primary selector gene in L4/L5 that activates different target genes in L4 vs L5 based on the differential availability of open chromatin loci.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript presents an interesting example of how Notch activity cooperates with TF expression to generate diverging cell fates. Together with the accompanying paper, it helps thoroughly describe how lamina cell types L4 and L5 are specified and provides an interesting hypothesis for the role of Notch and Bsh in increasing neuronal diversity in the lamina during evolution.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Differential Notch activity in L4 and L5:</p>
<p>
● The manuscript focuses its attention on describing Notch activity in L4 vs L5 neurons. However, from the data presented, it is very likely that the pool of progenitors (LPCs) is already subdivided into at least two types of progenitors that will rise to L4 and L5, respectively. Evidence to support this is the activity of E(spl)-mɣ-GFP and the Dl puncta observed in the LPC region. Discussion should naturally follow that Notch-induced differences in L4/L5 might preexist L1-expressed Dl that affect newborn L4/L5. Therefore, the differences between L4 and L5 fates might be established earlier than discussed in the paper. The authors should acknowledge this possibility and discuss it in their model.</p>
<p>
● The authors claim that Notch activation is caused by L1-expressed Delta. However, they use an LPC driver to knock down Dl. Dl-KD should be performed exclusively in L1, and the fate of L4 should be assessed.</p>
<p>
● To test whether L4 neurons are derived from NotchON LPCs, I suggest performing MARCM clones in early pupa with an E(spl)-mɣ-GFP reporter.</p>
<p>
● The expression of different Notch targets in LPCs and L4 neurons may be further explored. I suggest using different Notch-activity reporters (i.e., E(spl)-GFP reporters) to further characterize these differences. What cause the switch in Notch target expression from LPCs to L4 neurons should be a topic of discussion.</p>
<p>Notch role in establishing L4 vs L5 fates:</p>
<p>
● The authors describe that 27G05-Gal4 causes a partial Notch Gain of Function caused by its genomic location between Notch target genes. However, this is not further elaborated. The use of this driver is especially problematic when performing Notch KD, as many of the resulting neurons express Ap, and therefore have some features of L4 neurons. Therefore, Pdm3+/Ap+ cells should always be counted as intermediate L4/L5 fate (i.e., Fig3 E-J, Fig3-Sup2), irrespective of what the mechanistic explanation for Ap activation might be. It's not accurate to assume their L5 identity. In Fig4 intermediate-fate cells are correctly counted as such.</p>
<p>
● Lines 170-173: The temporal requirement for Notch activity in L5-to-L4 transformation is not clearly delineated. In Fig4-figure supplement 1D-E, it is not stated if the shift to 29{degree sign}C is performed as in Fig4-figure supplement 1A-C.</p>
<p>
● Additionally, using the same approach, it would be interesting to explore the window of competence for Notch-induced L5-to-L4 transformation: at which point in L5 maturation can fate no longer be changed by Notch GoF?</p>
<p>L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh</p>
<p>
● Although interesting, the L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh is never shown to be dependent on Notch activity. Importantly, L3 NotchON status is assumed based on their position next to Dl-expressing L1, but it is not empirically tested. Perhaps screening Notch target reporter expression in the lamina, as suggested above, could inform this issue.</p>
<p>
● Otherwise, the analysis of Bsh Loss of Function in L4 might be better suited to be included in the accompanying manuscript that specifically deals with the role of Bsh as a selector gene for L4 and L5.</p>
<p>Different chromatin landscape in L4 and L5 neurons</p>
<p>
● A major concern is that, although L4 and L5 neurons are shown to present different chromatin landscapes (as expected for different neuronal types), it is not demonstrated that this is caused by Notch activity. The paper proves unambiguously that Notch activity, in concert with Bsh, causes the fate choice between L4 and L5. However, that this is caused by Notch creating a differential chromatin landscape is based only in correlation (NotchON cells having a different profile than NotchOFF). Although the authors are careful not to claim that differential chromatin opening is caused directly by Notch, this is heavily suggested throughout the text and must be toned down.</p>
<p>
e.g.: Line 294: &quot;With Notch signaling, L4 neurons generate distinct open chromatin landscape&quot; and Line 298: &quot;Our findings propose a model that the unique combination of HDTF and open chromatin landscape (e.g. by Notch signaling)&quot; . These claims are not supported well enough, and alternative hypotheses should be provided in the discussion. An alternative hypothesis could be that LPCs are already specified towards L4 and L5 fates. In this context, different early Bsh targets in each cell type could play a pioneer role generating a differential chromatin landscape.</p>
<p>● The correlation between open chromatin and Bsh loci with Differentially Expressed genes is much higher for L4 than L5. It is not clear why this is the case, and should be discussed further by the authors.</p>

<p>Thanks!  It is a crucial question whether Notch signaling regulates chromatin landscape independently of a primary HDTF. We will include this discussion in the text and pursue it in our next project.</p>
<p>We think Notch signaling may regulate chromatin accessibility independently of a primary HDTF based on our observation: in larval ventral nerve cord, all premotor neurons are NotchON neurons while all postsensory neurons are NotchOFF neurons; NotchON neurons share similar functional properties, despite expressing distinct HDTFs, possibly due to the common chromatin landscape regulated by Notch signaling.</p>

<p>The authors are successful in characterizing the role of Notch to distinguish between L4 and L5 cell fates. They show that the Notch pathway is active in L4 but not in L5. They identify L1, the neuron adjacent to L4 as expressing the Delta ligand, therefore being the potential source for Notch activation in L4. Moreover, the manuscript shows molecular and morphological/connectivity transformations from one cell type into the other when Notch activity is manipulated.</p>

<p>Using DamID, the authors characterize the chromatin landscape of L4 and L5 neurons. They show that Bsh occupies distinct loci in each cell type. This supports their model that Bsh acts as a primary selector gene in L4/L5 that activates different target genes in L4 vs L5 based on the differential availability of open chromatin loci.</p>

<p>Overall, the manuscript presents an interesting example of how Notch activity cooperates with TF expression to generate diverging cell fates. Together with the accompanying paper, it helps thoroughly describe how lamina cell types L4 and L5 are specified and provides an interesting hypothesis for the role of Notch and Bsh in increasing neuronal diversity in the lamina during evolution.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Differential Notch activity in L4 and L5:</p>
<p>●  The manuscript focuses its attention on describing Notch activity in L4 vs L5 neurons. However, from the data presented, it is very likely that the pool of progenitors (LPCs) is already subdivided into at least two types of progenitors that will rise to L4 and L5, respectively. Evidence to support this is the activity of E(spl)-mɣ-GFP and the Dl puncta observed in the LPC region. Discussion should naturally follow that Notch-induced differences in L4/L5 might preexist L1-expressed Dl that affect newborn L4/L5. Therefore, the differences between L4 and L5 fates might be established earlier than discussed in the paper. The authors should acknowledge this possibility and discuss it in their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. Historically, LPCs are thought to be homogenous; our data suggests otherwise. We now emphasize this in the Discussion as requested. We are also investigating this question using single-cell RNAseq on LPCs to look for molecular heterogeneities. Nevertheless, whether L4 is generated by E(spl)mɣ-GFP+ (NotchON) LPCs does not affect our conclusion that Notch signaling and the primary HDTF Bsh are integrated to specify L4 fate over L5.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>●  The authors claim that Notch activation is caused by L1-expressed Delta. However, they use an LPC driver to knock down Dl. Dl-KD should be performed exclusively in L1, and the fate of L4 should be assessed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Dl is transiently expressed in newborn L1 neurons. To knock down Dl in newborn L1, we need to express Dl-RNAi before the onset of Dl expression in newborn L1; the only known Gal4 line expressed that early is the LPC-Gal4, which is the one that we used.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>●  To test whether L4 neurons are derived from NotchON LPCs, I suggest performing MARCM clones in early pupa with an E(spl)-mɣ-GFP reporter.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree! Whether L4 neurons are derived from NotchON LPCs is a great question. However, MARCM clones in early pupa with an E(spl)-mɣ-GFP reporter will not work because E(spl)-mɣ-GFP reporter is only expressed in LPCs but not lamina neurons. We now mention this in the Discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>●  The expression of different Notch targets in LPCs and L4 neurons may be further explored. I suggest using different Notch-activity reporters (i.e., E(spl)-GFP reporters) to further characterize these. differences. What cause the switch in Notch target expression from LPCs to L4 neurons should be a topic of discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks! It is a great question why Notch induces Espl-mɣ in LPCs but Hey in newborn neurons. However, it is not the question we are tackling in this paper and it will be a great direction to pursue in future. We will add this to our Discussion.</p>

<p>Notch role in establishing L4 vs L5 fates:</p>
<p>●  The authors describe that 27G05-Gal4 causes a partial Notch Gain of Function caused by its genomic location between Notch target genes. However, this is not further elaborated. The use of this driver is especially problematic when performing Notch KD, as many of the resulting neurons express Ap, and therefore have some features of L4 neurons. Therefore, Pdm3+/Ap+ cells should always be counted as intermediate L4/L5 fate (i.e., Fig3 E-J, Fig3-Sup2), irrespective of what the mechanistic explanation for Ap activation might be. It's not accurate to assume their L5 identity. In Fig4 intermediate-fate cells are correctly counted as such.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree that the use of 27G05-Gal4 is problematic when performing Notch-KD because our conclusion from Notch-KD is that Bsh without Notch signaling activates Pdm3 and specifies L5 fate. However, 27G05-Gal4 does not have any effect on Pdm3 expression. To make this clearer, we will quantify the percentage of Pdm3+ L5 neurons in Bsh+ lamina neurons for Notch-KD experiment. We are sorry this wasn't clearer.</p>

<p>●  Lines 170-173: The temporal requirement for Notch activity in L5-to-L4 transformation is not clearly delineated. In Fig4-figure supplement 1D-E, it is not stated if the shift to 29{degree sign}C is performed as in Fig4-figure supplement 1A-C.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for catching this. We will correct it in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>●  Additionally, using the same approach, it would be interesting to explore the window of competence for Notch-induced L5-to-L4 transformation: at which point in L5 maturation can fate no longer be changed by Notch GoF?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data show that Bsh with transient Notch signaling in newborn neurons specifies L4 fate while Bsh without Notch signaling in newborn neurons specifies L5 fate. Therefore, we think the window of fate competence is during newborn neurons.</p>
<p>However, as suggested by the reviewer, we did the experiment (see figure below). We used Gal80 (Gal80 inhibits Gal4 activity at 18C) to temporarily control Bsh-Gal4 activity for expressing N-ICD (the active form of Notch) in L5 neurons. We found that tub-Gal80ts, Bsh-Gal4&gt;UAS-N-ICD is unable to induce ectopic L4 neurons when we shift the temperature from 18C to 30C to inactivate Gal80 at 15 hours after pupal formation, which is close to the end of lamina neurogenesis. However, it is unknown how many hours it takes to inactivate Gal80 and activate Bsh-Gal4 and thus we decided not to include this data in our manuscript.</p>

<p>L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh</p>
<p>●  Although interesting, the L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh is never shown to be dependent on Notch activity. Importantly, L3 NotchON status is assumed based on their position next to Dlexpressing L1, but it is not empirically tested. Perhaps screening Notch target reporter expression in the lamina, as suggested above, could inform this issue.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data show the L4-to-L3 conversion in the absence of Bsh and in the presence of Notch activity while the L5-to-L1 conversion in the absence of Bsh and in the absence of Notch activity. Therefore, Notch activity is necessary for the L4-to-L3 conversion. Unfortunately, currently, we only have Hey as an available Notch target reporter in newborn neurons. To tackle this challenge in the future, we will profile the genome-binding targets of endogenous Notch in newborn neurons. This will identify novel genes as Notch signaling reporters in neurons for the field.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>●  Otherwise, the analysis of Bsh Loss of Function in L4 might be better suited to be included in the accompanying manuscript that specifically deals with the role of Bsh as a selector gene for L4 and L5.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That is an interesting suggestion, but without knowing that Bsh + Notch = L4 identity the experiment would be hard to interpret. Note that we took advantage of Notch signaling to trace the cell fate in the absence of Bsh and found the L4-to-L3 conversion (see Figure 5G-K).</p>

<p>Different chromatin landscape in L4 and L5 neurons</p>
<p>●  A major concern is that, although L4 and L5 neurons are shown to present different chromatin landscapes (as expected for different neuronal types), it is not demonstrated that this is caused by Notch activity. The paper proves unambiguously that Notch activity, in concert with Bsh, causes the fate choice between L4 and L5. However, that this is caused by Notch creating a differential chromatin landscape is based only in correlation. (NotchON cells having a different profile than NotchOFF). Although the authors are careful not to claim that differential chromatin opening is caused directly by Notch, this is heavily suggested throughout the text and must be toned down.e.g.: Line 294: &quot;With Notch signaling, L4 neurons generate distinct open chromatin landscape&quot; and Line 298: &quot;Our findings propose a model that the unique combination of HDTF and open chromatin landscape (e.g. by Notch signaling)&quot; . These claims are not supported well enough, and alternative hypotheses should be provided in the discussion. An alternative hypothesis could be that LPCs are already specified towards L4 and L5 fates. In this context, different early Bsh targets in each cell type could play a pioneer role generating a differential chromatin landscape.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and appreciate the comment, it is well justified. We have toned down our comments and clearly state that this is a correlation that needs to be tested for a causal relationship. The reviewer posits: “An alternative hypothesis: different early Bsh targets in each cell type could play a pioneer role generating a differential chromatin landscape.” Yes, it is a crucial question whether Notch signaling regulates chromatin landscape independently of a primary HDTF (e.g., Bsh). We will include this discussion in the text and pursue it in our next project. We think Notch signaling may regulate chromatin accessibility independently of a primary HDTF based on our observation: in larval ventral nerve cord, all premotor neurons are NotchON neurons while all post-sensory neurons are NotchOFF neurons; NotchON neurons share similar functional properties, despite expressing distinct HDTFs, possibly due to the common chromatin landscape regulated by Notch signaling.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>●  The correlation between open chromatin and Bsh loci with Differentially Expressed genes is much higher for L4 than L5. It is not clear why this is the case, and should be discussed further by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree and think in L5 neurons, the secondary HDTF Pdm3 also contributes to L5-specific gene transcription during the synaptogenesis window, in addition to Bsh. We will include this in the text.</p>
