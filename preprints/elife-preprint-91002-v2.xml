<title>Abstract</title><p>Proteotoxic stress impairs cellular homeostasis and underlies the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The proteasomal and autophagic degradation of proteins are two major pathways for protein quality control in the cell. Here, we report a genome-wide CRISPR screen uncovering a major regulator of cytotoxicity resulting from the inhibition of the proteasome. Dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) was found to be a robust suppressor, the loss of which protects against proteasome inhibition-associated cell death through promoting clearance of ubiquitinated proteins. Loss of DBT altered the metabolic and energetic status of the cell and resulted in activation of autophagy in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent mechanism in the presence of proteasomal inhibition. Loss of DBT protected against proteotoxicity induced by ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian neurons. DBT is upregulated in the tissues from ALS patients. These results demonstrate that DBT is a master switch in the metabolic control of protein quality control with implications in neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The maintenance of protein homeostasis is essential for cell viability, but protein often misfolds during the life of the cell as a result of destabilizing mutations, environmental stress, or metabolic challenges. Protein misfolding is a common theme in human neurodegenerative disorders, among a growing list of &quot;conformational diseases&quot;, which often manifest with pathologies of proteinaceous inclusions in the affected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Prusiner 2012</xref>). These neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s (AD), Parkinson’s (PD), Huntington’s (HD) diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ross and Poirier 2004</xref>). For instance, protein inclusions containing TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, including the majority of ALS cases and significant subsets of FTD and AD cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Neumann et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cairns et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lagier-Tourenne et al. 2010</xref>). The accumulation of misfolded proteins can overwhelm the protein quality control systems in the cell and lead to functional impairment or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tyedmers et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, proteotoxicity is considered a critical step in the pathogenesis of relevant neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms through which the cell organizes its protein quality control systems to alleviate proteotoxicity are not fully understood.</p>
<p>To guard against proteotoxicity, the cell has evolved elaborate machinery that can detect and degrade abnormal proteins to maintain the health of its proteome. The protein degradation machinery, including the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Varshavsky 2017</xref>), play a critical role in removing the misfolded or aggregated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a selective proteolytic system based on the tagging of substrate proteins with ubiquitin molecules, plays a pivotal role in protein quality control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Glickman and Ciechanover 2002</xref>). Autophagy is another major pathway for protein quality control, which mediates bulk or selective protein degradation or removal of protein aggregates in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yamamoto and Yue 2014</xref>). Impairment of both the UPS and autophagic systems has been extensively implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ciechanover and Brundin 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wong and Cuervo 2010</xref>). Although proteotoxicity is known to be counteracted by the quality control systems including UPS and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Pohl and Dikic 2019</xref>), how these systems are regulated in a coordinated manner to mount an effective defense against proteotoxic stress remains poorly understood.</p>
<p>Here, in search of critical regulators of proteotoxicity and protein quality control, we conducted an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen for suppressors of cytotoxicity as a result of proteasomal impairment and then identified dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) as a major regulator of protein quality control. We found that loss of DBT robustly enhanced survival of cells under stress induced by proteasomal impairment. The mechanisms through which loss of DBT conferred resistance to the proteasomal inhibition was through an AMPK-dependent signaling that retained autophagic activities when the proteasomal activity was diminished. Loss of DBT also protected against proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative models. Abnormal upregulation of DBT in ALS patient tissues suggests that the DBT-dependent protein quality control pathways are dysregulated in the human disease conditions. These results have revealed a previously unknown mechanism of maintaining proteostasis that has implications for understanding the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Genome-wide screening identifies DBT as a potent suppressor of proteasomal inhibition-induced cytotoxicity</title>
<p>To identify critical regulators of proteotoxicity as a result of proteasomal impairment, we designed a CRISPR-Cas9 screen to search for suppressors that confer resistance to toxicity induced by proteasomal inhibition in mammalian cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The screen was performed on human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE1) cells, a genomically stable diploid cell line, through infection with single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) from the human GeCKO (Genome-Scale CRISPR Knock-out) lentiviral pooled library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sanjana et al. 2014</xref>). A potent and reversible proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kisselev and Goldberg 2001</xref>), which is a peptide aldehyde and analog of proteasomal substrates, was applied to induce proteotoxicity. The sensitivity of RPE1 cells to proteasome inhibition was tested with MG132 treatment at a range of concentrations, with 2 μM of MG132 observed to cause lethality in most of the cells within 6 days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The CRISPR screen was then performed with 2 μM of MG132 as the optimized concentration for selecting suppressors that would confer resistance to the proteasomal inhibition-induced toxicity. The RPE1 cells were infected with the GeCKO pooled lentiviral sgRNAs and cultured in the presence of 2 μM of MG132 for 6 days, and the surviving cells were allowed to recover without MG132 and grow into single cell-derived colonies. These colonies were then harvested and sequenced for further analysis.</p>

<p>The single-cell-derived colonies were expanded and analyzed for their resistance to the proteasomal inhibition-induced cell toxicity. The cell line that had the most potent resistance phenotype was found to harbor a specific sgRNA against the DBT gene. Sanger sequencing of the genomic locus targeted by the sgRNA revealed a homozygous mutation, where a 1-bp insertion in exon 2 resulted in a premature stop codon in exon 3 (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The loss of the C-terminal 77 amino acids from the 482 a.a. full-length protein suggests that this is a null mutant of DBT (Supplemental Fig. S1A). The phenotype of the DBT knockout (KO) cell line was verified through a series of cell survival experiments, in which the cells were subjected to MG132 treatment at a range of concentrations or over a period of time, and the DBT KO cells exhibited the robust phenotype of resisting MG132-induced cytotoxicity when compared to the wild-type (WT) control cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Additionally, the resistance of DBT KO cells to proteasome inhibition-induced cytotoxicity was confirmed using another proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib. The results from the bortezomib assay were consistent with those of MG132, as the DBT KO cells consistently demonstrated better survival rates than the WT control cells (Supplemental Fig. S1C and D). To further confirm the role of DBT in the cell survival phenotype through an independent approach of removing DBT protein, we knocked down DBT in RPE1 cells by using a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) against the gene and observed a similar phenotype, indicating that DBT deficiency indeed underlies the resistance of the cells to MG132-induced cell toxicity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether the resistance of the DBT KO cells to MG132-induced cell toxicity could be rescued by exogenous DBT. We engineered a DBT cDNA (DBT’) harboring seven synonymous point mutations in the gRNA-targeted region, which rendered the cDNA resistant to the Cas9 cleavage in the DBT KO cell line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> and Supplemental Fig. S1B). The expression of DBT’ in the DBT KO cells completely restored the cell lethality phenotype induced by MG132 treatment, as measured by the fluorescence signals from Calcein AM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), a cell-permeant dye that stains live cells. Moreover, the MG132-induced cell death can be measured by the cleavage of marker proteins such as PARP1 and Caspase 3 through immunoblotting analysis. While WT RPE1 cells exhibited pronounced cell death as indicated by the increase in cleaved PARP1 and Caspase 3 after treatment with 2 μM MG132 for 48 hr, the loss of DBT markedly suppressed the cleavage of these cell death marker proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">H</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that loss of DBT robustly suppresses cell toxicity induced by the proteasome inhibitor MG132.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Loss of DBT prevents the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins</title>
<p>Next, we sought to identify the underlying mechanism through which DBT regulates MG132-induced cytotoxicity. The primary action of MG132 is to block the proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome complex, which is responsible for the degradation of most ubiquitinated proteins. To assess the effect of MG132-induced proteasomal inhibition on protein ubiquitination in WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells, we performed immunoblotting analysis of ubiquitinated proteins, which showed an accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the WT cells upon the MG132 treatment, whereas the MG132-induced changes in the levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the DBT KO cells were significantly reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Moreover, the relative reduction in the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the DBT KO cells compared with those in the WT cells was observed over a period of 3 days of the MG132 treatment (Supplemental Fig. S2A), when more than half of the WT cells had died, Furthermore, we performed immunofluorescence staining analysis on these cells using a ubiquitin-specific antibody. Although the ubiquitin signal was very low without MG132 treatment, there was a substantial accumulation of ubiquitin-positive proteins in the WT cells upon treatment with 2 μM of MG132 for 48 hr. However, the MG132-induced increase in ubiquitin immunofluorescence signals was greatly diminished in the DBT KO cells when compared with the WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting that the loss of DBT suppressed the MG132-induced cell death by preventing the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins.</p>

<p>The ubiquitin modification is a universal feature of pathological protein aggregates observed in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alves-Rodrigues et al. 1998</xref>). To measure the levels of aggregated proteins in WT or DBT KO RPE1 cells, we employed a fluorescent dye, ProteoStat, that detects protein aggregates by selectively intercalating into the cross-beta spine of quaternary structures typically found in misfolded and aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lesire et al. 2020</xref>). The fluorescence staining indicated that the MG132 treatment triggered a substantial accumulation of aggregated proteins in the WT cells; however, the levels of the protein aggregates were significantly reduced in the DBT KO cells under the MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), consistent with the changes in the levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins. These results demonstrate that the loss of DBT prevents the accumulation of protein aggregates as a result of MG132-induced proteasomal inhibition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Loss of DBT preserves autophagy under proteasomal inhibition</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether loss of DBT suppressed the MG132-induced cell toxicity by enhancing the proteasomal activity. Using a luminogenic Proteasome-Glo substrate, we measured the chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity of the proteasome in WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells. The DBT KO cells had similar proteasomal activity to that of WT cells under resting states. Notably, the MG132 treatment decreased the proteasomal activity in both WT and DBT KO cells but to the same degree (Supplemental Fig. S2B). Furthermore, the protein levels of proteasomal core subunits, such as PSMD1, PSMD5, and PSMD11, were unchanged between the WT and DBT KO cells before or after the MG132 treatment (Supplemental Fig. S2C-F). These results show that loss of DBT does not promote proteasomal activity but prevents the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins through a proteasome-independent mechanism.</p>
<p>The autophagy-lysosome pathway is an alternative mechanism for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kraft et al. 2010</xref>). Thus, we examined the status of autophagy in the WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells by measuring the levels of LC3II, a lipidated form of LC3 protein that serves as a maker for the autophagosome. In the absence of MG132 treatment, the LC3II levels were similar between WT and DBT KO cells. Treatment with the lysosome inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 blocks the degradation of LC3II, and the Bafilomycin A1-induced increase in LC3II was comparable between WT and DBT KO cells, indicating that the DBT KO cells had normal autophagy flux levels similar to those of WT cells under the resting condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Loos et al. 2014</xref>). Upon the treatment with 2 μM of MG132 for 48 hr, there was a significant increase in LC3II levels in WT cells; however, the Bafilomycin A1-induced inhibition of lysosomal degradation did not further increase the LC3II levels in the WT cells, indicating that the autophagy flux was severely impaired, thereby leading to the accumulation of LC3II in these cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). By contrast, the DBT KO cells exhibited lower levels of LC3II than the WT cells upon the MG132 treatment, and unlike the WT cells, these DBT KO cells showed further increase in LC3II levels after the Bafilomycin A1-induced inhibition of lysosomal degradation, indicating that the DBT KO cells had a functioning autophagy flux under the MG132-treated condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-C</xref>). Moreover, using another compound, vinblastine, that blocks the fusion between the autophagosome and the lysosome, we observed effects similar to those of Bafilomycin A1 that DBT KO cells showed further increase in the LC3II levels after the inhibition of lysosomal degradation (Supplemental Fig. S5A). Time course analyses of LC3II levels indicated that MG132-induced increases of LC3II could be observed as early as 4 hr after the treatment and that DBT KO cells consistently showed higher LC3II levels than the WT control cells (Supplemental Fig. S5B, S5C). When DBT expression was reintroduced into the DBT KO cells, the level of LC3II was decreased (Supplemental Fig. S5D). These results suggest that loss of DBT enhances the function of the autophagy-lysosome pathway under the stress induced by proteasomal inhibition.</p>

<p>P62 is the autophagy receptor for ubiquitinated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Katsuragi et al. 2015</xref>). Since p62 is degraded by the autophagy-lysosome pathway, its protein level is typically enhanced when the function of the autophagy-lysosome pathway is impaired. In the absence of MG132 treatment, the p62 levels were comparable between WT and DBT KO cells and were increased to similar levels upon the treatment with the lysosome inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, confirming that the DBT KO cells had normal autophagy functions under the resting condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). However, under the MG132-induced proteotoxic condition, the WT cells showed a heightened level of p62 and there was no further increase in p62 after the Bafilomycin A1-induced inhibition of lysosomal degradation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref>). By contrast, with the MG132 treatment, the DBT KO cells exhibited lower levels of p62 than the WT cells and showed a further increase in p62 after the lysosomal inhibition, confirming that the DBT KO cells had preserved the autophagic functions under the MG132-treated condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>To further test whether the resistance of the DBT KO cells to the MG132-induced cytotoxicity was a result of the preserved autophagic activities, we treated the WT and DBT KO cells with Bafilomycin A1 and analyzed the cell survival. As mentioned above, the loss of DBT protected cells from MG132-induced cell death; however, the inhibition of the autophagy-lysosome pathway with Bafilomycin A1 completely abolished the enhanced cell survival associated with the loss of DBT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>), indicating that the autophagy-lysosome pathway is required for the DBT-dependent regulation of proteotoxicity under proteasomal inhibition.</p>

<title>DBT is a metabolic switch regulating proteotoxicity-dependent activation of AMPK</title>
<p>DBT is a core component of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex, which functions in inner mitochondria to break down the essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), leucine, isoleucine, and valine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brosnan and Brosnan 2006</xref>). The BCKD-mediated reaction is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in the catabolism of BCAAs into acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA, which can be used for energy production by the citric acid cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Holecek 2018</xref>). To understand the mechanism through which DBT regulates MG132-induced cytotoxicity, we examined the metabolic and energetic status of WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells under the proteotoxic stress. First, BCAA levels were analyzed in the WT and DBT KO cells using a colorimetric assay. The DBT KO cells exhibited significantly increased levels of BCAAs, in line with the notion that DBT is essential for BCAA catabolism (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, left). Although MG132 treatment led to a decrease in the BCAA levels in the WT cells, the BCAA levels in the DBT KO cells remained elevated and showed no change upon the MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), confirming that the BCAA catabolism was completely blocked in the absence of DBT. Then we asked whether the accumulation of BCAAs played a role in the resistance of DBT KO cells to MG132 toxicity. When the BCAA levels were increased by 6-8 folds in the culture media of WT RPE1 cells, we did not observe any protection against MG132 toxicity (Supplemental Fig. S3B), indicating that the BCAA accumulation alone was not sufficient to protect the cells from toxicity associated with the proteasomal impairment.</p>

<p>The catabolism of BCAAs consists of two main steps (Supplemental Fig. S3A). The first step is mediated by BCAT, which is that enzyme converting BCAAs and α-ketoglutarate into branched-chain α-keto acids and glutamate. The second step is mediated by the BCKD enzyme complex, with DBT as one of its components. As DBT deficiency was found to protect cells from proteotoxicity, we further asked how deficiency in other components of the BCAA catabolism could affect cell survival under proteotoxic stress. We generated knockout RPE1 cells lacking BCAT or BCKDHA, the latter being a component of the BCKD enzyme complex, disrupting the first and second steps of the BCAA catabolism, respectively. Depletion of BCAT or BCKDHA did not affect cell survival under normal conditions. However, the BCAT or BCKDHA knockout cells exhibited significant resistance to MG132-induced cytotoxicity (Supplemental Fig. S3C), similar to DBT knockout cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that it is not the accumulation of BCAAs but the blockade of the BCAA catabolism that leads to resistance to MG132-induced toxicity.</p>
<p>Since both the proteasome-mediated proteolysis and the BCAA catabolism can influence energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ye et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Szczepanowska and Trifunovic 2021</xref>), we examined the energetic status of WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells. Under normal conditions, the DBT KO cells showed ATP/ADP ratios comparable to those of WT cells. The MG132 treatment slightly decreased the ATP/ADP ratios in the WT cells; however, the MG132-treated DBT KO cells exhibited significantly decreased ATP/ADP ratios compared to the untreated DBT KO cells or the WT cells with or without the MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Given that glucose is the primary source of ATP production in the cell, we sought to analyze the effects of increasing glucose concentrations on the sensitivity of DBT KO cells to MG132-induced toxicity. When WT cells were examined, increasing the glucose concentrations in the media from 17.5 mM to 70 mM or 140 mM did not affect the sensitivity of the WT cells to MG132 toxicity (Supplemental Fig. S3D). In contrast, when the cell survival of DBT KO cells was examined, the increased glucose levels significantly decreased the survival of DBT KO cells under MG132 treatment in a glucose-concentration-dependent manner (Supplemental Fig. S3D), in accordance with the notion that reduction in ATP levels contributed to the resistance of DBT KO cells to MG132 toxicity. Furthermore, glucose starvation rendered WT cells more resistant to MG132-induced toxicity (Supplemental Fig. S4C), consistent with the notion that reduction in ATP levels contributed to the cellular resistance to the toxicity. Together, these results indicate that loss of DBT combined with proteasomal inhibition led to a significant decrease in the ATP/ADP ratios, which correlated with the preservation of autophagic activities and the resistance to cell death induced by the proteasomal inhibition.</p>
<p>AMPK is a highly conserved sensor of cellular energy changes and is activated by increasing levels of AMP or ADP coupled with falling ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mihaylova and Shaw 2011</xref>). To assess the effect of DBT on AMPK signaling, we examined the activation of AMPK, as measured by the phosphorylation of its threonine 172 (T<sup>172</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hardie 2011</xref>), in WT and DBT KO RPE1 cells. The levels of phosphorylated AMPK-T<sup>172</sup> were not significantly changed in the DBT KO cells under the resting condition; however, upon the MG132 treatment, the DBT KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK-T<sup>172</sup> than the WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). The total level of AMPK was not changed by the loss of DBT or the MG132 treatment alone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These data indicated that AMPK was activated in cells under the MG132-induced proteotoxic stress in the absence of DBT.</p>
<p>Next, we tested the role of AMPK in the resistance of DBT KO cells to MG132-induced toxicity. We knocked down AMPK by using specific shRNAs and examined the cell survival in the DBT KO cells with the MG132 treatment. The AMPK knockdown abolished the resistance of the DBT KO cells to the MG132-induced cytotoxicity. Under the MG132-treated conditions, the AMPK knockdown did not affect the survival of WT RPE1 cells; however, it significantly decreased the survival of DBT KO cells to a level comparable to that of WT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). To confirm the role of the AMPK signaling in the cell survival phenotype of DBT KO cells, we applied an AMPK inhibitor, Compound C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhou et al. 2001</xref>), and found that it also abolished the protective effects of loss of DBT and rendered the DBT KO cells sensitive to the MG132 treatment (Supplemental Fig. S4A and B). Conversely, using an AMPK agonist EX229, also known as compound 991 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Xiao et al. 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lai et al. 2014</xref>), we found that the AMPK agonist promoted the resistance to MG132-induced toxicity in both WT and DBT KO cells (Supplemental Fig. S4D). These results indicate that AMPK is a key player in the resistance of DBT KO cells against MG132-induced toxicity.</p>

<title>Loss of DBT activates autophagy under proteotoxic stress via AMPK effectors</title>
<p>Since AMPK is a principal regulator of autophagy, we tested the role of AMPK in the autophagy activation in the DBT KO cells under MG132-induced proteotoxic stress. The knockdown of AMPK via shRNAs significantly reduced the LC3 protein levels, and quantification of LC3II levels before and after Bafilomycin A1-medicated inhibition of lysosomal degradation indicated that the autophagy flux was significantly reduced by the downregulation of AMPK (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>), consistent with the increased vulnerability of the DBT KO cells to the MG132-induced proteotoxic stress (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>The activation of AMPK promotes autophagy through several downstream effectors, including serine/threonine-protein kinase ULK1 and mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mihaylova and Shaw 2011</xref>). ULK1 is an important regulator of autophagosome biogenesis and can be activated by AMPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kim et al. 2011</xref>). In the absence of MG132 treatment, there was no difference in the levels of total ULK1 protein or its activity, as measured by the phosphorylation at its serine 371 (S<sup>371</sup>) site (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Upon the treatment with 2 μM of MG132 for 48 hr, there was little change in the ULK1 activity in WT RPE1 cells; however, the DBT KO cells exhibited a significant increase in the phosphorylation of ULK1-S<sup>371</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that loss of DBT specifically induced the activation of ULK1 under the MG132 treatment, concomitant with the AMPK activation under this condition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Conversely, the elevated expression of DBT significantly decreased the levels of phosphorylated ULK1 and phosphorylated AMPK in both WT and DBT KO cells (Supplemental Fig. S5E). These results indicate that the loss of DBT specifically induces the activation of the AMPK-ULK1 signaling under MG132 treatment.</p>
<p>Activated AMPK also inhibits the mTOR signaling, which negatively regulates autophagy. AMPK is reported to regulate the mTOR signaling by phosphorylating TSC2 on serine 1387 (S<sup>1387</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mihaylova and Shaw 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of TSC2-S<sup>1387</sup> enhances the activity of TSC2 as a Rheb GAP, leading to the inhibition of mTOR. We found that the changes in the phosphorylation of TSC2-S<sup>1387</sup> were in accordance with that of AMPK-T<sup>172</sup> in the WT and DBT KO cells under the MG132-induced proteotoxic stress. There was little difference in the phosphorylation levels of TSC2 between the WT and DBT KO cells in the absence of MG132 treatment; however, under the treatment of 2 μM of MG132 for 48 hr, the DBT KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of phosphorylated TSC2-S<sup>1387</sup>, while the WT cells did not show any change in the phosphorylation levels of TSC2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results suggest that the AMPK-TSC2-mTOR signaling is another mechanism through which loss of DBT leads to autophagic activation under proteasomal impairment.</p>
<p>Next, we modulated the activity of the mTOR signaling in the DBT KO cells to test its roles in the observed phenotypes of autophagic activation and resistance of MG132-induced cell toxicity. Since inhibition of mTOR signaling is associated with autophagic activation, as observed in the DBT KO cells, we targeted TSC1, a negative regulator of mTOR, via shRNAs to increase the mTOR signaling in the DBT KO cells. The increase in the mTOR activity as a result of TSC1 knockdown, as confirmed by the upregulated S6K phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), led to a significant reduction in LC3II protein levels as well as in the autophagy flux measured by the LC3II ratios before and after Bafilomycin treatment, confirming that the autophagic activation in the DBT KO cells was dependent on the inhibition of mTOR signaling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Furthermore, in accordance with the changes in autophagic activities, the knockdown of TSC1 abolished the enhanced survival phenotype of the DBT KO cells under the MG132 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). To confirm the role of the mTOR signaling in the cell survival phenotype of DBT KO cells, we applied an mTOR agonist, MHY1485 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Choi et al. 2012</xref>), and found that it also abolished the protective effects of loss of DBT and rendered the DBT KO cells sensitive to the MG132 treatment (Supplemental Fig. S4E and F). Conversely, treatment with an mTOR inhibitor, RAD001 or AZD8055 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beuvink et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Willems et al. 2012</xref>), increased the resistance of WT cells to MG132-induced toxicity (Supplemental Fig. S4G). These results demonstrate that the mTOR signaling plays a key role in the resistance of DBT KO cells to the proteasomal inhibition-induced toxicity.</p>

<title>Loss of DBT suppresses the toxicity of mutant TDP-43 by promoting its clearance</title>
<p>Neurodegeneration-associated protein misfolding and aggregation often lead to impairment of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Ciechanover and Brundin 2003</xref>). ALS-linked mutant TDP-43 proteins, including the M337V variant, are prone to misfolding and aggregation, providing a disease-related molecular model for studying proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Johnson et al. 2009</xref>).

However, the DBT KO cells exhibited significantly higher levels of cell survival than the WT cells when expressing TDP-43<sup>M337</sup>, indicating strong protection by the loss of DBT.

<p>Importantly, knockdown of DBT by specific shRNAs significantly rescued the neuronal loss with the TDP-43<sup>M337</sup> expression, as compared to the non-targeting control shRNAs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). These results demonstrate that loss of DBT resulted in robust protection against TDP-43-associated proteotoxicity.</p>
<p>Next, we asked whether the resistance of DBT KO cells to TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>-induced proteotoxicity was associated with any change in the turnover of the mutant protein. In immunoblotting analysis, TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> transiently expressed in the DBT KO RPE1 cells showed substantially lower protein levels than that expressed in the WT cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). To determine whether the decrease in the steady-state levels of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> protein was a consequence of increased protein degradation, we performed the cycloheximide chase assay to measure the turnover rate of the TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> protein. As analyzed by immunoblotting of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> over a period of time after cycloheximide-induced inhibition of protein synthesis, the degradation of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> took place at a much faster rate in the DBT KO cells than in the WT cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). The half-life of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> was estimated to be over 24 hr in the WT cells but only ∼4.5 h in the DBT KO cells. Furthermore, consistent with the faster turnover rate of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>, the DBT KO cells exhibited a higher degree of autophagy flux than the WT cells, as measured by LC3II levels before and after the Bafilomycin treatment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). Additionally, the elevated expression of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> selectively increased the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the DBT KO cells but not in the WT cells (Supplemental Fig. S7A). These data indicate that loss of DBT promoted the clearance of TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> and reduced its proteotoxicity through enhanced AMPK signaling and autophagic functions.</p>
<p>To study the TDP-43-associated proteotoxicity in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system, we employed a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, which expresses the ALS-associated human mutant TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> under the GMR-GAL4 driver and develops a rough-eye phenotype as a result of the loss of photoreceptors and retinal degeneration in adult eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ritson et al. 2010</xref>). By crossing with a transgenic strain with stable RNAi-induced reduction of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of human DBT, CG5599 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">St Pierre et al. 2014</xref>), we found that the knockdown of the DBT homolog produced a significant rescue of the TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup>-induced rough eye phenotype, resulting in a smoother eye appearance and increased pigmentation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). To confirm the observation, we generated a DBT KO <italic>Drosophila</italic> strain by mating Cas9 flies with DBT sgRNA flies and obtained a homozygous mutant with a 1-bp deletion in exon 2 of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> DBT gene, which yielded a null allele with a premature stop codon in exon 2 (Supplemental Fig. S1E). When we crossed the DBT KO flies with TDP-43<sup>M337V</sup> transgenic flies, a similar protection against the rough eye phenotype was observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>), indicating that loss of DBT protects against TDP-43-associated neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>To extend the analysis of DBT-dependent proteotoxicity from TDP-43 to another disease-associated protein, we focused on the polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat, which is a misfoleded protein domain associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ross and Poirier 2004</xref>). In cell survival assays, we found that WT RPE1 cells expressing polyQ showed significantly lower cell viability than DBT KO cells, indicating that loss of DBT protects against polyQ-induced proteotoxicity (Supplemental Fig. S6A and B). In immunoblotting analysis, we found that polyQ transiently expressed in the DBT KO cells exhibited substantially lower protein levels than those in WT cells (Supplemental Fig. S6C and D), suggesting that the resistance of the DBT KO cells to polyQ-induced proteotoxicity was associated with enhanced turnover of the polyQ protein. Additionally, we utilized a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model to confirm the protective effects of loss of DBT polyQ-induced toxicity in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system. Based on the analysis of the rough eye phenotype in the polyQ transgenic fly model, we observed significant protection against eye degeneration in both DBT RNAi and KO flies (Supplemental Fig. S6E and F). Together, these results demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved regulatory effects of DBT on proteotoxicity are likely broad-spectrum.</p>

<title>DBT is dysregulated in ALS patients</title>
<p>To understand whether the DBT-dependent regulation of proteotoxicity is relevant to human patients, we analyzed the spinal cord tissues from a cohort of ALS patients, most of whom have been observed to harbor TDP-43 proteinopathy in their postmortem exams of central nervous systems (Supplemental Table S1). First, we carried out the immunoblotting analysis of spinal cord tissue extracts from 24 ALS patients and 8 non-neurological controls. Although the immunoblot signals showed variability among the individuals, we found that DBT protein levels were significantly elevated in the majority of ALS cases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref> and Supplemental Fig. S7B). Next, we performed immunofluorescence staining to analyze the quantity and distribution of DBT proteins in the human spinal cord tissue sections. In the control cases, DBT could be seen clearly expressed in motor neurons, which are characterized by their large soma and unique nuclear morphologies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Compared with the controls, the DBT immunofluorescence signals showed much higher intensity and broader distribution across the spinal cord sections, suggesting elevated levels of DBT in neuronal soma and neurites (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Indeed, stronger signals of DBT immunofluorescence could be detected in large neuronal cell bodies in the ALS cases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). These observations suggest that the DBT-mediated regulation of protein quality control is compromised in the disease-relevant tissues of ALS patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study uncovers a major regulator of protein quality control through an unbiased genetic screen and demonstrates the signaling pathway through which DBT regulates autophagic activation under stress induced by proteasomal inhibition (Supplemental Fig. S8). The observations of DBT’s robust regulatory effects on the proteotoxicity in models of neurodegenerative diseases and the upregulation of DBT in ALS patient tissues suggest that DBT is an important player in the pathogenesis of the disease. The findings could contribute to our better understanding of the regulation of protein quality control systems under stress or disease conditions.</p>
<p>DBT is a core component of the BCKD enzyme complex, which functions to break down BCAAs and provide acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA that can be used for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Brosnan and Brosnan 2006</xref>). Recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggested that BCAA metabolism plays complicated roles in the regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with deficiency in components of the BCKD complex negatively impacting the ubiquitin-proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Ravanelli et al. 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, we found in the present study that mammalian cells deficient in DBT exhibited a remarkable degree of resistance to cell death from proteotoxicity induced by the proteasomal inhibition. In accordance with the enhanced cellular survival under the proteotoxic stress induced by proteasomal inhibition in cells lacking DBT, the DBT-deficient cells exhibited a remarkable capacity to prevent the accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins as a result of the proteasomal inhibition. The efficient clearance of the poly-ubiquitinated proteins despite the proteasomal inhibition was attributable to the preservation of autophagic activities in the DBT-deficient cells, unlike the WT cells where the autophagic activities were diminished due to the overloaded burden of proteotoxicity as a consequence of the proteasomal inhibition.</p>
<p>Conventionally, elevated levels of BCAAs are associated with inhibition of autophagy due to their ability to activate mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhenyukh et al. 2017</xref>), the nutrient sensor that negatively regulates autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dunlop and Tee 2014</xref>). While the expected increase in BCAAs was observed following the loss of DBT, our findings indicate that additional factors beyond BCAAs play a role in the regulation of autophagy, since DBT-deficient cells exhibited improved preservation of autophagic activities under the conditions of proteasomal inhibition compared to WT cells. Consistent with the preservation of autophagic activities, the DBT-deficient cells showed significant activation of AMPK signaling under the conditions of proteasomal inhibition. The activation of AMPK only under the combined conditions of proteasomal inhibition and DBT deficiency but not under each of the conditions alone is driven by the depletion of intracellular ATP under the combined conditions. The ATP-producing OXPHOS complexes are sensitive to the regulation of protein quality control, as its many components are regulated by proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Szczepanowska and Trifunovic 2021</xref>), consistent with our observation of lower ATP levels upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor. We also found that the DBT deficiency decreased the intracellular ATP levels under the condition of proteasomal inhibition, suggesting that DBT-dependent BCAA catabolism is a critical source of energy production under the condition of proteasomal inhibition. Furthermore, the net outcome of better preservation of autophagic activities, upon inhibition of both proteasomal degradation and BCAA catabolism, underlies the important roles of the energy metabolism and the cognate AMPK signaling, which regulates autophagy regulators including mTOR and ULK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alers et al. 2012</xref>), as the driving force for the autophagic activation under these conditions. Although cells have complicated networks that regulate metabolism and proteostasis, the present study has revealed the pivotal role of DBT as a master switch for protein quality control and cell survival under proteotoxic stress such as that induced by the proteasomal inhibition.</p>
<p>The newly recognized function of DBT in regulating proteotoxicity is further demonstrated through the protective effects of DBT deficiency in cellular and <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of TDP-43 proteotoxicity. Together with the observations that DBT exhibits aberrant accumulation in ALS patients’ spinal cord tissues, these results suggest that DBT may modulate proteotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases. Both DBT and BCAAs play important roles in metabolism important for physiology and diseases. Defective BCAA catabolism is associated with metabolic disorders, such as maple syrup urine disease, insulin resistance, and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoon 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Holecek 2018</xref>). Abnormal regulation of the levels and metabolism of BCAAs has been implicated in a variety of other human pathological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, and liver diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dimou et al. 2022</xref>). The role of DBT as a critical regulator of protein quality control through metabolic and energetic controls under proteotoxic stress, as revealed in the present study, opens a new avenue for understanding the complex regulation of protein homeostasis in human health and pathologies.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Through an unbiased genomewide KO screen, the authors identified loss of DBT to suppress MG132-mediated death of cultured RPE cells. Further analyses suggested that DBT reduces ubiquitinated proteins by promoting autophagy. Mechanistic studies indicated that DBT loss promotes autophagy via AMPK and its downstream ULK and mTOR signaling. Furthermore, loss of DBT suppresses polyglutamine- or TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and/or neurodegeneration in fly models. Finally, the authors showed that DBT proteins are increased in ALS patient tissues, compared to non-neurological controls.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The idea is novel, the evidence is convincing, and the data are clean. The findings have implications for human diseases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hwang, Ran-Der et al utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE1) cells to evaluate for suppressors of toxicity by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and identified that knockout of dihydrolipoamide branched chain transacylase E2 (DBT) suppressed cell death. They show that DBT knockout in RPE1 cells does not alter proteasome or autophagy function at baseline. However, with MG132 treatment, they show a reduction in ubiquitinated proteins but with no change in proteasome function. Instead, they show that DBT knockout cells treated with MG132 have improved autophagy flux compared to wildtype cells treated with MG132. They show that MG132 treatment decreases ATP/ADP ratios to a greater extent in DBT knockout cells, and in accordance causes activation of AMPK. They then show downstream altered autophagy signaling in DBT knockout cells treated with MG132 compared to wild-type cells treated with MG132. Then they express the ALS mutant TDP43 M337 or expanded polyglutamine repeats to model Huntington's disease and show that knockdown of DBT improves cell survival in RPE1 cells with improved autophagic flux. They also utilize a Drosophila models and show that utilizing either a RNAi or CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of DBT improves eye pigment in TDP43M337V and polyglutamine repeat-expressing transgenic flies. Finally, they show evidence for increased DBT in postmortem spinal cord tissue from patients with ALS via both immunoblotting and immunofluorescence.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a mechanistic and well-designed paper that identifies DBT as a novel regulator of proteotoxicity via activating autophagy in the setting of proteasome inhibition. Major strengths include careful delineation of a mechanistic pathway to define how DBT is protective. These conclusions are well-justified.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>More experiments are needed to establish the connections between DBT and autophagy. The mechanistic studies are somewhat biased, and it's unclear whether the same mechanism (i.e., AMPK--&gt;mTOR) can be applied to TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration. Also, some data interpretation has to be more accurate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We thank the reviewer for raising these questions, and we have provided additional evidence in the revised manuscript to support the model that DBTKO can enhance autophagy and induce resistance to TDP-43-associated toxicity. This is described in greater detail below.</p>
<p>(1) To provide further evidence for the connection between DBT and autophagy, we have introduced additional controls. For the additional controls, we have included the AMPK shRNA and drug treatment controls (Fig.4D, Fig.S4B), and these results suggest that reducing the AMPK level renders DBTKO cells sensitive to MG132 toxicity. We also added the TSC1 shRNA and mTOR agonist treatment controls (Fig.5E, Fig.S4G), and the results show that increasing mTOR levels also make the DBTKO cells sensitive to MG132.</p>
<p>(2) To further confirm the roles of AMPK and mTOR in DBTKO cells, we introduced the AMPK agonist (EX229) and mTOR inhibitors (RAD001 and AZD8055) in co-treatment experiments with MG132 and then measured cell survival (Fig.S4D, S4G). The results indicate that promoting AMPK activation or inhibiting mTOR can enhance cell resistance to MG132-induced toxicity.</p>
<p>(3) Additionally, we included the overexpression and rescue experiments for DBT and analyzed the AMPK-ULK1 signaling in WT RPE1 and DBTKO cells (Fig.S5D, S5E). The results indicate that the increase of DBT can significantly reduce the phosphorylation of AMPK/ULK1 and the levels of the autophagy marker LC3II. Together, these results suggest that DBT plays an important role in autophagy.</p>
<p>(4) We had shown in the original version of the manuscript that DBTKO renders cells more resistant to TDP-43-associated toxicity, similar to the tolerance of MG132-induced toxicity. Here we further show that expression of TDP-43M337V enhances the phosphorylation of AMPK in the DBTKO cells (Fig. S7A), similar to the effect of the MG132 treatment. These results suggest that the resistance of DBTKO cells to MG132 or TDP-43-assoicated toxicity shares a similar mechanism of activated the AMPK signaling.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The large majority of the experiments are evaluating suppression of drug (MG132) toxicity in an in vitro epithelial cell line, so the generalizability to disease is unclear. Indeed, MG132 itself has been shown to modulate autophagy, and off-target effects of MG132 are not addressed. While this paper is strengthened by the inclusion of mouse-induced motor neurons, Drosophila models, and postmortem tissue, the putative mechanisms are minimally evaluated in these models.</p>
<p>Also, this effect is only seen with MG132 treatment, at a dose that causes markedly impaired cell survival. In this setting, it is certainly plausible that changes in autophagy could be the result of differences in cell survival, as opposed to an underlying mechanism for cell survival.
Additional controls would be useful to increase confidence that DBT knockdown is protective via modulation of autophagy.</p>
<p>While the authors report increased DBT in postmortem ALS tissue as suggestive that DBT may modulate proteotoxicity in neurodegeneration, this point would be better supported with the evaluation of overexpression of DBT in their model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reply: We appreciate the reviewer for raising these questions, and we have provided further evidence in the revised manuscript to support the proposed mechanism that DBTKO confers resistance to MG132-induced toxicity through activation of autophagy. This is discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p>(1) To provide further mechanistic analysis, we have included additional controls  for the analysis of AMPK signaling in Fig. 4D and Fig. S4B. These results demonstrate that using drugs or shRNAs to reduce AMPK activity can decrease DBTKO survival. We have also shown that that an increasing the AMPK activity with an activator enhances the survival of both WT and DBTKO cells under MG132 treatment (Fig. S4D), suggesting that DBTKO cells resist MG132-induced toxicity through the activation of AMPK signaling.</p>
<p>(2) We have included additional controls for the analysis of mTOR signaling in Fig. 5E and Fig. S4F. The results in Fig. 5E show that reducing TSC1 using shRNAs can decrease DBTKO survival. We also added the experiments with mTOR agonist MHY1485 as a control in Fig. S4F. These results indicate that mTOR activation can promote DBTKO cells' sensitivity to MG132 toxicity. To further confirm the importance of mTOR in DBTKO-mediated resistance to MG132 toxicity, we included the mTOR inhibitors RAD001 and AZD8055 in the co-treatment experiments with MG132, and then measured cell survival (Fig. S4G). The results show that both mTOR inhibitors can enhance cell resistance to MG132-induced toxicity (Fig. S4G). These findings suggest that mTOR inhibition is required for DBTKO-mediated cell survival under MG132 treatment.</p>
<p>(3) To further test the hypothesis that DBT knockdown is protective via modulation of autophagy, we have introduced the overexpression of DBT and the rescue of DBT in DBTKO cells to analyze the AMPK signaling that regulates autophagy (Fig. S5E). The results demonstrate that overexpression of DBT significantly reduced the phosphorylation of AMPK and ULK1 (Fig. S5E). In the rescue experiment, the results mirror those of the overexpression experiment, showing a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of AMPK and ULK1 (Fig. S5E). We also analyzed the autophagy marker LC3II in both the overexpression and rescue experiments, and the results indicate that increasing the DBT level specifically reduces the LC3II level (Fig. S5D). These results support the model that loss of DBT promotes the activation of autophagy.</p>
<p>(4) To test the hypothesis that DBT may modulate proteotoxicity in neurodegeneration, we included the studies with TDP-43M337V and found that the expression of the mutant TDP43 enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK in the DBTKO cells (Fig. S7A), consistent with the observations made with MG-132 treatment. Together with other findings in the manuscript, these results indicate that DBTKO can sensitize the activation of the AMPK signaling and confer the resistance to TDP-43-associated toxicity.</p>
