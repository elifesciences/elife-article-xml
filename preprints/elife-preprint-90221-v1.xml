<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Receptor mediated signaling is fundamental to cell-cell communication, regulation of cellular growth/differentiation, maintenance of tissue function/homeostasis, and regulation of injury repair. When a cell specific response is necessary, nature achieves that selectivity through various mechanisms such as cell specific receptor, ligand gradient, short range ligand, and direct cell-cell contacts. However, most ligand receptor systems have pleiotropic effects due to broad expressions of receptors on multiple cell types. While this may be important when a coordinated response in multiple cell types or tissues is needed, achieving cell specific signaling has been a major challenge for both research and therapeutic development to avoid systemic toxicity or off-target effects. In addition, it is often difficult to identify differences between normal and diseased cells for a particular signaling pathway of interest, making it challenging, if not impossible, to selectively modulate that signaling pathway either in diseased or normal cells specifically. Therefore, effective cell targeting is needed for both research and therapeutic development.</p>
<p>Comparing to cell targeted antagonists, cell targeted agonists are even more complex to design. In addition to cell targeting, agonists also have stringent requirements on affinity, epitope, and geometry of the molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dickopf et al., 2020</xref>). Previous efforts to engineer cell selective growth factors and cytokines have employed various approaches such as the “chimeric activators” concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cironi et al., 2008</xref>), where a cell targeting arm (“targeting element”) is attached to either the wild-type ligand or a mutated ligand with reduced affinity toward signaling receptor (“activity element”). Such an approach has been applied to several signaling pathways, such as erythropoietin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Taylor et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Burrill et al., 2016</xref>), interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cironi et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Garcin et al., 2014</xref>), and interleukin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Ghasemi et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Lazear et al., 2017</xref>). While little selectivity could be achieved with attaching a targeting arm to a wild-type ligand, selectivity of up to 1000-fold has been reported when a mutated ligand was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Garcin et al., 2014</xref>). The “chimeric activators” approach is based on the cooperativity concept, where mutations that weaken the affinity of a natural ligand to its receptor are selected as the “activity element”. Due to the weakened affinity, the mutant “activity element” alone displays a significantly right shifted dose response curve (or lower potency) in an activity assay, on both target and non-target cells that express the signaling receptors. When the “targeting element” is tethered to the mutant “activity element”, the “targeting element” helps to increase the local concentration of the mutant “activity element” on the desired target cell surface, driving engagement of signaling receptor and subsequent intracellular signaling activation, left shifting the activity dose response curve (increase potency) on the target cell and creating a separation between target vs non-target cells. While conceptually elegant, identifying the appropriate mutations that achieve the precise reduction of affinity that could be rescued by the “targeting element” is not trivial. In some cases, while the potency could be rescued, the maximal signaling strength remains compromised, resulting in a partial agonist. In addition, the selectivity is not exquisite, with most literature examples reporting a modest 10-fold separation between targeting vs non-targeting cells. Additional strategies have also been reported that show promising results, for example, inactive pro-drug requiring tumor-associated proteases to activate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Puskas et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Skrombolas et al., 2019</xref>), complementation of two inactive components via targeted assembly in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banaszek et al., 2019</xref>), and passive enrichment on the target cell leading to colocalization of monomeric subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Mock et al., 2020</xref>) or inactive “split” components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Quijano-Rubio et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we present a novel concept to achieve cell targeting for ligand/receptor systems that involves multicomponent receptor complexes, where a productive signaling competent receptor complex formation is directly assembled through a “bridging element”. We have tested this concept using the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway as a model system.</p>
<p>The WNT pathway is highly conserved across species and crucial for embryonic development, and adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>). WNT induced signaling through β-catenin stabilization has been widely studied and is achieved by ligand binding to frizzled (FZD) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) family of receptors. There are nineteen mammalian WNTs, 10 FZDs (FZD<sub>1-10</sub>), and 2 LRPs (LRP5 and LRP6). WNTs are highly hydrophobic due to lipidation that is required for function and are promiscuous, capable of binding and activating multiple FZD and LRP pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Janda et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kadowaki et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dijksterhuis et al., 2015</xref>). Elucidating the functions of individual FZDs in tissues has been hampered by difficulties in producing the ligands and lack of receptor and tissue selectivity. Recent breakthroughs in the development of WNT-mimetic molecules have largely resolved the production and receptor specificity challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Janda et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tao et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Miao et al., 2020</xref>). While tissue selectivity could be partly achieved by tissue injury as damaged tissues seem more sensitive to WNTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Xie et al., 2022</xref>), it still represents a significant technical and therapeutic development advancement to be able to target WNTs to specific cells and tissues.</p>
<p>The WNT mimetics reported so far are all bispecific and can simultaneously bind to FZDs and LRPs, and the optimal stoichiometry (at least for the antibody-based molecules) are tetravalent bispecific (2:2 format), requiring two FZD binders and two LRP binders in the same molecule to achieve efficient signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tao et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). We took advantage of the fact that two FZD binders alone and two LRP binders alone do not signal. Cell specificity could be achieved by attaching a “targeting element” (capable of binding to another cell surface receptor, called a bridging receptor here) to these two inactive molecules, and signaling competent receptor complexes consisting of two FZDs and two LRPs could then be assembled via the bridging receptor on the target cell surface. This approach reduces or eliminates the need to mutate and reduce the affinity of the “active elements” toward signaling receptors, and creates a highly cell specific activation of the signaling pathway as the individual components are inactive. The detailed proof of concept studies based on the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway are presented herein. We have called the cell targeted WNT mimetics SWIFT (<bold><underline>S</underline></bold>plitting of <bold><underline>W</underline></bold>NT to <bold><underline>I</underline></bold>nduce <bold><underline>F</underline></bold>unctional <bold><underline>T</underline></bold>argeting).</p>

<title>Conceptual design of cell targeted activators via a bridging receptor</title>
<p><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> shows one optimized design for a WNT mimetic that is a tetravalent bispecific antibody-based molecule. It is important to highlight that efficient WNT/β-catenin signaling requires two FZD binding domains and two LRP binding domains in one molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> shows a cell targeting approach using the bridging receptor concept, the SWIFT approach. The first step of this concept is to split the active molecule into inactive components. In the case of the tetravalent bispecific WNT mimetic, the active molecule is split into one molecule having two FZD binding arms and a second molecule having two LRP binding arms. These two inactive components are then each tethered to a different “bridging element” binding to a different epitope on the same bridging receptor (BR, the tethered molecules named αLRP-αBR-1 and αFZD-αBR-2 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, top two panels). αLRP-αBR-1 and αFZD-αBR-2 are each inactive on non-targeting cells where the bridging receptor (BR) is not expressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> top panels). On targeting cells where the BR is expressed, FZD and LRP are then assembled or brought into proximity with one another by αLRP-αBR-1 and αFZD-αBR-2 via BR recreating the signaling competent receptor complexes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> bottom panel).</p>

<title>Proof of concept with the targeted WNT mimetic molecules</title>
<p>To test the concept shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, we selected βKlotho and endocrine fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) ligand system as the bridging receptor system. FGF21 is an endocrine hormone produced by the liver that regulates metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">BonDurant and Potthoff, 2018</xref>). FGF21 signals through FGFR1c, FGFR2c, and FGFR3c in the presence of co-receptor βKlotho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Zhang and Li, 2015</xref>). The binding of FGF21 to the receptor complex is primarily driven by its affinity toward βKlotho via its C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lee et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Shi et al., 2018</xref>), while its N-terminal domain is important for FGFR interaction and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Yie et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Micanovic et al., 2009</xref>). βKlotho binding antibodies have also been identified that could induce βKlotho/FGFR signaling and one particular agonistic βKlotho antibody binds to a different epitope on βKlotho from FGF21 and does not compete with FGF21 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Min et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the following bridging receptor (βKlotho) binding elements were selected to test the cell targeting SWIFT concept:</p>
<p>FGF21FL (full length FGF21) that can bind to βKlotho and competent to induce FGFR signaling;</p>
<p>FGF21ΔC (FGF21 without the C-terminal βKlotho interaction domain) that does not bind βKlotho nor capable of inducing FGFR signaling;</p>
<p>FGF21ΔN (FGF21 without the N-terminal FGFR interaction domain) that binds βKlotho but does not signal;</p>
<p>FGF21ΔNΔC that cannot bind βKlotho and cannot signal; 39F7 IgG that binds βKlotho and can induce FGFR signaling.</p>
<p>The FZD and LRP binding domains selected are F (binds FZD<sub>1,2,5,7,8</sub>) and L (binds LRP6) previously named as F1 and L2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). The graphic representations of the binders and the various combinations are shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A-C</xref>.</p>

<p>To test the concept in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, the FZD binder (F) was combined with two versions of bridging receptor (βKlotho) binder, F-FGF21FL and F-FGF21ΔN (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), and the LRP binder (L) was combined with the other bridging receptor (βKlotho) binder 39F7 as L-39F7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>We first confirmed the binding of the various fusion molecules shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> to their respective target proteins. All F and L containing molecules bound to either FZD<sub>7</sub> or LRP6 E3E4 fragments as expected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D-J</xref>). FGF21FL, FGF21ΔN, and 39F7 bound to βKlotho, while FGF21 without its C-terminal domain (FGF21ΔC and FGF21ΔNΔC) lost bindings to βKlotho (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D-J</xref>). Therefore, the molecule formats of the various fusion proteins had no significant impact on the individual binding element’s binding to their target receptors. Next, we performed the Octet binding assays to assess whether the F-FGF21 or L-39F7 allow simultaneous bindings to their target receptors. Sequential additions of the various F-FGF21 fusion molecules to the sensor surface, followed by FZD<sub>7</sub> CRD, and then βKlotho show that a stepwise increase in binding signal was observed with FZD<sub>7</sub> CRD, but only F-FGF21FL and F-FGF21ΔN showed additional binding to βKlotho but not from F-FGF21ΔC or F-FGF21ΔNΔC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). This suggests that both F-FGF21FL or F-FGF21ΔN are capable of simultaneous bindings to both FZD<sub>7</sub> and βKlotho receptors. Sequential additions of the various L, 39F7, and αGFP combinations to the sensor surface, followed by LRP6E3E4, and then βKlotho show that a stepwise increase in binding signal with L-39F7 but not the other negative control molecules, αGFP-39F7 or L-αGFP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>). This suggests that L-39F7 can simultaneously bind to both LRP6 and βKlotho receptors.</p>
<p>The ability of this set of molecules to activate WNT/β-catenin signaling was assessed in WNT-responsive Huh7 and HEK293 Super TOP-FLASH (STF) reporter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, the combination of F-FGF21FL or F-FGF21ΔN with L-39F7 resulted in WNT/β-catenin signaling in the liver cell line, Huh7 cells which expresses the bridging receptor βKlotho (<italic>KLB</italic>), but not in 293 cells where βKlotho is not expressed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3G</xref>). This signaling depends on the presence of both FZD and LRP binding arms and the ability to bind the bridging receptor, as the removal of LRP binding arm L from L-39F7 or inactivation of βKlotho binding arms (use of FGF21ΔC or FGF21ΔNΔC, or the replacement of 39F7 with αGFP) resulted in no activity in either cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A-F</xref>). This provided experimental evidence supporting the SWIFT concept presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>.</p>

<title>Validation of liver specific targeting with primary human cells</title>
<p>To test the potency of these molecules in cells directly derived from the tissue of interest we selected primary human hepatocytes and human small intestinal organoids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). These cultures better represent the physiological and transcriptional characteristics of the liver and intestine compared to cell lines. As expected, primary human hepatocytes express bridging receptor βKlotho, while human small intestinal cells do not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A major deficiency in therapeutic development today is effective approaches to target drugs toward a desired cell type. Due to the pleiotropic expression and actions of most drug targets in many cell types/organs or lack of differentiation between diseased vs normal cells, many drugs exhibit either dose limiting toxicity or act on multiple cell types of opposing activity that render drugs less effective. Therefore, developing effective cell targeting methods would allow reduced systemic toxicity and higher efficacy for more effective treatments.</p>
<p>Here we describe a novel cell targeting approach we termed BRAID where an active drug molecule is divided into inactive parts that are assembled via a bridging receptor specific to the target cell. Although complementation and splitting a molecule into inactive parts have been explored previously, the novelty of our approach is that there is no requirement for the two split inactive components to interact with one another and therefore, does not require cooperative interactions between the split components and receptors for activity. The assembly of the signaling complex by our approach is achieved by simultaneous binding of the two divided inactive components through a common bridging receptor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested this concept on WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway as a model system. This signaling system requires two receptors, FZD and LRP. We, and others, have generated antibody based WNT mimetic molecules by linking FZD binders and LRP binders into a single molecule to activate the FZD/LRP receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Janda et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Tao et al., 2019</xref>). To explore the BRAID concept with the WNT signaling receptors, we first divided the tetravalent bispecific WNT mimetic into two components: one contains two FZD binding domains and the other contains two LRP binding domains. To each of these two inactive components, a binding moiety to the bridging receptor, βKlotho (predominantly expressed in hepatocytes), was attached. The two bridging receptor binding moieties are FGF21 and 39F7 which bind to non-overlapping regions on βKlotho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Min et al., 2018</xref>). As demonstrated both on WNT responsive reporter cell lines as well as on primary human hepatocytes and human intestinal organoids, target cell specific WNT signaling was indeed observed when the two inactive components were combined. The signaling only occurred on the target cell hepatocytes, but not on HEK293 nor intestinal cells. Furthermore, activity depends on the presence of βKlotho binding domains on the two inactive components, as removal of βKlotho binding on either the FZD or the LRP half of the molecule or having βKlotho but not LRP binding, resulted in inactive combinations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results provided compelling evidence for this novel cell targeting concept. We envision that other potential ways of dividing the WNT or the WNT mimetic molecules, including different geometry, or stoichiometry of FZD/LRP ratios, linker length, or having one each of FZD and LRP binding arms as one component may also result in active targeted WNT mimetics. We have termed this cell targeted WNT system, SWIFT. As WNT plays important roles in many tissues during development and in adult tissue homeostasis and injury repair, and dysregulated WNT signaling may result in various human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nusse and Clevers, 2017</xref>), SWIFT offers the opportunity to more specifically target WNT activation in desired cell types that can help both research and therapeutic development.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we describe here a novel cell targeting approach that can be broadly applied to various signaling systems. This approach also allows the combination of different signaling pathways together resulting in additive or synergistic effects.</p>

<p>All constructs were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian expression vector (Thermo Fisher). The L-scFv binder was constructed by fusing the heavy-chain variable region (VH) to the N-terminus of the light-chain variable (VL) region with a 15-mer linker (GSAASGSSGGSSSGA); The anti-GFP scFv binder was constructed by fusing the VH to the N-terminus of the VL with a 15-mer linker (GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS). All human IgG1 constructs contain the L234A/L235A/P329G mutations (LALAPG) in Fc domain to eliminate effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Lo et al., 2017</xref>). For generating the constructs of scFv-39F7 IgG1, the scFv binder was fused to the N-terminus of 39F7 LC with a 5-mer-linker GSGSG. For generating the construct of L-αGFP IgG1, the L-scFv was fused to the N-terminus of αGFP LC with a 15-mer-linker GSGSGGSGSGGSSGG. For generating the FGF21 variants appended F IgG molecules, FGF21 variants were fused to the C-terminus of the LC of F IgG1 (LALAPG) with a 5-mer-linker (GGSGS). FGF21FL has the mature protein sequence (H29-S209) with RGE mutations in the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Stanislaus et al., 2017</xref>); FGF21ΔN is the sequence of FGF21FL with the deletion of the N-terminus of sequence of H29-R45; FGF21ΔC is the sequence of FGF21FL with the deletion of the C-terminus S190-S209; FGF21ΔNΔC is the sequence of FGF21FL with the deletion of both the N-terminal sequence of H29-R45 and the C-terminal sequence of S190-S209.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study introduces a new therapeutic cell targeting system, where an active molecule is divided into inactive or less active parts that are subsequently linked via a bridging receptor on a target cell. <bold>Solid</bold> experimental proof of concept involving the activation of Wnt signaling in hepatocytes is presented, which could be further strengthened by demonstrating the specificity of the effect when applied to a mix of different cell types. This study may be of substantial interest to medical biologists focused on targeted therapeutics or seeking to utilize cell type-specific pathway modulation in their research.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The goal of this study was to develop and validate novel molecules to selectively activate a cell signaling pathway, the Wnt pathway in this case, in target cells expressing a specific receptor. This was achieved through a two-component system that the authors call BRAID, where each component simultaneously binds the target cell-specific marker BKlotho and a Wnt co-receptor. These components, called SWIFT molecules, bring together the Wnt co-receptors LRP and FZD, activating the pathway specifically in cells that express BKlotho. Results presented in the study demonstrate the desired activity of SWIFT molecules; the binding assays support the simultaneous association of SWIFT with BKlotho and a Wnt co-receptor, and the Wnt reporter and qPCR assays support pathway activation in cell lines and primary cells in a BKlotho-dependent manner. In the future, the BRAID approach could be applied to activate Wnt signaling or another pathway initiated by a co-receptor complex in a cell type-specific manner, and/or in a FZD subtype-specific manner to activate distinct branches of Wnt signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

• This study successfully demonstrates a novel way to activate Wnt signaling in target cells expressing a specific marker. Given the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in key processes such as cell proliferation and tissue renewal and the value of modulating cell signaling in a cell type-specific manner, the cell targeting system developed here holds great therapeutic and research potential. It will be curious to see whether the BRAID design can be applied to other cell surface markers for Wnt activation, or for activation of other signaling pathways that require co-receptor association.</p>
<p>• Octet assay results show simultaneous binding of SWIFT molecules to both the Wnt co-receptor FZD/LRP and BKlotho, while negative control molecules without the FZD/LRP or BKlotho-binding module show neither receptor binding nor Wnt pathway activation. These results indicate that SWIFT molecules function through the intended mechanism.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
• Here, the activity of SWIFT molecules was assessed in single cell types with or without BKlotho expression. Ultimately, the ability of the SWIFT molecules to activate Wnt signaling in a cell type-specific manner should be tested in the context of many different cellular identities that express BKlotho to different extents. It would be good to demonstrate that Wnt activation by SWIFT correlates with BKlotho expression level in multiple cell types - such data would strengthen the claim of cell-type specificity.</p>
<p>• The study does not address whether the targeted cells express FGFR1c/2c/3c and whether the FGF21 full-length moiety or the 39F7 IgG moiety of SWIFT molecules could unintentionally activate FGF signaling in these cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study introduces BRAID, a novel approach for targeting drugs to specific cell types, addressing the challenges of pleiotropic drug actions. Unlike existing methods, this one involves breaking a protein drug molecule into inactive parts that are then put back together using a bridging receptor on the target cell. The individual components of this assembly are not required to be together, thereby affording it a degree of flexibility. The authors applied this idea to the WNT/-catenin signaling pathway by splitting a WNT mimic into two parts with FZD and LRP binding domains and bridging receptors. This combined method, which is called SWIFT, showed that WNT signaling was turned on in target cells, showing cell-specific targeting. The technique shows promise for the development of therapeutics, as it provides a way to more precisely target signaling pathways.</p>
<p>The authors have effectively elucidated their strategy through visually appealing diagrams, providing clear and thorough visual aids that facilitate comprehension of the concept. In addition, the authors have provided convincing evidence that the C-terminal region of FGF21 is essential for the binding process. Their meticulous and thorough presentation of experimental results emphasizes the significance of this specific binding domain and validates their findings.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
BRAID, a novel cell targeting method, divides an active drug molecule into inactive components formed by a bridging receptor. This novel approach to cell-specific drug action may reduce systemic toxicity.</p>
<p>The SWIFT approach successfully targets cells in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. The approach activates WNT signaling only in target cells (hepatocytes), proving its specificity.</p>
<p>The study indicates that the BRAID approach can target various signaling systems beyond WNT/β-catenin, indicating its versatility. Therapeutic development may benefit from this adaptability.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The study shows the SWIFT approach works in vitro using cell lines, primary human hepatocytes, and human intestinal organoids, but it lacks an in vivo animal model or clinical validation. The applicability of this approach to therapy is still unknown.</p>
<p>The success of SWIFT depends on the presence and expression of the bridging receptor (βKlotho) on target cells. The approach may fail if the target receptor is not expressed or available.</p>
