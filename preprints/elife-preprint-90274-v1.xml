<title>Abstract</title><p>Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are essential components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. In terms of protein targeting and assembly, the current dogma holds that a “β-signal” imprinted in the final β-strand of the OMP engages the β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM complex) to initiate membrane insertion and assembly of the OMP into the outer membrane. Here, we reveal an additional rule, that signals equivalent to the β-signal are repeated in other, internal β-strands within bacterial OMPs. The internal signal is needed to promote the efficiency of the assembly reaction of these OMPs. BamD, an essential subunit of the BAM complex, recognizes the internal signal and the β-signal, arranging several β-strands for rapid OMP assembly. The internal signal-BamD ordering system is not essential for bacterial viability but is necessary to retain the integrity of the outer membrane against antibiotics and other environmental insults.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In Gram-negative bacteria outer membrane proteins (OMPs) play important roles in membrane-mediated processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lundquist et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Tommassen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Walther et al., 2009</xref>). Structurally, each major OMP has a β-barrel transmembrane domain, spanning the membrane as a cylindrical structure formed from amphiphilic, antiparallel β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Konovalova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Schulz, 2000</xref>). Starting as nascent polypeptides synthesized by ribosomes in the cytoplasm, these newly synthesized OMPs cross the inner membrane in a process mediated by the SecYEG translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Manting et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Mori and Ito, 2001</xref>), and then traverse the periplasm supported by the periplasmic chaperones(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The fundamental insertase for OMP insertion and assembly into the membrane is the β-barrel Assembly Machinery complex (BAM complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>). Given this essential role, and its location on the bacterial cell surface, the BAM complex has emerged as an attractive antibiotic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Imai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Luther et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the BAM complex is composed of five subunits BamA, BamB, BamC, BamD and BamE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Iadanza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). BamA, the essential core-subunit, is embedded in the outer membrane and projects an extensive N-terminal domain consisting of five polypeptide transport-associated (POTRA) repeats into the periplasm which interacts with other subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Voulhoux, 2003</xref>). The lipoprotein subunits present in the BAM complex varies in different bacterial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anwari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Webb et al., 2012</xref>) but both BamA and the lipoprotein BamD are found in the BAM complexes of all bacterial lineages and are essential for viability in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Webb et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). The interaction of the POTRA domains of BamA with its partner BamD contributes to a large, funnel-like feature of the BAM complex which expands into the periplasm.</p>
<p>BamA belongs to Omp85-superfamily protein conserved across bacterial lineages and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). Omp85-superfamily proteins are themselves β-barrels, utilizing a transiently open lateral gate between the first and last β-strands as the catalytic site of the OMPs assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doyle and Bernstein, 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Takeda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). Biophysical studies have shown “snap-shot” structures of assembly intermediates of the BAM complex with substrate OMPs and demonstrated that during assembly the first strand of the lateral gate of the BamA interacts with the C-terminal strand of the substrate OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Takeda et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). OMPs contain a conserved sequence termed the “β-signal” located within this C-terminus strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Paramasivam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Struyvé et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Inhibitory compounds such as darobactin show a similar structure to that of the β-signal and are capable of interacting with the lateral gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Imai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). The current dogma suggested by these studies dictate that this β-signal should engage the first strand of the lateral gate in BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Horne and Radford, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Tomasek and Kahne, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite recent advances in resolving the BAM complex structure and its function, the molecular mechanism of early stage OMP assembly remains enigmatic. It has been shown that the β-signal plays a significant role in the targeting and folding of BAM complex substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), yet several important OMPs do not have a recognizable β-signal motif in their C-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). For instance, BamA itself lacks an apparent C-terminal β-signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). Also, a comprehensive study of the autotransporter class of OMPs, including proteins such as EspP, showed that while 1038 non-redundant proteins did have a C-terminal β-signal motif, over 40% of these proteins had a β-signal motif only in internal strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Celik et al., 2012</xref>), which was also suggested to be the case for BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to be tested if these internal motifs function as β-signals and how they engage the BAM complex.</p>
<p>Before substrate OMPs can enter the later gate of BamA, they must first pass through the POTRA domain of the BAM complex. Although the assembly reactions that occur at the lateral gate are well understood, the molecular mechanisms at the early stage, prior to being position in the lateral gate, are largely unknown. The specific points that have been established are that the substrate makes contact with the BamB and BamD subunits and the lateral gate of the BamA subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harrison, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we establish a screening system based on an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted membrane assay using a translocation-competent <italic>E. coli</italic> Microsomal Membrane (EMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gunasinghe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thewasano et al., 2023</xref>) and demonstrate that the majority of OMPs, including the major porins that are the predominant substrate of the BAM complex, contain multiple β-signal related repeats. Comparison of the C-terminal β-signal with what we refer to here as the “internal signal”, revealed the essential elements of sequence and orientation in the signals that are recognized by the BAM complex. Internal signals and β-signals are recognized by BamD and are responsible for rapid assembly of the OMP into the bacterial membrane at the early stage. Moreover, in Gram-negative bacteria, <italic>in situ</italic> cross-linking and mutagenesis demonstrate how BamD simultaneously recognized these two β-signals, within the context of a functional BAM complex.</p>

<title>Peptidomimetics derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> OmpC inhibit OMP assembly</title>
<p>The EMM assembly assay provides a means for <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of BAM complex function, where the assembly of a <sup>35</sup>S-labelled OMP can be monitored (fig. S1A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gunasinghe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Thewasano et al., 2023</xref>). When applied to an autotransporter like <sup>35</sup>S-labelled EspP, the assay discriminates assembly of a protease-protected β-barrel domain, assembled into the OM by the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>), from the protease-sensitive extracellular passenger domain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) that are degraded by protease(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leyton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Roman-Hernandez et al., 2014</xref>). To screen for potential peptidomimetics that could inhibit BAM complex function, a synthetic peptide library was designed for coverage of the sequence features in OmpC (fig. S2). Under the conditions of the EMM assay, <sup>35</sup>S-labelled EspP was observed to fragment as predicted (fig. S1B) and was used to screen inhibitory peptides in a robust high-throughput format.</p>

<p>Six peptides (4, 10, 17, 18, 21, and 23) were found to inhibit EspP assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). Five of the most potent peptides (4, 17, 18, 21, and 23) also inhibited additional model OMPs; the porins OmpC and OmpF, the peptidoglycan-binding OmpA, and the maltoporin LamB (fig. S3). Comparing the sequences of these inhibitory peptides suggested the presence of a [Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ] motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>), which is part of the motif documented in the β-signal (ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]). The sequence codes refer to conserved features in residues such that: ζ, is any polar residue; G is a glycine residue; Ω is any aromatic residue; Φ is any hydrophobic residue and x is any residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>). The non-inhibitory peptide 9 contained some elements of the β-signal but did not show inhibition of EspP assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Peptide 18 showed a strong sequence similarity to the motif (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>) and also had a strong inhibitory action on EspP assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), so variant peptides based on the peptide 18 sequence were constructed and tested in the EMM assembly assay (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This analysis revealed that the position 0 (0Φ), in addition to the [Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ], motif was functionally important to inhibitory action (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized the elements of an internal β-signal (hereafter the internal signal) to be Φxxxxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ].</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Mutations to a putative internal signal results in loss of OMP assembly</title>
<p>To assess the impact of the conserved residues in the potential internal signal for OMP assembly, a series of mutant OmpC variants were constructed and assayed for assembly in the EMM assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Three of the peptide regions are present in the final 5 β-strands of OmpC. We denoted these as the first (−1), third (−3), and fifth (−5) β strands from the C-terminus of the barrel. Note, since peptide 17 and peptide 18 overlap, they were considered together as a single region. Given the antiparallel structure of a β-barrel the −1, −3 and −5 strands are orientated in the same direction, and these three strands all conform to the putative Φxxxxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ] motif.</p>

<p>BN-PAGE analysis was employed to measure the efficiency of OmpC trimer assembly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). These gels separate membrane proteins that have been solubilized from native membranes, allowing time-course analysis of protein assembly. Among the mutants with significantly reduced assembly efficiency, Y286A, Y325A, and Y365A correspond to Ω/Φ in position 6 (Ω/Φ), and F280A corresponds to Φ in position 0 of the putative signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and fig. S4A). In terms of the highly conserved residues present, sequence conservation was mapped against the β-strands of OMPs whose structures have been determined (fig. S5, S6, and S7). Analysis showed the −5 strand of OmpF and LamB includes residues that conform to the putative Φxxxxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ] motif (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). We constructed mutants to the 0Φ or 6[Ω/Φ] positions of the −5 strand in OmpF and LamB, these are the OmpF(V279A), OmpF(Y285), LamB(V333A) and LamB(Y339A) mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). BN-PAGE analysis showed that both the Φ – OmpF(V279) and LamB(V333) - and Ω/Φ – OmpF(Y285) and LamB(Y339) - residues were important for the assembly of OmpF and LamB (fig. S4B, C).</p>
<p>To address whether the results seen <italic>in vitro</italic> in the EMM assays were consistent with phenotypes drawn from intact <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, we constructed arabinose-inducible plasmids to express mutants of Φ (position 0), the [Ω/Φ] (position 6) and a double mutant combination of both positions in either the −5 or −1 strands of OmpC. To distinguish these plasmid-encoded OmpC variants from the endogenous, chromosome-encoded OmpC, a FLAG epitope tag was incorporated into the region of OmpC immediately behind the cleavage site for the secretory signal sequence (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Rapoport, 2007</xref>). Expression of FLAG-OmpC variants was induced with 0.1% arabinose, as confirmed through immunoblotting of total cell lysate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). In comparing the <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, a marked reduction was seen in the steady-state level of the double (“FY” or “VY”) mutants OmpC (F280A+Y286A or V359A+Y365A) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Little change was evident in the expression levels of the single −1 mutants, suggesting that a fully conserved β-signal located at the C-terminus alone is not essential to maintaining OmpC assembly. To further investigate the nature of the defects, the various strains were analyzed BN-PAGE. In all cases, OmpC that has been detergent-solubilized from outer membranes migrates as a characteristic population of dimeric and trimeric forms under conditions of the BN-PAGE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Both the trimeric and dimeric forms of OmpC solubilized from the β-barrel arrays in the outer membrane have equivalent structural and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Rocque and McGroarty, 1989</xref>). The double (“FY” or “VY”) mutants displayed drastic reductions of the dimer and trimer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). As a control, the level and integrity of the BAM complex were monitored and found to be equivalent in all strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>). Taken together these results suggest either the internal signal (in strand −5) or the C-terminal β-signal (in strand −1) must be present to achieve efficient assembly of OmpC into the outer membrane.</p>

<title>The internal signal is necessary for insertion step of assembly into OM</title>
<p>The β-signal located in the C-terminal β-strand is important for recognition by the BAM complex. In addition, because it is the last β-strand, it also contributes to engagement with the first β-strand in order that purified OMPs can fold into β-barrels, even in the absence of the BAM complex in artificial non-membrane environments such as detergent micelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgess et al., 2008</xref>). To compare this property of strand-engagement for β-barrel folding in detergent micelles, we purified urea-denatured OmpC and the OmpC variant proteins with mutations in the −5 strand (F280A and Y286A) and the −1 strand (V359A and Y365A). The spontaneous folding of each OmpC variant was assessed by the rate of formation of trimer in the presence of detergent micelles (fig.S8A). Trimer embedded into detergent micelles migrated at 100 kDa in this assay system, whereas non-folded monomeric OmpC migrated at 37 kDa (fig. S8). Relative to the rate/extent of trimer formation observed for OmpC(WT), mutations to the [Ω/Φ] (position 6) in the −5 strand i.e. OmpC(Y286A) or the −1 strand i.e. OmpC(Y365A) showed significantly impaired spontaneous folding. Mutation of the Φ residue (position 0) in the −5 strand i.e. OmpC(F280A) or the −1 strand i.e. OmpC(V359A) maintained a similar ability to assemble into micelles as native OmpC. Thus, the conserved features of both −1 and −5 strands have equivalent impact on intrinsic properties for spontaneous folding of β-barrel of OmpC.</p>
<p>Compared to the rate at which the trimeric form of OmpC is assembled (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), OmpC(Y286A) is slow and the gels resolve that most of the <sup>35</sup>S-labelled OmpC(Y286A) is held in a high-molecular-weight species for most of the time-course. Only at 80 min of assembly has substantial amount of the <sup>35</sup>S-labelled OmpC(Y286A) been resolved from this assembly intermediate (“Int”) to a native, trimeric form (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In analyzing assembly intermediates of other sorts of membrane proteins in mitochondria, a version of this analysis referred to as “gel shift” BN-PAGE analysis has been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Shiota et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the addition of an antibody recognizing the surface-exposed BamC to the samples prior to electrophoresis, resulted in a dramatic shift (i.e. retardation of electrophoretic mobility due to the added mass of antibodies) of the intermediate, consistent with OmpC(Y286A) being held in an assembly intermediate engaged with the BAM complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistent with this, the OmpC(Y286A) assembly intermediate can be extracted from the membranes with urea; urea extraction of the membrane samples prior to analysis by BN-PAGE showed that the integral membrane trimer form of OmpC and OmpC(Y286A) were not extracted by urea (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Conversely, the assembly intermediate was completely extracted with urea, as expected for a substrate engaged in protein-protein interactions with a proteinaceous complex in the membrane fraction. These results suggest that the mutation in OmpC(Y286A) causes a longer interaction with the BAM complex, as a species of protein that is not yet inserted into the surrounding membrane environment.</p>

<p>The two essential subunits of the BAM complex are BamA and BamD, and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays showed that both BamA and BamD can independently bind to the OmpC polypeptide (fig. S9). To test for signal-dependent binding, BamA and BamD were pre-incubated with signal containing inhibitor peptides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Peptide 23 inhibited binding of the substrate by BamA and peptide 18 inhibited binding of the substrate by BamD. Peptide 21 inhibited binding of the substrate by either BamA or BamD. Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful tool for probing the details of substrate-chaperone interactions, and is ideally suited for membrane-embedded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). To apply NR imaging to monitor the engagement of OmpC with the BAM complex, BamA was immobilized on an Ni-NTA atomic flat gold-coated silicon wafer to orient the POTRA domain distal to the silicon wafer as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2020</xref>). A lipid layer was reconstituted to provide BamA with a membrane-like environment prior to sequential measurement of: (i) BamA with lipid (1st measurement), (ii) BamA with lipid and BamD (2nd measurement), and (iii) BamA-BamD-lipid with the addition of OmpC (WT) or OmpC(Y286A) (3rd measurement) (fig.

<p>Comparing the reflectivity profiles of three measurements (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), changes were observed in the layers after the addition of BamD and OmpC(Y286A), as seen in a shift of fringe to low Q range around 0.02-0.03 Å<sup>-1</sup>. Crystal structures show that the periplasmic domains of BamA can be treated as two rigid bodies: POTRA1-POTRA2(P1-2) and POTRA3-POTRA4-POTRA5(P3-5). Thus, for further data analysis, we analyzed BamA as four layers: the His6 extra-cellular layer where BamA is attached to the chip, the membrane layer (containing the β-barrel domain of BamA), an adjoining P3-5 layer, and the N-terminal P1-2 layer. NR data can then highlight variations in thickness of these layers, which corresponds to the position of additional protein mass in each point of measurement (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, fig. S10B,C).</p>
<p>On addition of BamD (2nd measurement), the SLD profiles showed that BamD was located in the P3-5 layer (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, fig. S10D, E), an observation consistent with previous studies on the resting BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ding et al., 2020</xref>). On addition of the OmpC(Y286A) substrate (3rd measurement) binding was observed to the P3-5 layer, with a concomitant extension of this layer from 29.7±0.8 Å to 45.5±1.6 Å away from the membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C, 5D</xref>, fig. S10F,G). By contrast, no obvious changes were observed on the addition of the native OmpC protein implying that interactions it makes with BamA or BamD on the Si-Wafer were resolved too quickly to capture (fig. S11). The failure to observe changes with the WT-OmpC control in the NR analysis is consistent with the data from the BN-PAGE analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) where native OmpC does not form the stable intermediate seen for OmpC(Y286A). The NR findings indicate that OmpC(Y286A) is stacked at a position in the BAM complex with the POTRA3-5 of BamA and BamD, and that the Y286A mutation results in a relatively stable binding to this specific periplasmic region of the BAM complex.</p>

<title>BamD acts as a receptor for the internal signal and β-signal</title>
<p>To elucidate the residues within BamD that mediate this signal-receptor interaction, we applied <italic>in vitro</italic> site-specific photo-crosslinking (fig. S12A). A library of 40 BamD variants was created to incorporate the non-natural amino acid, <italic>p</italic>-benzoyl-<sub>L</sub>-phenylalanine (BPA), by the suppressor tRNA method in a series of positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chin et al., 2002</xref>). The UV-dependent appearance of crosslinks between OmpC and BamD occurred for 17 of the BamD variants (fig. S12B,C). The analysis was repeated to determine BamD cross-links for <sup>35</sup>S-labelled OmpC(WT), the internal signal mutant OmpC(Y286A), or the β-signal mutant OmpC(βAAA: Y365A, Q366A, F367A) (fig. S12D,E). This mapping of OmpC binding showed that an N-terminal section of BamD (amino acid residues 60 or 65) interacts with the internal signal, while a distinct section of BamD (amino acid residues 196, 200, 204) interacts with β-signal (fig. S12F).</p>
<p>While <italic>in vitro</italic> site-specific photo-crosslinking provides information on the substrate receptor region of BamD, this data only indirectly measures which residues of OmpC are being recognized. In order to obtain complimentary data on OmpC binding by BamD, we purified a form of BamD that is substituted with a cysteine residue in the substrate-binding region, and synthesized forms of <sup>35</sup>S-labeled OmpC substituted with a cysteine residue at various positions. Treatment with 1 µM CuSO<sub>4</sub> can stimulate disulfide formation between BamD and OmpC (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Consistent with the BPA crosslinking data, the positions near the internal signal in OmpC (amino acid residues 278, 284, 296 and 302) formed disulfide bonds with the N-terminal section of BamD (amino acid residues 49, 65). Conversely, residues towards the C-terminal, canonical β-signal of OmpC (amino acid residues 333, 357, and 363) formed disulfide bonds with a C-terminal section of BamD (at amino acid residue 204) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>).

<title>Two structurally distinct regions of BamD promote OmpC folding and assembly</title>
<p>In order to directly measure how the β-strands of OmpC come together, we established a new assay in which the folding of purified OmpC can be measured with or without assistance by purified BamD. Using the crystal structure of OmpC as a guide, cysteine residues were engineered in place of amino acids that were outward-facing on the final five β-strands of folded OmpC, placed close enough to a cysteine residue in the adjacent β-strand to allow for the possibility of disulfide formation once the strands had been correctly aligned in the folded protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). These cysteine-variant OmpC proteins were incubated with or without BamD to determine how efficiently disulfide bonds formed. Samples harboring cysteine residues in OmpC that were incubated with BamD migrated faster than non-Cys OmpC on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). This migration difference was not observed in reducing conditions, validating that the faster migration occurred as a result of internal molecule disulfide bond formation.

Isolated EMM from this time point showed that neither the BamD(Y62A) nor the BamD(R197A) mutants affected the steady-state protein levels of other components of the BAM complex (fig.

<p>Vancomycin sensitivity is a classic assay to measure membrane integrity in Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>E. coli</italic> because the drug vancomycin cannot permeate the outer membrane except if outer membrane integrity is breached by any means. Then, and only then, is sensitivity to vancomycin seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hart and Silhavy, 2020</xref>). To test whether expression of a mutant form of OmpC that cannot engage BamD <italic>in vivo</italic> would likewise diminish membrane integrity, we assayed for growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> strains expressing OmpC(FY) and other mutant forms of OmpC (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F, 8G</xref>). The OmpC(FY) −5 strand double mutant showed increased sensitivity to vancomycin (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8G</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While “outer membrane integrity” is a time-honored term, what does it means in a molecular sense? OMPs are the major components of bacterial outer membranes, accounting for more than 50% of the mass of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Horne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jarosławski et al., 2009</xref>). The quantitative analysis of single-cell data suggests approximately 500 molecules of major porins, such as OmpC or OmpF, are assembled into the outer membrane per minute per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benn et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lithgow et al., 2023</xref>). This considerable task requires factors that promote the efficient and prompt assembly of OMPs in order to handle this extraordinary rate of substrate protein flux. The efficiency of assembly is necessary to fight against external cellular insult, hence the use of BamD as an OMP assembly accelerator.</p>
<p>In an unbiased experimental approach to assess for inhibitory peptides, specific segments of the major porin substrate OmpC were shown to interact with the BAM complex as peptidomimetic inhibitors. Results for this experimental approach go well beyond expected outcomes. Discovery of conserved, internal signals in OMPs explains two previous reports where the −5 strand of BamA was suggested to be more similar to a β-signal motif than the C-terminal strand of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Imai et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, a hidden Markov model analysis showed that in the sub-class of OMPs called autotransporters, which includes EspP, ~31% (473/1511) of non-redundant proteins show no such β-signal motif at the C-terminal strand, but instead contain a β-signal motif in the −5 strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Celik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cox et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The inhibitory peptides discovered here contained information that led us to define an internal signal for OMP assembly. Hidden Markov model approaches like HMMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eddy, 1995</xref>) detect conserved sequence features and tools such as MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>) can then define a sequence motif derived from information across very many non-redundant protein sequences. This is rich information, that has to be oversimplified when written as a primary structure description typically used for the β-signal (ζxGxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Kutik et al., 2008</xref>). Analysis of the few peptidomimetic peptide sequences in functional analyses, via both <italic>in vitro</italic> assays and intact <italic>E. coli</italic> analysis, suggests that Φxxxxx[Ω/Φ]x[Ω/Φ] is a descriptor for the internal signal, which is complimentary in function to the C-terminal β-signal that engages the BAM complex to assist OMP assembly into the outer membrane.</p>
<p>The current dogma in our field states that the information contained in the β-signal is important for engagement into the lateral gate of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bitto and McKay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de Cock et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Doyle and Bernstein, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hagan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jansen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Robert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Xiao et al., 2021</xref>). This interaction initiates the insertion of a nascent OMP polypeptide into the outer membrane. By this model, BamD is considered to function by organizing the BamC and BamE subunits of the BAM complex against the core subunit BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kim et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Malinverni et al., 2006</xref>). If that is the sole role of BamD, then BamD is essential because its importance in structural organization of the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hart and Silhavy, 2020</xref>), not because of a substrate recognition function. Previous studies have shown BamD is capable of stimulating the folding and insertion of OMPs into liposomes in the absence of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Hagan et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">2010</xref>). The question remains, how is BamD capable of this function? In our present study, we show that incubation of OmpC with BamD promotes the formation of antiparallel β-strands by the formation of intra-molecular disulfide cross-linking of neighboring β-strands at the C-terminus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). In EspP position 1214, located within the internal signal, was seen to cross-link to BamD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ieva et al., 2011</xref>), and our inter-molecular cysteine cross-linking showed the N-terminal helices of BamD’s TPR structure interacts with the internal signal and the C-terminal helices interacts with the β-signal (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C</xref>). Failure in this interaction was seen to stall substrate assembly within the soluble domain of the BAM complex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). This suggests that BamD acts in an important role in an early recognition step in which both the substrate’s C-terminal β-signal and internal signal engage BamD in order to be arranged into a form ready for transfer to the lateral gate of BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9A</xref>). The recognition and initiation of β-strand formation by BamD is necessary to support the efficient assembly of the 500 molecules of OMPs per minute required by the outer membrane, ensuring the survival against foreign insult and supports bacterial survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lithgow et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p><bold>A,</bold> BAM complex assisted-OMP assembly is initiated when substrate OMPs encounter the periplasmic domain of the BAM complex. The canonical β-signal (blue arrow) of the OMP engages with the C-terminal TPR motifs of BamD (pink), after which the internal β-signal (orange arrow) is marshalled by the N-terminal TPR motif. The internal signal interacts with BamD R49 and N60 (black stars) while the canonical β-signal interacts with BamD D204 (black star). The proximity of BamD-substrate to POTRA 5 and the organization of the C-terminal β-strands of OMPs can then stimulate the entrance to the lateral gate of BamA.

<p>Recent advances in our understanding of BAM complex function have come from structural determination of EspP engaged in assembly by the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Shen et al., 2023</xref>). The assembly intermediate of EspP engaged with the BAM complex shows the −4 strand, interacts with the R49 residue of BamD, in the N-terminal substrate binding region, even before the −5 strand had entered into this cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>). Spatially, this indicates the BamD can serve to organize two distinct parts of the nascent OMP substrate within the periplasmic domain of the BAM complex, prior to, or in concert with, engagement to the lateral gate of BamA. Assessing this structure showed the N-terminal region of BamD (interacting with the POTRA1-2 region of BamA) and the C-terminal region of BamD (interacting with POTRA5 proximal to the lateral gate of BamA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tomasek et al., 2020</xref>) and that the N-terminal region of BamD changes conformation depending on the folding states of the last four strands of EspP. The C-terminal section of BamD and POTRA5 show no change during this stage of the folding reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Doyle et al., 2022</xref>), but the overall effect is that the dimensions of this cavity change, a change which is dependent on the folded state of the substrate engaged in it (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig 9</xref> B-E). We showed that purified BamD can facilitate partial folding of an OMP and we propose that BamD captures the −1 strand and draws the −5 strand by a conformational change, thereby catalyzing the formation of hydrogen bonds to form β-hairpins in neighboring strands, to prime the substrate for insertion into the outer membrane by the action of BamA.</p>

<p>Analysis of the NR profiles was performed using the MOTOFIT analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Nelson, 2010</xref>). The software uses a conventional method, optical matrix method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Nelson, 2006</xref>) to model the reflectivity profiles. Briefly, the layer is divided into several sublayers and then a characteristic matrix is evaluated for each sublayer, from which the whole reflectivity can be calculated exactly. The same layer with multiple datasets with three different isotopic contrasts is fitted simultaneously until the satisfactory fit is obtained (smallest χ<sup>2</sup> value in the genetic algorithm). All models include a 15 Å oxide layer on the surface of the silicon substrates and subsequently there are three layers of Ni, gold and Ni-NTA on the top of oxide layer. Protein layers will assemble outwards from the Ni-NTA layer.</p>
<p>The best-fit model from MOTOFIT gives information about the thickness, density and roughness of each layer. When a layer is composed of just two components, a chemical species or its fragment s and water w, the scattering length density (SLD) is given by: where ρw and ρs are the scattering length densities of the two components, respectively and φ is the volume fraction of species s in the layer.

<p>Purified BamA or BamD was resuspended in Buffer A to a final concentration of 10 μM. Specific peptides or DMSO alone was added (final concentration 0.35 mM) and incubated rocking at 4°C for 1 hour. To each tube, 0.5 μL of <sup>35</sup>S-OmpC was added and vortexed vigorously, 10% of the total volume was removed to assay as “input” for each sample. Samples were then incubated at 4°C with rocking for 30 minutes. Ni-NTA agarose beads were add to each sample, incubated at 4°C with rocking for an additional 30 minutes then washed with Buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole. BAM proteins were eluted from the Ni-NTA resin using Buffer A with 400 mM imidazole. Proteins were TCA precipitated and subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE and imaged via radio-imaging.</p>

<p>BamD-OmpC cysteine crosslinking was performed using 50 µM purified single-cysteine BamD mutant variants incubated with 8 µL of single-cysteine OmpC variants translated by the retic in 30 µL of Buffer A at 25°C for 2 min. An oxidizing reaction mixture of 1 µM CuSO4, 4 mM methionine, and 4 mM cysteine was added and incubated at 25°C for 5 min. Proteins were precipitated by TCA precipitation. e and solubilized in 1% SDS buffer. Solubilized proteins were diluted by 0.5% TritonX-100 buffer and purified with Ni-NTA via the tagged BamD-H6. BamD and disulfide crosslink products were eluted with 400 mM imidazole containing 0.5% TritonX-100 buffer. Eluted proteins were concentrated by TCA precipitation and solubilized with SDS-PAGE loading dye with or without β-Me.</p>
<p>The OmpC intrachain disulfide bond assay was performed using 1 μL <sup>35</sup>S-OmpC double cysteine variants translated in the presence of 1 mM DTT. OmpC variants were diluted in into 100 μL Buffer A then incubated with 50 μM BamD at 32°C for 30 minutes. 10 μM CuSO4 was added to samples and incubated for an additional 2 minutes, followed by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading dye with or without 5mM DTT and 1% β-Me.

<title><italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> photo-crosslinking</title>
<p>For <italic>in vivo</italic> photo-crosslinking, MC4100 strain was transformed with pEVOL-pBpF, pTnT-BamAp-BamD-His8, and pET-FLAG-OmpC, with respective antibiotics. A single colony was used to inoculate a culture in photo-crosslinking media (1% NaCl, 1% Tryptone, 0.1% Extract yeast dried, 1mM BPA) for 3 hours at 37°C in the dark. Afterward, arabinose (0.1% final concentration) was added and further incubated for 2.5 h. Cultures were divided with one half UV-irradiated for 7 min at RT and the other half not. Cells were pelleted and solubilized with 1% SDS buffer (50mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl, 1% SDS). His-tagged BamD containing BPA and its cross-linked products were purified by Ni-NTA agarose. Cross-linked products were identified via immunoblotting with anti-BamD and anti-FLAG antibodies.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> photo-crosslinking was performed with 32 µg of purified BamD-His<sub>8</sub> variants containing BPA diluted in Buffer A. 40 µL of <sup>35</sup>S-OmpC was added to each tube and incubated at 25°C for 10 minutes in the dark. Each mixture was transferred to the lid of a microtube and irradiated with UV using B-100AP (UVP) for 7 min on ice. 10% (w/v) SDS solution was added to a final concentration of 1%, then incubated at 95°C for 10 min to denature proteins. Protein mixtures were diluted with 0.5% TritonX-100 buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton-X100), and purified on Ni-NTA agarose beads. Elute fractions were concentrated by TCA precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radio-imaging.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The biogenesis of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) into the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria is still not fully understood, particularly substrate recognition and insertion by beta-assembly machinery (BAM). In the studies, the authors present their studies that in addition to recognition by the last strand of an OMP, sometimes referred to as the beta-signal, an additional signal upstream of the last strand is also important for OMP biogenesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. Overall the manuscript is well organized and written, and addresses an important question in the field. The idea that BAM recognizes multiple signals on OMPs has been presented previously, however, it was not fully tested.</p>
<p>2. The authors here re-address this idea and propose that it is a more general mechanism used by BAM for OMP biogenesis.</p>
<p>3. The notion that additional signals assist in biogenesis is an important concept that indeed needs fully tested in OMP biogenesis.</p>
<p>4. A significant study was performed with extensive experiments reported in an attempt to address this important question in the field.</p>
<p>5. The identification of important crosslinks and regions of substrates and Bam proteins that interact during biogenesis is an important contribution that gives clues to the path substrates take en route to the membrane.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Major critiques (in no particular order):</p>
<p>1. The title indicates 'simultaneous recognition', however no experiments were presented that test the order of interactions during OMP biogenesis.</p>
<p>2. Aspects of the study focus on the peptides that appear to inhibit OmpC assembly, but should also include an analysis of the peptides that do not to determine this the motif(s) present still or not.</p>
<p>3. The b-signal is known to form a b-strand, therefore it is unclear why the authors did not choose to chop OmpC up according to its strands, rather than by a fixed peptide size. What was the rationale for how the peptide lengths were chosen since many of them partially overlap known strands, and only partially (2 residues) overlap each other? It may not be too surprising that most of the inhibitory peptides consist of full strands (#4, 10, 21, 23).</p>
<p>4. It would be good to have an idea of the propensity of the chosen peptides to form b-stands and participate in b-augmentation. We know from previous studies with darobactin and other peptides that they can inhibit OMP assembly by competing with substrates.</p>
<p>5. The recognition motifs that the authors present span up to 9 residues which would suggest a relatively large binding surface, however, the structures of these regions are not large enough to accommodate these large peptides.</p>
<p>6. The authors highlight that the sequence motifs are common among the inhibiting peptides, but do not test if this is a necessary motif to mediate the interactions. It would have been good to see if a library of non-OMP related peptides that match this motif could also inhibit or not.</p>
<p>7. In the studies that disrupt the motifs by mutagenesis, an effect was observed and attributed to disruption of the interaction of the 'internal signal'. However, the literature is filled with point mutations in OMPs that disrupt biogenesis, particular those within the membrane region. F280, Y286, V359, and Y365 are all residues that are in the membrane region that point into the membrane. Therefore, more work is needed to confirm that these mutations are in parts of a recognition motif rather than on the residues that are disrupting stability/assembly into the membrane.</p>
<p>8. The title of Figure 3 indicates that disrupting the internal signal motif disrupts OMP assembly, however, the point mutations did not seem to have any effect. Only when both 280 and 286 were mutated was an effect observed. And even then, the trimer appeared to form just fine, albeit at reduced levels, indicating assembly is just fine, rather the rate of biogenesis is being affected.</p>
<p>9. In Figure 4, the authors attempt to quantify their blots. However, this seems to be a difficult task given the lack of quality of the blots and the spread of the intended signals, particularly of the 'int' bands. However, the more disturbing trend is the obvious reduction in signal from the post-urea treatment, even for the WT samples. The authors are using urea washes to indicate removal of only stalled substrates. However a reduction of signal is also observed for the WT. The authors should quantify this blot as well, but it is clear visually that both WT and the mutant have obvious reductions in the observable signals. Further, this data seems to conflict with Fig 3D where no noticeable difference in OmpC assembly was observed between WT and Y286A, why is this the case?</p>
<p>10. The pull down assays with BamA and BamD should include a no protein control at the least to confirm there is no non-specific binding to the resin. Also, no detergent was mentioned as part of the pull downs that contained BamA or OmpC, nor was it detailed if OmpC was urea solubilized.</p>
<p>11. The neutron reflectometry experiments are not convincing primarily due to the lack controls to confirm a consistent uniform bilayer is being formed and even if so, uniform orientations of the BamA molecules across the surface. Further, no controls were performed with BamD alone, or with OmpC alone, and it is hard to understand how the method can discriminate between an actual BamA/BamD complex versus BamA and BamD individually being located at the membrane surface without forming an actual complex. Previous studies have reported difficulty in preparing a complex with BamA and BamD from purified components. Additionally, little signal differences were observed for the addition of OmpC. However, an elongated unfolded polypeptide that is nearly 400 residues long would be expected to produce a large distinct signal given that only the C-terminal portion is supposedly anchored to BAM, while the rest would be extended out above the surface. The depiction in Figure 5D is quite misleading when viewing the full structures on the same scales with one another.</p>
<p>12. In the crosslinking studies, the authors show 17 crosslinking sites (43% of all tested) on BamD crosslinked with OmpC. Given that the authors are presenting specific interactions between the two proteins, this is worrisome as the crosslinks were found across the entire surface of BamD. How do the authors explain this? Are all these specific or non-specific?</p>
<p>13. The study in Figure 6 focuses on defined regions within the OmpC sequence, but a more broad range is necessary to demonstrate specificity to these regions vs binding to other regions of the sequence as well. If the authors wish to demonstrate a specific interaction to this motif, they need to show no binding to other regions.</p>
<p>14. The levels of the crosslinks are barely detectable via western blot analysis. If the interactions between the two surfaces are required, why are the levels for most of the blots so low?</p>
<p>15. Figure 7 indicates that two regions of BamD promote OMP orientation and assembly, however, none of the experiments appears to measure OMP orientation? Also, one common observation from panel F was that not only was the trimer reduced, but also the monomer. But even then, still a percentage of the trimer is formed, not a complete loss.</p>
<p>16. The experiment in Fig 7B would be more conclusive if it was repeated with both the Y62A and R197A mutants and a double mutant. These controls would also help resolve any effect from crowding that may also promote the crosslinks. Further, the mutation of R197 is an odd choice given that this residue has been studied previously and was found to mediate a salt bridge with BamA. How was this resolved by the authors in choosing this site since it was not one of the original crosslinking sites?</p>
<p>17. As demonstrated by the authors in Fig 8, the mutations in BamD lead to reduction in OMP levels for more than just OmpC and issues with the membrane are clearly observable with Y62A, although not with R197A in the presence of VCN. The authors should also test with rifampicin which is smaller and would monitor even more subtle issues with the membrane. Oddly, no growth was observed for the Vec control in the lower concentration of VCN, but was near WT levels for 3 times VCN, how is this explained?</p>
<p>18. While Fig 8I indeed shows diminished levels for FY as stated, little difference was observed for the trimer for the other mutants compared to WT, although differences were observed for the dimer. Interestingly, the VY mutant has nearly WT levels of dimer. What do the authors postulate is going on here with the dimer to trimer transition? How do the levels of monomer compare, which is not shown?</p>
<p>19. In the discussion, the authors indicate they have '...defined an internal signal for OMP assembly', however, their study is limited and only investigates a specific region of OmpC. More is needed to definitively say this for even OmpC, and even more so to indicate this is a general feature for all OMPs.</p>
<p>20. In the proposed model in Fig 9, it is hard to conceive how 5 strands will form along BamD given the limited surface area and tight space beneath BAM. More concerning is that the two proposal interaction sites on BamD, Y62 and R197, are on opposite sides of the BamD structure, not along the same interface, which makes this model even more unlikely. As evidence against this model, in Figure 9E, the two indicates sites of BamD are not even in close proximity of the modeled substrate strands.</p>

<p>Previously, using bioinformatics study, authors have identified potential sequence motifs that are common to a large subset of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins in gram negative bacteria. Interestingly, in that study, some of those motifs are located in the internal strands of barrels (not near the termini), in addition to the well-known &quot;beta-signal&quot; motif in the C-terminal region.</p>
<p>Here, the authors carried out rigorous biochemical, biophysical, and genetic studies to prove that the newly identified internal motifs are critical to the assembly of outer membrane proteins and the interaction with the BAM complex. The author's approaches are rigorous and comprehensive, whose results reasonably well support the conclusions. While overall enthusiastic, I have some scientific concerns with the rationale of the neutron refractory study, and the distinction between &quot;the intrinsic impairment of the barrel&quot; vs &quot;the impairment of interaction with BAM&quot; that the internal signal may play a role in. I hope that the authors will be able to address this.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. It is impressive that the authors took multi-faceted approaches using the assays on reconstituted, cell-based, and population-level (growth) systems.</p>
<p>2. Assessing the role of the internal motifs in the assembly of model OMPs in the absence and presence of BAM machinery was a nice approach for a precise definition of the role.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The result section employing the neutron refractory (NR) needs to be clarified and strengthened in the main text (from line 226). In the current form, the NR result seems not so convincing.</p>
<p>What is the rationale of the approach using NR?</p>
<p>
What is the molecular event (readout) that the method detects?</p>
<p>
What are &quot;R&quot;-y axis and &quot;Q&quot;-x axis and their physical meanings (Fig. 5b)?</p>
<p>
How are the &quot;layers&quot; defined from the plot (Fig. 5b)?</p>
<p>
What are the meanings of &quot;thickness&quot; and &quot;roughness&quot; (Fig. 5c)?</p>
<p>
What are the meanings of the increases in thickness and roughness?</p>
<p>
What does &quot;SLD&quot; stand for?</p>
<p>2. In the result section, &quot;The internal signal is necessary for insertion step of assembly into OM&quot;</p>
<p>This section presents an important result that the internal beta-signal is critical to the intrinsic propensity of barrel formation, distinct from the recognition by BAM complex. However, this point is not elaborated in this section. For example, what is the role of these critical residues in the barrel structure formation? That is, are they involved in any special tertiary contacts in the structure or in membrane anchoring of the nascent polypeptide chains?</p>
