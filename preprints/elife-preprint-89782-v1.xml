<title>Abstract</title><p>An expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene (<italic>HTT</italic>) causes Huntington’s disease (HD). Since the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, not polyglutamine, determines the age-at-onset in HD, base editing strategies to convert CAG to CAA are anticipated to delay onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Here, we developed base editing strategies to convert CAG in the repeat to CAA and determined their molecular outcomes and effects on relevant disease phenotypes. Base editing strategies employing combinations of cytosine base editors and gRNAs efficiently converted CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without generating significant indels, off-target edits, or transcriptome alterations, demonstrating their feasibility and specificity. Candidate BE strategies converted CAG to CAA on both expanded and non-expanded CAG repeats without altering <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA and protein levels. In addition, somatic CAG repeat expansion, which is the major disease driver in HD, was significantly decreased by a candidate BE strategy treatment in HD knock-in mice carrying canonical CAG repeats. Notably, CAG repeat expansion was abolished entirely in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats, supporting the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion base editing strategies in HD and potentially other repeat expansion disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Huntington’s disease (HD; MIM #143100) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> is one of many trinucleotide repeat disorders caused by expansions of CAG repeats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Although the underlying causative genes, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical features, and target tissues may be different <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, these disorders share a cardinal feature: an inverse relationship between age-at-onset and respective CAG repeat length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To explain this striking genotype-phenotype correlation that is common to many trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, a universal mechanism in which length-dependent somatic repeat expansion occurs toward a pathological threshold has been proposed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This mechanism provides a good explanation of the relationship between CAG repeat length and age-at-onset in HD very well as 1) the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat shows increased repeat length mosaicism in the target brain region <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, 2) somatic instability is repeat length-dependent <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, and 3) the levels of repeat instability shows correlations with cell type-specific vulnerability and age-at-onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, somatic repeat instability of an expanded <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat appears to play a major role in modifying HD since our genome-wide association studies have revealed that the majority of onset modification signals represent instability-related DNA repair genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Together, these data support the critical importance of CAG repeat length and somatic instability in determining the timing of HD onset.</p>
<p>Recent large-scale genetic analyses of HD subjects have revealed that different DNA repeat sequence polymorphisms have an impact on age-at-onset. Most HD subjects carry an uninterrupted glutamine-encoding CAG repeat followed by a glutamine-encoding CAA-CAG codon doublet (referred to as a canonical repeat; CR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, expanded CAG repeats lacking the CAA interruption (loss of interruption; LI) or carrying two consecutive CAA-CAG (duplicated interruption; DI) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> also exist (S. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the age-at-onset of HD subjects carrying LI or DI alleles is best explained by the length of their uninterrupted CAG repeat, not the encoded polyglutamine length <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These human genetics data indicate that introducing CAA interruption(s) into the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat to reduce the length of the uninterrupted repeat is a potential therapeutic avenue to delay the onset of HD. Importantly, a genome engineering technology called base editing (BE) was recently developed, permitting the C-to-T conversion (cytosine base editors; CBEs) or A-to-G conversion (adenine base editors; ABEs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, where CBEs could in principle be applied to convert CAG codons to CAA to shorten the uninterrupted CAG repeat without altering polyglutamine length or introducing different amino acids. In view of the strong human genetic evidence for the role of the uninterrupted CAG repeat length in determining HD onset, we have conceived BE strategies of converting CAG codons to CAA within the repeat and evaluated their therapeutic potential in HD.</p>

<p>(A-C) Least square approximation was performed to estimate the additional effects of LI (red circles in panel b and c) and DI on age-at-onset (green circles in panel c and d). We varied the CAG length of HD participants carrying LI or DI, and subsequently calculated sum of square (SS) to identify the CAG repeat that explained the maximum variance in age-at-onset of these allele carriers. Y-axis and X-axis represent age-at-onset and CAG repeat length, respectively. Grey circles and black trend lines respectively represent HD participants with CR alleles and their onset-CAG relationship.

In this example, therapeutic conversion of the 42nd CAG to CAA by BE would produce a DI allele of 41 CAG (45 glutamine). Considering the additional effect of DI alleles in HD patients, a 41 CAG / 45 glutamine DI allele would produce an onset similar to a CR allele of 40 CAG / 42 glutamine, with a mean onset age of 60. Therefore, CAG-to-CAA conversion in HD subjects with 43 CR repeats could delay onset by 12 years.</p></caption>

<title>Study approval</title>
<p>Subject consents and the overall study were approved by the Mass General Brigham IRB and described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Experiments involving mice were approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Age-at-onset of HD subjects carrying LI or DI</title>
<p>Detailed experimental procedures for sequencing of the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat region and determination of the CAG repeat length are described previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We compared age-at-onset of HD subjects carrying LI or DI to that of HD subjects carrying CR. Expected age-at-onset from CAG repeat length of CR was based on the onset-CAG regression model that we reported previously <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. For expected age-at-onset based on the polyglutamine length, the same regression model was modified by replacing CAG repeat length with CAG repeat length plus 2 because the glutamine length equals CAG + 2 in CR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Least square approximation to estimate the additional effects of LI and DI on age-at-onset</title>
<p>Carriers of LI and DI alleles showed slightly earlier and later onset age, respectively, compared to those with CR alleles of the same uninterrupted CAG repeat lengths, suggesting that LI and DI alleles confer additional effects. Thus, we attempted to determine the levels of additional effects of LI and DI that were not explained by the uninterrupted CAG size by taking a mathematical approach that is similar to least square approximation. Briefly, we predicted age-at-onset of HD subject carrying LI or DI alleles using our CAG-onset regression model for CR <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and subsequently calculated the residual by subtracting predicted onset from observed onset age. We then calculated the sum of square (SS) for LI and DI carriers based on the participant’s true uninterrupted CAG repeat length using the following formula.</p>
<p>Sum of squares (SS) = ∑ (observed age-at-onset − predicted age-at-onset age) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Subsequently, we gradually increased and decreased the CAG repeat length for LI and DI allele carriers, respectively, and calculated SS again to identify CAG repeat size that generated the smallest SS. The differences between true CAG and CAG repeat length that produced the smallest SS were considered as additional effects of LI and DI alleles on age-at-onset.</p>

<title>HEK293 cell culture, gRNA cloning, and transfection</title>
<p>HEK293 cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atcc.org/products/crl-1573">https://www.atcc.org/products/crl-1573</ext-link>) were maintained in DMEM containing L-glutamine supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000U/ml). Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TrypLE Express (Life Technologies) was used to detach cells for sub-culture. PX552 vector (addgene #60958) was digested using SapI (Thermo) and purified by gel purification (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit). A pair of oligos for each sgRNA were phosphorylated (T4 Polynucleotide Kinase, Thermo) and annealed by incubating at 37 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 5 min, and ramping to 4 °C. Annealed oligos were diluted (1:50) and ligated into the digested PX552 vector (T7 ligase, Enzymatic) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then, transformation was performed (One Shot Stbl3, Invitrogen). The inserted gRNA sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. For transfection, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at approximately 65% confluence and treated with 1.66ug of CBEs and 0.7ug of gRNA plasmids on the following day using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three days after transfection, cells were harvested for molecular analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted using DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue kit (QIAGEN). AccuPrime GC-Rich DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) was used to amplify a region containing the CAG repeat (35 cycles). PCR product was purified by PCR QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and subjected to MiSeq (Center for Computational and Integrative Biology DNA Core, Massachusetts General Hospital) and/or Sanger sequencing analysis (Center for Genomic Medicine Genomics Core, Massachusetts General Hospital). Primers for MiSeq sequencing were ATGAAGGCCTTCGAGTCCC and GGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGA; primers for Sanger sequencing analysis were CAAGATGGACGGCCGCTCAG and GCAGCGGGCCCAAACTCA.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>MiSeq data analysis to determine indels and conversion types</title>
<p>Sequence data from the MiSeq sequencing were subject to quality control (QC) by removing sequence reads 1) with mean base Phred quality score smaller than 20, 2) showing the difference between forward and reverse read pair, 3) containing fewer than 6 CAGs, or 4) not involving the full primer sequences. QC-passed data revealed that HEK293 cells carry 16/17 CAG canonical repeats and therefore are expected to produce 18/19 polyglutamine segments. For QC-passed sequence reads, we determined the proportion of sequence reads containing indels, revealing most indels were sequencing errors. Subsequently, we focused on sequence reads without indels to determine the types of conversion. For each sequence read (not including CAA-CAG interruption), we counted sequence reads containing CAA, CAC, CAG, CCG, CGG, CTG, AAG, GAG, and TAG trinucleotide to determine the types and levels of conversion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>MiSeq data analysis of HEK293 cells treated with BE strategies to determine the sites of conversion</title>
<p>Sequence analysis revealed that BE strategies using CBEs produced mostly CAG-to-CAA conversion. CAG-to-TAG conversion was detected in all samples regardless of BE strategies, suggesting that this type of conversion is also due to amplification/sequencing errors. Therefore, we focused on sequence reads of 16/17 CAG repeats containing only CAG or CAA to determine the sites of CAG-to-CAA conversion. Briefly, we recorded the sites of CAG-to-CAA conversion for each sequence read and summed the number of conversions at a given site for a given sample. Therefore, 30% CAG-to-CAA conversion at the second CAG means 70% and 30% of all sequence reads contain CAG and CAA at the second CAG position, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Quantification of duplicated interruption and multiple conversion</title>
<p>The proportion of duplicated interruptions was determined from HEK293 cells treated with different combinations of CBEs and gRNAs. Briefly, we counted sequence reads containing duplicated interruption and divided them by the number of all QC-passed sequence reads to calculate the proportion of DI alleles. Similarly, we calculated the proportion of sequence reads containing duplicated interruption and CAG-to-CAA conversions at other sites. We also determined the levels of multiple CAG-to-CAA conversion for each BE strategy. For each sequence read in a sample, we counted the number of CAG-to-CAA conversions regardless of their locations to generate a distribution of numbers of multiple conversion for each sample. Since we counted the conversions regardless of their positions, multiple conversions do not necessarily mean consecutive conversions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>Determination of the transfection efficiency</title>
<p>To determine the effects of transfection efficiency on patterns of base editing, we transfected HEK293 cells with gRNA 2 with combinations of different base editors and performed cell staining. Transfected HEK293 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.5%). Then, cells were stained with DAPI (0.5uM) and incubated for 30 min before being washed with PBS. The eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) and DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) images from eight areas in each well were captured using a fluorescence inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U). The ImageJ analysis program was used to measure the size of a single cell expressing eGFP; we randomly selected 20 cells for each image and averaged their sizes to be used as a reference. We counted the number of pixels covered by eGFP-positive signals, and subsequently divided by the average cell size to obtain the number of eGFP positive cells in each image. This was repeated with the DAPI staining images. The percent transfected was calculated by dividing the number of eGFP-positive cells by that of DAPI-positive cells multiplied by 100.</p>

<title>Base editing in HD patient-derived iPSC and differentiated neurons</title>
<p>An iPSC line carrying adult-onset CAG repeats (42 CAG) was derived from a lymphoblastoid cell line in our internal collection by the Harvard Stem Cell Institute iPS Core Facility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ipscore.hsci.harvard.edu/">http://ipscore.hsci.harvard.edu/</ext-link>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. HD iPSC cells were dissociated into single cells with Accutase (STEMCELL Tech) and plated on matrigel-coated 24-well plate in mTeSR plus media containing CloneR (STEMCELL Tech) to increase cell viability. The following day, cells at 60∼70% confluence were transfected with 1.8ug of BE4max and 0.6ug of gRNA plasmids using Lipofectamine STEM (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 days for sequencing analysis.</p>
<p>The same iPSC line was differentiated into neurons using a previously described method <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Briefly, the iPSC line was plated on growth factor reduced Matrigel (Corning) in mTeSR Plus media (STEMCELL Technologies). When cells reached ∼ 80% confluence, differentiation was initiated by switching to DMEM-F12/Neurobasal media (2:1) supplemented with N2 and retinol-free B27 (N2B27 RA−; Gibco). For the first ten days, cells were supplemented with SB431542 (10 µM; Tocris), LDN-193189 (100 nM; StemGene), and dorsomorphin (200 nM; Tocris). SB431542 was removed from the media on day 5. Cells were maintained in N2B27 RA− supplemented with activin A (25 ng/ml; R&amp;D) on day 9. On day 22, cells were split using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies) and seeded on a poly-D-lysine/laminin plate with N2B27 media supplemented with BDNF and GDNF (10 ng/ml each; Peprotech). Media were changed the next day to facilitate neuronal maturation and survival. Cells were fed with new media every two days. For neuronal marker staining, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked using the Image-iT Fix-Perm kit (Invitrogen).

<title>Generation and validation of HEK293-51 CAG cells carrying an expanded CAG repeat</title>
<p>HD patient-derived iPSC and neurons showed modest conversion efficiencies, making it technically difficult to characterize molecular consequences of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies. Thus, we generated HEK293 cells carrying an expanded repeat by replacing one of the non-expanded <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeats with a 51 CAG repeat. Briefly, we cloned a gRNA (CAGAGCGCAGAGAATGCGCG) into the PX459 vector (Addgene# 62988) to express SpCas9 and gRNA for CRISPR-Cas9 targeting at the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat region. The donor template for homologous recombination was generated by PCR amplification of a human DNA sample carrying 51 CAG repeat into the pCR-Blunt II TOPO plasmid (Invitrogen). Subsequently, HEK293 cells were transfected with PX459 and pCR-Blunt II TOPO plasmids by Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) for 72 hr. Subsequently, cells were treated with G-418 (Gibco) for 21 days, and surviving cells were re-plated onto 100 cm dishes. After 10 days, visible colonies were picked and maintained separately. Single cell clonal lines were validated by PCR analysis using AccuPrime GC-Rich DNA Polymerase and primer set (ATGAAGGCCTTCGAGTCCC and GGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGA). The PCR conditions were initial denaturation (95 °C, 3 min), 30 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 sec), annealing (55 °C, 30 sec), extension (72 °C, 40 sec), and final extension (72 °C, 10 min). The PCR products were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel containing GelRed (Biotium) and visualized under UV light to distinguish expanded from non-expanded CAG repeats. We also performed RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis to confirm the correct integration of the expanded CAG repeat. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA from the targeted clonal line was subjected to reverse transcription with SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions followed by PCR analysis using a primer set (ATGAAGGCCTTCGAGTCCC and GGCTGAGGAAGCTGAGGA). For HTT immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed with RIPA Lysis/Extraction Buffer (Thermo) supplemented Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo). Whole cell lysate was then separated on NuPAGE 3 to 8%, Tris-Acetate gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline for 1 h and incubated with primary antibodies for HTT (MAB2166, Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 h at 4 °C. The membrane was washed for 1 h, and blots were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h then washed for 1 h. The bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo). Similar to HEK293 cells, HEK293-51CAG cells were treated with BE4max and candidate gRNAs (i.e., gRNA 1 and gRNA 2) to determine the levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion and the total HTT protein levels. For gRNA 1, we determined the levels of in-frame insertion and deletion right after treatment using methods previously described (Lee 2015).</p>

<title>Effects of CAG-CAG codon doublet on age-at-onset in HD patients</title>
<p>Previously, we and others reported that most HD subjects carry canonical repeats (CR) comprising an uninterrupted expanded CAG repeat followed by CAA-CAG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Although infrequent, uninterrupted CAG repeats followed by 1) no CAA-CAG (LI; 0.23% in our previous GWA data) and 2) two CAA-CAG codon doublets (DI; 0.76% in our previous GWA data) also exist (S. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In HD subjects carrying LI alleles, the length of the CAG repeat and polyglutamine segment are identical. However, the polyglutamine length is greater by 2 and 4, respectively, compared to the CAG repeats in CR and DI alleles (S. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Since CR, LI, and DI alleles with the same uninterrupted CAG repeat lengths have different polyglutamine sizes, they have provided a powerful tool to investigate the relative importance of the CAG repeat in DNA vs. polyglutamine in protein in determining onset age. For example, if polyglutamine length played an important role in determining age-at-onset, onset of LI and DI allele carriers, who respectively have 2 fewer and 2 more glutamines compared to CR allele carriers, would be significantly later and earlier compared to CR allele carriers with the same uninterrupted CAG repeats (S. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). In stark contrast to these predictions, the onset ages of LI or DI allele carriers are best explained by their respective CAG repeat sizes, not polyglutamine length (S. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>). Furthermore, age-at-onset of DI allele carriers is significantly delayed compared to that of LI allele carriers with the same uninterrupted CAG repeat size even though DI alleles encode 4 more glutamines than LI alleles (Student t-test p-value, 1.007E-12) (S. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Together, the data indicate that age-at-onset in HD is determined primarily by the uninterrupted length of the CAG repeat, but there may also be additional effects of different CAA-interruption structures since the CAG repeat length does not fully explain age-at-onset in LI and DI allele carriers (S. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, we performed least square approximation to calculate the magnitudes of the additional effects of LI and DI alleles on age-at-onset. Briefly, we varied the individual CAG repeat length to identify the repeat size that best explains the observed age-at-onset of carriers of these LI and DI alleles relative to CR alleles. The age-at-onset of the LI allele carriers is best explained when 3 CAGs are added to the true CAG repeat length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>; S. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) while the DI allele carriers behave with respect to age-at-onset as if they have one less CAG than their true CAG repeat length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>; S. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). These data suggest that switching a CR allele to a DI allele would delay onset by 1) shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat by two CAG repeats and 2) conferring an additional effect comparable to a reduction in length of one CAG. For example, if a DI allele were generated from a CR allele with 43 uninterrupted CAGs by converting the 42nd CAG to CAA using base editing strategies, the age-at-onset is predicted to be delayed by approximately 12 years (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), illustrating the robustness of therapeutic base editing strategies.</p>

<title>Cytosine base editors and gRNAs to convert CAG to CAA in the HTT CAG repeat</title>
<p>Recent advancements in genome editing technologies have led to the development of CBEs that are capable of efficient C-to-T conversion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. In principle, CR can be converted to DI if CBEs target the non-coding strand of the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). In this study, we tested 4 CBEs comprised of various cytosine deaminases and SpCas9 enzymes with different protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificities to explore the feasibility of CAG-to-CAA conversion as a putative treatment for HD. BE4 is the fourth-generation base editor which was engineered from BE3 to increase the editing efficiencies and decrease the frequency of undesired by-products (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. BE4 exhibited high levels of C-to-T editing activity on the target sites harboring NGG PAMs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. The activity window of BE4 is position 4-8, counting from the PAM distal end of the spacer (where the PAM is positions 21-23) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. We tested the BE4max (Addgene #112093) in this study, which is a codon optimized version of BE4 with improved nuclear localization <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Due to the sparsity and lack of NGG PAM sites near and within the CAG repeat, respectively, CAG-to-CAA conversion using BE4 was expected to be somewhat limited. Therefore, we also explored engineered CBEs containing SpCas9 variants that target an expanded range of PAM sequences, including SpCas9-NG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> and SpG <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Since these variants are capable of targeting sites with NGN PAMs, they might permit higher density targeting near or within the CAG repeat. The nucleotide preceding the target cytosine also affects the C-to-T conversion efficiency in CBEs, especially when a G precedes the C <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Thus, engineered deaminase domains have been explored to improve C-to-T conversion in the GC-contexts <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. For instance, an evolved CDA1-based BE4max variant (evoCDA1) showed substantially higher editing on GC targets <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, which is relevant to the nucleotide context on the non-coding strand of the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat (CT<underline>GC</underline>TG). Therefore, we explored the use of canonical BE4max-SpCas9, BE4max-SpCas-NG, BE4max-SpG, and evoCDA1-BE4max-SpG (henceforth referred to as BE4max, BE4-NG, BE4-SpG, and evo-SpG, respectively) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>To achieve CAG-to-CAA conversion in the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat, we designed 3 groups of gRNAs (S. Table 1) based on the sites of predicted hybridization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Aiming at converting CAGs at the front-end of the repeat, gRNAs 1 and 2 were designed to hybridize with a region involving the upstream of the repeat and conventional NGG PAMs. The gRNAs 1 and 2 contain 10 and 2 non-CAG bases at the PAM-proximal ends, respectively (S. Table 1; S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Considering the activity window of the BE4 (i.e., 13th-17th nucleotide from the PAM) (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, green boxes in the gRNAs), BE4max-gRNAs 1 and BE4max-gRNA 2 were predicted to convert the 1st/2nd and 4th/5th CAG to CAA, respectively (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>; sequences with green highlight). The gRNAs 3, 4, and 5 comprised the CAG repeat sequence (S. Table 1) and therefore, were predicted to hybridize throughout the <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat and potentially other CAG repeat-containing genes (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The gRNAs 3, 4, and 5 were predicted to utilize NAA/NTG, NGA/NCT, and NGG/NGC PAMs, respectively (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Lastly, gRNAs 6, 7, and 8 were designed to convert CAGs at the back-end of the repeat (S. Table 1). Available PAM sites for these gRNAs are NCT, NGC, and NTG (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Considering the predicted gRNA-target hybridization sites and conversion windows, these three gRNAs might generate the duplicated interruption that is found in HD patients.

Table 2; S. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), also reflecting sequencing errors. However, the levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion were significantly increased over baseline sequencing errors in cells treated with some BE strategies (S. Table 2). For example, BE4max in combination with gRNAs 1, 2, 5, and 7 resulted in efficient CAG-to-CAA conversion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref>). Given the availability of the NGG PAMs (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), robust CAG-to-CAA conversion by gRNAs 1, 2, and 5 was somewhat anticipated for BE4max. However, high levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion by the BE4max-gRNA 7 combination (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; S. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) were unexpected because the anticipated hybridization site does not provide the NGG PAM (S. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) that is required for the optimal activity of BE4max. The BE4-NG robustly produced CAG-to-CAA conversions with gRNAs 1, 2, and 3; although not significant, gRNAs 5 and 7 also generated high levels of CAG-to-CAA conversions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; S. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). BE4-SpG with the combinations with gRNAs 1 and 2 resulted in significant levels of CAG-to-CAA conversions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>; S. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Overall, the CAG-to-CAA conversion was higher in evo-SpG compared to other base editors; gRNAs 1, 2, 4, and 8 produced significant CAG-to-CAA conversions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>; S. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). These data indicated that our BE strategies primarily generated CAG-to-CAA conversion without significant indel formation. Patterns of conversions also indicated that sites with NGG PAMs (gRNAs 1, 2, and 5) permitted the highest levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion for BE4max and CBEs with relaxed PAM specificities.</p>

<title>Sites of CAG-to-CAA conversion</title>
<p>Subsequently, we determined conversion sites for different BE strategies. The patterns of conversion sites were similar for BE4max, BE4-NG, and BE4-SpG in gRNA 1, showing the most conversion at the second CAG with decreased levels of conversion at the first CAG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; S. Table 3). In contrast, evo-SpG-gRNA 1 combination showed higher editing efficiencies with the maximum conversion at the second CAG with comparable levels of conversions at the first and third CAGs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, cyan; S. Table 3). The gRNA 2 showed similar patterns as gRNA 1 except that conversion sites were shifted to the right; the highest conversion occurred at the 4th CAG by BE4max, BE4-NG, and BE4-SpG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; S. Table 3).</p>
<p>The gRNAs 3 and 4, which were designed to hybridize throughout the CAG repeat, did not generate CAG-to-CAA conversion in combination with BE4max (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, red; S. Table 3) because of the lack of a NGG PAM. Although modest, BE4-NG and BE4-SpG converted the 5th CAG to CAA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>; S. Table 3), potentially due to the possibility that NAA (gRNA 3) and NGA (gRNA 4) PAMs supported the base editing activity of BE4-NG and BE4-SpG. The gRNAs 3 and 4 produced higher levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion in evo-SpG again (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>, cyan), and interestingly, CAG-to-CAA conversions were not limited to the 5th CAG (S. Table 3). The gRNA 5 with BE4max efficiently converted the 6th CAG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, red), which was unexpected; conversions by other base editors were lower but widespread throughout the repeat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>).</p>
<p>BE strategies designed to convert CAGs at the back-end of the repeat were tested using gRNA 6, 7, and 8. Although less robust, the patterns of conversion by gRNA 6 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>) were similar to those of gRNA 4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Since only one nucleotide is different between gRNA 6 and gRNA 4, it appeared that gRNA 6 behaved like gRNA 4 despite one mismatch, favoring the NGA PAM instead of the less optimal NCT PAM (S. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The same explanation might account for the similar patterns of conversion sites for gRNA 7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>) and gRNA 5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>); efficient conversion at the 6th CAG by BE4max-gRNA 7 might be due to the interaction of gRNA 7 at the target site of gRNA 5 (with one mismatch) in favor of the NGG PAM (S. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). The gRNA 8 generated CAG-to-CAA conversions only in evo-SpG. Although this group of gRNAs was designed to hybridize with the back-end of the CAG repeat, higher levels of conversion were observed at the front-end CAGs and throughout the repeat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4F</xref>-<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref>). These results suggest that one PAM-distal mismatch might be tolerated by base editors in favor of targets sites harboring more robust PAMs. Also, our data revealed that as expected, BE4max is highly dependent on the NGG PAM, resulting in CAG-to-CAA conversion at specific CAG sites, while evo-SpG is more efficient in conversion leading to broader targeting due to its relaxed PAM requirement.</p>

<title>Generation of duplicated interruption by BE strategies</title>
<p>Next, we determined the levels of duplicated interruption in the same HEK293 cell MiSeq data. As shown in S. Figure 8, BE4max and evo-SpG did not produce significant amounts of the DI that is found in humans (S. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). However, BE4-NG (S. Figure 8B) and BE4-SpG (S. Figure 8C) produced modest but significant levels of DI in combinations with gRNAs 5 and 7 (0.5%∼1% increase over the basal levels). Modest levels of DI alleles compared to conversions at other sites might be due to the lack of canonical PAMs (e.g., NGG) at the specific site (approximately 18 nucleotides upstream of CAA-CAG interruption). We also observed that gRNA 5 and 7 relatively increased the number of sequence reads containing both DI and CAG-to-CAA conversions at other sites (S. Figures 9B and 9C), indicating that CTG trinucleotides on the non-coding strand of the repeat contributed to modest but widespread CAG-to-CAA conversion throughout the repeat. Similarly, CAG-to-CAA conversion was not confined to specific sites in evo-SpG in combination with gRNAs 3-8 as DI alleles generated by these strategies also contained CAG-to-CAA conversions at other sites (S. Figure 9D). Since increased conversion efficiency in evo-SpG could not be explained by the transfection efficiency (S. Figure 10), these data indicate that evo-SpG has a significantly wider conversion window. In agreement with this, the most frequent number of conversions in a given sequence read by evo-SpG was greater than that of other base editors (S. Figure 11; S. Table 4).</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<title>Evaluation of off-target effects</title>
<p>We then evaluated the levels of off-target conversions using Off-Spotter. As summarized in S. Table 5, gRNAs 1 and 2 showed relatively smaller numbers of predicted off-targets due to unique sequences near the PAMs. As expected, gRNAs that were designed to hybridize throughout the CAG repeat showed increased numbers of predicted off-targets. Similarly, gRNAs to convert CAG at the back-end of the repeat showed larger numbers of predicted off-targets, potentially due to the fact that unique sequences are distal to the PAMs. Subsequently, we performed two sets of follow-up off-target validations. For gRNAs 1 and 2, we experimentally evaluated predicted off-targets focusing on protein-encoding genes; one and four genes were predicted off-target sites for gRNA 1 and gRNA 2, respectively, and all showed low levels of conversion compared to on-target (S. Table 6). We also characterized the levels of off-target conversion in other CAG repeat-containing genes focusing on 8 polyglutamine disease genes (S. Tables 7). As predicted, gRNAs 1 and 2 showed low-level conversions in the CAG repeats of other polyglutamine disease genes in general (S. Table 8; S. Figure 12). In contrast, gRNAs 3- 8 produced variable but higher levels of conversion in some polyglutamine disease genes depending on the availability of preferred PAMs (S. Figure 12).</p>

<title>Allele specificities and molecular outcomes of candidate BE strategies</title>
<p>Subsequently, we evaluate the levels of allele specificity of candidate BE strategies (BE4max-gRNA 1 and BE4max-gRNA 2) in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC carrying 41 CAG CR) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> and differentiated neurons (S. Figure 13). As shown in S. Table 9, transfection of gRNA 1 and gRNA 2 produced modest CAG-to-CAA conversion on both mutant and normal <italic>HTT</italic> (approximately &lt; 3%). Overall, low conversion efficiencies by transfection and transduction of AAV (adeno-associated virus; data not shown) represent difficulties in delivery in these cell types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, posing a challenge to determining the levels of allele specificity of BE strategies. To overcome these technical difficulties, we developed a HEK293 clonal line carrying an expanded <italic>HTT</italic> CAG repeat (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) by replacing one of normal CAG repeats with a 51 CAG canonical repeat (namely HEK293-51 CAG) (S. Figure 14). A candidate BE strategy (i.e., BE4max-gRNA 1) did not increase the levels of in-frame insertion/deletion in the mutant or normal <italic>HTT</italic> repeat (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Subsequent analysis revealed that a candidate BE strategy BE4max-gRNA 1 produced high levels of CAG-to-CAA conversions on both expanded and non-expanded canonical repeats (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Although very modest, conversion was significantly higher in the non-expanded repeat (uncorrected p-value, 0.04996), which can be explained by slightly reduced conversion on the mutant <italic>HTT</italic> due to higher GC content in the expanded CAG repeat. However, the candidate BE strategies did not alter huntingtin protein levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>) at the time of treatment, supporting the safety of candidate BE strategies. We also performed RNAseq analysis to identify genes whose expression levels were altered by candidate BE strategies in HEK293 cells. Candidate strategies such as BE4max-gRNA 1 and BE4max-gRNA 2 produced significant on-target CAG-to-CAA conversions (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), but the levels of <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA were not altered by either treatment (filled red circles in S. Figure 15 and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). In addition, RNAseq data analysis showed that neither BE strategy induced significant gene expression changes in any genes (false discovery rate, 0.05) (S. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). When comparing all HEK293 samples treated with either BE strategies (n=8) to those treated with EV (n=4), the shape of volcano plot mimicked random sample comparison (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>), implying the lack of impacts of candidate BE strategies on transcriptome.</p>

<title>Effects of base conversion on the CAG repeat instability in vivo</title>
<p>The limited cargo capacity of AAV has been circumvented by the intein-split base editor, and the feasibility of BE strategies targeting non-repetitive sequences has been demonstrated in mouse models of human diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. Taking advantage of the split BE system, we determined whether a candidate HD BE strategy could target the CAG repeat and result in a decrease in somatic repeat expansion, which was hypothesized to be the major disease driver <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Since striatal and liver repeat instability share certain underlying mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>, and <italic>in vivo</italic> delivery might be more efficient in the liver compared to the brain <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we used AAV9 to evaluate a candidate BE strategy in the liver. As expected, somatic CAG repeat expansion index in the liver of HD knock-in mice carrying around 110 CAGs showed a positive correlation with the inherited CAG repeat length (as represented in tail DNA) and the age of mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, we could not determine the sequence modification in treated mice by sequencing because of 1) very long CAG repeats in these mice, 2) modest levels of base conversion, and 3) high levels of errors when sequencing the CAG repeat (S. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). However, when the effects of the tail CAG repeat size and age of mice were corrected, retro-orbital injection of AAV9 for split CBE (v5 AAV-CBE) and gRNA 2 significantly decreased the levels of repeat expansion (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>; p-value, 1.78E-6). Nevertheless, the expansion index in treated and control mice was largely overlapping (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), suggesting that the effects of BE treatment were very modest. We speculate that 1) insufficient dosage due to difficulty in producing high titer viral package for big cargo (i.e., 5KB) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, 2) limited delivery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, and/or 3) difficulty in targeting the very long CAG repeat resulted in modest effects. Given those limitations, we also analyzed a mouse model containing interrupted repeat to determine the maximum effects of the interruption on the repeat expansion. HD knock-in mice carrying 105 interrupted CAG repeat (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/027418">https://www.jax.org/strain/027418</ext-link>) showed complete loss of repeat expansion compared to 105 CAG uninterrupted repeat mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jax.org/strain/027417">https://www.jax.org/strain/027417</ext-link>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>), suggesting that CAA interruption could completely suppress the most important disease modifier (i.e., CAG repeat expansion).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent advances in genome engineering provide powerful tools to interrogate the relationships among genes, functions, and diseases. For example, CRISPR-Cas9-based editing approaches have revolutionized the investigation of individual genes of interest and also have begun to be applied to humans to treat diseases <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Base editing (BE), which can convert a single nucleotide to another, represents a newly developed and highly versatile genome engineering technology <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. BE has advantages over other genome engineering approaches with respect to safety and clinical applicability. BE employing nickase Cas9 does not intentionally create double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, minimizing potential adverse effects. Also, BE with low off-targeting is being actively developed, adding an additional layer of safety <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. The majority of well-characterized disease-causing mutations are point mutations, and therefore many genetic disorders can be addressed by BE strategies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. The robustness of BE has been demonstrated in models of genetic disorders caused by point mutations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, and the first human trial employing base editing has already been started <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. However, many human disorders are caused by other types of mutations, such as expansions of DNA repeats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> for which BE may not seem like an ideal tool. In contrast to this commonly held notion, we show that BE strategies could also address diseases that are caused by expanded repeats, broadening their target space and applicability.</p>
<p>In HD, multiple studies have shown that the uninterrupted CAG repeat length in <italic>HTT</italic> gene, not the polyglutamine length in huntingtin protein, determines age-at-onset <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Age-at-onset of HD subjects carrying DI alleles not only supports this notion directly, but also points to novel therapeutic strategies. For example, converting CAG to CAA would decrease the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat without changing the length of polyglutamine or altering huntingtin protein. Indeed, our candidate BE strategies could shorten the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat by converting CAG to CAA at various sites in the CAG repeat without causing significant indels or off-target effects. In support, our candidate BE strategy modestly but significantly reduced the levels of CAG repeat expansion in mice, and HD knock-in mice carrying the CAA-interrupted repeats showed virtually zero repeat expansion. Given the role of the uninterrupted CAG repeat length as the most important disease determinant and a pivotal role for repeat instability in the modification of HD <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, our data support the therapeutic potential of CAG-to-CAA conversion BE strategies in HD.</p>
<p>Our data are relevant for a number of reasons. Firstly, genetically supported targets significantly increase the success rate in clinical development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>; our BE strategies derive directly from human genetic observations in HD individuals <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> that point to the uninterrupted CAG repeat length in <italic>HTT</italic> as the most direct therapeutic target in HD. Based on these human data, CAG-to-CAA conversion even near the 5’-end of the expanded CAG repeat may produce robust onset-delaying effects. In addition, if BE strategies are applied to fully penetrant 40 or 41 CAG canonical repeats, the repeats can become reduced penetrant (i.e., 36-39). Similarly, BE strategies may be able to convert some of the reduced penetrant CAG repeats (e.g., 36 and 37 CAG) to non-pathogenic (CAG &lt; 36), which can prevent the manifestation of the disease. Secondly, lessons from the recent huntingtin-lowering clinical trial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup> implied the importance of allele-specific approaches <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Although CAG-to-CAA conversions in our experiments occurred on both mutant and normal <italic>HTT</italic>, our candidate BE strategies are expected to produce mutant allele<italic>-</italic>specific consequences. The amino acid sequence and levels of huntingtin were not altered, while the length of the uninterrupted CAG repeat was shortened. On the mutant allele, this shortening is expected to reduce the somatic instability of the repeat, reducing its disease-producing potential. On the normal allele, inherited variation in the length of the CAG repeat has not been associated with an abnormal phenotype <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, so the shortening of the CAG repeat is expected to be benign. Importantly, the mutant allele-specific consequences can be achieved without relying on individual genetic variations beyond the CAG repeat. Various SNP-targeting allele-specific approaches have been proposed <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>, but most of these can be applied only to a subset of the HD population depending on heterozygosity at the target site. Our BE strategies can achieve allele-specific consequences without targeting SNPs, and, therefore, can be applied to all HD subjects, representing a huge advantage over SNP-targeting allele-specific strategies. Lastly, BE with relaxed PAM requirements <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> has increased the applicability of BE, and our study has further expanded the target space of this powerful technology. BE is appropriately viewed as a tool to correct disease-causing point mutations or to modify gene expression by introducing early stop codons or altering splice sites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>. However, our study demonstrates that base conversion can address disease-causing repeat expansion mutations without involving DSB. The ramifications apply not only to HD but also to numerous other diseases that are caused by expansions of repeats <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, offering alternative therapeutic approaches for the repeat expansion disorders.</p>
<p>Although promising, hurdles must be overcome before CAG-to-CAA conversion BE strategies are applied to humans. The BE strategies that we evaluated did not robustly generate DI alleles that are found in humans, potentially due to the possibility that PAM at specific sites that are required to generate DI did not sufficiently support the activity of CBEs that we tested. Therefore, new CBEs that can efficiently generate DI alleles will greatly facilitate the development of rational treatments for HD. Also, the inability to directly target alternative toxic species such as RAN translation or exon 1A huntingtin fragment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> may represent one of the limitations of our BE strategies for HD. Still, if the levels of those alternative toxic species are dependent of the length of uninterrupted CAG repeat, CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies may be able to ameliorate alternative toxic species-mediated HD pathogenesis. Although BE strategies can address the primary disease driver in principle, they may not produce any significant clinical benefits if they are applied too late in the disease. As we previously speculated, the timing of treatment might have negatively impacted the outcomes of the first ASO <italic>HTT</italic> lowering trial <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup><sup>;</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>. Considering the evidence for significant levels of neurodegeneration at the onset of characteristic clinical manifestations <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>, CAG-to-CAA conversion treatments may not produce any clinical improvements if applied late. With the expectation of mutant-specific consequences, we reason that BE strategies can be applied quite early without involving deficiency-related adverse effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup> because CAG-to-CAA conversion is predicted to neither alter the amino acid sequence nor changes the expression levels of <italic>HTT</italic>. Regardless, these temporal aspects and safety features have to be determined. Finally, like other gene targeting strategies, the development of effective delivery methods is critical for applying BE therapeutically. The expansion-decreasing effects of our initial AAV injection experiments, while significant, may have been limited compared to cell culture systems by inefficient delivery and difficulty in targeting the repeat sequence. For the successful application of BE strategies to human HD, efficient delivery methods will be critical.</p>
<p>Given the lack of effective treatments for HD and the premature terminations of highly anticipated <italic>HTT</italic>- lowering clinical trials such as GENERATION-HD1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup> and VIBRANT-HD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hda.org.uk/media/4418/novartis-vibrant-hd-community-letter-final-pdf.pdf">https://www.hda.org.uk/media/4418/novartis-vibrant-hd-community-letter-final-pdf.pdf</ext-link>), aiming at the most relevant target is becoming increasingly important. Our data reveal relevant strategies for addressing the target most strongly supported by human HD genetic data, the uninterrupted CAG repeat in <italic>HTT</italic>, therefore offer new opportunities for blocking the disorder at its cause. Although both great promise and significant hurdles exist for the clinical application of BE strategies in HD, our data demonstrate the proof-of-concept of this technology as the basis for developing a rational treatment for HD and, potentially, for other repeat expansion disorders.</p>

<p>This proof-of-concept study focuses on an A-&gt;G DNA base editing strategy that converts CAG repeats to CAA repeats in the human HTT gene, which causes Huntington's disease (HD). These studies are conducted in human HEK293 cells engineered with a 51 CAG canonical repeat and in HD knock-in mice harboring 105+ CAG repeats. The findings of this study are <bold>valuable</bold> for the HD field, applying state-of-the-art techniques. However, the key experiments have yet to be performed in neuronal systems or brains of these mice: actual disease-rectifying effects relevant to patients have yet to observed, leaving the work <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the paper by Choi et al., the authors aimed to develop base editing strategies to convert CAG repeats to CAA repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT), which causes Huntington's disease (HD). They hypothesized that this conversion would delay disease onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Using HEK-293T cells as a model, the researchers employed cytosine base editors and guide RNAs (gRNAs) to efficiently convert CAG to CAA at various sites within the CAG repeat. No significant indels, off-target edits, transcriptome alterations, or changes in HTT protein levels were detected. Interestingly, somatic CAG repeat expansion was completely abolished in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In human patients with Huntington's disease (HD), caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation, the number of uninterrupted CAG repeats at the genomic level influences age-at-onset of clinical signs independent of the number of polyglutamine repeats at the protein level. In most patients, the CAG repeat terminates with a CAA-CAG doublet. However, CAG repeat variants exist that either do not have that doublet or have two doublets. These variants consequently differ in their number of uninterrupted CAG repeats, while the number of glutamine repeats is the same as both CAA and CAG codes for glutamine. The authors first confirm that a shorter uninterrupted CAG repeat number in human HD patients is associated with developing the first clinical signs of HD later. They predict that introducing a further CAA-CAG doublet will result in years of delay of clinical onset. Based on this observation, the authors tested the hypothesis that turning CAG to CAA within a CAG repeat sequence using base editing techniques will benefit HD biology. They show that, indeed, in HD cell models (HEK293 cells expressing 16/17 CAG repeats; a single human stem cell line carrying a CAG repeat expansion in the fully penetrant range with 42 CAG repeats), their base editing strategies do induce the desired CAG-CAA conversion. The efficiency of conversion differed depending on the strategy used. In stem cells, delivery posed a problem, so to test allele specificity, the authors then used a HEK 293 cell line with 51 CAG repeats on the expanded allele. Conversion occurred in both alleles with huntingtin protein and mRNA levels; transcriptomics data was unchanged. In knock-in mice carrying 110 CAG repeats, however, base editing did not work as well for different, mainly technical, reasons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors use state-of-the-art methods and carefully and thoroughly designed experiments. The data support the conclusions drawn. This work is a very valuable translation from the insight gained from large GWAS studies into HD pathogenesis. It rightly emphasises the potential this has as a causal treatment in HD, while the authors also acknowledge important limitations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
They could dedicate a little more to discussing several of the mentioned challenges. The reader will better understand where base editing is in HD currently and what needs to be done before it can be considered a treatment option. For instance,</p>
<p>-It is important to clarify what can be gained by examining again the relationship between uninterrupted CAG repeat length and age-at-onset. Could the authors clarify why they do this and what it adds to their already published GWAS findings? What is the n of datasets?</p>
<p>
-What do they think an ideal conversion rate would be, and how that could be achieved?</p>
<p>
-Is there a dose-effect relationship for base editing, and would it be realistic to achieve the ideal conversion rate in target cells, given the difficulties described by the authors in differentiated neurons from stem cells?</p>
<p>
- The liver is a good tool for in-vivo experiments examining repeat instability in mouse models. However, the authors could comment on why they did not examine the brain.</p>
<p>
- Is there a limit to judging the effects of base editing on somatic instability with longer repeats, given the difficulties in measuring long CAG repeat expansions?</p>
<p>
- Given the methodological challenges for assessing HTT fragments, are there other ways to measure the downstream effects of base editing rather than extrapolate what it will likely be?</p>
<p>
- Sequencing errors could mask low-level, but biologically still relevant, off-target effects (such as gRNA-dependent and gRNA-independent DNA, Off-targets, RNA off-targets, bystander editing). How likely is that?</p>
<p>
- How worried are the authors about immune responses following base editing? How could this be assessed?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the paper by Choi et al., the authors aimed to develop base editing strategies to convert CAG repeats to CAA repeats in the huntingtin gene (HTT), which causes Huntington's disease (HD). They hypothesized that this conversion would delay disease onset by shortening the uninterrupted CAG repeat. Using HEK-293T cells as a model, the researchers employed cytosine base editors and guide RNAs (gRNAs) to efficiently convert CAG to CAA at various sites within the CAG repeat. No significant indels, off-target edits, transcriptome alterations, or changes in HTT protein levels were detected. Interestingly, somatic CAG repeat expansion was completely abolished in HD knock-in mice carrying CAA-interrupted repeats.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's constructive recommendations. Our genetic investigation focused on understanding observations in HD patients to develop genetic-based treatment strategies and test their feasibility. We agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of data from relevant cell types. Unfortunately, the levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion in the patient-derived neurons were modest, as described in our manuscript (approximately 2%). In addition, AAV did not produce detectable conversions in the brain of HD knock-in mice (data not shown), which was somewhat expected from the literature (PMID: 31937940). We believe some technical hurdles can be overcome by developing efficient delivery methods. Nonetheless, it will be an important follow-up study to perform preclinical studies employing optimized base editing strategies and efficient brain delivery methods to fully demonstrate the therapeutic potential of BE strategies.</p>

<p>Our strategies for converting CAG to CAA in model systems resulted in quantitative DNA modification in a population of cells. Consequently, individual cells may carry different genotypes, some harboring CAA and others CAG at the same genomic location. Therefore, using a standard genotype format for DNA to present base editing outcomes may not be ideal. Instead, we presented the resulting genotype data in a quantitative fashion to provide the percentage of conversion at each site. This approach allows for an intuitive interpretation of both the extent of repeat length reduction and the proportion of such modifications.</p>
<p>Currently, genetically precise HD mouse models with robust motor and behavioral phenotypes are unavailable. While some HD mouse models, such as the BAC and YAC models, feature pronounced behavioral phenotypes, they consist of interrupted CAG repeat sequences, making them unsuitable for base conversion studies due to their inherently short uninterrupted repeats. Although genetically precise HD knockin mouse models exist, they do not manifest motor symptom-like phenotypes. Given that CAG repeat expansion is the primary driver of the disease and knock-in mice recapitulate such phenomenon, our genetic investigation focused on assessing the effects of base conversion on CAG repeat instability in knock-in mice. However, as emphasized by the reviewer, subsequent preclinical studies to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies using mouse models harboring uninterrupted adult-onset CAG repeats and robust HD-like phenotypes remain crucial.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Published HD GWAS (PMID: 31398342) compared the onset age of duplicated interruption and loss of interruption to that of canonical repeats to determine whether uninterrupted CAG repeat or polyglutamine determines age at onset. However, GWAS findings did not quantify the magnitude of the unexplained remaining variance in age at onset in duplicated interruption and loss of interruption. Our study further investigated to gain insights into the amount of additional impact of duplicated interruption to estimate the maximum clinical benefits of base editing strategies for CAG-to-CAA conversion. Since the purpose of this genetic analysis is described in the result section already, we added the following sentence in the introduction section to bring up what is unknown.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, age at onset of loss of interruption and duplicated interruption was not fully accounted for by uninterrupted CAG repeat, suggesting additional effects of non-canonical repeats.&quot;</p>
<p>We added sample size for the least square approximation analysis in the text and corresponding figure legend. Sample sizes for molecular and animal experiments can be found in the corresponding figure legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- What do they think an ideal conversion rate would be, and how that could be achieved?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is a very important question. However, speculating the ideal conversion levels is out of the scope of this genetic investigation. A series of preclinical studies using relevant models may generate data that may shed light on the conversion rate levels that are required to produce meaningful clinical benefits. In the discussion section, we added the following sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Currently, the ideal levels of CAG-to-CAA conversion that produce significant clinical benefits are unknown. A series of preclinical studies using relevant model systems may generate data that may shed light on the optimal conversion rate levels that are required to produce significant clinical benefits.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Is there a dose-effect relationship for base editing, and would it be realistic to achieve the ideal conversion rate in target cells, given the difficulties described by the authors in differentiated neurons from stem cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observed a clear dose-response relationship between the amount of BE reagents and the levels of conversion in non-neuronal cells. Unfortunately, the conversion rate was low in neuronal cells, potentially due to limited delivery, as speculated in the result section. As described in the discussion sections, we predict that efficient delivery methods will be crucial to produce significant CAG-to-CAA conversion to achieve therapeutic benefits.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The liver is a good tool for in-vivo experiments examining repeat instability in mouse models. However, the authors could comment on why they did not examine the brain.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We focused on liver instability because of 1) the expectation that delivery/targeting efficiency is significantly lower in the brain (PMID: 31937940) and 2) shared underlying mechanisms between the brain and liver (described in the result section). The following sentence was added in the method section to provide a rationale for liver analysis.</p>
<p>&quot;Since significantly lower delivery/targeting efficiency was expected in the brain 34, we focused on analyzing liver instability.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Is there a limit to judging the effects of base editing on somatic instability with longer repeats, given the difficulties in measuring long CAG repeat expansions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Determining the levels of base conversion using sequencing technologies gets harder as repeats become longer. Fragment analysis can overcome such technical difficulty if conversion efficiency is high. As pointed out, the repeat expansion measure is also challenging because amplification is biased toward shorter alleles. However, if repeat sizes are relatively similar, the levels of repeat expansion as a function of base conversion can be determined relatively precisely without a significant bias by a standard fragment analysis approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Given the methodological challenges for assessing HTT fragments, are there other ways to measure the downstream effects of base editing rather than extrapolate what it will likely be?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies are not expected to directly generate fragments of huntingtin DNA, RNA, or protein. In contrast, immediate downstream effects of CAG-to-CAA conversion include sequence changes (DNA and RNA) and alteration of repeat instability, which are presented in the manuscript. If repeat instability is associated with HTT exon 1A fragment, base conversion strategies may indirectly alter the levels of such putative toxic species, which remains to be determined.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Sequencing errors could mask low-level, but biologically still relevant, off-target effects (such as gRNAdependent and gRNA-independent DNA, Off-targets, RNA off-targets, bystander editing). How likely is that?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that increased editing efficiency is expected to increase the levels of off-target editing. However, the field is actively developing base editors with minimal off-target effect (PMID: 35941130), which will increase the safety aspects of this technology for clinical use. We added the following sentence.  &quot;In addition, developing base editors with high level on-target gene specificity and minimal off-target effects is a critical aspect to address 100.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- How worried are the authors about immune responses following base editing? How could this be assessed?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added the following sentence in the discussion section as the reviewer raised an important safety issue.</p>
<p>&quot;Thorough assessments of immune responses against base editing strategies (e.g., development of antibody, B cell, and T cell-specific immune responses) and subsequent modification (e.g., immunosilencing) 101 will be critical to address immune response-associated safety issues of BE strategies.&quot;</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The following points could be considered to improve the overall quality of the manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) The authors mentioned that the reason for checking repeat instability in the nonneuronal cells was due to the availability of specific types of AAV; there are other subtypes of AAVs available to infect neurons and iPSCs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our pilot experiments testing several AAV serotypes in patient-derived iPSC and HD knock-in mice showed that only AAV9 converted CAG to CAA at detectable levels in the liver, not in the brain or neurons. We also speculate that difficulties in targeting the CAG repeat region due to GC-rich sequence contributed to low conversion efficiency. Therefore, subsequent optimization of base editor and delivery may improve BE strategies for HD, permitting robust conversion at the challenging locus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Despite its bold nature, minimal data in the manuscript demonstrate that this gene editing strategy is disease-modifying.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Resources required to demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies are not fully available. Especially, relevant HD mouse models that carry uninterrupted adult onset CAG repeat and that permit measuring the levels of disease-modifying are lacking, as described in our response to the second reviewer. Given that CAG repeat expansion is the primary driver of the disease, this genetic investigation focused on determining the impacts of base editing strategies on CAG repeat expansion. Still, as indicated by the reviewer, follow-up preclinical studies to evaluate the levels of disease-modifying of CAG-to-CAA conversion strategies using relevant mouse models represent important next steps.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Off-target analysis at the DNA level was limited to &quot;predicted&quot; off-target sites. What about possible translocations that can result from co-nicking on different chromosomes, as a large number of potential targets exist?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Among gRNAs we tested, we focused on gRNAs 1 and 2, which predicted small numbers of off-target. Therefore, our off-target analysis at the DNA level was focused on validating those predicted off-targets. As pointed out, thoroughly evaluating off-target effects will be necessary when candidate BE strategies take the next steps for therapeutic development.</p>
<p>Genomic translocation caused by double-strand breaks can produce negative consequences, such as cancer. Importantly, although paired nicks efficiently induced translocations, translocations were not detected when a single nick was introduced on each chromosome (PMID: 25201414). Therefore, it is predicted that BE strategies using nickase confers little risk of translocation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) For in vivo work, somatic repeat expansion was analyzed only in peripheral tissue samples. Since the main affected cellular population in HD is the brain, the outcome of this treatment on a disease-relevant organ still needs to be determined.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Challenges in delivery to the brain made us determine instability in the liver since many mechanistic components of somatic CAG repeat instability are shared between the liver and striatum, as rationalized in the manuscript. However, we agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of determining the effects of base conversion on brain instability. We added the following sentence in the method section to provide a rationale. &quot;Since significantly lower delivery/targeting efficiency was expected in brain 34, we focused on analyzing liver instability.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Throughout the manuscript, the authors apologize for techniques that do not work when workarounds seem readily apparent to an expert in the field. In its current form, the manuscript reads verbose, speculative, apologetic, and preliminary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Drug development programs that are supported by human genetics data show increased success rates in clinical trials (PMID: 26121088, 31827124, 31830040). This is why this genetic study focused on 1) investigating observations in HD subjects and 2) subsequently developing treatment strategies that are supported by patient genetics. As the first illustration of base editing in HD, the main scope of our manuscript is to justify the genetic rationale of CAG-to-CAA conversion and demonstrate the feasibility of therapeutic strategies rooted in patient genetics. As our study was not aimed at entirely demonstrating the clinical benefits of base editing strategies in HD, some of our data were based on tools and approaches that were not fully optimal. We agree with the reviewer that it will be an important next step to employ optimized approaches to evaluate the efficacy of base editing strategies in model systems. Nevertheless, our novel base conversion strategies derived from HD patient genetics represent a significant advancement as they may contribute to developing effective treatments for this devastating disorder.</p>

<p>It would make for an easier read if abbreviations were kept to a minimum.</p>

<p>As recommended, we decreased the use of abbreviations. The following has been spelled out throughout the manuscript: CR (canonical repeat), LI (loss of interruption), DI (duplicated interruption), and CBE (cytosine base editor).
