<title>Abstract</title><p>In the wild, many animals respond to cold temperatures by entering hibernation. In the clinic, controlled cooling is used in transplantation and emergency medicine. Yet, the molecular mechanisms that the cells use to survive cold remain largely unexplored. One aspect of cold adaptation is a global downregulation of protein synthesis. Studying it in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, we find that the translation of most mRNAs continues in the cold, albeit at a slower rate, and propose that cold-specific gene expression is regulated primarily at the transcription level. Moreover, we show that the transcription of some cold-induced genes reflects the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) mediated by the conserved IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway. Our results suggest that the activation of this pathway stems from cold-induced perturbations in proteins and lipids in the endoplasmic reticulum and that its activation is beneficial for cold survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One constant facet of hibernation appears to be the global reduction of protein synthesis. It is manifested, among others, by the loss of polyribosomes (aka polysomes associated with robust translation) and the inhibition of basic translation factors like eIF2α and eEF2 that are required for the initiation and elongation steps of translation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Frerichs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Knight et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Van Breukelen and Martin, 2001</xref>). Cells from non-hibernating species, including humans, also respond to cold by downregulating translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hofmann et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, numerous studies highlight the importance of cold-induced gene expression, raising questions about the mechanism facilitating the expression of specific genes against the overall reduction of protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Hibernation has been traditionally studied in non-standard animal models like squirrels, bats, or bears. Nonetheless, simple genetic models are often advantageous in dissecting complex biological phenomena. Thus, to better understand gene expression underlying cold adaptation, we employ the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>: a rapid, morphologically simple, and genetically tractable animal model. These animals thrive in temperate climates, indicating that, in the wild, they can tolerate spells of cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Frezal and Felix, 2015</xref>). In a laboratory, deep cooling of <italic>C. elegans</italic> either leads to death (when the cooling is rapid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Habacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Robinson and Powell, 2016</xref>) or to a dormant hibernation-like state (when the cooling is gradual) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Habacher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ohta et al., 2014</xref>). During “hibernation” <italic>C. elegans</italic> suppresses aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Habacher et al., 2016</xref>). Although this response and mammalian hibernation are not equivalent, some aspects appear to be conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pekec et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the advantages of a simple genetic model may be useful in uncovering conserved aspects of cellular adaptations to cold.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that <italic>C. elegans</italic>, like hibernating animals, respond to cold by globally reducing mRNA translation. Overall, the translation of individual transcripts correlates with their levels, suggesting that cold-specific gene expression is regulated primarily through transcription. We validated this hypothesis by focusing on one up-regulated gene, <italic>lips-11</italic>, which encodes a putative lipase implicated in unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). The UPR consists of three stress-sensing and transducing branches: IRE1, PEK1, and ATF6, all conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hetz et al., 2020</xref>). Once activated, the UPR restores homeostasis by various means, including by remodeling transcription and translation. We find that, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, cold activates the IRE-1 branch of the UPR. While IRE-1 signaling is induced typically in response to protein misfolding, we present evidence that, in the cold, the IRE1 pathway responds to both protein and lipid bilayer stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that its activation is beneficial for hibernating animals.</p>

<title>Protein synthesis is globally reduced in hibernating <italic>C. elegans</italic></title>
<p>In several species and cultured cells, cooling leads to a global reduction of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Frerichs et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hofmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Knight et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Van Breukelen and Martin, 2001</xref>). To test if this occurs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we used a previously described cooling paradigm and sampling across different temperatures and time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We combined this with either polysome profiling or SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET). The former method separates translated mRNAs according to the number of bound ribosomes. The latter involves the incorporation of puromycin into newly synthesized peptides and subsequent detection of the incorporated puromycin by western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arnold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). By polysome profiling, we observed in the cold a massive loss of polyribosomes (multiple ribosomes associated with mRNAs), with a concomitant increase in monosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). By SUnSET, we observed a stark drop in puromycin incorporation in hibernating animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, consistent with observations in other species, severe cooling is accompanied in <italic>C. elegans</italic> by a global reduction of protein synthesis.</p>

<title>Transcription is a major determinant of cold-specific gene expression</title>
<p>Although global translation decreases in the cold, the translation of specific transcripts still could be regulated, i.e., activated or repressed. To examine this possibility, we combined ribosomal profiling with total RNA sequencing across different temperatures and time points (<bold>Supplementary files 1 and 2</bold>). We made several observations. First, while shifting animals from 20°C to 10°C had a relatively mild impact on translation (ribosomal occupancy), the subsequent shift from 10°C to 4°C had a strong effect. Then, continuing the incubation at 4°C again had a relatively small effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A – figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, most translational remodeling occurs during the first day of incubation at 4°C. Focusing on this transition (10°C to 4°C day 1), we observed a good correlation between mRNA levels and translation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, although general protein synthesis is reduced in the cold, the available mRNAs appear to be translated. However, we did observe some exceptions, such as a group of transcripts whose translation appeared reduced with no concomitant drop in mRNA levels (red dots in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting the existence of dedicated repressive mechanism(s). Intriguingly, this group includes mRNAs encoding three fatty acid desaturases (FAT-2, -3, and -4; <bold>Supplementary file 3</bold>). This finding is surprising, because desaturation of membrane lipids has been thought to play an important role in cold adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hayward et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<p>For most transcripts, however, their translation correlates with their levels. In other words, the abundance of a particular protein appears to depend primarily on the abundance of its mRNA. Since transcription is the main determinant of mRNA levels, these results suggest that cold-specific gene expression primarily depends on transcription activation. To test this, we selected one gene, <italic>lips-11</italic>, whose expression increased the most during the shift from 10°C to 4°C (green dot in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To test if cold induces <italic>lips-11</italic> transcription, we generated a strain expressing a GFP reporter, whose expression depends on the endogenous <italic>lips-11</italic> promoter (P<italic>lips-11</italic>) and the <italic>unc-54</italic> 3’UTR (permitting unregulated expression of the attached open reading frame). We observed that the <italic>lips-11</italic> promoter was sufficient to induce GFP expression in the cold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, while we cannot exclude that cold additionally impacts the stability of some mRNAs, we propose that cold-specific gene expression is shaped mainly at the transcription level.</p>

<title>Cold-induced transcription of <italic>lips-11</italic> depends on the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR</title>
<p>Intriguingly, <italic>lips-11</italic> belongs to genes activated by the UPR during ER stress (UPR<sup>ER</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shen et al., 2005</xref>).

This observation prompted us to examine if the induction of <italic>lips-11</italic> in the cold depends on a particular branch of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> signaling; IRE-1, ATF-6, or PEK-1. Indeed, we observed reduced levels of the <italic>lips-11</italic> reporter upon RNAi-mediated depletion of <italic>ire-1</italic>, but not <italic>atf-6</italic> or <italic>pek-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, <italic>lips-11</italic> expression in the cold depends on the UPR<sup>ER</sup> signal transducer IRE-1.</p>

<p>In response to ER stress, the endoribonuclease domain of IRE-1 is activated and promotes the processing of <italic>xbp-1</italic> mRNA, which gives rise to the functional form of the XBP- 1 transcription factor. As XBP-1-independent functions of IRE-1 have been reported, we first examined if <italic>xbp-1</italic> mRNA is processed in the cold. To do this, we used a published <italic>xbp-1</italic> splicing reporter strain, wherein the <italic>xbp-1</italic> promoter drives the expression of genomic <italic>xbp-1</italic> fused to GFP, which is expressed in frame upon processing by activated IRE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ozbey et al., 2020</xref>). Importantly, we observed a significant upregulation of XBP-1::GFP in the cold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), indicating the activation of the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>. Moreover, in addition to IRE-1, the cold-induced expression of the <italic>lips-11</italic> reporter also depended on XBP-1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the upregulation of <italic>lips-11</italic> in hibernating <italic>C. elegans</italic> depends on the IRE-1/XBP-1 branch of the UPR<sup>ER</sup>.</p>

<title>Hibernation specifically activates the IRE-1 branch of the UPR<sup>ER</sup></title>
<p>The activation of IRE-1 in the cold suggests that hibernating animals experience ER stress. To confirm this, we utilized a commonly used UPR<sup>ER</sup> reporter strain, wherein GFP expression is driven by the promoter of <italic>hsp-4</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the ER chaperone BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, the expression of this reporter gradually increased in the cold (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). By following the expression of mitochondrial chaperones <italic>hsp-6</italic> (homolog of HSP70) and <italic>hsp- 60</italic> (homolog of HSP60), we additionally examined if cold elicits UPR in the mitochondria (UPR<sup>mito</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yoneda et al., 2004</xref>). However, by contrast to <italic>hsp-4</italic>, neither <italic>hsp-6</italic> nor <italic>hsp-60</italic> were induced in the cold (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A – figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, hibernating animals appear to experience stress in the ER but not mitochondria.</p>

<p>While we showed that <italic>lips-11</italic> upregulation is mediated by the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway, other branches of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> could be activated in the cold. Testing this possibility, we examined the expression of select UPR<sup>ER</sup> target genes regulated through the IRE-1 (<italic>dnj-27</italic>, <italic>srp-7</italic>, <italic>C36B7.6</italic>), the ATF-6 (<italic>cht-1</italic>, <italic>ZC168.2</italic>), or the PEK-1 (<italic>cbp-3</italic>, <italic>R02D3.8</italic>) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shen et al., 2005</xref>). While the levels of these transcripts did not change significantly after one day in the cold (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B – figure supplement 1</xref>), four transcripts were more abundant after three days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, 3/4 of them are known targets of the IRE-1 pathway. Although a more comprehensive analysis is needed to reach firm conclusions, these findings suggest that cold triggers the UPR<sup>ER</sup> primarily via the activation of IRE-1.</p>

<title>The cold-induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> stems from both protein misfolding and lipid disequilibrium</title>
<p>ER stress and subsequent activation of the UPR<sup>ER</sup> are typically associated with misfolded proteins accumulating in the ER lumen. To test if cold aggravates protein misfolding, we employed another reporter strain, wherein YFP is fused to a mutated form of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> cathepsin L-like protease (CPL-1<sup>W32A,Y35A</sup>), which does not fold properly and accumulates during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Efstathiou et al., 2022</xref>). We found that the levels of misfolded CPL-1 modestly increased after one day in the cold but then returned to basal levels after a longer cold exposure (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, disturbed ER proteostasis could, at least transiently, trigger the activation of UPR<sup>ER</sup> in hibernating animals.</p>

<p>Apart from protein misfolding, lipid disequilibrium is also known to trigger UPR<sup>ER</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Halbleib et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Tam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Volmer et al., 2013</xref>). The IRE-1 pathway is specifically activated when the ratio between phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) decreases, or when the levels of unsaturated fatty acids become insufficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ariyama et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Thibault et al., 2012</xref>). In the latter case, reduced content of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) results in a decreased ER membrane fluidity, which is thought to increase the oligomerization and thus the activation of IRE-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Halbleib et al., 2017</xref>). So, we asked next if dietary supplementation of unsaturated FAs or choline (crucial for PC synthesis) impacts the IRE-1-dependent induction of the <italic>lips-11</italic> reporter in the cold. We found that supplementing the diet with either saturated (palmitic acid) or unsaturated FAs (oleic acid or linoleic acid) did not prevent the expression of the <italic>lips-11</italic> reporter (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 – figure supplement 1</xref>; if anything, adding oleic acid appeared to upregulate the reporter). While these experiments have certain caveats (for example it is impossible to precisely control the concentration of internalized FAs), they suggest that insufficient lipid desaturation is not the main trigger of UPR<sup>ER</sup> in the cold. By contrast, the dietary supplementation of choline led to reduced expression of <italic>lips-11</italic> and <italic>hsp-4</italic> reporters in hibernating animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, respectively). Together, these experiments suggest that cold-induced activation of UPR<sup>ER</sup> could be triggered by sensing disruptions in both protein and lipid homeostasis, with the latter related to insufficient levels of PC rather than unsaturated FAs.</p>

<title>IRE-1-dependent signaling is important for cold survival</title>
<p>Cold triggers the IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling pathway, but for what purpose? If it helps animals in cold adaptation, then inhibiting this pathway may be expected to impair cold survival. At standard temperature, the loss-of-function <italic>ire-1(ok799)</italic> mutants display no obvious defects. In the cold, however, we observed that these mutants survived less well than the wild type (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Thus, IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling appears to improve cold survival, presumably by activating its downstream target(s). A natural candidate is LIPS-11, but we found that its RNAi-mediated depletion had no obvious impact on cold survival. Assuming that the RNAi was effective, it suggests that either LIPS-11 plays no role in cold survival, or it functions redundantly with other IRE-1/XBP-1 targets. Several previous studies reported IRE-1-dependent genes activated in response to protein misfolding (UPR<sup>PT</sup>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shen et al., 2005</xref>), lipid bilayer stress (UPR<sup>LBS</sup>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Koh et al., 2018</xref>), or cold when using different cooling conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dudkevich et al., 2022</xref>). To examine if these genes are also activated by cold treatment in this study, we extracted them from the publications (<bold>Supplementary file 4</bold>) and examined their overlap with the cold- induced transcripts from <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Curiously, we observed relatively little overlap between the different gene sets (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 – figure supplement 1</xref>). While the UPR<sup>PT</sup> and the UPR<sup>LBS</sup> are known to regulate largely distinct targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Koh et al., 2018</xref>), this analysis further suggests than IRE-1-mediated gene activation is largely context-dependent. Also, since many cold- induced genes from this study appear to be unrelated to the examined IRE-1 gene sets, we hypothesize that additional pathways(s) work alongside the IRE1/XBP-1 pathway to shape gene expression in the cold.</p>

<p>Summarizing our findings in a model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>), cold-induced protein and lipid stress in the ER specifically induces the IRE-1 branch of the UPR. Following the IRE-1-mediated processing of <italic>xbp-1</italic> mRNA, the XBP-1 transcription factor enters the nucleus and activates its target genes. These include <italic>lips-11</italic>, but the regulation of additional targets is necessary to explain the beneficial effect of IRE-1 on cold survival.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that <italic>C. elegans</italic> respond to severe cold by decreasing protein synthesis, consistent with observations in other models. Since translation is one of the most energy- consuming biological processes, its global reduction will help preserve cellular energy stores. In poikilotherms (animals whose body temperature depends on the environment), reducing global translation is part of their physiological response to cold. A similar situation occurs in homeotherms (animals whose temperature depends on metabolism) who are capable of temporal heterothermy, i.e., can change their body temperature in a circadian or seasonal circle. In other homeotherms (like humans), the global reduction of protein synthesis may help survive accidental hypothermia or repair peripheral cold injuries affecting the extremities and exposed skin.</p>
<p>Despite the general reduction of protein synthesis in the cold, most mRNAs continue to be translated, albeit at a lower rate. Consequently, either transcription or mRNA stability could regulate cold-specific gene expression. We present evidence that the expression of some cold-inducible genes depends on the transcription factor XBP-1, which functions downstream from IRE-1. Curiously, another cooling procedure (involving shifting animals from 15°C to 2°C) was reported to elicit IRE-1 signaling independently from XBP-1. In that case, IRE-1 activation occurs in neurons, but it stimulates the remodeling of lipid metabolism in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dudkevich et al., 2022</xref>). In that context, IRE-1 was proposed to adjust the balance between saturated and unsaturated FAs, because supplementing the diet with unsaturated FAs could bypass the requirement for IRE-1. By contrast, the IRE-1 signaling reported here depends on XBP-1, and the dietary supplementation of non-saturated FAs did not prevent the activation of IRE-1/XBP-1 signaling. This observation is consistent with a previous study, which showed that inhibiting <italic>C. elegans</italic> fatty acid desaturases has relatively little impact on <italic>C. elegans</italic> tolerance of severe cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). Combined with our observation that some FA desaturases are translationally repressed in the cold, these findings collectively suggest that desaturated FAs are not limiting in hibernating <italic>C. elegans</italic>, although the situation appears to be different when these animals are cultured at low but physiologically tolerable temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Svensk et al., 2013</xref>). Summarizing, cold seems to activate IRE-1-mediated signaling in various ways and with different outcomes, possibly influenced by the animal’s physiological state and specific cooling conditions.</p>
<p>What triggers the activation of the IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway in the cold? Using the CPL- 1<sup>W32A,</sup> <sup>Y35A</sup> protein folding sensor, we observed a transient misfolding (present at day 1, but not 3 in the cold). Since protein synthesis is strongly downregulated in the cold, the burden of misfolded proteins may decrease over time, suggesting that additional cues evoke UPR<sup>ER</sup> at later stages of hibernation. Intriguingly, the dietary supplementation of choline reduced IRE- 1-dependent expression during both early and later stages of hibernation, suggesting that alterations involving one or more choline derivatives may contribute to ER stress. Since choline is essential for PC synthesis (a critical component of biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akkers et al., 2010</xref>)), the IRE-1 pathway may monitor a PC-sensitive aspect of ER biology. For example, it could detect alterations in transmembrane channels or peripheral membrane-binding proteins, whose activities depend on the physical properties of membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Allende et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Janmey and Kinnunen, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, while the activation of IRE-1-dependent signaling appears to be an important aspect of <italic>C. elegans</italic> responses to cold, is it also used in other animals? There is emerging evidence suggesting that it could be so. In culture, human neurons exposed to moderate hypothermia activate the ER stress response and induce all three branches of the UPR, including the IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Rzechorzek et al., 2016</xref>). Whether this holds <italic>in vivo</italic> and applies to deep hypothermia remains to be tested. Nonetheless, the same study suggested that cooling- induced UPR<sup>ER</sup> may be neuroprotective, potentially helping understand the cellular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic benefits of hypothermia. In the clinic, organ cooling is used in transplantation, and therapeutic hypothermia is applied, among others, in stroke or trauma, helping preserve the functions of key organs like the brain or heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kutcher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yenari and Han, 2012</xref>). Therefore, understanding how cold elicits UPR<sup>ER</sup> may help in discovering interventions mimicking the beneficial effects of cold, but at a thermoneutral temperature. Such preconditioning could be administered to individuals at risk of accidental hypothermia or patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, aimed at minimizing potential injuries and enhancing recovery.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Engelfriet et.al. addresses an interesting question in animal physiology - how do animals adapt to cold. Using polysome profiling and puromycin labeling, the authors confirm that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> exposed to a cooling regimen, protein synthesis is decreased globally. They then use RNAseq and ribosome profiling to propose that this decrease is driven mainly by decreased transcription, while translation of most mRNAs continues in the cold at a slower rate. They also find many transcripts whose expression is increased in the cold, and suggest that transcription of some of the cold-induced genes reflects activation of the IRE-1/XBP-1 UPR pathway. The authors further suggest that activation of the UPR by cold is due to cold-induced protein misfolding and perturbations in lipids in the ER, and that UPR activation is beneficial for cold survival.</p>
<p>The finding that a decrease in protein synthesis that is characteristic of cold exposure and hibernation is driven primarily by changes in transcription rather than translation is quite interesting and different from findings in other studies. It would be important to understand the reason for this difference. The findings that some of the cold-induced transcription in worms reflects XBP-1-dependent activity of IRE-1 is also new, while UPR activation by lipid perturbations both agrees with previous observations but also exposes differences. The differences highlight the need for better understanding of how different temperature exposures affect different lipids, as cold adaptation is widespread in nature, and cooling is often used in the clinical settings.</p>
<p>However, some concerns with interpretations and technical issues make several major conclusions in this manuscript less rigorous, as explained in detail in comments below. In particular, the two major concerns I have: 1) the contradiction between the strong reduction of global translation, with puromycin incorporation gel showing no detectable protein synthesis in cold, and an apparently large fraction of transcripts whose abundance and translation in Fig. 2A are both strongly increased. 2) The fact that no transcripts were examined for dependance on IRE-1/XBP-1 for their induction by cold, except for one transcriptional reporter, and some weaknesses (see below) in data showing activation of IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway. The conclusion for induction of UPR by cold via specific activation of IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway, in my opinion, requires additional experiments.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) Fig. 1B shows polysomes still present on day 1 of 4{degree sign}C exposure, but the gel in Fig. 1C suggests a complete lack of protein synthesis. Why? What is then the evidence that ribosomal footprints used in much of the paper as evidence of ongoing active translation are from actual translating rather than still bound to transcripts but stationary ribosomes, considering that cooling to 4{degree sign}C is often used to 'freeze' protein complexes and prevent separation of their subunits? The authors should explain whether ribosome profiling as a measure of active translation has been evaluated specifically at 4{degree sign}C, or test this experimentally. They should also provide some evidence (like Western blots) of increases in protein levels for at least some of the strongly cold-upregulated transcripts, like lips-11.</p>
<p>As puromycin incorporation seems to be the one direct measure of global protein synthesis here, it conflicts with much of the translation data, especially considering that quite a large fraction of transcripts have increased both mRNA levels and ribosome footprints, and thus presumably increased translation at 4{degree sign}C, in Fig. 2A.</p>
<p>Also, it is not clear how quantitation in Fig. 1C relates to the gel shown, the quantitation seems to indicate about 50-60% reduction of the signal, while the gel shows no discernable signal.</p>
<p>(2) It is striking that plips-11::GFP reporter is induced in day 1 of 4{degree sign}C exposure, apparently to the extent that is similar to its induction by a large dose of tunicamycin (Fig. 3 supplement), but the three IRE-1 dependent UPR transcripts from Shen 2005 list were not induced at all on day 1(Fig. 4 supplement). Moreover, the accumulation of the misfolded CPL-1 reporter, that was interpreted as evidence that misfolding may be triggering UPR at 4{degree sign}C, was only observed on day 1, when the induction of the three IRE-1 targets is absent, but not on day 3, when it is stronger. How does this agree with the conclusion of UPR activation by cold via IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway? It is true that the authors do note very little overlap between IRE-1/XBP-1-dependent genes induced by different stress conditions, but for most of this paper, they draw parallels between tunicamycin-induced and cold-induced IRE-1/XBP-1 activation.</p>
<p>The conclusion that &quot;the transcription of some cold-induced genes reflects the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR)...&quot; is based on analysis of only one gene, lips-11. No other genes were examined for IRE-1 dependence of their induction by cold, neither the other 8 genes that are common between the cold-induced genes here and the ER stress/IRE-1-induced in Shen 2005 (Venn diagram in Figure 7 supplement), nor the hsp-4 reporter. What is the evidence that lips-11 is not the only gene whose induction by cold in this paper's dataset depends on IRE-1? This is a major weakness and needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whether induction by cold of lips-11 itself is due to IRE1 activation was not tested, only a partial decrease of reporter fluorescence by ire-1 RNAi is shown. A quantitative measure of the change of lips-11 transcript in ire-1 and xbp-1 mutants is needed to establish if it depends on IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway.</p>
<p>The authors could provide more information and the additional data for the transcripts upregulated by both ER stress and cold, including the endogenous lips-11 and hsp-4 transcripts: their identity, fold induction by both cold and ER stress, how their induction is ranked in the corresponding datasets (all of these are from existing data), and do they depend on IRE-1/XBP-1 for induction by cold? Without these additional data, and considering that the authors did not directly measure the splicing of xbp-1 transcript (see comment for Fig. 3 below), the conclusion that cold induces UPR by specific activation of IRE-1/XBP-1 pathway is premature.</p>
<p>There are also technical issues that are making it difficult to interpret some of the results, and missing controls that decrease the rigor of conclusions:</p>
<p>(1) For RNAseq and ribosome occupancy, were the 20{degree sign}C day 1 adult animals collected at the same time as the other set was moved to 4{degree sign}C, or were they additionally grown at 20{degree sign}C for the same length of time as the 4{degree sign}C incubations, which would make them day 2 adults or older at the time of analysis? This information is only given for SUnSET: &quot;animals were cultivated for 1 or 3 additional days at 4{degree sign}C or 20{degree sign}C&quot;. This could be a major concern in interpreting translation data: First, the inducibility of both UPR and HSR in worms is lost at exactly this transition, from day 1 to day 2 or 3 adults, depending on the reporting lab (for example Taylor and Dillin 2013, Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015, De-Souza et al 2022). How do authors account for this? Would results with reporter induction, or induction of IRE-1 target genes in Fig. 4, change if day 1 adults were used for 20{degree sign}C?</p>
<p>Second, if animals at the time of shift to 4{degree sign}C were only beginning their reproduction, they will presumably not develop further during hibernation, while an additional day at 20{degree sign}C will bring them to the full reproductive capacity. Did 4{degree sign}C and 20{degree sign}C animals used for RNAseq and ribosome occupancy have similar numbers of embryos, and were the embryos at similar stages? If embryos were retained in one condition vs the other, how much would they contribute in terms of transcripts, and do the authors expect the same adaptive programs operating in embryos and in the adults?</p>
<p>(2) Second, no population density is given for most of the experiments, despite the known strong effects of crowding (high pheromone) on C. elegans growth. From the only two specifics that are given, it seems that very different population sizes were used: for example, 150 L1s were used in survival assay, while 12,000 L1s in SUnSET. Have the authors compared results they got at high population densities with what would happen when animals are grown in uncrowded plates? At least a baseline comparison in the beginning should have been done.</p>
<p>(3) Fig. 3: it is unclear why the accepted and well characterized quantitative measure of IRE1 activation, the splicing of xbp-1transcript, is not determined directly by RT-PCR. The fluorescent XBP-1spliced reporter, to my knowledge, has not been tested for its quantitative nature and thus its use here is insufficient.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the image of this fluorescent reporter in Fig. 3b shows only one anterior-most row of cells of intestine, and quantitation was done with 2 to 5 nuclei per animal, while lips-11 is induced in entire intestine. Was there spliced XBP-1 in the rest of the intestinal nuclei? Could the authors show/quantify the entire animal (20 intestinal cells) rather than one or two rows of cells?</p>
<p>(4) The differences in the outcomes from this study and the previous one (Dudkevich 2022) that used 15{degree sign}C to 2{degree sign}C cooling approach are puzzling, as they would suggest two quite different IRE-1 dependent programs of cold tolerance. It would be good if authors commented on overlapping/non-overlapping genes, and provided their thoughts on the origin of these differences considering the small difference in temperatures. Second, have the authors performed a control where they reproduced the rescue by FA supplementation of poor survival of ire-1 mutants after the 15{degree sign}C to 2{degree sign}C shift?</p>
<p>Without this or another positive control, and without measuring change in lipid composition in their own experiments, it is unclear whether the different outcomes with respect to FAs are due to a real difference in adaptive programs at these temperatures, or to failure in supplementation?</p>
<p>(5) Have the authors tested whether and by how much ire-1(ok799) mutation shortens the lifespan at 20{degree sign}C? This needs to be done before the defect in survival of ire-1 mutants in Fig. 7a can be interpreted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates cold induced states in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, using polysome profiling and RNA seq to identify genes that are differentially regulated and concluding that cold-specific gene regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. This study also includes analysis of one gene from the differentially regulated set, lips-11 (a lipase), and finds that it is regulated in response to a specific set of ER stress factors.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Understanding how environmental conditions are linked to stress pathways is generally interesting.</p>
<p>(2) The study used well-established genetic tools to analyze ER stress pathways.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The conclusions regarding a general transcriptional response are based on one gene, lips-11, which does not affect survival in response to cold. We would suggest altering the title, to replace &quot;Reprograming gene expression: with&quot; Regulation of the lipase lips-11&quot;.</p>
<p>(2) There is no gene ontology with the gene expression data.</p>
<p>(3) Definitive conclusions regarding transcription vs translational effects would require use of blockers such as alpha amanatin or cyclohexamide.</p>
<p>(4) Conclusions regarding the role of lipids are based on supplementation with oleic acid or choline, yet there is no lipid analysis of the cold animals, or after lips-1 knockdown. Although choline is important for PC production, adding choline in normal PC could have many other metabolic impacts and doesn't necessarily implicate PC with out lipidomic or genetic evidence.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors sought to understand the molecular mechanisms that cells use to survive cold temperatures by studying gene expression regulation in response to cold in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They determined whether gene expression changes during cold adaptation occur primarily at the transcriptional level and identified specific pathways, such as the unfolded protein response pathway, that are activated to possibly promote survival under cold conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Effective use of bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to measure transcript abundance and ribosome profiling (ribo-seq) to assess translation rates, providing a comprehensive view of gene expression regulation during cold adaptation. This combined approach allows for correlation between mRNA levels and their translation, thereby offering evidence for the authors' conclusion that transcriptional regulation is the primary mechanism of cold-specific gene expression changes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study has several weaknesses: it provides limited novel insights into pathways mediating transcriptional regulation of cold-inducible genes, as IRE-1 and XBP-1 are already well-known responders to endoplasmic reticulum stress, including that induced by cold. Additionally, the weak cold sensitivity phenotype observed in ire-1 mutants casts doubt on the pathway's key role in cold adaptation. The study also overlooks previous research (e.g. PMID: 27540856) that links IRE-1 to SKN-1, another major stress-responsive pathway, potentially missing important interactions and mechanisms involved in cold adaptation.</p>
