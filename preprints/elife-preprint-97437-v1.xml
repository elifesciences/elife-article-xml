<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The ability to analyse the function of all genes in a genome has obvious appeal. However, this has been challenging in <italic>Leishmania</italic> due to a repetitive genome architecture, limited DNA repair mechanisms and the absence of RNA interference machinery in most species. While our previous introduction of a cytosine base editor (CBE) tool in <italic>Leishmania</italic> showcased the potential for bypassing these limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke (2023)</xref>), challenges remained in achieving high transfection efficiencies, overcoming species-specific editing rates, minimizing effects on parasite growth and eliminating competition between deleterious and non-deleterious mutations. Here, we present an optimized approach to address these limitations. Firstly, we identified a T7 RNAP promoter variant that ensures high editing rates across <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without adversely affecting parasite growth. Secondly, we adjusted the scoring of CBE single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to prioritize those ensuring STOP codon generation. Thirdly, we developed a triple-expression construct enabling the integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into a <italic>Leishmania</italic> safe harbor locus via AsCas12a ultra-mediated DNA double-strand breaks. This facilitates the generation of stable CBE sgRNA expression cell lines and increases transfection rates by ∼400-fold, resulting in up to one transfectant per 70 transfected cells. Lastly, we show how the co-expression of AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP and CBE can be utilized for hybrid CRISPR gene replacement and base editing approaches in the same cell line. Overall, we believe that these improvements will broaden the range of possible gene editing applications in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species and will enable a variety of loss-of-function screens in the future.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing has greatly improved loss-of-function experiments in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, and bar-seq screens have facilitated the functional dissection of large gene cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beneke and Gluenz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burge et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Damianou et al., 2020</xref>). However, the applications of bar-seq screens are limited, and it remains difficult to target the vast <italic>Leishmania</italic> repertoire of repetitive genetic elements by gene replacement approaches. In addition, <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites lack crucial components of the non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Passos-Silva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, CRISPR-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) lead to unpredictable DNA deletions, increased cell death during DNA repair failures, prolonged repair times and generally low editing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang and Matlashewski, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Without other means of selection, such as the selection of drug resistance-associated edits, this complicates further the targeting of dispersed multi-copy genes and applications of pooled CRISPR transfection formats. While RNA interference (RNAi) could offer an alternative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Paiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lye et al., 2022</xref>), its use is confined to species within the <italic>Viannia</italic> subgenus, restricting its applicability in the majority of <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lye et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ullu et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>We have recently shown how the use of the hyBE4max cytosine base editor (CBE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) could potentially overcome these limitations. We demonstrated how the conversion of cytosine to thymine, and thereby the introduction of STOP codons, enables the functional disruption of single- and multi-copy genes in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without requiring DSB, homologous recombination (HR), the additional use of donor DNA, or isolation of clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Importantly, we presented how this method can be used to identify essential genes in pooled loss-of-function screens via the delivery of plasmid libraries, thereby providing a proof-of-principle experiment for how large-scale pooled CRISPR transfection fitness screens could be carried out in <italic>Leishmania</italic>. However, we also highlighted the need for additional improvements of our method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, since we used a ribosomal promoter derived from <italic>L. donovani</italic> for expression of the CBE and single guide RNA (sgRNA), editing efficiencies varied greatly between species, and for some <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, sufficient editing could be only achieved after weeks in culture. Our attempts to use different promoters, such as the T7 RNA Polymerase (RNAP) promoter were unsuccessful, as their employment for CBE sgRNA expression resulted in strong growth defects. Furthermore, the transfection of pooled plasmid libraries led to combinatorial knockout effects, with about 38% of all transfectants harbouring more than one CBE-sgRNA expression plasmid. In addition, the transfection efficiency of plasmid pools was generally low, yielding only ∼1 transfectant out of 30,000 transfected cells. To compensate for combinatorial effects and the relatively low transfection rate, a large number of cells would need to be transfected to enable large-scale pooled CRISPR transfection screens. Lastly, we noticed that non-deleterious mutations within the CBE editing window can become dominant over desired mutations, especially when targeting essential or growth-affecting genes.</p>
<p>Here, we aimed to develop our base editing approach further and deliver needed improvements. We show how we have identified a T7 RNAP promoter variant that enables stable expression of CBE sgRNAs and results in high editing rates within a short period of time without having significant effects on parasite growth. In addition, we present a construct that allows to express not only T7 RNAP and the hyBE4max CBE but also a highly efficient variant of a Cas12a nuclease derived from <italic>Acidaminococcus sp.</italic> (AsCas12a ultra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), formerly AsCpf1). Using AsCas12a ultra-mediated DSBs, we have developed a novel approach to deliver and integrate CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the <italic>Leishmania</italic> 18S rRNA safe harbor locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Misslitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sorensen et al., 2003</xref>). We demonstrate how this has allowed to increase transfection rates by up to 400-fold. In a final optimisation step, we have also improved our CBE sgRNA design and scoring tool <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net">www.leishbaseedit.net</ext-link> to select CBE sgRNAs that have fewer possibilities in generating edits that do not result in a STOP codon. We believe that these optimisation steps now enable us to deliver a range of gene editing applications, including large-scale loss-of-function screens, in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species without limitations due to extreme cases of gene copy numbers, aneuploidy and/or lack of RNAi components.</p>

<title>T7 RNAP promoter variant-driven CBE sgRNA expression reduces toxicity and improves editing efficiency</title>
<p>In our first version of a CBE toolbox for <italic>Leishmania</italic> we utilized a ribosomal promoter derived from <italic>L. donovani</italic> for CBE protein and sgRNA expression. While achieving high editing rates with this single plasmid system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), efficiencies varied greatly among species, requiring for example over 40 days of incubation to reach significant editing in <italic>L. major</italic> parasites. We previously attempted to minimize these species-specific variations by segregating the CBE expression from the CBE sgRNA cassette in a dual construct system and by employing a T7 RNAP promoter for CBE sgRNA expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, upon transfection of CBE sgRNA expression constructs into <italic>L. major</italic> T7 RNAP- and CBE-expressing parasites, the doubling time increased from 7 to about 14 hours, highlighting a significant growth defect through T7 RNAP-driven CBE sgRNA expression. On the contrary, we observed higher editing rates in a shorter period of time compared to our approach with the single plasmid ribosomal promoter system, indicating potential advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>Here, our first aim was to eliminate this growth defect observed in the dual construct system while maintaining high editing rates. Assuming that the growth defect resulted from excessive CBE sgRNA expression, we wondered whether modifying the T7 RNAP promoter sequence and altering the transcription initiation site could alleviate the observed toxicity. We therefore introduced a variety of CBE sgRNA expression plasmids into our previously established <italic>L. major</italic> cell line, expressing CBE and T7 RNAP from the β-tubulin locus, as well as tdTomato from the 18S rRNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To drive CBE sgRNA expression, we thereby utilized two T7 RNAP promoter variants (T7 T-10 and T7 G-10), known for their ability to reduce transcription activity in the closely related parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wirtz et al., 1998</xref>). We also manipulated the transcription initiation site by altering the number of guanines (either two or one guanines), a factor believed to impact transcription yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Padmanabhan et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, we compared CBE sgRNA expression via T7 RNAP promoters with the ribosomal promoter derived from <italic>L. donovani</italic>, either in a single or dual construct system setup. For our measurements, we transfected CBE sgRNA expression plasmids with two tdTomato-targeting CBE sgRNAs. While the ‘target’ CBE sgRNA was designed to yield an early STOP codon through C to T conversion, the ‘control’ CBE sgRNA was designed to induce a C to T conversion that results in a neutral substitution (codon change but no amino acid change). Following transfection, we then analysed growth rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) and tdTomato reporter signals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). Our aim was to identify the promoter variant with the highest activity and least toxicity.</p>

A stable <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell line maintains plasmid pTB107 as an episome and is co-transfected with a donor DNA reporter construct and a Cas12a crRNA template DNA. Using a T7 RNAP promoter, the Cas12a crRNA template DNA is <italic>in vivo</italic> transcribed to facilitate a Cas12a-mediated DSB at the 18S rRNA SSU locus. Using homology flanks the reporter construct is efficiently integrated at the site of the DSB. Plasmid pTB107 thereby allows for the expression of hyBE4max CBE, AsCas12a ultra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), T7 RNAP and hygromycin resistance marker. AsCas12a ultra and T7 RNAP are expressed as a fusion protein but then cleaved through a P2A self-cleaving peptide.

<p>As anticipated, when utilizing the ribosomal promoter for CBE sgRNA expression, the dual construct system resulted in a more significant reduction of the tdTomato reporter signal compared to the single plasmid system. The complete knockdown of the tdTomato reporter was also achieved using all T7 RNAP promoter variants with the dual construct system. While there were no detectable differences in these knockdown efficiencies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">F</xref>), there were notable variations in the growth rates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with our prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), cells transfected with constructs containing the unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence (T7 wt GG in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) exhibited an almost two-fold increase in doubling time. On the contrary, employing for CBE sgRNA expression the T7 T10 GG, T7 G10 GG and ribosomal promoter resulted in no significant growth rate increase. The doubling times here ranged from 7.5 to 8.1 hours. While this aligned with measurements obtained for cells transfected with our single plasmid system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), the complete knockdown of the tdTomato reporter was much more rapid using any dual construct system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Specifically, the complete depletion of the tdTomato reporter signal was achieved in just seven days (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) compared to 33 days when using the same CBE sgRNA in <italic>L. major</italic> parasites previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). This demonstrates a major improvement in our method to generate loss-of-function mutants in non-clonal populations.</p>

<title>DSBs introduced by AsCas12a ultra increase integration rates of donor DNA constructs</title>
<p>Having successfully improved editing efficiencies, while at the same time reducing the toxicity of CBE sgRNA expression and targeting, we next attempted to increase transfection rates of the CBE sgRNA expression constructs. Previously, we have shown that ∼30,000 <italic>L. mexicana</italic> wildtype cells need to be transfected with our single plasmid system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) to obtain one transfectant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Since genomic dropout screens need to be performed at a high representation of about 500 cells per sgRNA construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yau and Rana, 2018</xref>), this relatively low transfection rate would make any large-scale screen challenging. In addition, we wanted to enable screening of base editor libraries over long periods and in complex environments, such as <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, without risking that parasites would lose their CBE sgRNA plasmid, vary their plasmid copy number or transfer plasmids between cells. Therefore, we wanted to integrate CBE sgRNA expression constructs into a safe harbor locus. Strategies to increase transfection rates and stably integrate expression cassettes by homologous recombination have been previously developed in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Here, the use of an I-SceI mega- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>) or zinc finger- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schumann et al., 2017</xref>) nuclease-induced DSB at a safe harbor locus has been shown to increase the transfection efficiency for the integration of RNAi expression constructs significantly. In combination with improved transfection protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burkard et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>), this has enabled RNAi loss-of-function screens on a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Glover et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schumann Burkard et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, it has been shown in <italic>Leishmania</italic> that CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSBs can increase the rate of correct donor DNA integration, regardless of homology flank length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>To develop a strategy for stable integration of CBE sgRNA expression constructs in <italic>Leishmania</italic> species, we decided to employ a Cas12a nuclease variant from <italic>Acidaminococcus</italic> species. Specifically, we generated an expression construct (pTB107) to co-express in <italic>Leishmania</italic> the AsCas12a ultra variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), a T7 RNAP and the hyBE4max CBE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The use of AsCas12a ultra had several advantages compared to other approaches mentioned above. Firstly, compared to the use of I-SceI meganuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>), it allowed us to select any TTTV-PAM containing locus of interest to insert our CBE sgRNA expression construct, simply by just changing the Cas12a crRNA sequence. Secondly, Cas12a editing – just like any CRISPR strategy – is much simpler to design than a zinc-finger nuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schumann et al., 2017</xref>) or TALENs approach. Thirdly, compared to a functional SpCas9 nuclease, there was no risk of interference between the Cas9 base editor and Cas9 nuclease sgRNAs. Finally, since AsCas12a has an intrinsic RNase activity that allows processing of its own crRNA array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Paul and Montoya, 2020</xref>), multiplexing of guide sequences is possible, which could expand the scope of standard CRISPR knockin and knockout approaches in <italic>Leishmania</italic> in future studies. Ultimately, we figured that the co-expression of the AsCas12a ultra nuclease, a T7 RNAP and the CBE would generate a hybrid gene editing toolbox that has many possible applications.</p>
<p>To introduce AsCas12a-mediated DSBs, we decided to adapt the LeishGEdit approach, which was previously developed for delivering Cas9 sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beneke and Gluenz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, we designed two overlapping oligos capable of being mutually amplified, generating a Cas12a crRNA template DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). This resulting template featured an unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence, facilitating the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription of the Cas12a crRNA. To ensure high binding affinity of AsCas12a with its Cas12a crRNA, we used an optimized direct repeat (DR) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">DeWeirdt et al. (2021)</xref>. Subsequently, this enabled AsCas12a ultra-mediated DSBs for donor DNA integration. To test this approach, we utilized a donor DNA construct containing mNeonGreen (mNG) as a reporter and blasticidin as a resistance marker, allowing for a relatively straightforward assessment of integration accuracy and transfection rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, we varied the length of homology flanks to investigate whether Cas12a-mediated integration of donor DNA remained independent of homology flank length, as previously observed with Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). Using homology flanks routinely used for integration into the 18S rRNA safe harbor locus of various <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Misslitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sorensen et al., 2003</xref>), we then designed one Cas12a crRNA targeting the 200bp region between both homology regions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 S1A</xref>). To evaluate if Cas12a could enhance the transfection rate, we compared transfections of these reporter constructs with and without the addition of Cas12a crRNA.</p>
<p>Like findings with Cas9, we observed that Cas12a-induced DSBs in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> increased the rate of correct donor DNA integration, irrespective of homology flank length. Integration of reporter constructs with 600 nt homology flanks showed no difference in reporter signal (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), but the addition of Cas12a crRNA boosted transfection efficiency by approximately 25-fold when assessing blasticidin-resistance rates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). When reducing homology flank length to 60 nt, we observed no impact on the reporter signal or transfection rate when Cas12a crRNA was present during transfections. However, in the absence of Cas12a crRNA, no transfectants were obtained, confirming that homologous recombination of the reporter is only independent of homology flank length if a Cas12a-mediated DSB has occurred. Further reducing the homology flank length to 30 nt did not significantly decrease transfection efficiency, but the percentage of mNG positive cells decreased from ∼99% in all other samples to 96.7% (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Conversely, Sanger sequencing off all integration sites indicated flawless recombination for all constructs (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 S1A, B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Interestingly, diversity in the reporter signal was also noted when transfecting the mNG construct as an episome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), possibly pointing towards plasmid copy number variants between transfected cells. In addition, episomal transfections using the same number of DNA molecules resulted in a significantly lower number of transfectants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), concluding the advantages of integrating expression constructs via Cas12a-mediated DSBs.</p>
<p>We then wondered whether employing different Cas12a crRNAs could enhance the transfection efficiency even further. Three additional Cas12a crRNAs within the 18S rRNA SSU locus were selected for testing (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 S1D</xref>). In addition, we sought to examine the integration into a “landing-pad”, such as a previously introduced resistance marker. We expected that this would further increase the accuracy and efficiency of the transfection. We therefore decided to test our system in a tdTomato-expressing <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>) and designed two Cas12a crRNAs to integrate mNG-blasticidin donor DNA constructs within their neomycin-resistance marker (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 S1D</xref>). Given that 60 nt homology flank length was sufficient for accurate and efficient integration of donor DNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">D</xref>), we decided to test all six Cas12a crRNAs in combination with donor DNA constructs containing 60nt homology flanks. This meant that homology flanks could be easily adapted through long-primer PCR without the need for bacterial cloning.</p>
<p>Across all six Cas12a crRNAs tested, no significant changes in the proportion of mNG-expressing cells were observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). However, there was a substantial variation in the rate of blasticidin-resistant cells, indicative of Cas12a crRNA efficiency (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). For Cas12a crRNA-1, we confirmed our previous results, yielding one transfectant per ∼8,500 transfected cells. However, other Cas12a crRNAs, particularly Cas12a crRNA-4, performed significantly better, resulting in one transfectant out of approximately 2,300 transfected cells. Interestingly, despite being only 44bp upstream of Cas12a crRNA-4, Cas12a crRNA-3 exhibited a 500-fold lower integration efficiency. Surprisingly, both neomycin-targeting Cas12a crRNAs were less efficient than the majority of 18S rRNA SSU locus-targeting guides (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Given the exceptional efficiency of Cas12a crRNA-4, we verified the integration of donor DNA at its site through Sanger sequencing, confirming flawless integration (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 S1D, E</xref>, and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>).</p>

<title>Integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes via AsCas12a ultra-introduced DSBs increase editing rates</title>
<p>After successfully validating our here developed AsCas12a ultra-mediated integration system, we then decided to combine our Cas12a knock-in system with our optimized CBE sgRNA expression cassette (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For this purpose, we developed two CBE sgRNA expression plasmids, namely pTB104 and pTB105, each incorporating a puromycin-resistance marker and the most effective T7 RNAP promoter variant (T7 T10 GG) for CBE sgRNA expression (as identified in assays above; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C, D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). While pTB104 featured 350 nt homology flanks adjacent to the neomycin-targeting Cas12a crRNA-6, pTB105 included 350 nt homology flanks adjacent to our best-performing Cas12a crRNA-4, targeting the 18S rRNA SSU locus. This design allowed for the integration of both CBE sgRNA expression cassettes with and without the addition of Cas12a crRNAs. To assess if such a system could effectively generate a functional null mutant through cytosine-to-thymine conversion, we chose to target tdTomato again and tested a tdTomato-targeting CBE sgRNA in <italic>L. donovani</italic>, <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, and <italic>L. major</italic>. Parasites expressed tdTomato, along with the CBE, Cas12a ultra, and T7 RNAP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, we investigated whether the efficiency of the tdTomato knockdown would be influenced by how the CBE sgRNA expression cassette was integrated. We therefore compared Cas12a crRNA-4 and 6 in combination with 60 and 350 nt homology flanks.</p>

</fig>
<p>Strikingly, we observed a complete depletion of the tdTomato signal just 7 days post transfection in all tested species when integrating CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the 18S rRNA SSU locus. This occurred irrespective of homology flank length. However, integrating cassettes into the neomycin resistance marker resulted in only partial tdTomato knockdowns in <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic>, while a complete knockdown could again be achieved in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>. Although we have not further investigated the cause for this, we assume that either the low efficiency of Cas12a crRNA-6 or the number of tdTomato-neomycin-expression cassettes caused this discrepancy. Overall, this highlights that integrating CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the 18S rRNA SSU locus using Cas12a crRNA-4 in combination with plasmid pTB105 would yield the highest CBE sgRNA editing efficiency. We therefore tested next the transfection rate of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes using Cas12a crRNA-4 for integration in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic>. We reached high transfection efficiencies, yielding up to one transfectant out of ∼470 transfected <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites, with <italic>L. donovani</italic> being the most and <italic>L. major</italic> being the least efficient (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel).</p>
<p>We then wondered whether we could increase the transfection efficiency even further by using the Lonza Nucleofector technology. Previous studies in <italic>T. brucei</italic> demonstrated that the improved transfection rate achieved through I-SceI meganuclease-mediated cleavage could be further increased when combined with the Lonza Nucleofector technology, resulting in up to one transfectant per 100 transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Glover and Horn, 2009</xref>). Considering this, we explored whether this approach would be as effective in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites. We therefore conducted a site-by-site comparison of the transfection efficiency between the Lonza Nucleofector Basic Parasite kit and the <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>-optimized buffer (Tb-BSF buffer, see method section for further details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schumann Burkard et al., 2011</xref>), both in combination with an Amaxa Nucleofector 2b electroporator. To increase the number of parasites per transfection even further, we compared our standard transfection protocol using 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells per transfection with up-scaled transfection formats involving 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells and 2.5×10<sup>8</sup> cells per electroporation. Testing these conditions in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, we confirmed that the Lonza Nucleofector technology could indeed boost transfection efficiency by an additional 20-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). When transfecting 1×10<sup>8</sup> cells per transfection with 10 µg of PacI-linearized pTB105 plasmid DNA, we achieved up to one transfectant out of 70 transfected cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, right panel). This represents a more than 400-fold increase in transfection efficiency compared to our previous rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Moreover, it demonstrates that a CBE sgRNA library with 40,000 constructs could be transfected at a representation rate of 500-fold using just 20×10<sup>8</sup> cells across 20 transfection cuvettes. Ensuring a 500-fold library representation represents a substantial improvement compared to previous RNAi screens in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, where screens typically achieved about 5-9-fold library representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Glover et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Horn, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Morris et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Schumann Burkard et al., 2011</xref>). This high representation rate is considered crucial for large-scale dropout screens, as it can affect hit identification by minimizing variations between replicates. However, it’s worth noting that drug resistance screens can also be conducted at much lower coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yau and Rana, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>While the significantly enhanced transfection rates are a central aspect of our improved base editing method presented here, it is crucial to emphasize that these improvements were achieved without impacting parasite growth. Through an assessment of doubling times in transfected and parental cell lines, we confirmed that the expression of CBE, T7 RNAP, AsCas12a ultra, and the CBE sgRNA had minimal or no impact on parasite growth across all three species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This marks a substantial improvement, considering that the expression of CBE and/or CBE sgRNA in our first toolbox version, using the pLdCH-hyBEmax plasmid, could lead to significant growth defects in some <italic>Leishmania</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Having established this optimised system, we next decided to target PF16, a gene encoding a central pair protein of the axoneme that has been demonstrated to be essential for <italic>Leishmania</italic> flagellar motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martel et al., 2017</xref>). For our test, we chose to utilize a previously employed PF16-targeting CBE sgRNA, namely PF16-3. This specific CBE sgRNA induces paralysis in <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites by introducing a thymidine homo-polymer (“TTTTT”) within the PF16 coding sequence. While our usual design for CBE sgRNAs aims to introduce STOP codons through cytosine-to-thymine conversion, we selected PF16-3 for this test because its editing activities are known to vary across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). In earlier attempts, we had to express CBE sgRNA PF16-3 for 42 days to achieve sufficient editing in <italic>L. major</italic> when using our pLdCH-hyBE4max single vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Meanwhile, in <italic>L. donovani</italic>, high editing rates were already achieved 14 days post transfection. Now, we expected that editing rates had improved uniformly across all species.</p>
<p>As anticipated, we observed a significant increase in editing activity in <italic>L. major</italic> parasites. Just 14 days post transfection, we found that the homo-polymer had been fully introduced when using our T7 RNAP promoter-based dual vector system, while no editing could be observed using the ribosomal promoter single vector system at this time point (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, <italic>L. major</italic> panel). This was also reflected in the analysis of mutant swimming speed, revealing clear motility defects in respective transfectants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <italic>L. major</italic> panel).</p>
<p>We next proceeded to test our optimized system also in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic> parasites, once again employing Cas12a for integration of the CBE sgRNA expression construct. However, here we chose to target PF16 in two cell lines: (i) one that possessed the pTB107 construct and a tdTomato reporter, and (ii) one that possessed the pTB107 construct only (WT pTB107). Additionally, we took this opportunity to compare motility and CBE editing rates in cells that had been transfected with Cas12a crRNAs that target the neomycin-resistance marker (Cas12a crRNA-6) and the 18S rRNA SSU locus (Cas12a crRNA-4).</p>
<p>Our results clearly showed that just 6 days post transfection, the PF16 target site was fully edited, and the overwhelming majority of all cells were paralyzed in all tested scenarios (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). However, surprisingly editing slowly reversed in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cells harboring the pTB107 construct only (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). Although we decided not to further investigate the reason for this unexpected result, we assumed that it might be caused by a small proportion of cells where the CBE sgRNA expression cassette was incorrectly integrated. Since the PF16 mutation in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> is known to be associated with a mild growth defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>), PF16-deficient mutants would eventually be outcompeted over time, leading to the reversal of editing rates. But this phenomenon was not observed in any other tested cell line, when comparing editing and motility rates 6 and 16 days post transfection. Both tested <italic>L. donovani</italic> cell lines and the tested <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell line that possessed the pTB107 construct and the tdTomato expression cassette (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">B</xref>) remained paralyzed over the entire observation time. To confirm that these cells would have no potential ever to reverse their phenotype, we decided to Illumina sequence paralyzed <italic>L. mexicana</italic> PF16 mutants 16 days post transfection. Analyzing their sequencing data, we did not find a single read of an unedited PF16 CDS sequence (with approximately 35× genome coverage), confirming that indeed all cells were completely mutated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Cas12a-mediated DSB ensures the integration of one CBE sgRNA per <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transfectant</title>
<p>We next wanted to verify how exactly the CBE sgRNA expression cassette had been integrated via Cas12a-mediated DSB in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cells that possessed the pTB107 construct and the tdTomato reporter. Since the tdTomato expression cassette is just ∼400 nt upstream of the Cas12a crRNA-4 target sequence, we wondered whether it had come to any obvious interference between the tdTomato and CBE sgRNA expression cassettes. Given the highly repetitive nature of the 18S rRNA SSU locus, we employed Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing to determine the exact integration pattern of both cassettes. For the analysis of sequencing reads, we mapped them against two customized genomes. In the first genome, we assumed that the tdTomato expression cassette was integrated separately from the CBE sgRNA construct, implying that each cassette had integrated on the opposite allele (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>). In the second genome, we assumed that both cassettes were integrated on the same allele and could be detected on a single ONT read (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1C</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, we could only map unique ONT reads to the first scenario, where cassettes were assumed to be integrated on separate alleles and present in only one copy in the genome. These ONT reads covered the entire tdTomato or CBE sgRNA expression cassette, as well as sequences adjacent to homology flanks used for integration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). To validate our findings, we revisited our Illumina sequencing data and analyzed the coverage of relevant genetic features. Specifically, we normalized all reads to the total number of reads per chromosome and compared the normalized coverage of reads mapped to the CDS of PF16, the CBE sgRNA cassette, the CDS of tdTomato, and the CDS of the neomycin-resistance marker. While we found equal read coverage of PF16-mapped reads and the chromosome harboring PF16, read coverage for the CBE sgRNA cassette, the CDS of tdTomato, and the CDS of the neomycin-resistance marker were approximately half of the read coverage of their harboring chromosome 27 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1D</xref>). This confirmed our hypothesis that indeed the CBE sgRNA expression cassette had only been integrated on one allele, and most likely, this meant that only one CBE sgRNA cassette copy was present per <italic>L. mexicana</italic> cell.</p>
<p>This represents a major improvement since, in our previously used single vector system, about 38% of all <italic>L. mexicana</italic> transfectants possessed more than one CBE-sgRNA expression plasmid, potentially causing combinatorial knockout effects. To verify that in our new dual system each cell indeed harboured only one CBE sgRNA, we decided to test if isolated clones from a transfected library would possess one or multiple CBE sgRNA sequences. In addition to testing this in <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, we also wanted to assess this for <italic>L. donovani and L. major</italic>, as we had not sequenced respective mutants via ONT and Illumina sequencing.</p>
<p>Using again Cas12a crRNA-4 for the integration of a small-scale pTB105 CBE sgRNA expression cassette library (containing 13 different CBE sgRNA sequences), we isolated 10 clones from each species, PCR amplified the integrated CBE sgRNA locus, and sequenced it by Sanger sequencing. As expected, we found only unique sequencing reads for all tested <italic>L. mexicana</italic> clones, confirming the integration of only one guide per transfectant (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 S2</xref>). However, for <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic>, 2 out of 10 sequencing reads showed mixed guide sequences (<xref rid="figs4-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 S2</xref>), suggesting that multiple CBE sgRNAs can be integrated per cell, though at a slightly lower rate of about 20% compared to the previous 38% observed with plasmid transfections. Furthermore, the integration of multiple sgRNAs per cell remained random. While testing other Cas12a crRNAs in the future may identify a more unique integration locus for <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic> parasites, any compensatory effects through the integration of multiple CBE sgRNAs in these species will likely be minimal and presumably not detectable in large-scale screens with a high library representation rate. Therefore, we believe that this method is suitable not only for screens in <italic>L. mexicana</italic> but also in <italic>L. donovani</italic> and <italic>L. major</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Improved CBE sgRNA design to prioritize edits resulting only in STOP codons</title>
<p>The results above demonstrate that Cas12a crRNAs can be used to efficiently integrate CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into <italic>L. mexicana</italic>, <italic>L. major</italic> and <italic>L. donovani</italic>. This has no significant impact on parasite growth and enables high editing rates in all these tested species. However, as we noted in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), high editing rates do not necessarily lead to a strong knockdown of the targeted protein. Cells with a deleterious mutation can be simply outcompeted by cells with a non-deleterious mutation. This issue is particularly relevant when not all available cytosine nucleotides within the CBE sgRNA editing window result in a STOP codon after thymine conversion. To address this, we have therefore improved the scoring of previously designed CBE sgRNAs by implementing a C-score that determines the ratio of available cytosines to resulting STOP codons (<xref rid="figs4-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 S3</xref>). This new scoring system has been uploaded to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.leishbaseedit.net">www.leishbaseedit.net</ext-link>. We also considered the position at which the STOP codon would occur and designed a scoring matrix that rates CBE sgRNAs higher when the STOP codon is introduced within positions 4-8 and lower when introduced within positions 11-12 (<xref rid="figs4-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 S3</xref>). While our ratio scoring aims to increase the chance of successfully generating a functional mutation through STOP codon insertion, it is important to note that the introduction of a STOP codon is not the only efficient way to generate a functional mutant. As shown above, the introduction of a thymidine homo-polymer (“TTTTT”) within the PF16 CDS produces the same motility phenotype observed when using gene replacement strategies for knockout generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). Ultimately, this expands the possibilities for upcoming mutational screens in <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>

<title>Co-expression of Cas12a and CBE enables a wide range of genetic manipulations</title>
<p>While these modifications to our sgRNA scoring tool represent another improvement in our method, the design of our triple expression construct (AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and Cas9 CBE) also offers opportunities for other advancements. For example, it enables hybrid approaches where classical CRISPR gene replacement and/or tagging methods can be combined with cytosine base editing experiments in one cell line. This is particularly interesting for targeting multiple genes simultaneously or dispersed multi-copy genes, and can also include the co-targeting of non-coding and coding genetic elements. Furthermore, since Cas12a has an intrinsic RNA cleavage activity, multiplexing of sgRNAs is possible and this expands the range of potential applications further.</p>
<p>To explore the applicability of AsCas12a ultra for gene replacement strategies, such as the LeishGEdit approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beneke and Gluenz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>), we devised two Cas12a crRNAs targeting the 5’ and 3’ UTR of the PF16 ORF (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Additionally, we designed 30nt homology flanks adjacent to these crRNAs. We then PCR-amplified pTBlast and pTPuro cassettes from the LeishGEdit toolbox using primers containing these homology flanks and co-transfected them with Cas12a crRNA template DNA into <italic>L. mexicana</italic> parasites. These cells contained the pTB107 construct for co-expression of AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and CBE. Like the Cas9 LeishGEdit approach, transfected Cas12a crRNAs contained a T7 RNAP promoter for efficient <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Following transfection, we then confirmed that the ORF was successfully replaced by drug resistance markers on both alleles and amplified the PF16 locus with two ORF spanning primers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). In addition, we performed Sanger sequencing over integration flanks to verify the integration of donor DNA fragments. This analysis confirmed the accurate integration of both donor DNA constructs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">D</xref>). Lastly, we performed again our motility analysis on these mutants, revealing the expected PF16 motility phenotype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). Overall, this demonstrates the versatility of our AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, and CBE co-expression vector for a wide range of CRISPR applications in <italic>Leishmania</italic>.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The <italic>Leishmania</italic> research community faces significant challenges in targeting all genes within the species. The absence of a functional NHEJ pathway complicates the process of obtaining null mutants, typically demanding the additional use of donor DNA, selection of edits associated with drug resistance, or the time-consuming isolation of clones. These complexities also apply to loss-of-function screens. Classical pooled CRISPR transfection screening formats are unlikely to be executed successfully, unless additional selective measures are used. While, bar-seq screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Baker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beneke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Beneke and Gluenz, 2020</xref>) and RNAi methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">de Paiva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lye et al., 2022</xref>) offer potential solutions, they come with clear limitations. Most notably, the use of RNAi is restricted to <italic>Leishmania</italic> species within the <italic>Viannia</italic> subgenus, and bar-seq screens pose logistical challenges due to the necessity of generating thousands of individually created mutants. Furthermore, CRISPR gene replacement approaches, such as bar-seq methods, require multiple rounds of transfection when targeting dispersed multi-copy genes and are not suited to mutate interrupted tandemly arrayed coding and non-coding genes, which are abundantly present in the <italic>Leishmania</italic> genome.</p>
<p>Therefore, we recently introduced cytosine base editing as an alternative method for gene editing and large-scale screening in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, aiming to overcome these limitations. However, variations in editing efficiency, substantial reduction in parasite growth, competition between deleterious and non-deleterious mutations, and low transfection rates prompted further refinements of our method. Here we present major improvements that collectively enhance our CBE method for <italic>Leishmania</italic> parasites.</p>
<p>In our final setup, we effectively employ a dual construct system, where a stable cell line is transfected with a CBE sgRNA expression construct. The stable cell line expresses the hyBE4max CBE, AsCas12a ultra, and T7 RNAP, with CBE sgRNA expression driven by a T7 RNAP promoter variant (T7 T-10 GG). Alongside our updated CBE sgRNA design tool, which now prioritizes sgRNAs with a low cytosine to resulting STOP codon ratio, this system achieves high editing rates without affecting parasite growth. Compared to our initial CBE single-vector method, this dual-construct system has the disadvantage that it requires the generation of a stable cell line first. However, it offers the clear advantage that CBE sgRNA expression constructs can be efficiently integrated using AsCas12a-mediated DSBs. Through testing a series of Cas12a crRNAs, we identified a specific Cas12a crRNA capable of efficiently integrating CBE sgRNA expression cassettes into the 18S rRNA SSU safe harbor locus. CBE sgRNA expression cassettes can thereby be generated by amplification or digestion of the plasmid pTB105. In combination with the Lonza Nucleofector Technology, this approach increases transfection rates by ∼400-fold, yielding up to 1 transfectant per 70 transfected cells. Additionally, the co-expression of Cas12a and CBE provides strategic advantages, enabling the use of CRISPR gene replacement and base editing approaches in the same cell line. Moreover, Cas12a can be easily employed for protein tagging and multiplexing of sgRNAs, offering in the future a wide range of possible editing experiments in combination with base editing. Overall, we believe that our improved toolbox sets the stage for various gene editing applications in <italic>Leishmania</italic>, including genome-wide cytosine base editor screens, and we hope that these will make significant advancements in the field.</p>

<p>Cas12a crRNAs were designed using CCTop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Labuhn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Stemmer et al., 2015</xref>) with the “PAM type” setting “TTTN” and species specification “Protists – Euglenozoa – <italic>Leishmania tarentolae</italic>”.

<title>Construction of CBE, Cas12a and T7 RNAP co-expression plasmids</title>
<p>We synthesized the open-reading frame (ORF) of AsCas12a ultra (M537R/F870L mutation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>) with a fused SV40 nuclear localisation signal (NLS), a 3xFLAG tag, a P2A self-cleaving peptide and a c-myc NLS, consisting of six repeats. This c-myc NLS repeat has been previously shown to increase editing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gier et al., 2020</xref>). We then amplified the synthesized Cas12a construct in a fusion PCR, adding parts of the T7 RNAP (ORF) and an intergenic region to the construct (using primer-pair 2051F/2052R and 2053F/2054R for amplification from pTB007-hyBE4max). Subsequently, this enabled cloning of the AsCas12a-expression cassette into pTB007-hyBE4max using FseI and AflII. We termed the resulting plasmid pTB107, which allows for the co-expression of AsCas12a ultra, T7 RNAP, hyBE4max CBE and hygromycin resistance-marker. To create a version of pTB107 that contained our previously pioneered <italic>Leishmania</italic>-derived version of the Rad51 single-stranded DNA-binding domain (ssDNA-DBD), we digested pLdCH-hyBE4max-LmajDBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>) and pTB107 with AvrII and FseI to generate pTB106.</p>

<title>Construction of sgRNA expression plasmids and their optimisation by promoter testing</title>
<p>For generation of T7 RNAP promoter-driven CBE sgRNA expression plasmids, we amplified and cloned the sgRNA-expression cassette from pLdCH into NsiI and MluI sites of a pPLOT-Puro plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>), thereby introducing the unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence (amplification using primer-pair 2128F-WT/2129R). To enable sgRNA cloning using BbsI sites, we then eliminated the BbsI site contained within the Actin 5’UTR of this plasmid, using primer-pair 2126F/2129R and PspOMI/MluI restriction sites. To avoid over-expression of the puromycin drug resistance marker, we also eliminated the additional unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence contained in the plasmid backbone by amplifying the whole expression cassette (using primer-pair 2067F/2068R) and cloning it using PacI into the bacterial backbone of plasmid pTB007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beneke et al., 2017</xref>). We then cloned into this resulting plasmid T7 RNAP and rRNAP promoter variant cassettes, containing tdTomato targeting sgRNAs, by using again NsiI and MluI sites (primer-pairs 2014-2021 and 2025-2027). Tdtomato-targeting sgRNA expression constructs were then transfected as episomes into <italic>L. major</italic> parasites that expressed a tdTomato reporter, T7 RNAP and CBE. Following transfection recovery, the proportion of tdTomato-expressing cells was determined by FACS analysis and doubling times measured. Thereby, transfection and FACS analysis were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>). Following promoter testing, we then finalized our design and generated pTB102 with a T7 RNAP T10 GG promoter variant (using primer-pair 2128F-T10GG/2129R).</p>
<p>To include homology flanks in the pTB102 plasmid, neomycin-targeting or 18S rRNA-targeting regions were amplified and fused to pTB102 sgRNA expression cassettes using a fusion PCR approach (primer-pairs 2236F-2257R). Resulting amplicons were cloned into PacI sites, resulting in pTB104 (neomycin-targeting T7 RNAP expression plasmid) and pTB105 (18S rRNA-targeting T7 RNAP expression plasmid).</p>
<p>PF16 and tdTomato targeting CBE sgRNAs were cloned into pTB102, pTB104 and pTB105 plasmids using BbsI sites as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>).</p>

<title>Preparation of donor DNA and Cas12a crRNA template DNA</title>
<p>To amplify the CBE sgRNA expression donor construct, 50 ng of plasmid template (pTB102, pTB104 or pTB105) containing a CBE targeting guide, 200 µM dNTPs, 0.5 µM each of forward and reverse primers, and 1 unit of Q5 polymerase (New England Biolabs) were mixed in 1x Q5 buffer to a final volume of 100 µl. Oligos used for amplification contained homology flanks of varying lengths. PCR steps were 30 s at 98°C, followed by 20 cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 10 s at 65°C and 40 s at 72°C, concluding with a final elongation step of 5 min at 72°C. Alternatively, donor DNA was produced by digesting pTB104 and pTB105 plasmids with PacI. To confirm the presence of the expected product, 2 µl of this reaction was analysed on a 0.8% agarose gel.</p>
<p>For the amplification of the Cas12a crRNA template DNA, we used a common forward primer, containing an unmodified T7 RNAP promoter sequence and an optimised Cas12a direct repeat (DR) from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">DeWeirdt et al. (2021)</xref>. For the PCR 200 µM dNTPs, 2 µM each of Cas12a forward primer and corresponding reverse primer, and 1 unit of Phusion Polymerase (Thermo Fisher) were mixed in 1x Phusion GC Buffer and 3 % DMSO to a total volume of 50 µl. PCR steps were 30 s at 98°C followed by 35 cycles of 10 s at 98°C, 10 s at 65°C and 10s at 72° concluding with a final elongation step for 7 min at 72°C. Successful amplification was confirmed by running 2 µl of the reaction on a 2% agarose gel.</p>

<title>Testing Cas12a-mediated integration of mNG constructs</title>
<p>To test the Cas12a-mediated integration efficiency of donor DNA constructs with varying homology flank lengths, we generated a DNA construct containing mNeonGreen (mNG) as a reporter and blasticidin as a resistance marker, as well as ∼600 nt homology flanks targeting the 18S rRNA SSU locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Misslitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sorensen et al., 2003</xref>).

<p>We then PCR amplified as described above donor DNA from this plasmid with varying homology flank lengths (∼600 nt, 60 nt and 30 nt; Supplementary File 1). Resulting PCR amplicons and the pPLOT-SSU-HDR-mNG-Blast plasmid itself were then purified using ethanol precipitation and normalized to the same number of DNA molecules (3.6×10<sup>12</sup> molecules per transfection). This normalization was based on 10 µg of pPLOT-SSU-HDR-mNG-Blast plasmid. In addition, 10 µg of Cas12a crRNA template DNA was added to donor DNA as indicated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Engstler and Beneke, 2023</xref>), DNA mixtures were then transfected using 5×10<sup>6</sup> cells per transfection and we determined the number of blasticidin resistant clones by immediately diluting transfected populations and platting them on 96 well plates. In addition, 10 days post transfection undiluted blasticidin resistant populations were subjected to FACS analysis.

<title>Optimised CBE sgRNA scoring</title>
<p>To determine the likelihood of successful gene editing, we adjusted the sgRNA ranking system. New sgRNA ranking scores were calculated based on various parameters, including the relative likelihood of generating a STOP codon from a cytosine base, the total number of possible STOP codons, the location of cytosines within the editing window, and the position of the guide’s target within the coding sequence (CDS) of the gene. To generate the overall score, we weighted the contribution of each of these scores, with the likelihood of generating a stop codon having four times more contribution than the other scores. We then normalized the total score on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents the best score, and 100 represents the worst score.</p>

<p>This manuscript describes a method for genetic manipulation of Leishmania species which should be sufficiently efficient to enable genome-wide genetic screens. The authors improved numerous aspects of their previously described method, which is based on sequence-specific genome editing to introduce premature stop codons using a CAS9-cytidine deaminase variant. The work is thoroughly described, with <bold>convincing</bold> data, and will be very <bold>important</bold> for Leishmania researchers, as well as perhaps suggesting the use of similar approaches in other organisms in which genetic manipulation is challenging.</p>

<p>While CRISPR/Cas technology has greatly facilitated the ability to perform precise genome edits in Leishmania spp., the lack of a non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) pathway in Leishmania has prevented researchers from performing large-scale Cas-based perturbation screens. With the introduction of base editing technology to the Leishmania field, the Beneke lab has begun to address this challenge (Engstler and Beneke, 2023).</p>
<p>In this study, the authors build on their previously published protocols and develop a strategy that:</p>
<p>(1) allows for very high editing efficiency. The cell editing frequency of 1 edit per 70 cells reported in this study represents a 400-fold improvement over the previously published protocol,</p>
<p>
(2) reduces the negative effects of high sgRNA levels on parasite growth by using a weaker T7 promoter to drive sgRNA transcription.</p>
<p>The combination of these two improvements should open the door to exciting large-scale screens and thus be of great interest to researchers working with Leishmania and beyond.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Previously, the authors published a Leishmania cytosine base editor (CBE) genetic tool that enables the generation of functionally null mutants. This works by utilising a CAS9-cytidine deaminase variant that is targeted to a genetic locus by a small guide RNA (sgRNA) and causes cytosine to thymine conversion. This has the potential to generate a premature stop codon and therefore a loss of function mutant.</p>
<p>CBE has advantages over existing CAS-based knockout tools because it allows the targeting of multicopy gene families and, potentially, the easier generation of pooled loss of function mutants in complex population experiments. Although successful, the first generation of this genetic tool had several limitations that may have prevented its wider adoption, especially in complex genome-wide screens. These include nonspecific toxicity of the sgRNAs, low transfection efficiencies, low editing efficiencies, a proportion of transfectants that express multiple different sgRNAs, and insufficient effectivity in some Leishmania species.</p>
<p>Here, the authors set out to systematically solve each of these limitations. By trialling different transfection conditions and different CAS12a cut sites to promote sgRNA expression cassette integration, they increase the transfection efficiency 400-fold and ensure that only a single sgRNA expression cassette integrates that edits with high efficiencies. By trialling different T7 promoters, they significantly reduce the non-specific toxicity of sgRNA expression whilst retaining high editing efficiencies in several Leishmania species (Leishmania major, L. mexicana and L. donovani). By improving the sgRNA design, the authors predict that null mutants will be more efficiently produced after editing.</p>
<p>This tool will find adoption for producing null mutants of single-copy genes, multicopy gene families, and potentially genome-wide mutational analyses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is an impressive and thorough study that significantly improves the previous iteration of the CBE. The approach is careful and systematic and reflects the authors' excellent experience developing CRISPR tools. The quality of data and analysis is high and data are clearly presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Figure 4 shows that editing of PF16 is 'reversed' between day 6 and day 16 in L. mexicana WTpTB107 cells. The authors reasonably conclude that in drug-selected cells there is a mixed population of edited and non-edited cells, possibly due to mis-integration of the sgRNA expression construct, and non-edited cells outcompete edited cells due to a growth defect in PF16 loss of function mutants. However, this suggests that the CBE tool will not work well for producing mutants with strong fitness phenotypes without incorporating a limiting dilution cloning step (at least in L. mexicana and quite possibly other Leishmania species). Furthermore, it suggests it will not be possible to incorporate genes associated with a growth defect into a pooled drop-out screen as described in the paper. This issue is not well explored in the paper and the authors have not validated their tool on a gene associated with a severe growth defect, or shown that their tool works in a mixed population setting.</p>
<p>Although welcome, the improvements to the crRNA CBE design tool are hypothetical and untested.</p>
<p>The Sanger and Oxford Nanopore Technology analyses on integration sites of the sgRNA expression cassette integration will not detect the mis-integration of the sgRNA expression construct into an entirely different locus.</p>

<p>Genetic manipulation of Leishmania has some challenges, including some limitations in the DNA repair strategies that are present in the organism and the absence of RNA interference in many species. The senior author has contributed significantly to expanding the available routes towards Leishmania genetic manipulation by developing and adapting CRISPR-Cas9 tools to allow gene manipulation via DNA double-strand break repair and, more recently, base modification. This work seeks to improve on some limitations in the tools previously described for the latter approach of base modification leading to base change.</p>
<p>The work in the paper is meticulously described, with solid evidence for most of the improvements that are claimed: Figure1 clearly describes reduced impairment in the growth of parasites expressing sgRNAs via changes in promoters; Figures 2 and 3 compellingly document the usefulness of using AsCas12a for integration after transformation; and Figures 1 and 4 demonstrate the capacity of the combined modifications to efficiently edit a gene in three different Leishmania species. There is little doubt these new tools will be adopted by the Leishmania community, adding to the growing arsenal of approaches for genetic manipulation.</p>
<p>There are two weaknesses the authors may wish to address, one smaller and one larger.</p>
<p>(1) The main advance claimed here is in this section title: 'Integration of CBE sgRNA expression cassettes via AsCas12a ultra-introduced DSBs increase editing rates', with the evidence for this presented in Figure 4. It is hard work in the submission to discern what direct evidence there is for editing rates being improved relative to earlier, Cas9-based approaches. Did they directly compare the editing by the new and old approach? If not, can they more clearly explain how they are able to make this claim, either by adding text or a new figure? A side-by-side comparison would emphasise the advance of the new approach more clearly.</p>
<p>(2) The ultimate, stated goal of this work is (abstract) to 'enable a variety of loss-of-function screens', as the older approach had some limitations. This goal is not tested for the new tools that have been developed here; the experiment in Figure 5 merely shows that they can, not unexpectedly, make a gene mutant, which was already possible with available tools. Thus, to what extent is this paper describing a step forward? Why have the authors not run an experiment - even the same one that was described previously in Engstler and Beneke (2023) - to show that the new approach improves on previous tools in such a screen, either in scale or accuracy?</p>

<p>We would like to thank all reviewers and editors for their thorough peer review and valuable suggestions. In these provisional responses, we summarize the main concerns raised by the reviewers and outline our planned revisions to address them in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Overall, we are pleased to note that the reviewers agree on the potential value of our updated toolbox for gene editing, highlighting its various applications. However, they also raised several valid concerns, which we have summarized and responded to as follows:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Mutant phenotypes in transfected populations can be occasionally reversed or escaped. This suggests it will not be possible to detect growth-associated phenotypes in pooled screens. An experiment with a pooled loss-of-function screen to test this is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Escapes or reversals of mutant phenotypes have been observed with other genetic tools used for loss-of-function screening, including lentiviral CRISPR approaches in mammalian systems and RNAi in Trypanosoma brucei. Cells can escape phenotypes through various mechanisms, such as promoter silencing or selection of non-deleterious mutations. Additionally, not every CRISPR guide is efficient in generating a mutant phenotype, and RNAi constructs can also vary in their effectiveness. Despite these challenges, genome-wide loss-of-function screens have been successfully carried out in mammalian cells and Trypanosoma parasites. Therefore, we believe that the observed escape of one mutant phenotype does not preclude the detection of growth-associated or other phenotypes in pooled screens. Moreover, we did not observe a reversal of the mutant phenotype in L. mexicana, L. donovani, and L. major parasites expressing tdTomato from an expression cassette integrated into the 18S rRNA SSU locus (Figure 4). However, the reviewers are rightfully requesting a pooled loss-of-function screen to validate this. Since submitting this manuscript, we have conducted multiple pooled loss-of-function screens, which have confirmed the ability of our here presented method to detect a range of mutant phenotypes in pooled screening formats. We will include these results in our revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The possibility of mis-integration of the CBE sgRNA expression construct into an entirely different locus is not explored.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We plan to reanalyze our ONT sequencing data to verify if the CBE sgRNA expression construct was integrated into an unintended loci. If we detect any mis-integration events, we will evaluate their potential negative impacts and discuss these findings in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The achieved increase in editing efficiency compared to the previous base editing method could be more clearly presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have directly compared our improved method to our previous base editing method in Figures 1E and 4, demonstrating higher editing rates in a much shorter time. In the revised manuscript, we will present and describe the increase in editing rate more clearly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The improvements on CBE sgRNA guide design are hypothetical and untested.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the improvements to the CBE sgRNA design are currently hypothetical. We plan to systematically test our guide design principles in future studies. Since this will require testing hundreds of guides to draw robust conclusions, we believe that this aspect is beyond the scope of the current study. However, we will discuss our plans for future validation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>Overall, we appreciate the reviewers' insights and are committed to addressing their concerns thoroughly. We believe that the planned revisions and additional experiments will significantly strengthen our manuscript and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of our updated gene editing toolbox.</p>
