<title>Summary</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering enables rapid and precise gene manipulations in the CNS. Here, we developed a non-invasive astrocyte-specific method utilizing a single AAV vector, which we named GEARBOCS (Gene Editing in AstRocytes Based On CRISPR/Cas9 System). We verified GEARBOCS’ specificity to mouse cortical astrocytes and demonstrated its utility for three types of gene manipulations: knockout (KO); tagging (TagIn); and reporter knock-in (GeneTrap) strategies. Next, we deployed GEARBOCS in two test cases. First, we determined that astrocytes are a necessary source of the synaptogenic factor Sparcl1 for thalamocortical synapse maintenance in the mouse primary visual cortex. Second, we determined that cortical astrocytes express the synaptic vesicle associated Vamp2 protein and found that it is required for maintaining excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers in the visual cortex. These results show that the GEARBOCS strategy provides a fast and efficient means to study astrocyte biology <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 (i.e., <underline>C</underline>lustered regularly interspaced <underline>s</underline>hort <underline>p</underline>alindromic repeats-associated endonuclease 9) mediated gene-editing is widely used to engineer the mammalian genome <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Cas9 cleaves the genome at specific guide RNA (gRNA) target sites generating double-strand breaks. These breaks are repaired by two cell-intrinsic repair mechanisms: non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Cas9-mediated cleavage events continue until repair induces insertions or deletions in the genome (i.e., indels) precluding gRNA recognition and further cleavage by Cas9. Indels within coding sequences often result in frameshifts and premature stop codons generating gene knockouts. HDR and NHEJ following CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome cleavage can also be used to introduce engineered sequences into the genome, even in postmitotic cells such as neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These knock-in strategies utilize in-frame donor sequences to insert reporters or tags within the open reading frames of target genes.</p>
<p>Numerous methods, such as SLENDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, vSLENDR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, HITI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, HiUGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and ORANGE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> were developed for gene knockout and knock-in applications in neurons, each using different DNA delivery methods or molecular strategies for donor insertion. For example, HDR-based SLENDR and vSLENDR use <italic>in utero</italic> electroporation or Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based methods to deliver gene-editing machinery into the mitotic radial glial stem cells or postmitotic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, the efficiency of HDR-mediated donor insertion in postmitotic cells is limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The homology-independent targeted integration (HITI) method offers more effective genome editing and endogenous tagging of proteins of interest in postmitotic cells such as neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Homology-independent Universal Genome Engineering (HiUGE) utilizes universal guide/donor pairs to enable rapid alterations of endogenous proteins without the need for designing target-specific donors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Even though these gene-editing tools have versatile <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> applications, they depend on multiple vectors harboring the essential components required for genome engineering. Moreover, these strategies are developed primarily for neuronal gene manipulation.</p>
<p>In the CNS, non-neuronal glial cells, called astrocytes, play critical roles in neuronal connectivity and health. Astrocytes are characterized by their complex, ramified structures which are arborized into several thin filamentous branches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Astrocytes are indispensable for the functioning of the brain. They provide trophic support to neurons, maintain the blood-brain barrier, regulate ion/water homeostasis as well as control synaptic transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. These essential roles of astrocytes in synapse formation, maturation, elimination, and maintenance depend on a complex bidirectional interaction with neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> mediated by secreted and adhesion molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the undeniable importance of astrocytes in brain development and function, our molecular understanding of this glial cell type is still in its infancy. To address this knowledge gap, many recent studies revealed astrocyte-specific gene expression profiles and proteomes in the mammalian brain both in normal and disease conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. These -omics approaches provide a rich resource for future discoveries; however, efficient tools for rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> genome editing of mouse astrocytes are needed to speed up discovery.</p>
<p>Here, we developed an astrocyte-specific CRISPR-based gene-editing tool, GEARBOCS (<underline>G</underline>ene <underline>E</underline>diting in <underline>A</underline>st<underline>R</underline>ocytes <underline>B</underline>ased <underline>O</underline>n <underline>C</underline>RISPR/Cas9 <underline>S</underline>ystem) to address this need. GEARBOCS is a single AAV vector to be used in conjunction with transgenic mice expressing Cas9 in a Cre-dependent manner. GEARBOCS enables three genome engineering strategies: 1) Gene Knockout (KO), 2) knocking in a tag for labeling of endogenous proteins (TagIn) and, 3) simultaneous KO and reporter knock-in (GeneTrap). Importantly, GEARBOCS harbors all essential components for genome editing in a single AAV backbone. We tested the efficiency and specificity of GEARBOCS for <italic>in vivo</italic> gene editing and applied it to two experimental questions: 1) to determine if astrocytes are a required source of the synaptogenic factor Sparcl1 to maintain thalamocortical synapses after the initial synaptogenic period is completed in the mouse visual cortex and 2) to determine whether astrocytes express the synaptic vesicle associated protein Vamp2 and whether astrocytic Vamp2 is required for maintenance of synapse numbers.</p>
<p>Sparc-like-1 (Sparcl1, also known as Hevin) is a member of the secreted protein acidic, rich in cysteine (SPARC) family of proteins. Previous studies identified Sparcl1 as an astrocyte-secreted protein which promotes synaptogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Sparcl1 bridges neuronal presynaptic neurexin-1alpha and postsynaptic neuroligin-1B and orchestrates the formation of thalamocortical synapses in the developing visual cortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Previous studies utilized a global Sparcl1 knockout mouse to show that astrocyte-specific overexpression of Sparcl1 was sufficient to rescue the decreases in thalamocortical synapse number and ocular dominance plasticity observed in Sparcl1 KO animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. However, the impact of astrocyte-specific loss of Sparcl1 on thalamocortical synapses has not been tested.</p>
<p>Astrocytes are known to secrete many neuroactive proteins and small molecules; however, the secretory mechanisms in these cells are not well known. Vamp2 (also known as synaptobrevin II) is a component of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complex, and its functions at neuronal synapses for regulation of neurotransmitter release are well-characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, the expression and functional relevance of Vamp2 and the role of the SNARE complex in astrocytes has been controversial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Therefore, here we used GEARBOCS to determine the expression of Vamp2 in astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> and tested its roles in controlling synapse numbers in the mouse cortex.</p>

<title>GEARBOCS is designed as a single AAV tool for <italic>in vivo</italic> genome editing in astrocytes</title>
<p>To facilitate rapid, astrocyte-specific, <italic>in vivo</italic> genome editing, we designed a CRISPR tool within a single AAV vector, which we named GEARBOCS. GEARBOCS vector is designed to be used in combination with an AAV capsid such as PHP.eB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> which is delivered into the CNS of mice via retro-orbital injection. For the GEARBOCS strategy to work, transgenic mice that express spCas9 in a Cre recombinase-dependent manner are required (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). For all the experiments described here, we used GEARBOCS AAVs produced with AAV-PHP.eB capsids and retro-orbitally injected them into the loxP-STOP-loxP spCas9 (LSL-Cas9) or loxP-STOP-loxP spCas9-EGFP (LSL-Cas9-EGFP) mice at postnatal day (P) 21 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). 3 weeks later, at P42, brains were harvested and analyzed. For consistency, we focused our analyses on the primary visual cortex (V1).</p>

The excised donor fragment from the GEARBOCS can integrate into the genome by homology-independent targeted integration (HITI). The donors are designed to be in frame with the gene of interest. If the endogenous tagging of a protein of interest in astrocytes (TagIn) is needed, the tag is knocked in frame with both the START and STOP codons of the gene of interest. If the donor has its own STOP codon and polyA tail, then this will lead to GeneTrap.</p></caption>

<p>The GEARBOCS vector (5743bp) harbors four essential components for <italic>in vivo</italic> genome editing:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A U6 expression cassette, including a human U6 promoter, a gRNA cloning site, and a 76bp gRNA scaffold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The U6 promoter drives the expression of a small guide RNA (gRNA), which is cloned into the <italic>Sap1</italic> restriction site within the gRNA cloning site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The gRNA is designed to match a 20bp genomic target site, which is next to a Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A Donor Insertion Site (DIS) wherein the donor DNA can be cloned between the BamH1 and Sal1 restriction sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The donor DNA is omitted for generating gene KOs. Alternatively, donor sequences, ranging from a small epitope tag, like HA or V5, or a larger reporter tag, such as EGFP or mCherry (up to 2kb), can be cloned into the DIS. The donor sequence is flanked with the guide RNA target site sequences on both ends (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A synthetic human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, GfaABC1D, to drive the expression of Cre in astrocytes. Cre removes the STOP codon and turns on Cas9 or Cas9-EGFP expression in astrocytes. While the GfaABC1D promoter is highly active in astrocytes, only low levels of cre-recombinase expression are necessary for recombination. As a result, an early version of GEARBOCS (GEARBOCS-v0) led to recombination in a small number of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (Figure S1). To overcome this, we incorporated a miRNA targeting cassette (miRT) to the 3 prime of the Cre-recombinase sequence. This miRNA targeting cassette triggers transcript degradation in neurons and endothelial cells, increasing astrocyte specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Two inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) for AAV packaging. The ITR sequences in GEARBOCS are based on the AAV2 serotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p></list-item>
</list>
The GEARBOCS approach uses the intrinsic DNA repair mechanism non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) for homology-independent targeted integration (HITI). Thus, when combined with HITI of donor sequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, GEARBOCS permits gene knock-in both in mitotic and postmitotic cells. The GEARBOCS tool can be used to manipulate the astrocyte genome in three different ways. GEARBOCS, without a donor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), generates knock out (KO) of the gene of interest in astrocytes. The gRNA specific to the gene of interest guides the spCas9 in astrocytes to the genomic locus to create a double stranded break upstream of its PAM sequence (NGG for spCas9). This double stranded break is repaired by NHEJ, until the repair causes indels which results in a frame shift and gene KO. To generate KOs, we choose unique gRNAs targeting genomic regions within the first few exons of the gene of interest. gRNAs are chosen based on their low off-target and high on-target scores predicted by the Broad Institute CRISPick tool (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public</ext-link>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>GEARBOCS can also be used for knocking in a donor sequence in frame with the gene of interest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). To do so, a donor sequence, flanked with the reverse-oriented genomic gRNA target sites on both ends, is cloned into the DIS of the GEARBOCS vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B and D</xref>). The gRNAs guide spCas9s to the genomic loci and the donor sequence within the viral genome to generate double-stranded breaks in both sequences. These cleavage events result in two blunt ends in the genome and two at the donor fragment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). The donor DNA is then integrated into the genomic target site via HITI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>GEARBOCS with donor can be used for endogenous tagging of proteins of interest (TagIn) in astrocytes. To do so, the donor is designed to insert a protein coding sequence in frame with the endogenous coding sequence so that the endogenous start and stop codons and the polyA tails are kept intact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>When the donor sequence is designed to insert in frame following the endogenous START site but has its own STOP codon and a synthetic polyA tail, this will lead to a gene trap: The donor sequence will be expressed but the target gene will be knocked out after the editing site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). This GeneTrap approach is particularly useful to label and visualize astrocytes in which a gene of interest is knocked out. Reverse orientation of gRNA target sequences flanking the donor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) is critical for avoiding further cleavage, thereby facilitating the insertion of the donor in the correct orientation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. The GEARBOCS vector design enables us to interchange the donors quickly with a single cloning step. Hence, it provides an “all-in-one” simple CRISPR tool to target astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>GEARBOCS enables efficient astrocyte-specific genome editing</title>
<p>GEARBOCS uses the astrocyte-specific minimal promoter, gfaABC1D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> to drive the Cre expression and turn on the production of Cas9 or Cas9-EGFP in astrocytes of the commercially available LSL-Cas9 or LSL-Cas9-EGFP mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

<p>Previous studies have raised the caveat that the human GfaABC1D promoter may permit Cre-mediated genome recombination in some neuronal cells, when AAVs are directly injected at high titers into the mouse brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.

We found that retro-orbitally injected AAV-GEARBOCS indeed transduces the mouse brain with high efficiency which is evidenced by the abundance of Cas9-EGFP positive cells across many brain regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>) including V1 cortex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>)</p>

<p>To investigate the astrocyte specificity of Cre-mediated Cas9 expression, we performed the co-immunostaining of Cas9-EGFP with different CNS cell type-specific markers.

<title>GEARBOCS-mediated gene editing of Sparcl1 in mouse cortical astrocytes</title>
<p>To evaluate the effectiveness of GEARBOCS as a molecular CRISPR tool for manipulation of astrocyte genome in multiple ways, we targeted the gene Sparcl1, which encodes for a secreted synaptogenic protein, also known as Hevin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>.

Here we used GEARBOCS to target Sparcl1 specifically in astrocytes after the completion of the synaptogenic period (after P21) to determine if its astrocytic expression is required for maintenance of thalamocortical synapses.</p>
<p>To do so, we first applied the GEARBOCS KO strategy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) by selecting a unique gRNA targeting the first exon of Sparcl1, located 40bp after the start codon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The selected gRNA1 was cloned into GEARBOCS to generate the AAV-GEARBOCS-Sparcl1-KO and retro-orbitally injected into P21 Cas9-EGFP (loxP-STOP-loxP) mice. We used AAV-GEARBOCS without a gRNA as our control. After tissue collection at P42, immunostaining showed that the Sparcl1 expression is ablated in EGFP/Cas9+ cells which are transduced by AAV-GEARBOCS-Sparcl1-KO when compared to the astrocytes transduced by the control virus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-G</xref>).

<p>To test the utility of GEARBOCS for TagIn applications (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we designed a donor sequence, containing an mCherry fluorophore tag sequence, flanked with two inverted gRNA target sequences on either side. This gRNA sequence corresponded to a suitable donor insertion site in exon 9 of Sparcl1 at the C terminus of the protein. This donor sequence was then cloned into the GEARBOCS vector, which already contained the gRNA targeting the exon 9, generating AAV-GEARBOCS-Sparcl1-TagIn-C-mCherry. We validated the efficiency of the guide and potential of the donor insertion first using 3T3-Cas9 cells (Calibre Scientific, Cat# CBIO-AKR-5104), a mouse fibroblast cell line expressing spCas9. By PCR amplifying the edited genomic DNA of these cells, we were able to validate this approach (Figure S2J).</p>
<p>AAV-GEARBOCS-Sparcl1-TagIn-C-mCherry viruses were injected into the floxed-Cas9-EGFP mice and cortical sections were stained with antibodies against Sparcl1 and mCherry. As predicted, the endogenous Sparcl1 staining co-localized with mCherry in the GEARBOCS-transduced EGFP/Cas9+ astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3M-T</xref>). Of the Cas9-EGFP positive astrocytes, 12.49±0.90% had mCherry-tagged Sparcl1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3U</xref>).</p>
<p>We were also able to label Sparcl1’s N-terminus with either mCherry or HA TagIn viruses and observed colocalization between Sparcl1 antibody staining and these N- terminal tags (Figure S2).</p>
<p>Finally, we tested the GEARBOCS tool’s utility to achieve a GeneTrap- i.e., the simultaneous KO of an astrocytic gene of interest and insertion of a reporter gene into its locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). To do so, we used the gRNA targeting the <italic>Sparcl1</italic> gene in exon 1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We designed and generated the mCherry-CAAX reporter donor with its own STOP codon and polyA tail. This GeneTrap strategy caused loss of endogenous Sparcl1 expression as expected, while the mCherry-CAAX was produced in these cells facilitating their visualization (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3V-Y</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated that GEARBOCS is an efficient tool for gene KO, endogenous tagging, and gene trap purposes, greatly facilitating the study of astrocyte cell biology in the mouse CNS. Hence, this “all-in-one” AAV CRISPR tool could help address the limitations and challenges in understanding the development and functions of astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Astrocytic Sparcl1 is required for thalamocortical synapse maintenance in the mouse visual cortex</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that Sparcl1 is required for proper synapse formation in the mouse visual cortex. Moreover, specifically overexpressing Sparcl1 in astrocytes rescues synapse number deficits in Sparcl1 KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. While these data show that astrocytic Sparcl1 is sufficient for synapse formation, it remains an open question if astrocytic Sparcl1 is necessary for thalamocortical synapse formation and maintenance. This is particularly important because a small subset of cortical neurons also express Sparcl1/Hevin protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Moreover, Sparcl1 mRNA is also present in endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> and overexpressing Hevin specifically in the endothelial cells of the Hevin KO mice was able to rescue synapse phenotypes in the Sparcl1-KO mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To test this, we used the GEARBOCS Sparcl1 KO system from <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> to knockout Sparcl1 specifically in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In the mouse visual cortex, ages between P21 and P42 coincide with the critical period of ocular dominance plasticity, during which synapses carrying eye-specific synaptic inputs can be remodeled drastically if one of the eyes loses vision<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we found that knocking out of Sparcl1 specifically in the astrocytes by the injection of Sparcl1 KO GEARBOCS at P21 and brain collection at P42 showed a 48% decrease in VGlut2/PSD95 synapse numbers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-E</xref>). These results show that in addition to its role during early synaptogenic period (before P21) astrocytic Sparcl1 is required for the maintenance of thalamocortical connectivity during the critical period of ocular dominance plasticity.</p>

<p>While the presence of calcium transients in astrocytes has been well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, the expression of Vamp2 in astrocytes and its functions are still controversial. This is primarily due to the overwhelming abundance of neuronal Vamp2 compared to astrocytic Vamp2 and the limited specificity of both chemical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> and genetic approaches to target astrocytic Vamp2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Therefore, it has been difficult to discriminate the astrocytic expression of Vamp2 from its neuronal counterpart.</p>
<p>To capture astrocytic Vamp2 expression by conventional immunohistochemical methods and imaging, we immunostained Vamp2 in brain sections from mice in which cortical astrocytes were transduced with AAV-gfaABC1D-mCherry-CAAX. Co-localization of mCherry+ astrocytes with Vamp2 was detected; however, due to the intense Vamp2 staining in brain tissue and the resolution limit of light microscopy, it was difficult to confirm Vamp2 expression within astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-D</xref>). Using the Imaris software, we reconstructed the fluorescence signal from an mCherry-filled astrocyte to map the spatial Vamp2 expression in astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To verify the specificity of observed astrocytic Vamp2 staining with GEARBOCS, we used a Vamp2-targeting gRNA which was previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Using the GeneTrap method, we knocked-in an mCherry-CAAX donor with a STOP codon and polyA tail at its second exon, 22bp after the start codon (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This strategy allowed us to confirm the endogenous Vamp2 promoter activity driving mCherry-CAAX expression, while simultaneously knocking out Vamp2 expression. Immunohistochemical analysis of mCherry and Vamp2 in cortical astrocytes transduced with AAV-GEARBOCS-Vamp2-GeneTrap revealed greatly diminished Vamp2 staining within the mCherry+ astrocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-H</xref>). These results show that Vamp2 locus is transcriptionally active in astrocytes, further suggesting that astrocytes express Vamp2.</p>
<p>To further corroborate this finding, we applied the GEARBOCS TagIn strategy to insert an HA epitope tag at the N-terminus of the Vamp2 protein. To do so, we used the same gRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>), but changed our donor with an in-frame sequence for a single HA-epitope tag. We initially validated this approach by transfecting 3T3-Cas9 cells with this construct and then conducting Sanger sequencing of the PCR amplified target site. This sequencing confirmed the insertion of the proper HA or mCherry donors (Figure S3). AAV-GEARBOCS-Vamp2-TagIn-HA viruses were retro-orbitally injected into the Cas9 mice at P21 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>) and brains were harvested at P42. HA-tagging revealed punctate staining within transduced astrocytes, suggesting a vesicular localization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). Coimmunostaining of astrocytes with HA and Vamp2 showed that Vamp2 signal colocalizes with the HA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J-M</xref>). Altogether, these data show that cortical astrocytes express Vamp2 <italic>in vivo.</italic> Furthermore, these results demonstrate GEARBOCS as a powerful tool for specifically characterizing the localization and function of astrocytic proteins while leaving neuronal protein unaffected and unlabeled.</p>

<p>To quantify excitatory cortical synapses, we labeled the brain sections with the excitatory intracortical presynaptic marker VGluT1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> and the postsynaptic marker PSD95. The inhibitory synapses were identified as the co-localization of presynaptic VGAT and postsynaptic Gephyrin. Interestingly, loss of Vamp2 in astrocytes caused a significant increase in the densities of intracortical (VGluT1/PSD95+) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-E</xref>) excitatory synapses when compared to control astrocytes. On the contrary, loss of Vamp2 caused a severe reduction in the density of VGAT/Gephyrin+ inhibitory synaptic puncta within the territories of Vamp2 KO astrocytes in layer 2/3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F-L</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our results elucidate a previously unknown role for Vamp2 in mouse cortical astrocytes in maintaining the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory synapses. These findings suggest that Vamp2 controls the release of synapse-modifying factors. Our findings also demonstrate that GEARBOCS is a useful genome-editing tool for the investigation of astrocyte-mediated complex cellular and molecular mechanisms in CNS development and function.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To further our understanding of astrocyte biology in CNS homeostasis and function an efficient molecular tool for rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> genome-editing in mouse astrocytes is needed. In this study, we devised a HITI-based, single virus, CRISPR tool, GEARBOCS, to target mouse cortical astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> and demonstrated its multiple applications in genetic manipulation of astrocytes.</p>
<p>GEARBOCS has several advantages and applications. First, GEARBOCS is a single AAV vector capable of carrying all the essential components required for <italic>in vivo</italic> genome editing when used in conjunction with a Cre-dependent Cas9 transgenic mouse line. The single vector GEARBOCS strategy ensures the simultaneous and efficient delivery of all components to the astrocytes. Second, GEARBOCS allows for multiple genome-editing strategies including gene knock out or knocking in reporters or tags to determine astrocytic protein expression and localization for genes of interest. Furthermore, the GEARBOCS-mediated GeneTrap strategy can be used to sparsely label and visualize the KO astrocytes to study their morphology and synapse interactions. Importantly, GEARBOCS can accommodate donor sizes up to 2kb. The donors can be interchanged in GEARBOCS to generate KO, TagIn and GeneTrap options for a gene of interest quickly. Third, GEARBOCS, when used with AAV capsids such as PHP.eB, efficiently and broadly targets astrocytes across the CNS after non-invasive retro-orbital injections. The high efficacy of astrocytic transduction provides a quick cell-type specific gene manipulation capability. Noninvasive AAV delivery greatly reduces the risk of causing reactive astrocytosis, which is often observed following direct injection of viruses into the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we used GEARBOCS technique to determine the necessity of astrocytic Sparcl1 for thalamocortical synapse formation and maintenance during and after the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. Previous studies have shown that Sparcl1 is required for proper synapse formation and that overexpression of Sparcl1 specifically in astrocytes is sufficient to rescue this phenotype. However, determining the necessity of astrocytic Sparcl1 required a tool like GEARBOCS to specifically KO Sparcl1 only in astrocytes, since other cell types could serve as a compensatory source of Sparcl1. Our experiments found that both injection of GEARBOCS-Sparcl1-KO at P21 followed by P42 collection and injection at P42 followed by P62 collection resulted in a reduction VGluT2/PSD95 thalamocortical synapse numbers, without altering VGlut1/PSD95 intracortical synapse numbers. These results show that astrocytes serve as the primary source of Sparcl1 in the mouse visual cortex to maintain thalamocortical synapses.</p>
<p>We also investigated the expression of Vamp2 in astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> using GEARBOCS. Calcium-regulated vesicular exocytosis is a key feature of neuronal synapses and is mediated by the molecular machinery of the SNARE complex including Vamp2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Several studies suggested that Vamp2, and other SNARE complex proteins, are involved in secretion of small neuroactive molecules and proteins from astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. However, it has been difficult and controversial to provide evidence for Vamp2 expression and function in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. In this study, we used GEARBOCS to delineate the expression of Vamp2 in mouse cortical astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. We were able to detect reporter expression under the control of Vamp2 endogenous promoter via GeneTrap method and we found vesicle-like HA-tag staining within Vamp2-TagIn astrocytes. These data provide further evidence that Vamp2 is expressed by astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>GEARBOCS-mediated endogenous tagging and visualization of proteins such as Vamp2 circumvents the challenges and limitations of antibody-based immunolabeling of proteins in astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, GEARBOCS facilitates the study of essentially any gene of interest in astrocytes, even in the absence of specific antibodies or conditional alleles. Moreover, this CRISPR tool allows for the determination of astrocyte-specific localization and distribution of proteins, even when the protein of interest, such as Vamp2, is more abundant in another CNS cell type, such as neurons. In addition to these advantages, GEARBOCS can be used to replace the strategy of ectopic expression of tagged proteins which may alter their localization and function in astrocytes.</p>
<p>Astrocytes form an integral part of the synapse and control excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis through the secretion of synapse-modifying proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Moreover, astrocytes have been proposed to participate in the regulation of neural circuits by secreting neuroactive small molecules such as D-serine and ATP that modify synaptic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Because Vamp2 is well established to control synaptic neurotransmitter release in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, as well as protein secretion in non-neuronal cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, we postulated that loss of Vamp2 will alter the regulation of excitatory and inhibitory synapse numbers locally. In agreement with this possibility, we found that loss of Vamp2 in astrocytes after the end of synaptogenic period (P21) significantly altered synapse numbers. Loss of astrocytic Vamp2 increased intracortical excitatory synapse numbers in the visual cortex, whereas the number of inhibitory synapses were reduced. These observations indicate that Vamp2-mediated secretion is required for maintaining the excitation/inhibition balance.</p>
<p>Astrocytes undergo local and global Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients, albeit at much slower timescales than neurons. The astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-transients occur in response to patterned neuronal activity and neuromodulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>. Manipulation of astrocytic calcium through opto- and chemo-genetic tools result in strong changes in synapse activity and animal behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. Vamp2 controls Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis in neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that Vamp2 could also mediate astrocytic exocytosis of synapse-modifying molecules. Thus, our finding reveals a rich and unexplored aspect of astrocytic-secretion and provides the rationale for future studies to study Vamp2 function in astrocytes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>In summary, our results show that GEARBOCS is an effective and multifunctional gene-editing tool that offers a quick and efficient way to investigate astrocyte biology at the cellular and molecular levels in mice. The simple design of GEARBOCS makes it a powerful and versatile ‘all-in-one’ CRISPR tool for both basic and translational research. Thus, future studies using GEARBOCS will likely provide new insights into the roles of astrocytes in the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<sec id="s4">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>GEARBOCS TagIn strategy enables both N and C-terminal tagging. However, an important caveat with introducing N-terminal tags is; it could lead to the gRNA-mediated KO of the gene if the donor integration does not happen. Similarly, GeneTrap strategy targets donors with reporters close to the START codon and in the absence of donor integration the Cas9+ astrocytes could be KOs. Therefore, the neighboring unlabeled astrocytes, which express Cas9, should not be considered WT.</p>
<p>In the future, the GEARBOCS method can be further developed and improved in several ways. GEARBOCS is a modular tool; thus, we can swap the promoters of gRNA and the Cre recombinase in a species- or cell type-specific manner to achieve broader applicability. For example, GEARBOCS can be modified to utilize smaller Cas9 homologs such as SaCas9<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> under the gfaABC1D promoter instead of driving Cas9 expression via Cre recombinase. This would eliminate the need for using Cas9 transgenic mouse lines and permit the use of GEARBOCS in other species.</p>
<p>The efficiency of GEARBOCS-mediated KO, TagIn and GeneTrap methods depend on many factors. The most important one is the effectiveness and specificity of the gRNA, which is heavily influenced by the accessibility of the targeted genomic locus. Off-target activity of gRNAs and imprecise insertion of donors pose significant challenges in CRISPR-mediated genome editing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Therefore, careful validation of the gRNAs for the genes of interest are critical for experimental success. In this study, we used guides which were previously validated or validated the guides for Sparcl1 using othologous methods such as by using 3T3-Cas9 cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. It is critical that future studies using GEARBOCS with newly developed guides should screen for off-target activity or precise insertion of tags at endogenous loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To generate GEARBOCS, Cre expression cassette was cloned first into the pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-Lck-GCaMP6f (A gift from Dr. Baljit Khakh; Addgene plasmid #52924) by replacing Lck-GCaMP6f. U6 expression cassette along with the donor insertion sites (DIS) were synthesized as gBlocks (IDT) and cloned upstream of gfaABC1D promoter. The 4x6T microRNA targeting cassette from AAV-GfaABC1D-Cre-4x6T (Addgene plasmid #196410) was synthesized as a gBlock (IDT) and cloned between the Cre sequence and SV40 polyA signal. pAAV-gfaABC1D-mCherry-CAAX was generated by cloning mCherry-CAAX into pZac2.1-GfaABC1D-Lck-GCaMP6f by replacing Lck-GCaMP6f. All the gRNAs used in this study were cloned into the Sap1 site of GEARBOCS and the donors were cloned between the Sal1 and BamH1 site in the DIS. To make the GEARBOCS donors, mCherry donors were PCR amplified and HA donors were oligo annealed with overhangs to clone into the DIS. All generated plasmids were confirmed by Sanger sequencing protocol. The sgRNA sequences used in this study were as follows:</p>

<title>AAV production and purification</title>
<p>Purified AAVs were produced as previously described (Uezu et al., 2016). Briefly, HEK293T cells grown on 150mm dishes were transfected with GEARBOCS plasmid, helper plasmid pAd-DeltaF6 (Addgene Plasmid #112867) and the serotype plasmid AAV PHP.eB (Addgene Plasmid #103005). After three days, cell lysates were prepared with 15mM NaCl, 5mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5 followed by three repeats of freeze-thaw cycles. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 30min at 4000rpm to collect the supernatant. Benzonase-treated supernatant (50U/ml, 30 min at 37°C) was added to an Optiprep density gradient (15%, 25%, 40% and 60%) for ultracentrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 1.5hr using a Beckman Ti-70 rotor. AAV fraction was collected from the gradient and concentrated along with multiple washes with DPBS in a 100 kDa filtration unit. AAV titers were quantified by qPCR based on SYBR green technology using primer pair targeting AAV2 ITR (Aurnhammer et al., 2012).

<title>Synaptic Puncta Colocalization Analysis</title>
<p>Confocal images of pre- and postsynaptic puncta were prepared for analysis using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) to convert the raw images into RGB type images with the presynaptic marker (VGlut1/VGlut2 or VGAT) in the red channel, the postsynaptic marker in the green channel (PSD95 or Gephyrin), and the astrocyte marker (mCherry) in the blue channel. Images were then Z-projected to make one projection for every 3 images, representing 1 um of depth in our imaging setup.

<p>The present study described GEARBOCS, an adeno-associated virus tool for in vivo gene editing in astrocytes, which is both timely and of importance for glial biologists, who often are troubled by efficient gene targeting in astrocytes. Overall, the finding is <bold>valuable</bold>, and the strength of the evidence is <bold>solid</bold>. Presumably, there will be great potential associated with GEARBOCS applications in the future.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Bindu et al. created an AAV-based tool (GEARAOCS) to perform in vivo genome editing of mouse astrocytes. The authors engineered a versatile AAV vector that allows for gene deletion through NHNJ, site-specific knock-in by HDR, and gene trap. By utilizing this tool, the authors deleted Sparcl1 virally in subsets of astrocytes and showed that thalamocortical synapses in cortical layer IV are indeed reduced during a critical period of ocular dominance plasticity and in adulthood, whereas there is no change in excitatory synapse number in cortical layer II/III. Furthermore, the authors made a VAMP2 gene-trap AAV vector and showed that astrocyte-derived VAMP2 is required for the maintenance of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This AAV-based tool is versatile for astrocytic gene manipulation in vivo. The work is innovative and exciting, given the paucity of tools available to probe astrocytes in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Several important considerations need to be made for the validation and usage of this tool, including:</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) Efficiency and specificity of spCas9-sgRNA mediated gene knockout in astrocytes. In Figure 3, the authors utilized Sparcl1 gene deletion as the proof-of-principle experiment. The readout for Sparcl1 KO efficiency is solely the immunoreactivity using an antibody raised against Sparcl1. As the method is based on NHEJ, the indels can be diverse and can occur in one allele or two. For the tool and proof-of-principle experiment, it will be important to know the percentage of editing near the PAM site, as well as the actual sequences of indels. This can be done by single-cell PCR of edited astrocytes, similar to the published work (Ye... Chen, Nature Biotechnology 2019).</p>
<p>(2) Along the same line, the authors showed that GEARBOCS TagIn of Sparcl1 resulted in 12.49% efficiency based on the immunohistochemistry of mCherry tag. It is understandable that the knock-in efficiency is much reduced as compared to gene knockout. However, it remains unclear if those 12.49% knock-in cells represent sequence-correct ones, as spCas9-mediated HDR is also an error-prone process, and it may accidentally alter nucleotides near the PAM site without causing the frameshift. The author will need to consider the related evidence or make comments in the discussion.</p>
<p>(3) What are the efficiencies of Sparcl1 GEARBOCS GeneTrap (Figure 3V) and Vamp2 GeneTrap and HA TagIn (Figure 5)?</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) Figure 3H-J. The authors only showed the representative images of Sparcl1 KO. Please consider including the control (without gRNA), given that there are still many Sparcl1+ signals in Figure 3I (likely because of its expression in other cell types?).</p>
<p>(2) In figure 3Q-T, it appears that some Cas9-EGFP+ astrocytes (Q) do not express Sparcl1 (R). Is Sparcl1 expressed in subsets of astrocytes? Does Cas9-EGFP or Sparcl1-TagIn alter Sparcl1 endogenous expression?</p>
<p>(3) On Page 8, for the explanation of the design of the GEARBOCS construct, the authors have made a self-citation (#43). That was a BioRxiv paper that is being reviewed currently.</p>
<p>(4) For Figures 4 and 6, the graphs seem to be made in R with the x-axis labeled as &quot;Condition&quot;. The y-axis labels are too small to read properly, especially in print. It would be better to make the graphs clearer like Figure 2 and Figure 3.</p>
<p>(5) On Page 13, &quot;Figures 3V-Y&quot; were referred to. However, there are no Figures 3W, X, and Y.</p>
<p>(6) There are a few typos in the manuscript, including line 900 &quot;immunofluorescence microscopy images of a Cas9-EGFP-positive astrocytes (green)&quot;.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study described GEARBOCS, an adeno-associated virus tool for in vivo gene editing in astrocytes. This tool is timely and important for glial biologists who often are troubled by efficient gene targeting in astrocytes. Overall the significance of the finding is valuable, and the strength of the evidence is solid. Presumably, there will be great potential associated with GEARBOCS applications in the future.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>As efficient tools for targeting non-neuronal cells in the brains are rather limited for astrocytes and microglia, GEARBOCS adds to the small pool of currently available tools and will provide new options for glial biologists studying these tools. As the study revealed, GEARBOCS are capable of knockout and knockin manipulations for genes of interest, also ascribed with reporter tracking and gene-trap strategy. The promising multi-functional tool will advance our understanding of astrocytes and help to further elucidate the mechanism of neuron-glia interaction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Even though the tool seems promising and powerful. the authors failed to provide more evidence on the robustness and specificity of GEARBOCS. Also, the advantages of GEARBOCS over some of the traditional methods were not clearly stated. Some of these concerns are described below.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sivadasan Bindu et al. developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing strategy using a single AAV vector, named GEARBOCS (Gene Editing in AstRocytes Based On CRISPR/Cas9 System), which enables precise genome manipulation in astrocytes. This tool was shown to effectively perform knockout, tagging, and reporter knock-in gene modifications. The utility of GEARBOCS was demonstrated in two cases: establishing astrocytes as essential for the synaptogenic factor Sparcl1 in thalamocortical synapse maintenance, and revealing that cortical astrocytes express the Vamp2 protein, which is vital for maintaining synapse numbers.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Astrocytes play a crucial role in brain development and function, but studying them in vivo has been challenging due to limited molecular tools for manipulation. Sivadasan Bindu et al. developed a valuable system called GEARBOCS for effective astrocyte infection via retro-orbital injection.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript provides data only from the cerebral cortex and results from P42. Additional data from other brain regions and various time points (e.g., P0-15) are needed. Results from local injection experiments would also enhance the utility of this tool for the broader glial research community.</p>
