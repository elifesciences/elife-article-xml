<title>Abstract</title><p>Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) offer a powerful means for reversible control of neuronal activity through systemic administration of inert actuators. Because chemogenetic control relies on DREADD expression levels, understanding and quantifying the temporal dynamics of their expression is crucial for planning long-term experiments in monkeys. In this study, we longitudinally quantified <italic>in vivo</italic> DREADD expression in macaque monkeys using positron emission tomography with the DREADD-selective tracer [<sup>11</sup>C]deschloroclozapine (DCZ), complemented by functional studies. Twenty macaque monkeys were evaluated after being injected with adeno-associated virus vectors expressing the DREADDs hM4Di or hM3Dq, whose expression was quantified as changes in [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ binding potential from baseline levels. Expression levels of both hM4Di and hM3Dq peaked around 60 days post-injection, remained stable for about 1.5 years, and declined gradually after two years. Significant chemogenetic control of neural activity and behavior persisted for about two years. Virus titer and the presence of protein tags significantly influenced expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing overall expression levels. These findings provide valuable insights and guidelines for optimizing the use of DREADDs in long-term primate studies and potential therapeutic applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemogenetic technology affords remote and reversible control of neuronal activity by expressing receptors that are designed to be activated by systemically delivered biologically inert actuators. One such tool is the widely used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) system, which is based on mutated muscarinic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Roth, 2016</xref>). DREADDs have been widely used in rodent models and their use in nonhuman primates has recently shown some promise, as they could induce significant behavioral changes by simultaneously modulating activity of disparate neuronal populations across large brain regions (Eldridge et al., 2016; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). Whether this promise will translate to reality depends on how long DREADDs can exert their effects. Because the efficacy of chemogenetic manipulation depends on DREADD expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Grayson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Upright et al., 2018</xref>), maintaining high and stable expression levels is critical for ensuring consistent control throughout all experiments in a study. While this has proven possible in rodent studies that typically only span several months, whether it is true for studies involving macaque monkeys, which often last multiple years, remains a question. Indeed, despite the growing use of DREADDs in monkey neuroscience research, consistent and reliable data on the temporal dynamics of DREADD expression following viral transduction remain scarce. Specifically, little is known about how quickly DREADD expression is established following viral transduction or how long it is maintained. This gap in knowledge complicates efforts to optimize critical parameters, such as the serotypes, constructs, and titers of viral vectors that all influence expression level and duration.</p>
<p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is an <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging technique that allows quantification of receptor density in the brain. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of PET for longitudinal measurements of gene expression introduced into the brain via adeno-associated virus (AAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Nerella et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Vandeputte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>). While these studies have highlighted the potential of using PET imaging to monitor gene expression over time, most have used it as an indirect measure of target gene expression, without exploring the relationship between expression levels and the resultant functional outcomes.</p>
<p>Several PET probes have been developed to visualize DREADD receptor expression. Initial studies in rodents used [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine-N-oxide and [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine to monitor DREADD expression in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ji et al., 2016</xref>). In nonhuman primates, longitudinal PET studies using [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine have successfully tracked virally expressed DREADDs in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). More recently, DREADD-selective ligands such as [<sup>18</sup>F]JHU37107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Bonaventura et al., 2019</xref>) and [<sup>11</sup>C]deschloroclozapine ([<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>) have been developed. Among these, [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ has become a particularly useful tracer for studying DREADD-mediated functional manipulation in macaques and marmosets. This PET ligand allows researchers to verify the location and density of DREADD expression at the site of AAV injection and at projection sites, as demonstrated in numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hirabayashi et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hori et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Mimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Miyakawa et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Miyake et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mueller et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oyama et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2022a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">2022b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Roseboom et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, unlike post-mortem analysis that relies on the detection of fused or expressed protein tags, [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET provides a direct, quantitative, and non-invasive measure of DREADD expression level <italic>in vivo</italic>, using standard reference tissue models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET thus serves as a valuable tool for tracking DREADD expression levels throughout long-term chemogenetics experiments in monkeys.</p>
<p>As the developer of the DREADD-selective agonist DCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>), we have consistently performed multiple [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET scans as part of our DREADD experiments in monkeys, including at baseline before AAV injection, 30–120 days post-injection, and then periodically over the course of the experiments. For the current study, we analyzed these PET data to examine the short- and long-term dynamics of DREADD expression <italic>in vivo</italic> and assessed how these changes correlated with the ability to manipulate neuronal activity or behavior. Our results provide valuable information with a few caveats and indicate that the promise of using DREADDs in long-term monkey experiments is real.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>PET imaging data using [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ were collected from 15 monkeys before (baseline) and after injections of AAV vectors for expressing hM4Di or hM3Dq (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). To achieve neuron-specific expression, we used AAV vectors with a preference for neuronal infection, such as AAV2 or AAV2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kimura et al., 2023</xref>), or for incorporation with neuron-specific promoters (e.g., human synapsin promoter; hSyn). To assess the specific binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ, we calculated the binding potential relative to a non-displaceable radioligand (BP<sub>ND</sub>) using a multilinear reference tissue model with the cerebellum as a reference region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). DREADD expression levels were then quantified as the change in BP<sub>ND</sub> (ΔBP<sub>ND</sub>) from baseline values. This approach allowed us to longitudinally and quantitatively monitor the dynamics of DREADD expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Peak DREADD expression occurred approximately 60 days post-injection</title>
<p>To evaluate the temporal profile of DREADD expression and determine how quickly expression was established following transduction, we analyzed the [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET data from seven monkeys that received AAV vector injection into the subcortical regions of their brains (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The data were selected according to the following criteria: (1) the titer of injected viral vector was 1.0– 3.0×10<sup>13</sup> gc/ml, (2) peak ΔBP<sub>ND</sub> value was increased by more than 0.5, and (3) PET scans were repeatedly performed until 150 days post-injection. Analysis showed that expression levels of hM4Di and hM3Dq increased rapidly, reaching peak expression at approximately 60 days after viral vector injection. Notably, no clear differences in expression dynamics were observed between hM3Dq and hM4Di (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We then conducted a longitudinal assessment of post-peak expression levels for hM4Di and hM3Dq using repeated [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET measurements from 16 injection sites, including cortical and subcortical regions, across 11 monkeys. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the temporal changes in normalized ΔBP<sub>ND</sub>, expressed as a percentage of the peak value observed around 60 days post-AAV injection. hM4Di expression levels remained stable at peak levels for approximately 1.5 years before gradually declining after 2 years (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared with hM4Di, hM3Dq expression exhibited greater post-peak fluctuations, but nevertheless remained at ∼75% of peak levels after about 1 year and declined to ∼50% by 2 years post-injection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This post-peak fluctuation was not explained by the cumulative number of times receptors were activated with DCZ (repeated measures two-way ANOVA, main effect of activation times, F<sub>(1,6)</sub>=5.745, p=0.054).</p>

<title>DREADDs effectively modulated neuronal activity and behavior for approximately two years</title>
<p>We assessed data from 17 monkeys to evaluate the duration over which DREADD activation produced significant effects on neural activity and behavior. Monkeys expressing hM4Di were assessed through behavioral testing (N = 11) and alterations in neuronal activity using electrophysiology (N = 2). Monkeys expressing hM3Dq were assessed for changes in glucose metabolism via [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG-PET (N = 5) or alterations in neuronal activity using electrophysiology (N = 1). Across these assessments, significant chemogenetic effects were observed for up to three years following AAV vector injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). For example, one monkey with bilateral hM4Di expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; monkey #229) consistently displayed impaired performance on the delayed response task with DCZ administration for up to 2.3 years (867 days) following vector injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oyama et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, another monkey with hM3Dq expression in the amygdala (monkey #215) exhibited increased glucose metabolism following DCZ administration for up to 2.5 years (926 days) following vector injection, as measured by FDG-PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Although experiment durations varied across monkeys, we consistently observed significant effects throughout the study periods, with only one monkey (#234) being removed from experiments due to a loss of DREADD effectiveness three years after transduction. In all other cases, receptor activation was performed repeatedly several tens of times, resulting in no clear loss of efficacy. After the termination of the chemogenetic studies, DREADD expression was verified by <italic>in vitro</italic> via postmortem immunohistochemical analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-H</xref>). These findings highlight the robust and sustained functionality of DREADD systems in long-term experiments.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, after more than three years, we observed the disappearance of hM4Di expression in one monkey (#234), and this was associated with the loss of chemogenetic behavioral effects. Specifically, activating hM4Di in the functionally defined representation of index finger primary somatosensory cortex (SI<sub>D2</sub>) resulted in reversible behavioral deficits for two years, including impaired finger dexterity and hypersensitivity in the foot, confined to the contralateral side (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hirabayashi et al., 2021</xref>). However, <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging more than three years after injection indicated diminished hM4Di expression, and subsequent behavioral assessments failed to detect any motor deficits or hypersensitivity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Post-mortem immunohistochemical examination confirmed the absence hM4Di, with no evidence of neuronal loss at the injection site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Factors affecting DREADD expression levels</title>
<p>Finally, we investigated the factors influencing the level of DREADD expression. Despite examining expression across various cortical and subcortical brain regions, including the caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala, thalamus, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and SI, we found that peak expression level did not clearly depend on any specific brain area (one-way ANOVA, effect of brain region, <italic>P</italic> = 0.154). However, comparing peak expression among different viral vector constructs suggested several factors that might have influenced peak expression levels.</p>
<p>To identify these factors, we applied a linear model incorporating multiple variables, including serotype, promoter, titer, tag, and DREADD type. Our analysis revealed that virus titer, along with its interaction with DREADD type, significantly influenced expression levels (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, including co-expressed protein tags led to reduced peak expression levels, with the vector encoding the fusion HA-tag sequence at the 5’-terminal site (5’-HA) of the DREADD sequence exerting a stronger suppressive effect compared with the vector with GFP encoding following the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>DREADDs have emerged as invaluable tools in nonhuman primate research due to their ability to exert effects on non-spatially restricted brain regions, allowing for simultaneous and discrete targeting of multiple areas. This capability makes DREADDs promising for investigating the causal roles of specific neural pathways and cell types in the highly specialized brain circuits found in primates. However, ethical and logistical constraints on using a large number of monkeys highlight the need of moving beyond a trial-and-error approach. It is essential to aggregate data and provide insights that are more widely applicable, thus enabling the development of a more efficient experimental design for DREADD research in monkeys. <italic>In vivo</italic> PET visualization of DREADDs offers a non-invasive and quantitative means for real-time monitoring of receptor expression. The present study analyzed PET and functional/behavioral data from 43 injection sites across 20 monkeys and revealed three key findings: (1) after AAV injection, DREADD expression levels peaked after approximately 60 days and remained stable for up to 1.5 years, followed by a gradual decline observed after two years; (2) significant chemogenetic effects on neural activity and behavior persisted for around two years; and (3) virus titer and protein tags significantly influenced peak expression levels, with co-expressed protein tags reducing peak expression. These results offer quantitative insights into the temporal dynamics of DREADD expression, thereby informing strategies for designing long-term experiments. They also confirm the efficacy and reliability of DREADD-mediated interventions.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Technical considerations</title>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic> monitoring of gene expression has been conducted using fluorescent reporters observed through a window or fiber, providing a method to verify transducing protein expression and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Diester et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ruiz et al., 2013</xref>). Although useful for optogenetics or imaging studies, these methods are invasive, less quantitative, and spatially limited, often requiring cranial surgeries and capturing only two-dimensional data. In contrast, DCZ PET imaging provides a direct, non-invasive, volumetric measure of receptor expression, making it particularly suitable for studies in large animals such as macaques and for translational research with potential application to future human therapies.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, PET measurement has certain limitations, including potential variability due to individual differences, underestimation of DREADD expression levels due to the partial volume effect, and the influence of anesthesia on kinetic parameters during imaging sessions. In this study, we have considered these factors and minimized their impact by applying appropriate ROI placements and excluding data collected under inadequate anesthetic conditions (see Methods).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Temporal dynamics of DREADD expression</title>
<p>Our [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET measurement showed that DREADD expression peaked around 60 days after AAV injection, regardless of whether hM4Di or hM3Dq was used. This pattern was consistent with our previous data of hM4Di expression visualized using [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). This gradual rise in AAV-mediated gene expression likely reflects rate-limiting steps following viral infection, including transport to the nucleus, uncoating, and conversion to double-strand DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Duan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ferrari et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Li and Samulski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Similar temporal patterns of AAV-mediated gene expression have been observed in previous studies using <italic>in vivo</italic> fluorescent measurement. For example, in rats transfected with an AAV5 encoding fluorescence protein (EYFP) in motor cortex and the hippocampus, <italic>in vivo</italic> fluorescence signals increased sigmoidally, rapidly until day 35, then slowed down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Diester et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, in macaques, ChR2 expression monitored via fluorescence intensity peaked at around 60 days after AAV9 injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nakamichi et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our findings are based on a limited dataset targeting neuronal DREADD expression, they offer important insights for designing chemogenetics studies in primates. Specifically, beginning functional experiments at approximately 60 days post-AAV injection will yield reliable results, avoiding unnecessary delays. This timeline may also be applicable to other genetic studies in monkeys, such as those using optogenetics or calcium imaging, which also require proper expression of functional proteins. However, while these tools rely on rapid, light driven responses and are relatively less dependent on stable functional protein expression, DREADDs require sustained expression for consistent long-term effects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Factors influencing DREADD expression</title>
<p>Our analysis indicated that both virus titer and the presence of protein tags significantly influenced DREADD expression levels. In general, while higher AAV titers result in increased transgene expression in neurons, excessively high titers can trigger immune responses, necessitating caution in their use. In the current study, we used titers that ranged from 1 to 5 × 10<sup>13</sup> gc/ml, achieving a balance between effective expression and minimal immune activation. Using vectors encoding DREADDs with protein tags, particularly 5’-terminal HA tags, was associated with a reduction of peak expression levels. Thus, although these tags are commonly used for antibody detection in DREADD constructs, they negatively impact expression efficacy and potentially affect protein function. Our findings are consistent with a previous PET study using [<sup>11</sup>C]clozapine and immunohistochemical analysis, which also found reduced hM4Di expression in constructs with 5’-terminal HA tags (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, constructs incorporating IRES-GFP might also result in lower expression levels due to the size and composition of the AAV vector, as has been shown in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Furler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kimura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Mizuguchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhou et al., 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, these constructs have been frequently used in rodent research and have also been effective in producing long-term chemogenetic effects in monkey studies, including the current one (e.g., monkeys #229 and #238). Thus, while the observed decline in DREADD expression resulting from these constructs is not inherently detrimental to experimental outcomes in monkey studies, it serves as a warning that we must be careful when designing vectors to avoid reductions in experimental efficacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3d">
<title>Implications for long-term experiments with DREADD expression</title>
<p>One of the most important findings was that AAV-mediated DREADD expression was maintained for up to 2 years for hM4Di and 1 year for hM3Dq. Throughout the duration of the experiments, chemogenetic effects remained consistent, as verified by individual behavioral and functional assessments. However, hM4Di expression diminished after 3 years, coinciding with the loss of chemogenetic behavioral effects in at least one case. This indicates that while chemogenetic effects can be maintained for up to two years, they likely decline gradually beyond this period. Consequently, researchers should anticipate consistent chemogenetic effects for a maximum of two years following AAV injection, and should be mindful that longer-term experiments risk a decline in effectiveness. Specifically, the inevitable failure to detect DREADDs via immunohistochemistry highlights an important caveat for researchers: timely termination of experiments to ensure verification through <italic>in vitro</italic> examination is necessary.</p>
<p>The gradual decline in expression levels observed beyond two years has several potential causes. First, AAV vectors typically remain episomal in transduced cells, without integrating into the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Weitzman and Linden, 2011</xref>). While this poses less of an issue in non-dividing neurons, episomal DNA can still be subject to gradual loss or degradation over time. Second, several mechanisms may contribute the gradual downregulation of transgene expression, including epigenetic modifications, immune responses, and genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Muhuri et al., 2022</xref>). For example promoter silencing—often associated with epigenetic modifications—has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Gray et al., 2011</xref>). Neuron-specific promoters have been shown to achieve more efficient and prolonged transgene expression than ubiquitous promoters like CMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Paterna et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study found no evidence of cell death at AAV injection sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that neuronal loss was not a primary cause of the eventual decline in expression levels. Repeated receptor activation did not affect DREADD expression levels or chemogenetic efficacy in a previous study (Oyama et al., 2022). Thus, understanding the factors that contribute to the decline in expression remains of critical importance for developing optimal strategies to maintain persistent transgene expression in neurons, both for chemogenetic studies and therapeutic applications. Despite this uncertainty, our data offers important guidelines for chemogenetics studies in nonhuman primates, demonstrating that up to two years of reliable expression is achievable.</p>

<title>Translational implications</title>
<p>This research has significant translational implication, particularly for the development of DREADD-based therapies for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. DREADD-based approaches have shown promising therapeutic potential, with successful application in monkey models of disease conditions such as epileptiform seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Miyakawa et al., 2023</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Extending these findings to human clinical applications positions PET imaging as a powerful tool for real-time, non-invasive confirmation of target protein expression—a critical factor for ensuring therapeutic efficacy. PET reporter imaging has already shown its value in human gene therapy for certain movement disorders, where sustained protein expression has been correlated with treatment efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Mittermeyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Tai et al., 2022</xref>). Our study reinforces this utility by demonstrating that when DREADD expression was no longer detectable via PET, the chemogenetic effects were also diminished.</p>

<p>Our study describes short- and long-term dynamics of DREADD expression in nonhuman primates using [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ PET imaging, complemented by assessment of functional efficacy. The findings provide critical insights into the practicality of multi-year studies using chemogenetic neuromodulation with DREADDs, including the expression time course and factors affecting expression stability. This work offers valuable guidance for designing future long-term nonhuman primate studies, and underscores the translational potential of using DREADDs combined with PET imaging for non-invasive, gene-targeted therapies for neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Surgical procedures and viral vector injections</title>
<p>Surgical procedures have been described in detail in the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Hirabayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Oyama et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2022a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2021</xref>). The AAV vectors and brain regions into which they were injected are summarized in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Before surgery, structural scans of the head were acquired via magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (7 tesla 400 mm/SS system, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) and X-ray computed tomography (CT) (Accuitomo170, J. MORITA CO., Kyoto, Japan) under anesthesia (continuous intravenous infusion of propofol 0.2–0.6 mg/kg/min). Overlay MR and CT images were created using PMOD<sup>®</sup> image analysis software (PMOD 4.4, PMOD Technologies Ltd, Zurich, Switzerland) to estimate the stereotaxic coordinates of target brain structures.</p>
<p>Surgeries were performed under aseptic conditions in a fully equipped operating suite. We monitored body temperature, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and endo-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> throughout all surgical procedures. Monkeys were immobilized by intramuscular (i.m.) injection of ketamine (5–10 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.2–0.5 mg/kg) after i.m. injection of atropine sulfate (0.02–0.05 mg/kg) and then intubated with an endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (1%–3%, to effect). After surgery, prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics (cefmetazole, 25–50 mg/kg/day; ketoprofen, 1–2 mg/kg/day) were administered for 7 days.</p>
<p>Viral vectors were injected with a stereotaxic apparatus or a hand-held syringe. For stereotaxic injection, burr holes (∼8 mm in diameter) were created for inserting the injection needle. Viruses were pressure-injected using a 10-μl Hamilton syringe (model 1701 RN, Hamilton, Reno, UV) mounted on a motorized microinjector (UMP3T-2, WPI, Sarasota, FL) held by a manipulator (model 1460, David Kopf, Tujunga, CA) on the stereotaxic frame. After making an approximately 3 mm cut in the dura mater, the injection needle was inserted into the brain and slowly moved down 1 to 2 mm beyond the target and then kept stationary for 5 min, after which it was pulled back up to the target location. Injection speed was 0.1 to 0.5 μl/min. After each injection, the needle remained <italic>in situ</italic> for 15 min to minimize backflow along the needle and then was pulled out very slowly.</p>
<p>For handheld injection, the target cortex of was exposed by removing a bone flap and reflecting the dura mater. Injections were made under visual guidance through an operating microscope (Leica M220, Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany) at an oblique angle to the brain surface. Each hemisphere received nine tracks of injections: one at the caudal tip, four along the dorsal bank, and four along the ventral bank of the principal sulcus, with 3 to 5 µL per track, depending on the depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Oyama et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>PET imaging</title>
<p>PET imaging was conducted as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, PET scans were performed using a microPET Focus 220 scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Malvern, USA). Monkeys were initially immobilized with ketamine (5–10 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.2–0.5 mg/kg) and maintained under anesthesia with isoflurane (1%–3%) throughout the PET procedures. The isoflurane level was carefully adjusted to ensure the stability of continuously monitoring physiological parameters, such as body temperature, heart rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and endo-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>. Endo-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> levels were maintained between 35 and 45 mmHg to prevent substantial changes in cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Markwalder et al., 1984</xref>), which could impact tracer kinetics. Transmission scans were performed for about 20 min with a Ge-68 source. Emission scans were acquired in 3D list mode with an energy window of 350–750 keV after intravenous bolus injection of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ (∼350 MBq) and [<sup>18</sup>F]FDG (∼200 MBq). Data acquisition lasted for 90 min.</p>
<p>To estimate the specific binding of [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ, regional binding potential relative to a non-displaceable radioligand (BP<sub>ND</sub>) was calculated by PMOD<sup>®</sup> with an original multilinear reference tissue model (MRTMo) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). The cerebellum was used as a reference region, and t* was 15 min. The DREADD expression level was defined as ΔBP<sub>ND,</sub> calculated by subtracting the pre-injection value from the post-injection value because the BP<sub>ND</sub> value included off-target binding. This minimized individual differences because off-target binding varied among subjects. The volumes of interest (VOIs) reflecting DREADD expression were identified by drawing contours at half of the maximum ΔBP<sub>ND</sub> value in the ΔBP<sub>ND</sub> parametric image, which was smoothed with a 2 mm Gaussian filter, and overlaid onto the corresponding region in each individual MR image.</p>
<p>For the FDG study, DCZ (1 μg/kg) or vehicle was administered intravenously 1 min before FDG injection. Data were converted to Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) images, averaged between 30- and 60-min, and normalized to SUV ratio (SUVR) images using the mean whole-brain value. Metabolic changes induced by DCZ were calculated as ΔSUVR and defined by the different DCZ and vehicle conditions, with VOIs for FDG analysis matching those used in the [<sup>11</sup>C]DCZ-PET study.</p>

<title>Administration of DREADD agonists</title>
<p>DCZ (HY-42110, MedChemExpress) and CNO (Toronto Research) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Co.), aliquoted, and stored at −30 °C. These stock solutions were then diluted in saline to a final volume of 0.1 ml (2.5% DMSO in saline), achieving a dose of 0.1 ml/kg and 3 mg/kg for DCZ and CNO, respectively. For behavioral testing, an agonist was injected 15 min before experiments began, unless otherwise noted. Fresh solutions were prepared on each day of usage.</p>

<title>Behavioral tasks</title>
<p>The behavioral experiments are summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Complete descriptions of the detailed procedures for each behavioral experiment are available in the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Hirabayashi et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hori et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Oyama et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">2022b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">2021</xref>). Here we focus on a modified Brinkman board task and a sensitivity to cold stimulation task, which were used to analyze the behavior of a monkey (#234) that had hM4Di expressed in its primary somatosensory cortex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). In the modified Brinkman board task, monkeys picked food pellets out of 10 slots in a board with one of their hands (i.e., contralateral or ipsilateral to the DREADD-expressing hemisphere), and the amount of time needed to pick up all ten items was recorded. The time to complete each trial was normalized to the number of pellets successfully picked up to obtain a value that reflected manual dexterity. In a single experimental session, the monkey performed five to ten trials with each hand before and 10 min after intravenous systemic administration of DCZ. In the sensitivity to cold task, monkeys were trained to place the sole of their foot on a cold metal plate that was placed in front of their monkey chair. The latency with which they withdrew their foot from the plate was recorded and used as an index of sensitivity to a cutaneous (cold) stimulus. If a monkey did not withdraw its foot within 60 s, the trial was terminated and a withdraw latency of 60 s was assigned for that trial. The monkeys performed five to ten trials for each of two temperature conditions (30°C for control and 10°C for cold stimulation) both before and 10 min after DCZ administration. Chemogenetic effects were assessed by comparing performance on the tasks pre- and post-injection and between contralateral and ipsilateral hands and feet (only the contralateral side should be affected by DCZ).</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All data and statistical analyses were performed using the R statistical computing environment (R Development Core Team, 2004). One way ANOVA was used to examine the relationship between vector injection sites (caudate, putamen, thalamus, amygdala, OFC, and SI) and peak expression level (peak ΔBP<sub>ND</sub> value). Repeated measures two-way ANOVA was used to examine the effect of cumulative number of activation times × days after injection on post-peak fluctuation. A stepwise model selection using the <monospace>MASS::stepAIC()</monospace> function was performed to identify factors influencing the peak expression level. Starting with a full model that included five factors—virus titer, serotype, promoter, DREADD type, and tag—along with all their interactions, the best-fitting linear model was determined based on Akaike information criterion (AIC). The resulting best model included four variables, excluding serotype, and three interactions (Titer:DREADD type, Titer:Promoter, and DREADD type:Promoter). The significance of their contributions to the peak expression level, as well as the effect sizes (generalized eta squared), were assessed using Type II analysis of variance with the <monospace>rstatix::anova_test()</monospace> function.</p>

<title>Histology and immunostaining</title>
<p>For histological inspection, monkeys were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, i.v.) or sodium thiopental (50 mg/kg, i.v.) after administration of ketamine hydrochloride (5‒10 mg/kg, i.m.) and then transcardially perfused with saline at 4°C, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at 4°C. The brain was removed from the skull, postfixed in the same fresh fixative overnight, saturated with 30% sucrose in phosphate buffer (PB) at 4°C, and then cut serially into 50-μm-thick sections on a freezing microtome. For visualizing immunoreactive GFP (co-expressed with hM4Di) signals, a series of every 6th section was immersed in 1% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (1:500, G10362, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% normal goat serum for 2 days at 4°C. The sections were then incubated in the same fresh medium containing biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:1,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC Elite, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA) for 2 h at room temperature. For visualizing the antigen, the sections were reacted in 0.05 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.04% diaminobenzidine (DAB), 0.04% NiCl<sub>2</sub>, and 0.003% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The sections were mounted on gelatin-coated glass slides, air-dried, and cover-slipped. Parts of other sections were Nissl-stained with 1% Cresyl violet.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Inhibitory hM4Di and excitatory hM3Dq DREADDs are currently the most commonly utilized chemogenetic tools in the field of nonhuman primate research, but there is a lack of available information regarding the temporal aspects of virally-mediated DREADD expression and function. Nagai et al. investigated the longitudinal expression and efficacy of DREADDs to modulate neuronal activity in the macaque model. The authors demonstrate that both hM4Di and hM3Dq DREADDs reach peak expression levels after approximately 60 days and are stably expressed for a period of at least 1.5 years in the macaque brain. During this period, DREADDs effectively modulated neuronal activity, as evidenced by a variety of measures, including behavioural testing, functional imaging, and/or electrophysiological recording. Notably, some of the data suggest that DREADD expression may decline after two years. This is a novel finding and has important implications for the utilization of this technology for long-term studies, as well as its potential therapeutic applications. Lastly, the authors highlight that peak DREADD expression may be significantly influenced by the choice of viral titer and the expressed protein tag, emphasizing the importance of careful design and selection of viral constructs for neuroscientific research. This study represents a critical step in the field of chemogenetics, setting the scene for future development and optimization of this technology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The longitudinal approach of this study provides important preliminary insights into the long-term utility of chemogenetics, which has not yet been thoroughly explored.</p>
<p>The data presented are novel and inclusive, relying on well-established in vivo imaging methods, as well as behavioral and immunohistochemical techniques. The conclusions made by the authors are generally supported by a combination of these techniques. In particular, the utilization of in vivo imaging as a non-invasive method is translationally relevant and likely to make an impact in the field of chemogenetics, such that other researchers may adopt this method of longitudinal assessment in their own experiments. Rigorous standards have been applied to the datasets, and the appropriate controls have been included where possible.</p>
<p>The number of macaque subjects (20) from which data was available is also notable. Behavioral testing was performed in 11 subjects, FDG-PET in 5, electrophysiology in 1, and [11C]DCZ-PET in 15. This is an impressive accumulation of work that will surely be appreciated by the growing community of researchers using chemogenetics in nonhuman primates.</p>
<p>The implication that chemogenetic effects can be maintained for up to 1.5-2 years, followed by a gradual decline beyond this period, is an important development in knowledge. The limited duration of DREADD expression may present an obstacle in the translation of chemogenetic technology as a potential therapeutic tool, and it will be of interest for researchers to explore whether this limitation can be overcome. This study therefore represents a key starting point upon which future research can build.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the conclusions of the paper are mostly supported by the data but may be overstated in some cases, and some details are also missing or not easily recognizable within the figures. The provision of additional information and analyses would be valuable to the reader and may even benefit the authors' interpretation of the data.</p>
<p>The conclusion that DREADD expression gradually decreases after 1.5-2 years is only based on a select few of the subjects assessed; in Figure 2, it appears that only 3 hM4Di cases and 2 hM3Dq cases are assessed after the 2-year timepoint. The observed decline appears consistent within the hM4Di cases, but not for the hM3Dq cases (see Figure 2C: the AAV2.1-hSyn-hM3Dq-IRES-AcGFP line is increasing after 2 years.)</p>
<p>Given that individual differences may affect expression levels, it would be helpful to see additional labels on the graphs (or in the legends) indicating which subject and which region are being represented for each line and/or data point in Figure 1C, 2B, 2C, 5A, and 5B. Alternatively, for Figures 5A and B, an accompanying table listing this information would be sufficient.</p>
<p>While the authors comment on several factors that may influence peak expression levels, including serotype, promoter, titer, tag, and DREADD type, they do not comment on the volume of injection. The range in volume used per region in this study is between 2 and 54 microliters, with larger volumes typically (but not always) being used for cortical regions like the OFC and dlPFC, and smaller volumes for subcortical regions like the amygdala and putamen. This may weaken the claim that there is no significant relationship between peak expression level and brain region, as volume may be considered a confounding variable. Additionally, because of the possibility that larger volumes of viral vectors may be more likely to induce an immune response, which the authors suggest as a potential influence on transgene expression, not including volume as a factor of interest seems to be an oversight.</p>
<p>The authors conclude that vectors encoding co-expressed protein tags (such as HA) led to reduced peak expression levels, relative to vectors with an IRES-GFP sequence or with no such element at all. While interesting, this finding does not necessarily seem relevant for the efficacy of long-term expression and function, given that the authors show in Figures 1 and 2 that peak expression (as indicated by a change in binding potential relative to non-displaced radioligand, or ΔBPND) appears to taper off in all or most of the constructs assessed. The authors should take care to point out that the decline in peak expression should not be confused with the decline in longitudinal expression, as this is not clear in the discussion; i.e. the subheading, &quot;Factors influencing DREADD expression,&quot; might be better written as, &quot;Factors influencing peak DREADD expression,&quot; and subsequent wording in this section should specify that these particular data concern peak expression only.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This paper reports histological, PET imaging, functional, and behavioural data evaluating the longevity of AAV2 infection in multiple brain areas of macaques in the context of DREADD experiments. The central aim is to provide unprecedented information about how long the expression of HM4di or HM3dq receptors is expressed and efficient in modulating brain functions after vector injections. The data show peak expression after 40 to 60 days of vector injection, and stable expressions for up to 1.5 years for hM4di, and that hM3dq remained mostly at 75% of peak after a year, declining to 50% after 2 years. DREADDs effectively modulated neuronal activity and behaviour for approximately two years, evaluated with behavioral testings, neural recordings, or FDG-PET. A statistical evaluation revealed that vector titers, DREADD type, and tags contribute to the measured peak level of DREADD expression.</p>
<p>The article presents a thorough discussion of the limitations and specificities of chemogenetic approaches in monkeys.</p>
<p>Strength</p>
<p>These are unique data, in non-human primates (NHP), an animal model that not only features physiological and immunological characteristics similar to humans but also contribute to neurobiological functional studies on a long timescale with experiments spanning months or years. This evaluation of the long-term efficacy of DREADDs will be very important for all laboratories using this approach in NHP but also for future use of such approach in experimental therapies. The longevity estimates are based on multiple approaches including behavioural and neurophysiological ones, thus providing information on the functional efficacy of DREADD expression.</p>
<p>Performing such evaluation requires specific tools like PET imaging that very few monkey labs have access to in the world. This study was done by the laboratory that has developed the radiotracer c11-DCZ used here, a radiotracer binding selectively to DREADDs and providing, using PET, quantitative in vivo measures of DREADD expression. This study and its data should thus be a reference in the field, providing estimates to plan future chemogenetic experiments.</p>
<p>Publishing databases of experimental outcomes in NHP DREADD experiments is crucial for the community because such experiments are rare, expensive, and long. It contributes to refining experiments and reducing the number of animals overall used in the domain.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>This study is a meta-analysis of several experiments performed in one lab. The good side is that it combined a large amount of data that might not have been published individually; the downside is that all things were not planned and equated, creating a lot of unexplained variances in the data. This was yet judiciously used by the authors, but one might think that planned and organized multicentric experiments would provide more information and help test more parameters, including some related to inter-individual variability, and particular genetic constructs.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>This manuscript, from the developers of the novel DREADD-selective agonist DCZ (Nagai et al., 2020), utilizes a unique dataset where multiple PET scans in a large number of monkeys, including baseline scans before AAV injection, 30-120 days post-injection, and then periodically over the course of the prolonged experiments, were performed to access short- and long-term dynamics of DREADD expression in vivo, and to associate DREADD expression with the efficacy of manipulating the neuronal activity or behavior. The goal was to provide critical insights into the practicality and design of multi-year studies using chemogenetics and to elucidate factors affecting expression stability.</p>
<p>Strengths are systematic quantitative assessment of the effects of both excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs, quantification of both the short-term and longer-term dynamics, a wide range of functional assessment approaches (behavior, electrophysiology, imaging), and assessment of factors affecting DREADD expression levels, such as serotype, promoter, titer (concentration), tag, and DREADD type.</p>
<p>Minor weaknesses are related to a few instances of suboptimal phrasing, and some room for improvement in time course visualization and quantification. These would be easily addressed in a revision.</p>
<p>These findings will undoubtedly have a very significant impact on the rapidly growing but still highly challenging field of primate chemogenetic manipulations. As such, the work represents an invaluable resource for the community.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful and constructive feedback. We are pleased that the reviewer found the overall conclusions of our paper to be well supported by the data, and we appreciate the suggestions for improving figure clarity and interpretive accuracy. Below we address each point raised:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The conclusion that DREADD expression gradually decreases after 1.5-2 years is only based on a select few of the subjects assessed; in Figure 2, it appears that only 3 hM4Di cases and 2 hM3Dq cases are assessed after the 2-year timepoint. The observed decline appears consistent within the hM4Di cases, but not for the hM3Dq cases (see Figure 2C: the AAV2.1-hSyn-hM3Dq-IRES-AcGFP line is increasing after 2 years.)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that our interpretation should be stated more cautiously, given the limited number of cases assessed beyond the two-year timepoint. In the revised manuscript, we will clarify in both the Results and Discussion that the observed decline is based on a subset of animals. We will also state that while a consistent decline was observed in hM4Di-expressing monkeys, the trajectory for hM3Dq expression was more variable—with at least one case showing increased in signal beyond two years.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given that individual differences may affect expression levels, it would be helpful to see additional labels on the graphs (or in the legends) indicating which subject and which region are being represented for each line and/or data point in Figure 1C, 2B, 2C, 5A, and 5B. Alternatively, for Figures 5A and B, an accompanying table listing this information would be sufficient.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful suggestions. In response, we will revise the relevant figures as noted in the “Recommendations for the authors”, including simplifying visual encodings and improving labeling. We will also provide a supplementary table listing the animal ID and brain regions for each data point shown in the graphs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the authors comment on several factors that may influence peak expression levels, including serotype, promoter, titer, tag, and DREADD type, they do not comment on the volume of injection. The range in volume used per region in this study is between 2 and 54 microliters, with larger volumes typically (but not always) being used for cortical regions like the OFC and dlPFC, and smaller volumes for subcortical regions like the amygdala and putamen. This may weaken the claim that there is no significant relationship between peak expression level and brain region, as volume may be considered a confounding variable. Additionally, because of the possibility that larger volumes of viral vectors may be more likely to induce an immune response, which the authors suggest as a potential influence on transgene expression, not including volume as a factor of interest seems to be an oversight.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. We agree that injection volume is a potentially confounding variable. In response, we will conduct an exploratory analysis including volume as an additional factor. We will also expand the Discussion to highlight the need for future systematic evaluation of injection volume, especially in relation to immune responses or transduction efficiency in different brain regions.</p>

While interesting, this finding does not necessarily seem relevant for the efficacy of long-term expression and function, given that the authors show in Figures 1 and 2 that peak expression (as indicated by a change in binding potential relative to non-displaced radioligand, or ΔBPND) appears to taper off in all or most of the constructs assessed. The authors should take care to point out that the decline in peak expression should not be confused with the decline in longitudinal expression, as this is not clear in the discussion; i.e. the subheading, &quot;Factors influencing DREADD expression,&quot; might be better written as, &quot;Factors influencing peak DREADD expression,&quot; and subsequent wording in this section should specify that these particular data concern peak expression only.</p>

<p>We appreciate this important clarification. In response, we will revise the title to “Factors influencing peak DREADD expression levels”, and we will specify that our analysis focused on peak ΔBP<sub>ND</sub> values around 60 days post-injection. We will also explicitly distinguish these findings from the later-stage changes in expression seen in the longitudinal PET data in both the Results and Discussion sections.</p>

<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>This study is a meta-analysis of several experiments performed in one lab. The good side is that it combined a large amount of data that might not have been published individually; the downside is that all things were not planned and equated, creating a lot of unexplained variances in the data. This was yet judiciously used by the authors, but one might think that planned and organized multicentric experiments would provide more information and help test more parameters, including some related to inter-individual variability, and particular genetic constructs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this important point to our attention. We fully agree that the retrospective nature of our dataset, compiled from multiple studies conducted within a single laboratory, introduces variability due to differences in constructs, injection sites, and timelines. While this reflects the real-world constraints of long-term NHP research, we acknowledge the need for more standardized approaches. We will add a statement in the revised Discussion emphasizing that future multicenter and harmonized studies would be valuable for systematically examining specific parameters and inter-individual variability.</p>

<p>Minor weaknesses are related to a few instances of suboptimal phrasing, and some room for improvement in time course visualization and quantification. These would be easily addressed in a revision.</p>
<p>These findings will undoubtedly have a very significant impact on the rapidly growing but still highly challenging field of primate chemogenetic manipulations. As such, the work represents an invaluable resource for the community.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our manuscript and for the constructive suggestions noted in the “Recommendations for the authors”. In response, we will carefully review and revise the manuscript to improve visualization and quantification.</p>
