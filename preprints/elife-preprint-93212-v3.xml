<title>Abstract</title><p>Tissue clearing and labeling techniques have revolutionized brain-wide imaging and analysis, yet their application to clinical formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks remains challenging. We introduce HIF-Clear, a novel method for efficiently clearing and labeling centimeter-thick FFPE specimens using elevated temperature and concentrated detergents. HIF-Clear with multi-round immunolabeling reveals neuron circuitry regulating multiple neurotransmitter systems in a whole FFPE mouse brain, and is able to be used as the evaluation of disease treatment efficiency. HIF-Clear also supports expansion microscopy and can be performed on a non-sectioned 15-year-old FFPE specimen, as well as a 3-month formalin-fixed mouse brain. Thus, HIF-Clear represents a feasible approach for researching archived FFPE specimens for future neuroscientific and 3D neuropathological analyses.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clinical brain tissues play a critical role in unraveling the molecular mechanisms underlying neurological diseases and facilitating the development of effective treatments,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]</sup> and also represent an invaluable resource for retrospective studies on rare diseases or conditions with long-term outcomes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]</sup> Currently, the majority of archived clinical specimens are stored in the form of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks. Advanced molecular analysis tools—such as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), DNA/RNA sequencing (DNA/RNA-seq), and Luminex assays—have been performed on FFPE specimens to enable comprehensive analysis from genomic, transcriptional, and proteomic perspectives.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup> However, image-based qualification and quantification of FFPE samples remains limited to performing chemical staining and immunohistochemistry on thin sections. Although whole-slide imaging enables unbiased analyses of entire tissue sections,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]</sup> its two-dimensional (2D) nature cannot provide the 3D information required for accurate quantification. Such quantification in neurobiological contexts is crucial for evaluating neuronal damage and neuroprotection, including neuronal cell counts and the extent of necrosis. Moreover, such 2D-based techniques also fail to reveal structural changes within target tissues.</p>
<p>Tissue clearing protocols,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup> in combination with deep-tissue immunolabeling <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup> and optical sectioning microscopy techniques,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup> represent powerful tools for collecting 3D information at a subcellular resolution from centimeter-scale specimens. Tissue clearing techniques render biological tissues transparent by removing components that induce refraction index mismatching, which is mainly attributable to two factors, i.e., light absorption due to pigments or biological chromophores and light scattering mainly caused by lipids.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup> In current tissue clearing protocols, samples are fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for approximately 24 hours before undergoing delipidation steps that involve solvents,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup> aqueous solutions with denaturing reagents or detergents,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup> or protection with chemicals that create crosslinks to withstand harsh electrophoretic delipidation.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup> Such protocols now enable imaging of whole-rodent bodies.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup> and even entire human organs at the cellular or subcellular level,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]</sup> facilitating detailed and comprehensive analyses of intact biological systems. However, FFPE specimens have not reaped the benefits of these advanced techniques. For instance, although tissue clearing approaches such as CUBIC, iDISCO, CLARITY, and passive SDS treatment have been applied previously to FFPE specimens,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup> they have only yielded immunolabeling depths of 1-2 mm, underscoring the need for a procedure tailored to FFPE samples in order to achieve centimeter-scale tissue clearing and labeling.</p>
<p>Our objective was to develop a protocol capable of rendering centimeter-scale FFPE specimens optically transparent and suitable for deep immunolabeling. To this end, we took account of two critical issues. First, successful immunohistochemistry of FFPE tissue sections requires antigen retrieval to restore target conformation and expose masked epitopes.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]</sup> Secondly, despite xylene treatment during paraffin processing and dewaxing protocols removing a substantial proportion of FFPE tissue lipids, certain phospholipids persist within the lipid bilayer, impeding antibody penetration and maintaining opacity.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we aimed to devise a procedure that achieves efficient antigen retrieval and delipidation for centimeter-scale FFPE specimens. Here, we present Heat-Induced FFPE based tissue Clearing (HIF-Clear), a pipeline that employs an optimized heat-induced antigen retrieval technique to achieve that goal. We validated the effectiveness of HIF-Clear using FFPE human brain tissues and entire mouse brains. Using HIF-Clear, we demonstrate the possibility of conducting multiple rounds of immunolabeling, which allowed characterization of the same brain tissue using six different neuronal markers and revealing neuronal circuitry. We further demonstrate volumetric quantification by means of HIF-Clear on intact FFPE mouse brains, with statistical analysis of the FFPE samples resulting in identical trends to the results determined for fresh brains. We also showcase the broad applications of HIF-Clear by successfully conducting volumetric imaging of mouse brain archived in FFPE blocks for a period of 15 years, as well as the compatibility of this apporach with expansion microscopy.</p>

<label>2.1.</label><title>Optimized antigen retrieval: Delipidation and epitope recovery of FFPE specimens</title>
<p>SDS is a detergent commonly used for lipid removal in tissue clearing methods. It is also known as an antigen retrieval agent and has been used to enhance immunolabeling signals in cells,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]</sup> cryosections,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup> formalin-fixed human brains,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]</sup> and epithelia of the pancreas, liver and lung.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we began optimizing tissue clearing by applying two types of SDS-based approaches, passive and active, to FFPE mouse brain hemispheres and then evaluated their impacts on antigen retrieval/delipidation by means of electrophoretic immunolabeling.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup> For the passive approach, we applied a FLASH protocol published previously involving sample incubation in an SDS-based solution (4% SDS and 200 mM borate) at 54 °C for antigen retrieval and tissue clearing of epithelial cells and abdominal organs.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]</sup> For the active approach, we employed SDS-based electrophoresis at 42 °C for 48 hours. We observed that both FLASH-processed and SDS-electrophoresed samples showed weak tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker of dopaminergic neurons) signal (Figure S1a). Additionally, we noticed that the FLASH-processed samples had almost no signal of NeuN (a marker of neuronal nuclei, Figure S1b left), and exhibited strong non-specific background noise (Figure S1a left). The presence of this background noise is considered an indicator of inadequate antigen retrieval.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>We found that FLASH-processed samples displayed weak tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, a marker of dopaminergic neurons) signal and almost completely lacked signal of NeuN (a marker of neuronal nuclei) (Figure S1a left, 1b left). We also observed that the SDS-electrophoresed sample only possessed weak TH-positive signal, as well as strong non-specific labeling (Figure S1a right), with this latter considered an indicator of inadequate antigen retrieval.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]</sup></p>
<p>These results imply insufficient antigen retrieval using the SDS approaches, likely due to the low-temperature experimental conditions. In 1991, Shi et al. published a heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method utilizing a temperature of 100 °C,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]</sup> which now represents the most broad-spectrum antigen retrieval protocol for FFPE tissue sections. Superheating (i.e., temperatures &gt;100 °C) in pressure cookers has been reported to enhance immunohistochemistry signal intensity and stability.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]</sup> However, heating with a classical antigen-retrieval citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) at 121 °C for 10 minutes in a pressure cooker, a condition appropriate for routine FFPE sections, only resulted in weak immunostaining signals of NeuN and SMI312 (a pan-neurofilament marker) in the middle of a 2-mm-thick FFPE mouse brain block (Figure S1b middle). Since dewaxed and rehydrated FFPE specimens still have residual phospholipids that prevent antibody penetration,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]</sup> we added 1% SDS into the citrate buffer to increase the delipidation capability of the HIER approach and found that NeuN and SMI312 signals were significantly enhanced (Figure S1b right). However, deploying SDS at such high temperatures also resulted in tissue expansion and fragility (Figure S1b, gross view), prompting us to search for a detergent condition that could achieve sufficient delipidation while retaining tissue integrity.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we tested four additional detergent conditions: 1% Tween 20; 1% Triton X-100; 1% sodium cholate (NaC); and 1% CHAPS. Tween 20 and Triton X-100 are commonly used to disrupt cell membranes in immunohistochemistry. NaC and CHAPS have higher critical micelle concentrations and form smaller micelles than SDS, and both have been reported as being more efficient than SDS with respect to active electrophoretic delipidation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]</sup> and passive delipidation,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]</sup> respectively. All tests were performed on 2-mm-thick FFPE mouse brain blocks with citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0) at 121 °C for 10 minutes in a pressure cooker. First, we assessed amounts of residual lipids by staining with DiD (a lipophilic dye with an excitation wavelength at 649 nm). Undelipidated and SDS-delipidated (hereafter referred to as PFA-SDS) mouse brain blocks, as well as dewaxed FFPE mouse brain blocks without HIER, were also stained as controls. To prove that DiD signal quantification could be used to reflect amounts of residual lipids in tissue sections, we compared DiD signal across the FFPE group without HIER, the undelipidated group and the PFA-SDS group (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>, left panel). The FFPE group without HIER exhibited a higher DiD signal intensity than the PFA-SDS group but lower than that of the undelipidated group, supporting partial lipid removal during the paraffin processing and dewaxing process. Among all of the test groups subjected to varied heated detergent conditions, only the 1% Tween 20 condition presented significantly lower lipid content compared to the FFPE without HIER group (p-value = 0.0035), achieving the same level of delipidation as the PFA-SDS group (p-value = 0.999) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). We also performed Oil red O staining to visualize the residual lipids and tissue morphology under bright-field microscopy (Figure S2).</p>

<p>Next, we evaluated the efficiency of antigen retrieval by conducting immunolabeling with NeuN and SMI312 antibodies on all of the test groups and examined the signals at the center of each FFPE specimen. We found that the 1% Tween 20 group displayed the sharpest and clearest neuronal nuclei and axon bundles with a high signal-to-background ratio, indicating both successful delipidation and antigen retrieval (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, panel 2). Interestingly, for the 1% Triton X-100, 1% NaC and 1% CHAPS groups, the fluorescence intensity of neuronal nuclei were even lower than the background signal, implying that heating these detergents might hinder nuclear epitopes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, panels 3, 4 and 5). We also examined the gross appearance of each group upon heating, which confirmed that the 1% Tween 20 group retained good sample integrity without apparent changes in size or color (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we employed 1% Tween 20 in citrate buffer with heating in a pressure cooker at 121 °C for 10 minutes as the critical step of our HIF-Clear pipeline for delipidation and antigen retrieval of centimeter-scale FFPE specimens.</p>

<label>2.2.</label><title>The HIF-Clear pipeline</title>
<p>We illustrate the complete HIF-Clear pipeline in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>. To retrieve a specimen from a FFPE block, the paraffin is first melted at 65-70 °C, before dewaxing at room temperature using xylene and sequentially rehydrating the tissue with alcohol. It is important to note that when working on a large sample, the dewaxing time should be increased to avoid opacity caused by residual wax due to insufficient dewaxing. Opacity can be eliminated through repeated dehydration and dewaxing steps (Figure S3b), with extended dewaxing times or repeated dewaxing steps not affecting tissue structure or antigenicity (Figure S3 and S4). A typical dewaxing timeframe for paraffin sections of less than 20 µm thickness is ∼20 minutes, with complete dewaxing of an entire mouse brain or similarly-sized sample achievable within 24 hours (see Materials and Methods). Optimal dewaxing times for tissue sizes between these two extremes warrant further testing.</p>
<p>The rehydrated FFPE samples are then treated with epoxy<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup> and immersed in the optimized antigen retrieval solution (10 mM sodium citrate, 1% Tween 20, pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 24 hours, before then being heated to 121 °C for 10 minutes. The samples are then subjected to active immunolabeling (see Materials and Methods). After staining, the specimen is immersed in 4% PFA for 24 hours to fix the antibodies bound to epitopes, matched for the refractive index (RI), and imaged by means of lightsheet microscopy. Figure S5 shows the gross views of the same mouse brain after undergoing 4% PFA fixation, paraffin processing, optimized antigen retrieval, and RI-matching, demonstrating intactness of the brain shape and preservation of tissue integrity. To enable 3D phenotyping and proteomic investigations, a multi-round staining protocol involving photobleaching and classic heat-induced antigen retrieval can also be included. In this study, unless otherwise specified, all HIF-Clear-processed whole mouse brains had been stored in paraffin blocks for two to six months before the experiments and underwent active labeling after heating with 1% Tween 20.</p>
<p>To further verify HIF-Clear’s efficacy in removing lipids from whole mouse brains, we employed coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), a spectroscopic technique for detecting vibrational responses of specific molecular structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast to a dewaxed FFPE mouse brain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, left) for which we observed CARS signals from axon bundles, thus indicating the presence of myelinated lipids, both the FFPE-HIF-Clear-processed and PFA-SDS-treated mouse brain samples displayed significantly lower CARS signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, middle and right, respectively; quantification in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), confirming removal of myelinated lipids.</p>

<label>2.3.</label><title>The HIF-Clear pipeline enables immunolabeling and registration of intact FFPE mouse brain</title>
<p>Previous studies have confirmed that transcriptomic and proteomic data are equally preserved in FFPE sections and fresh-frozen sections. To assess biomarker preservation within a spatial context, we investigated patterns of anti-TH antibody labeling in FFPE-HIF-Clear-processed mouse brains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 2</bold>A</xref>). We observed consistent distributions of dopaminergic neurons in key tissue regions, including the striatum, nigrostriatal fiber tracts, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, pontine reticular nucleus, and lateral reticular nucleus, aligning with the findings of a prior study<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, left) and matching results from Allen Brain Atlas registration<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, right). Furthermore, we compared the volume of each brain region between the left and right hemispheres, which revealed minimal sample distortion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Our investigation extended to a 2-mm-thick mouse brain that had been preserved in an FFPE block for 15 years. By applying HIF-Clear, we unveiled clear clusters of dopaminergic neurons at a cellular resolution in that specimen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These results confirm the feasibility of deploying HIF-Clear for long-term stored FFPE blocks, even without the need for sectioning, enabling effective retrieval of information on spatial biomarkers comparable to that obtained from freshly fixed samples. We also applied HIF-Clear to 3-month fixed mouse brain hemispheres (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref></bold>). Although the long-term fixed specimens exhibited reduced TH intensity and S/N ratio, the major dopaminergic regions were labeled, and magnified images revealed clear details of cell bodies and neuronal fibers. These results suggest that HIF-Clear has the potential to be applied to long-term fixed specimens.</p>

<label>2.4.</label><title>A tailored HIF-Clear+ pipeline enables multi-round immunolabeling of human brain tissues and whole mouse brains</title>
<p>Next, we investigated if HIF-Clear-processed whole-brain FFPE samples could be subjected to a multi-round staining process, a strategy commonly used for multiplexed immunolabeling. Chemical elution techniques utilizing detergents, reducing reagents, and denaturing reagents have been developed previously and tested on thin paraffin sections or cryosections. For thick sections, the CLARITY protocol published in 2013 involves incubation in 4% SDS solution, which was first demonstrated on a 1-mm-thick mouse hippocampus specimen. However, based on our preliminary experiments, we found that post-staining fixation is required to maintain signals in a centimeter-sized sample (i.e., a whole mouse brain) (Figure S6) and the post-fixed antibodies cannot be completely stripped using SDS-based stripping protocols (Figure S7). We also observed that fixation after staining hindered subsequent rounds of staining, although this impediment could be overcome by traditional heat-induced epitope retrieval (referred to hereafter as classical HIER to avoid confusion with the aforementioned optimized antigen retrieval protocol) (Figure S8). To overcome the difficulty of antibody stripping due to post-fixation, which is required for centimeter-sized specimens, we developed HIF-Clear+ to include a multi-round immunolabeling protocol utilizing photobleaching and classical HIER (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). After imaging, we photobleached transparent RI-matched samples using a 100W LED white light to quench the previously labeled fluorophores (Figure S9). The selected duration of bleaching is dependent on sample thickness; overnight bleaching is sufficient for tissue samples of &lt;500 μm thickness, whereas ∼72 hours are required for thicker samples such as whole mouse brains (a thickness of 0.8-1 cm). Bleached specimens are then subjected to classical HIER to restore the antigenicity hindered by post-staining PFA fixation. The brain shape and structural integrity remained after 4 rounds of immunolabeling, and there is no cross-reactivity in subsequent rounds of immunostaining following bleaching (Figure S10).</p>
<p>To explore the potential of revealing multiple neuronal circuitry in the whole FFPE mouse brain using HIF-Clear+, we performed a six-round immunolabeling procedure for TH, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), calbindin, parvalbumin (PV), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and SMI312, respectively, on one intact FFPE mouse brain (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></bold>). For each round, the brain was labeled not only with the antibody specific for the target protein, but also for lectin as a structural reference. Image datasets from each immunolabeling round were combined into a single multichannel image (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 5</bold>A</xref>), with lectin-labeled blood vessels deployed as a reference channel using Elastix,<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]</sup> demonstrating the ability of HIF-Clear+ to reveal the spatial distribution of different neuronal markers. We conducted a more detailed examination of the habenula-interpeduncular circuitry (Hbn-IPN circuitry) and its connection with these biomarkers. We visualized the expression of ChAT, calbindin, TH, and TPH2 in the IPN and the neighboring regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Previous studies have shown that these neurons are regulated by the Hbn-IPN circuitry through their connections with the IPN region, which plays a role in controlling emotion, addiction, and the reward process.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]</sup> To demonstrate that HIF-Clear+ can also be applied to human brain FFPE blocks, we performed three consecutive rounds of immunolabeling on a 1-mm-thick FFPE human brain specimen collected surgically from the temporal lobe of a brain tumor patient. For each round, the brain tissue was labeled with GFAP/lectin, SMI312/lectin, or MAP2/lectin, respectively (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figure 6</bold>A</xref>). Labeling homogeneity throughout the entire block was confirmed by imaging at depths of 100, 500 and 900 µm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, S11)</p>

<p>Next, we employed FFPE mouse brains from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) model to showcase the feasibility of employing HIF-Clear for 3D quantification of neuronal circuit recovery in disease research. Reduced dopamine levels are known to be a major cause of cognitive impairment after TBI.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>]</sup> To assess the impact on dopaminergic neural regeneration across four treatment groups (sham, sMN, aNORO@sMN, and aNORO@sMN+AMF; see Materials and Methods for details), we conducted immunolabeling using anti-TH antibodies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>) and compared quantitative changes in the dopaminergic system among these groups. We calculated quantitative ipsilateral-to-contralateral changes for three structural features: striatum volume (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>), nigrostriatal fiber tract volume (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref>), and the number of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra (SN) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7J</xref>). The sham group displayed a decrease (∼24%) in the ratio of dopaminergic neurons on the injured side to the uninjured control side (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>), indicative of dopaminergic system malfunction or imbalance. Treatment with aNORO@sMN rescued this disease phenotype (from 76% to 94%) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>), a positive impact on dopamine production and transmission recovery post-TBI.</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of aNORO@sMN on angiogenesis. To quantify angiogenesis, we selected three regions of interest around brain injury sites and segmented blood vessels (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7L</xref>). The aNORO@sMN treatment group exhibited a substantial increase in blood vessel length, surface area, volume, and branch numbers (244%, 301%, 186%, and 220%, respectively) compared to the sham group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7M</xref>), indicating enhanced angiogenesis. Thus, overall, HIF-Clear facilitates the 3D quantification critical for assessing neuronal damage and recovery in FFPE specimens.</p>
<p>We also performed identical TBI procedures and 3D quantification using the SHIELD protocol and SDS-based electrophoresis for brain clearing and labeling (Figure S12), which resulted in comparable quantitative outcomes compared to those determined for FFPE-HIF-Clear brains (Figure S13).

<label>2.6.</label><title>HIF-Clear enables expansion microscopy on thick FFPE samples</title>
<p>Expansion microscopy is a super-resolution microscopy technique that overcomes the limitations of optical diffraction by enlarging biological structures. It is achieved by synthesizing a polymer network within the specimen to anchor protein molecules, causing the specimen to physically expand and enabling analysis of sub-cellular structures.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]</sup> It is generally difficult to uniformly expand heavily formaldehyde-fixed specimens, such as FFPE tissues, due to the formaldehyde occupying the binding sites of anchoring reagents.

<p>In this study, we propose HIF-Clear, which utilizes a heat-induced antigen retrieval protocol optimized with 1% Tween 20, to eliminate residual lipids and recover masked antigens from FFPE specimens. Our method enables labeling agents to penetrate to a depth of centimeters within such specimens, enabling large-scale neuronal circuitry analyses of archived brain tissues and providing comprehensive information that previously could not typically be obtained from conventional 3-5 µm FFPE sections. We have demonstrated herein that FFPE samples subjected to the HIF-Clear pipeline can be repeatedly stained without compromising their integrity.

By applying HIF-Clear/HIF-Clear+, 3D histological information can be collected from FFPE specimens, thereby providing more accurate biomarker quantifications, brain-wide neuronal circuitry and cell analyses. Moreover, HIF-Clear/HIF-Clear+ may be performed on archived patient samples hosted in neuronal disease brain banks to establish a 3D biomarker atlas for neurological diseases, maximizing the utility of archived specimens. Such an atlas would represent an invaluable resource for retrospective research on biomarker distributions throughout the entire neural network, enabling tracking of their changes and interactions. The resulting comprehensive imaging datasets could also be deployed to train deep learning models, explore potential therapeutic targets, and to predict early diagnostic markers.</p>

<label>3.2.</label><title>FFPE-HIF-Clear as an archival and delipidation strategy for clearing centimeter-sized tissue samples</title>
<p>The development of tissue clearing has revolutionized neuroscientific research. However, current tissue-clearing protocols impose a 24-hour fixation limit on mouse brains, requiring immediate tissue clearing and labeling upon animal sacrifice. HIF-Clear offers a solution to this predicament by enabling long-term preservation of mouse brains in FFPE blocks. Accordingly, clinical samples can be conveniently transported to imaging facilities and staining decisions can be postponed until essential analytical results, such as RNA sequencing, become available. Additionally, HIF-Clear minimizes excessive use of experimental mice in time-course studies by allowing brain samples in FFPE blocks after sacrifice, adhering to 3Rs principles. Consequently, researchers can decide on whole-brain staining approaches upon completing experiments, such as for toxicological or pharmacological targets, thereby avoiding the need to repeat animal experiments.</p>
<p>Another possible application of FFPE-HIF-Clear is to use it as a tissue clearing method for removing lipids. Since paraffin embedding, dewaxing, and heat-induced antigen retrieval are commonly used pathological procedures, FFPE-HIF-Clear can be quickly, easily, and efficiently executed in the pathology department of hospitals or research institutions, reinforcing its potential utility in clinical research.</p>

<p>Optical sectioning techniques are crucial for obtaining high-quality volumetric images. Techniques such as confocal microscopes, multi-photon microscopy, and light-sheet microscopy filter out-of-focus signals, resulting in sharp images of individual planes. In our study, we used light-sheet microscopy and multi-point confocal (i.e., spinning disc) for imaging centimeter-sized specimens because of their scanning speeds. While two-photon and confocal microscopy offer high-resolution imaging of smaller volumes, they are not ideal for scanning entire tissues because of their prolonged scanning times.</p>
<p>Non-optical sectioning wide-field fluorescence microscopes, like the Olympus BX series or ZEISS Axio imager series, can also be used to scan samples up to about 3.5mm thick with long working distance objective lenses. In these cases, deconvolution algorithms are required to eliminate out-of-focus signals.

<p>Heat-induced antigen retrieval has been widely used since first being reported by Shi et al. in 1991, with many protocol variations since being developed, including the use of different heat sources (e.g., water baths, steamers, microwave ovens, autoclaves, and pressure cookers) and buffer choices (low molarity buffers of acid or alkaline pH).<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, a unifying principle is to heat the fixed tissue sections in buffer solutions at or above 100 °C for up to 30 minutes without boiling.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup> In our study, we used a pressure cooker as the heat source to achieve a temperature of ∼121 °C, thereby ensuring temperature stability and time efficiency. Any heating condition that is effective for FFPE sections should also work for centimeter-scale FFPE specimens (e.g., using water baths at 95-99 °C), but their effects on delipidation require further testing.</p>
<p>The choice of antigen retrieval solutions depends on the antibody being deployed. For example, EDTA solutions are favorable for antibodies against phosphorylated tyrosine.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]</sup> Generally, alkaline pH solutions exhibit higher antigen retrieval efficiency, but they are also more tissue-destructive and result in higher background signal compared to lower pH solutions.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]</sup> In our study, we tested the addition of 1% Tween 20 to two common antigen retrieval solutions, citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and Tris-EDTA (pH 9.0), both of which yielded satisfactory staining results (Figure S14), demonstrating that HIF-Clear facilitates the choice between acidic or alkaline antigen retrieval solutions based on antibody preference without compromising the delipidation effect.</p>

<label>3.5.</label><title>Staining strategies and Epoxy/hydrogel pre-treatments in HIF-Clear</title>
<p>In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, we propose two staining strategies for samples with thicknesses less than 500 um and greater than 1 mm: passive immunolabeling and active immunolabeling. In passive immunolabeling, antibodies penetrate and reach their targets solely through diffusion, without any additional force. It takes approximately two months to passively stain a whole mouse brain.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup> Compared to passive immunolabeling, active immunolabeling uses an external force, such as pressure, electrophoresis, etc., to facilitate antibody penetration and therefore significantly speed up the staining process, reducing the required staining time for a whole mouse brain to one day. However, the harsh conditions, such as pressure and heat, caused by external forces might damage specimens. To protect specimens from the harsh conditions caused by active staining, specimens could be strengthened by treatment with epoxy or acrylamide monomer to form a tissue-epoxy or tissue-hydrogel hybrid.<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup> Laboratories that do not have adequate devices or handle small specimens could use passive immunolabeling instead and skip the step of epoxy or hydrogel pretreatment.</p>

<sec id="s3f">
<label>3.6.</label><title>Limitations</title>
<p>We acknowledge that there are some limitations to HIF-Clear application, which we wish to address. Firstly, the FFPE tissues we tested in this study have been limited to mouse and human brain tissues fixed under well-controlled conditions. Differences in tissue fixation procedures at different hospitals and tissue banks may affect the clarity and immunostaining efficiency of dewaxed FFPE tissues. In the demonstration of HIF-Clear to 3-month fixed specimens, we observed that pontine reticular nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, yellow arrowheads) lose TH-positive signals after long-term fixation. The fluorescence intensity was more affected by fixation with formalin, which is methanol-stabilized and stronger, than with PFA. The results indicate that a stronger antigen retrieval method may be a possible solution. However, achieving the right balance between antigen retrieval efficiency and tissue integrity will require additional testing and investigation. Secondly, HIF-Clear has not yet been extensively tested on tissues other than the brain. Thus, its applicability and effectiveness for other tissues remain to be established. Third, the size of the samples used in this study is mostly in the range of 2-3 cm<sup>3</sup>. Larger samples may require a prolonged incubation time and/or increased Tween 20 concentration. Fourth, HIF-Clear is not compatible with endogenous fluorescence due to a reduction in fluorescence intensity caused by xylene and alcohol used in paraffin processing. Researchers who need to directly observe genetically encoded fluorescent proteins can utilize tissue-clearing methods such as 3DISCO, X-CLARITY, CUBIC, etc., which have been shown to minimize the decrease in fluorescence intensity. On the other hand, if researchers need to visualize transgenic fluorescent proteins along with other biomarkers, they can use HIF-Clear for delipidation and boost-immunolabeling to visualize the transgenic fluorescent proteins. Fifth, HIF-Clear+ may not be suitable for cases necessitating iterative staining with the same antibody. In addition, the applicability of HIF-Clear+ to antibodies not tested in the study requires further testing and validation. Finally, whether HIF-Clear-treated tissues retain sufficient molecular features and structural integrity for omics analysis warrants verification. Further research and testing will help to address these limitations and improve the applicability and effectiveness of the HIF-Clear pipeline we present herein.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, as a method enabling multi-round immunolabeling of centimeter-scale archived FFPE specimens, HIF-Clear/HIF-Clear+ presents new possibilities for researching neural disease and could serve as a powerful tool for neuronal circuitry analyses and pathology. Its integration with conventional pathological procedures also renders it readily applicable in clinical settings. Through further validation across various organs and testing of its compatibility with spatial omics techniques, HIF-Clear could potentially catalyze broader and more comprehensive investigations in both the fundamental and clinical research domains.</p>

<title>TBI mouse model</title>
<p>All animal procedures and handling complied with guidelines from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Tsing Hua University (IACUC protocol Number: 110081). We divided 7-week-old C57BL/6 female mice into four groups: (1) untreated (sham), (2) treated with a paracetamol-coated silk-based microneedle (sMN), (3) treated with alternating magnetic field-responsive NO-release octahedrons (aNORO@sMN), and (4) treated with aNORO@sMN and an alternating magnetic field (aNORO@sMN+AMF). To perform traumatic brain injury (TBI), we used an electric drill to create a hole in the skull at the left motor cortex (M1 &amp; M2) and used a 2-mm-diameter punch to cause a 1.5-mm-deep injury. For all treatments except sham, the microneedle was implanted one day post-injury to avoid excessive swelling in the injured area. For the aNORO@sMN and aNORO@sMN+AMF groups, the NO-release octahedrons (aNORO) were embedded in a silk microneedle (sMN). For the AMF-treated group, a magnetic field at a power of 3.2 kW and a frequency of 1 MHz was applied for 5 min per day until the mice were sacrificed.

<title>Evaluating the extent of delipidation</title>
<p>Serial 20-µm-thick cryosections were cut from mouse brain slices (2-mm thick) of various treatment conditions for subsequent DiD or Oil red O staining. For DiD staining, cryosections (that were of approximately 0-40 µm depth) were post-fixed with 4% PFA at room temperature for 5 minutes. The sections were then rinsed with distilled water and immersed in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 minutes to remove OCT. These sections were stained with 0.0025 uM DiD/PBST solution at room temperature for 1 hour, before rinsing them with distilled water and washing with 1% SDS for several seconds to remove excess DiD. The slides were mounted in 50% glycerol and imaged under a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope using a 10× 0.75NA Plan-Apochromat objective (Zeiss). For Oil red O staining, the sections (that were of approximately 40-80 µm depth) were post-fixed with a 4% formal-calcium solution for 5 minutes and then rinsed with distilled water.

<title>Electrophoretic immunolabeling (active staining)</title>
<p>The procedure was modified from the previously published eFLASH protocol<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup> and was conducted in a SmartLabel System (LifeCanvas Technologies, Seoul, South Korea). The specimens were preincubated overnight at room temperature in sample buffer (240 mM Tris, 160 mM CAPS, 20% w/v D-sorbitol, 0.9% w/v sodium deoxycholate). Each preincubated specimen was placed in a sample cup (provided by the manufacturer with the SmartLabel System) containing primary, corresponding secondary antibodies and lectin diluted in 8 mL of sample buffer. Information on antibodies, lectin and their optimized quantities is detailed in Supplementary Table 1. The specimens in the sample cup and 500 mL of labeling buffer (240 mM Tris, 160 mM CAPS, 20% w/v D-sorbitol, 0.2% w/v sodium deoxycholate) were loaded into the SmartLabel System.

The resulting spectrum (600-1300 nm) was spectrally sliced by tunable color filters (3G LVLWP, LVSWP, and LVFBP, Delta) to provide pump (725 nm) and Stokes (914 nm) beams, which could address the Raman shift (2850 cm-1) of lipids. The two beams were temporally and spatially overlapped, and then guided into a commercial upright microscope (Axio Examiner.Z1, Zeiss) with a scanning unit (LSM7MP, Zeiss) to achieve raster scanning on the x-y plane. A single 20x water immersion objective (UMPLFLN 20XW, Olympus) was used to focus the combined laser beams on the mouse sample.

<p>In this study, Lin et al developed a protocol termed HIF-Clear, to perform tissue clearing and labelling on large-scale FFPE mouse brain specimens. They have optimized protocols for dewaxing and adequate delipidation of FFPE tissues to enable deep immunolabelling, even for whole mouse brains. This was useful for the study of disease models such as in an astrocytoma model to evaluate spatial architecture of the tumour and its surrounding microenvironment. It was also used in a traumatic brain injury model to quantify changes in vasculature density and differences in monoaminergic innervation. They have also demonstrated the potential of multi-round immunolabelling using photobleaching, as well as expansion microscopy with FFPE samples using Hif Clear.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The revised manuscript by Lin et al is much improved with a more detailed methods description. There are only a few minor comments for the authors that are still valid:</p>
<p>- Some procedures, including the basic HIF-Clear protocol, seem to produce marked tissue expansion that is not mentioned in the manuscript. Users should take this fact into consideration when making measurements.</p>
<p>
- The authors have provided a comparison between mouse and human brain samples in Figure S12. However, it is misleading to mention that the &quot;fluorescent signals are comparable at varying depth&quot; as the figure clearly showed a lack of continuous staining especially for SMI312 at 900um depth, and human brain tissue showed considerably increased background signal (likely due to endogenous lipofuscin which has autofluorescent properties). Also, This is difficult to assess in the present design of the experiment because, at different depths, the tissue and the antigen may change themselves... making it difficult to make a direct staining comparison with other depths.</p>

<p>The manuscript details an investigation aimed at developing a protocol to render centimeter-scale formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens optically transparent and suitable for deep immunolabeling. The authors evaluate various detergents and conditions for epitope retrieval such as acidic or basic buffers combined with high temperatures in entire mouse brains that had been paraffin-embedded for months. They use various protein targets to test active immunolabeling and light-sheet microscopy registration of such preparations to validate their protocol. The final procedure, called MOCAT pipeline, briefly involves 1% Tween 20 in citrate buffer, heated in a pressure cooker at 121 {degree sign}C for 10 minutes. The authors also note that part of the delipidation is achieved by the regular procedure.</p>
<p>Major Strengths</p>
<p>
- The simplicity and ease of implementation of the proposed procedure using common laboratory reagents distinguish it favorably from more complex methods.</p>
<p>- Direct comparisons with existing protocols and exploration of alternative conditions enhance the robustness and practicality of the methodology.</p>
<p>Final considerations</p>
<p>
The evidence presented supports the effectiveness of the proposed method in rendering thick FFPE samples transparent and facilitating repeated rounds of immunolabeling.</p>
<p>The developed procedure holds promise for advancing tissue and 3D-specific determination of proteins of interest in various settings, including hospitals, basic research, and clinical labs, particularly benefiting neuroscience research.</p>
<p>The methodological findings suggest that MOCAT could have broader applications beyond FFPE samples, differentiating it from other tissue-clearing approaches in that the equipment and chemicals needed are broadly accessible.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Major Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The assertion that MOCAT can be rapidly applied in hospital pathology departments seems overstated due to the limited availability of light-sheet microscopes outside research labs. In the first rebuttal letter, authors explain the limitations of other microscopes more readily available in hospitals. This explanation relies on your own investigations and practical experience on the matter, so including them in some part of the manuscript would be beneficial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's comments and have added a discussion on the limitations of microscopes that are more readily available in hospitals in our text:</p>
<p>Revised manuscript, line 305-316:</p>
<p>“3.3 Microscopy options for imaging centimeter-sized specimens</p>
<p>Optical sectioning techniques are crucial for obtaining high-quality volumetric images. Techniques such as confocal microscopes, multi-photon microscopy, and light-sheet microscopy filter out-of-focus signals, resulting in sharp images of individual planes. In our study, we used light-sheet microscopy and multi-point confocal (i.e., spinning disc) for imaging centimeter-sized specimens because of their scanning speeds. While two-photon and confocal microscopy offer high-resolution imaging of smaller volumes, they are not ideal for scanning entire tissues because of their prolonged scanning times.”</p>
<p>Non-optical sectioning wide-field fluorescence microscopes, like the Olympus BX series or ZEISS Axio imager series, can also be used to scan samples up to about 3.5mm thick with long working distance objective lenses. In these cases, deconvolution algorithms are required to eliminate out-of-focus signals. However, it should be noted that the epifluorescence system might reduce fluorescent intensity in deeper regions within the samples.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Refractive index matching is a critical point in the protocol, the one providing final transparency. Authors utilized the commercial solutions NFC1 and NFC2 (Nebulem, Taiwan) with a known refractive index, but for which its composition is non-disclosable. My knowledge on the organic chemistry around refractive index matching is limited, but if users don't really know what is going on in this final step, the whole protocol would rely on a single world-wide provider and troubleshooting would be fishing. I suggest that you try to validate the approach with solutions of known composition, or at least provide the solutions sold by other providers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestions. Based on our experience, the CUBIC-R solution developed by Ueda's team also serves as an effective RI-matching solution in the MOCAT pipeline. Its only drawback is the potential reddening of the specimen, likely due to the light-responsive component, antipyrine. We have now added this information to the Methods section:</p>
<p>Revised manuscript, line 492-496:</p>
<p>“Refractive index (RI) matching. Before imaging, the specimens were RI-matched by being  immersed in NFC1 (RI = 1.47) and NFC2 (RI = 1.52) solutions (Nebulum, Taipei, Taiwan).  Each immersion lasted for one day at room temperature. Alternatively, RI-matching can also be accomplished by immersing specimens in a 1:1 dilution of CUBIC-R[28] for one day, followed by pure CUBIC-R for an additional day.“</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>A comment on the name of the protocol, MOCAT. I am sorry to bring this now, and not before. But, I strongly recommend another name for the procedure. My concern is that the present name &quot;MOCAT&quot; refers to the problem, and NOT to the actual solution provided by you. See, the problem to solve is: to perform Multiplex labeling Of Centimeter-sized Archived Tissue (MOCAT), but it says nothing about HOW you did it: heat-induced antigen retrieval and Tween20-delipidation for centimeter-scale FFPE specimens. In summary, I strongly recommend that the acronym of the procedure refers more to the &quot;solution&quot; than to the &quot;problem&quot;, and for me this is important because otherwise the acronym is not fair with present and future techniques pretending to provide a novel solution to the same problem. Another way to put it is that researchers can own their proposed solutions, but they do not own the problem to be solved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestions. In response to their concerns, we have renamed the procedure presented in this study as Heat-Induced FFPE-based Tissue Clearing, with the acronym HIF-Clear. This change reflects the critical step in our procedure. Corresponding updates have also been made in the manuscript.</p>
