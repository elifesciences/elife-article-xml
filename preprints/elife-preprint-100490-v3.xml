<title>Abstract</title><p>Cell crowding is a common microenvironmental factor influencing various disease processes, but its role in promoting cell invasiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the biomechanical changes induced by cell crowding, focusing on pro-invasive cell volume reduction in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Crowding specifically enhanced invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells through significant volume reduction compared to hyperplasia-mimicking or normal cells. Mass spectrometry revealed that crowding selectively relocated ion channels, including TRPV4, to the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. TRPV4 inhibition triggered by crowding decreased intracellular calcium levels, reduced cell volume, and increased invasion and motility. During this process, TRPV4 membrane relocation primed the channel for later activation, compensating for calcium loss. Analyses of patient-derived breast cancer tissues confirmed that plasma membrane- associated TRPV4 is specific to high-grade DCIS and indicates the presence of a pro-invasive cell volume reduction mechanotransduction pathway. Hyperosmotic conditions and pharmacologic TRPV4 inhibition mimicked crowding-induced effects, while TRPV4 activation reversed them. Silencing TRPV4 diminished mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells, reducing calcium depletion, volume reduction, and motility. This study uncovers a novel pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway driven by cell crowding and identifies TRPV4 as a potential biomarker for predicting invasion risk in DCIS patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The complex interplay between cellular mechanics and invasive behaviors is crucial to understanding various physiological and pathological processes, such as wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Numerous studies show that these processes are mediated by mechanotransduction, whereby cells translate mechanical stimuli into cellular activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. While mechanotransduction is traditionally studied concerning fluid stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, matrix stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, and other biomechanical changes such as osmotic stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, the role of cell crowding, characterized by increased cell density and spatial constraints, is relatively less explored. A recent report shows that cell crowding plays a role in facilitating wound closure and repair by enhancing cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As tissues develop, repair, or undergo pathological transformation, cell crowding becomes common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This challenges individual cells, forcing them to perceive and respond to the mechanical constraints of a crowded environment. Our study used human breast cell line model systems to describe a novel mechanotransduction pathway triggered by cell crowding that induces invasiveness into surrounding tissues. Interestingly, this pathway exhibited unique selectivity, as it specifically associated with a type of non-invasive cancer pathology and was not present in lower-grade or less aggressive pathologies. This suggests that not all cells possess the ability to translate mechanical stimuli, such as cell crowding, into cell invasiveness.</p>
<p>To assess the role of cell crowding in cell invasiveness, we chose in vitro cell lines linked to different pathological states that reflect cell crowding conditions in vivo, including atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. ADH is an intraductal clonal epithelial cell proliferative lesion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and represents an intermediate step between normal breast tissue and in situ carcinomas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. ADH is associated with high risk as it is reported that an ADH diagnosis is associated with a five-fold increased risk of breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. DCIS is non-invasive form of cancer characterized by proliferating malignant epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Unlike ADH, DCIS is considered a precursor to invasive breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, the mechanism of how DCIS transitions to invasive cancer is not well understood and therefore, there is currently no reliable and robust method to differentiate which DCIS cells are at high risk of becoming invasive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Both ADH and DCIS conditions can potentially expose cells to crowding in vivo. However, how ADH and DCIS cells respond to such changes in cell density remains unknown. Our study revealed that cell crowding selectively triggered a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program in a specific type of DCIS cell line associated with high-grade pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The mechanotransduction program induced by cell crowding involved the inhibition of ion channels, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, a calcium-permeable ion channel, as identified from our mass spectrometry assay. This inhibition prompted the relocation of TRPV4 and other ion channels to the plasma membrane, leading to decreased intracellular calcium levels, subsequent induction of reduced cell volume and cortical stiffening, thereby promoting cell invasiveness and motility.</p>

<title>Cell crowding enhances invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells</title>
<p>Cell crowding reflects a common condition in tumor microenvironments for ADH and DCIS, arising from aberrant cell proliferation within spatially constrained intraductal spaces. We examined the influence of this prevalent environmental factor on the invasiveness of these cells in vitro. To conduct this investigation, we assembled a panel of cell lines derived from the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A, including its H-RAS mutation-driven derivatives associated with various pathologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>: MCF10AT1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link>, and invasive cells MCF10CA1a. MCF10AT1 resembles ADH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> mimics high-grade DCIS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, and MCF10CA1a represents a malignant invasive cancer that was observed to form metastatic lesions in a mouse xenograft<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The current classification of DCIS relies on histological factors such as cell growth patterns and cytonuclear features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Comedo-DCIS is a histologic subtype, which is characterized by apoptotic cell death, representing a high-grade DCIS with higher invasive potential than those of lower-grades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> forms comedo-type DCIS lesions that can spontaneously transition to invasive cancer when xenografted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To compare cell invasiveness under normal cell density and cell crowding conditions in vitro, we opted for a modified 2D matrix degradation assay. This approach allowed us to quantify overall cell invasiveness by normalizing it with the total cell number, thereby accounting for differences in cell densities. We chose this method over transwell, 3D Matrigel, or spheroid assays, where quantifying cell invasiveness as a function of cell density is challenging. By modifying an existing collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, we could determine the invasive cell fraction out of the total cell population by fluorescence imaging of the invasion gel bed and cell nuclei through low magnification (4X) imaging (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; for a detailed procedure, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 1</xref>) when cells were at normal density versus under cell crowding conditions.</p>

<caption><title>Cell crowding selectively increases invasiveness in high-grade DCIS cells.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> We used a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay to assess the effect of cell crowding on cell invasiveness. Representative images show gelatin-Alexa488 conjugates, where dark areas in the green (Gelatin488) background indicate cell invasion through degradation, and DAPI staining marks cell locations (blue; DAPI) in a two-day invasion assay of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells under normal density (ND; upper panel) and overconfluent (OC; lower panel) conditions. “Masked” images are thresholded to produce positive masks applied to the “DAPI” images. Individual cell locations detected in “DAPI” images are marked with purple circles in “Detected points” images. The total number of cells within the field of view is counted from these points. By overlaying the mask and DAPI images, “Masked DAPI” images are obtained, and invaded cells are detected and represented by purple circles in “Masked points” images. The invasive cell fraction is calculated by the ratio of the number of invaded cells to the total number of cells (0.24 for ND and 0.59 for OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells). These data show that cell invasiveness is enhanced by cell crowding. Scale bar = 100 μm. <bold>(B)</bold> Comparison of “Gelatin488” images of MCF10A (normal breast epithelial cells), MCF10AT1 (ADH-mimicking cells), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> (high-grade DCIS mimic), and MCF10CA1a (invasive breast cancer cells) between ND and OC conditions. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cell invasion is significantly higher under cell crowding than under ND conditions. <bold>(C)</bold> Invasive cell fractions of these cells between ND (blue circles) and OC (red circles) conditions are compared, showing that cell crowding-induced increases in invasiveness are notable only in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. The number of cell invasion analyses was as follows: MCF10A (ND: 10; OC: 7), MCF10AT1 (ND: 6; OC: 6), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> (ND: 9; OC: 9), and MCF10CA1a (ND: 6; OC: 7). We used the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, a nonparametric and unpaired statistical method, to compare differences between groups. ****: p &lt; 0.0001, ***: p &lt; 0.001, **: p &lt; 0.01, *: p &lt; 0.05, ns: p &gt; 0.05, throughout the manuscript.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>We observed alterations in live cell morphology and invasiveness as they progressed from normal density (ND: 40-70%) to full confluence (100%) and beyond. Our goal was to determine a distinct time window, termed overconfluence (OC), where cell crowding-induced changes level off. The OC time window was achieved in cells cultured for an additional 5-10 days after reaching 100% confluence, with the growth medium replaced twice per day to prevent acidification. We confirmed that the cells remained largely viable under crowding conditions, with minimal cell death (∼1.58%) similar to that observed in ND cells (∼0.85%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 2A-B</xref>). The schematic of the timeline to achieve the OC conditions, and low-magnification (4X) bright-field images at different time points from the ND to OC conditions are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 3A-B</xref>. The time-dependent equilibration of cell invasiveness after the cells reached confluence is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 3C-D</xref> using our quantifiable collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay. Cell crowding mechanosensing significantly increased the invasive cell fraction of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells from ∼24% (ND cells) to 59% (OC cells). The enhanced invasiveness of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells under cell crowding was largely reversible. When OC cells were reseeded at normal density for invasion assays, their invasive cell fraction decreased to approximately 15%, slightly lower (p = 0.012) than the initial value of around 24% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 3C, 3E</xref>). In contrast, normal breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) and the ADH-mimicking MCF10AT1 cells did not display invasiveness under ND conditions or enhanced invasiveness under OC conditions, indicating insensitivity to cell crowding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>).</p>
<p>The invasive cell fraction of ND MCF10CA1a cells was already ∼80%, and the additional increase in invasiveness due to cell crowding was not readily discernible, with a slight increase to ∼82% under crowded conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). These data suggest a striking and selective mechanosensing effect of cell crowding on cell invasiveness in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. To ensure that acidification did not affect the invasiveness of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells despite the frequent replacement of the cell growth medium, we incubated ND cells for two days with acidified medium from cultures of OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. We observed that medium acidity did not alter cell invasiveness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 3F</xref>), reinforcing that the increased invasiveness under OC conditions was induced by cell crowding.</p>

<p>As cells became crowded, we observed a reduction in cell size. Previous reports indicate an inverse relationship between cell volume and cortical stiffness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, leading us to hypothesize that reduced cell volume would be accompanied by increased cortical stiffness. Research on glioma cell invasion underscores the critical role of hydrodynamic cell volume changes in penetration into surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, suggesting that significant cell volume reduction facilitates cell invasion. Additionally, increased cortical stiffness is known to help cells overcome the physical barriers of the dense extracellular matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We thus investigated whether cell crowding selectively induces pro-invasive cell volume reduction and cell stiffening in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, thereby priming them for invasion.</p>
<p>To measure the cell volume of individual cells, we used confocal microscopy with a 60X oil immersion objective to obtain z-stack images of live or fixed cells stably expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Using a nanoindenter attached to the confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 4A</xref>), we extracted Young’s modulus of live individual cells to assess changes in cortical stiffness. Cell crowding significantly reduced cell volume (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>) and increased cortical stiffness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) in both <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> and MCF10A cells. However, the changes in volume and stiffness from ND to OC conditions were more pronounced in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 4B, C</xref>). The cell crowding-induced alterations in cell volume and stiffness were negligible in MCF10AT1 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, cell crowding led to an increase in stiffness, but a decrease in volume was not evident. This was expected because the cell volume was already too small to be accurately measured with the available resolution (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). The notable plasticity in cell volume and stiffness changes observed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells in response to cell crowding potentially underscores the critical link between this plasticity and mechanosensitive increases in cell invasiveness. We assessed cell volume changes only as an effector event of cell crowding, without measuring cell stiffness, because cell volume reflects the mechanical properties of the entire cell, while Young’s modulus can vary depending on the location of indentations in the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The observed cell volume changes by cell crowding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) depended on the ND cell volume, as OC cell volumes under crowding conditions were comparable across all cells. Consequently, the ND cell volume and the volume changes from ND to OC conditions exhibited an approximately linear relationship (<italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.97; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 4D</xref>). This finding suggests that the ND cell volume could serve as an indicator of relative cell volume plasticity.</p>

<p>To validate the pro-invasive nature of cell volume reduction in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, we examined the effect of hyperosmotic cell volume reduction in ND cells using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 300 for 15 minutes. The cell volume reduction effects of this treatment were previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. PEG 300 effectively reduced ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cell volume in a dose-dependent manner, showing a greater reduction with 148.8 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 than with 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). To assess the impact of PEG-induced cell volume reduction on cell invasiveness, we used a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay and exposed cells to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 for 2 days. While treatment with 148.8 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 significantly reduced cell viability, cells treated with 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 remained viable for 2 days. Monitoring changes in cell invasiveness revealed that exposure of ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells to 74.4 mOsmol/kg PEG 300 increased cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), confirming the causal relationship between cell volume reduction and increased cell invasiveness.</p>

<title>Cell crowding induces TRPV4 relocation to plasma membrane in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells</title>
<p>Cell volume regulation typically depends on osmotic gradients that direct the movement of water across cell membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This process is facilitated by ion flux modulation, which is controlled by ion channels and ion transporters located on the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, cells capable of achieving minimal cell volumes have been shown to successfully invade neighboring tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Based on this, we speculated that the high cell volume plasticity observed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells underlies their ability to penetrate the surrounding tissues. To achieve such efficient cell volume changes, cell crowding-induced mechanotransduction in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells may involve modulation of the number of ion channels or transporters on the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>To compare the plasma membrane-associated proteins between ND and OC conditions, we employed mass spectrometry and profiled those proteins using streptavidin-pulled surface-biotinylated cell lysates. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> shows the relative protein densities on the plasma membrane under ND (blue bars) and OC (red bars) conditions in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. The figure highlights the top 25 proteins that exhibit over a 5-fold increase in expression on the plasma membrane in the OC condition compared to the ND condition (triangle plots). The gene names of these 25 proteins are presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Table 1</xref> provides the corresponding protein names along with the corresponding fold increases). Notably, TRPV4, a member of the transient receptor potential family of ion channels known for its mechanosensitive properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, showed a remarkable 153-fold increase in plasma membrane association in response to cell crowding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Additionally, we observed an increase in plasma membrane association of other ion channels, such as SCN11A (the alpha subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.9) with ∼42-fold enrichment, and KCNN4 (the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3 SK3) showing ∼6-fold increase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). To evaluate the relative plasma membrane association of proteins under OC versus ND conditions, we performed a comparable mass spectrometry analysis of cell-surface biotinylated cell lysates for MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and MCF10CA1a cells. The top 25 gene/protein names showing increased plasma membrane associations in these cells are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Table 2</xref>. Unlike in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cases, there was no cell-crowdinginduced relocation of ion channels and ion transporters to the plasma membrane in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells. However, in MCF10CA1a cells, ion transporters such as ATP2B4 showed a ∼37-fold greater plasma membrane association under crowding conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Table 2</xref>). This suggests that plasma membrane relocations of these ion channels and ion transporters in response to cell crowding selectively occurred in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells and, to an extent, in invasive ductal cancer MCF10CA1a cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl.

<p>TRPV4 plays a pivotal role in facilitating the passage of calcium ions (Ca2+) and is integral in detecting various forms of mechanical stresses, including temperature fluctuations and osmotic pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Activation of TRPV4 channels elevates intracellular calcium levels, leading to cell volume increase via osmotic water influx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Nav1.9 primarily contributes to the generation and propagation of action potentials in sensory neurons and is associated with various pain disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. SK3 channels are activated by elevated intracellular calcium levels and serve diverse physiological functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. However, unlike TRPV4, Nav1.9 and SK3 channels are not generally classified as mechanosensors. Consequently, we focused on TRPV4, the mechanosensor channel displaying the most significant increase in the plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, to further investigate its role in promoting pro-invasive cell volume reduction in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells.</p>
<p>To confirm the selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in OC-treated <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells suggested by the mass spectrometry results, we performed immunoprecipitation using avidin beads on surface-biotinylated lysates from all four cell types under both control and OC conditions, followed by immunoblotting. The immunoblots showed a notable association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, which was significantly lower in ND cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1"> and Suppl. Fig. 5A</xref>). This association was not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells under any conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Interestingly, in MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 associated with the plasma membrane under both conditions, with a slight increase in OC conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). This increase suggests that these cells may also possess mechanosensing abilities, enabling them to respond to cell crowding. Additionally, immunoblots from whole-cell lysates showed consistent TRPV4 expression levels across different cell types and densities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 5B</xref>), indicating that cell crowding influences ion channel trafficking without altering overall expression. This evidence strongly suggests that the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane is a mechanosensitive response to cell crowding.</p>
<p>To investigate the redistribution of TRPV4 in response to cell crowding, we performed IF imaging with confocal microscopy across all four cell types under both ND and OC conditions. The binding specificity of the TRPV4 antibody was validated in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells using TRPV4-specific shRNA, as demonstrated by IF imaging (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 6A</xref>) and immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 6B</xref>). As expected from the mass spectrometry results, TRPV4 (red) showed only modest localization to the plasma membrane in ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In contrast, it was prominently associated with the plasma membrane in OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 was also associated with plasma membrane under ND conditions, but cell crowding also increased the association significantly as shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Plasma membrane associations were verified using the plasma membrane marker DiIC18(3), which we previously used to visualize the plasma membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. IF images showed that TRPV4 successfully colocalized with DiIC18(3) in OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> and OC MCF10CA1a cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 7A).</xref> However, the non-interacting protein transferrin receptor (TfR; green) remained similarly distributed in the OC cells compared to the ND cells, indicating that the protein trafficking changes induced by cell crowding are specific to TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether other ion channels identified through mass spectrometry and the wellknown mechanosensory channel PIEZO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, exhibit similar behavior, we conducted IF imaging on ND and OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells targeting KCNN4 and PIEZO1. Unfortunately, due to the absence of specific antibodies, we were unable to examine SCN11. In ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, KCNN4 was observed to be mostly cytosolic, while PIEZO1 was mildly but slightly more associated with the plasma membrane than TRPV4 under ND conditions. However, under OC conditions, both PIEZO1 and KCNN4 also relocated to the plasma membrane, albeit to a lesser extent than TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 7B</xref>). The varying degrees of plasma membrane association of PIEZO1 and KCNN4 are quantified using line analysis, as summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supple. Fig. 7C</xref>.</p>
<p>As expected, in MCF10A, MCF10AT1, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells under ND conditions, TRPV4 was modestly present at the plasma membrane but predominantly localized intracellularly, with notable enrichment in the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Under OC conditions, TRPV4 remained largely cytosolic in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells but migrated out of the nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In contrast, in OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, approximately 80% of TRPV4 relocated to the plasma membrane, as shown by line analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In MCF10CA1a cells, TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane was evident under both ND and OC conditions, with a further increase under OC, aligning with the immunoprecipitation results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 was quantified using line analysis and plotted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>. Refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 8A</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 associations with the plasma membrane, cytosol, and nucleus between ND and OC conditions in all four cell types. These IF imaging results underscore the mechanosensitive plasma membrane relocation of ion channels in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link>, and to an extent, in MCF10CA1a cells, contrasting with the observed insensitivity of MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells to cell crowding.</p>
<p>To assess the relationship between cell crowding-induced cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, we investigated whether hyperosmotic conditions, which reduce cell volume without cell crowding, would also result in TRPV4 relocation. We subjected ND cells to the same PEG 300 condition (74.4 mOsm/kg for 15 minutes) used in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> to induce cell volume reduction. In ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, such hyperosmotic cell volume reduction prompted significant plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, a response not observed in MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells, but observed in MCF10CA1a cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). Quantitative line analysis confirmed these findings by assessing the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 8B</xref> for plots of the relative TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane, cytosol, or nucleus). We confirmed that the apparent plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 under the hyperosmotic condition was indeed localized at the plasma membrane by using an extracellular domain antibody against TRPV4 in live <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, both untreated and treated with 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. As expected, significant antibody binding was observed only in PEG 300-treated cells, where intracellular TRPV4 had relocated to the plasma membrane unlike in untreated live cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 9A</xref>-B). This finding underscores the relationship between mechanosensitive cell volume reduction and plasma membrane relocation of TRPV4, highlighting that both cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress lead to the same effect, which is particularly pronounced in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells.</p>
<p>We investigated whether TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane induced by cell crowding is reversible, as suggested by its impact on invasiveness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 3F</xref>). To test this, previously OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells were reseeded under ND conditions. We then assessed TRPV4 localization via IF imaging to determine if most channels returned to the cytoplasm with only a modest localization at the plasma membrane, and could be relocated to the plasma membrane under mechanical stress, such as hyperosmotic conditions, again. Consistent with their initial ND state, reseeded ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells displayed intracellular TRPV4 distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl.

Fig. 10B</xref>). These findings, quantified through line analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl.

<title>Patient tissue analysis shows selective plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells</title>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells represent a basal cell model for high-grade DCIS cells driven by HRAS mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, the majority of patient-derived DCIS cells originate from the luminal cell population and lack the HRAS mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Moreover, there are limited options for patient-derived DCIS cell line models that have not linked to well-defined pathology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. Thus, to seek generality of our finding regarding the selective association between plasma membrane relocation and high-grade DCIS pathology, we examined 39 breast cancer patient tissue blocks to assess the selectivity in vivo. We designed an early-stage retrospective study by selecting various breast tissue pathologies that range from benign to invasive cancer. Those pathologies include usual ductal hyperplasia, papilloma, columnar changes, ADH, low- to high-grade DCIS, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). We also incorporated normal regions for comparison. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to visualize tissue sections from each patient, excluding samples with prior cancer diagnoses or drug treatments. In total, 97 regions of interest (ROIs) from H&amp;E-stained sections of 39 patient tissue blocks were selected. Two pathologists independently assessed TRPV4 distribution patterns at the single-cell level in corresponding ROIs in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) images (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). A detailed methodology is described in the Methods section and more example images are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 11</xref>. High-grade DCIS cells, as depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>, clearly demonstrated plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), a feature absent in lower-grade DCIS cells (intermediate- and low-grade). This distinction sets them apart not only from cells with ADH and benign pathologies but also from lower-grade DCIS cells. As demonstrated by the IF images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> for MCF10CA1a (invasive cell mimic), IDC cells exhibited notable plasma membrane TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>), suggesting that they possess a similar pro-invasive mechanotransduction capability to high-grade DCIS cells.</p>
<p>We found that the sensitivity and specificity for plasma membrane TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells were 0.75 ± 0.19 (15/20) and 0.98 ± 0.03 (61/62) respectively (95% confidence interval) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3I</xref>). It is important to note that the specificity calculation excluded IDC cases. Notably, even in less aggressive pathologies, a significant amount of TRPV4 was localized in the nuclei, as shown for MCF10A and MCF10AT1 cells in the IF images in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>. This underscores our interpretation from the in vitro results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-D</xref> that increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 in high-grade DCIS cells results from changes in protein localization through trafficking alterations, rather than differences in expression levels. These initial in vivo results clearly demonstrate the selective and specific association of TRPV4 with the plasma membrane in high-grade DCIS cells. Notably, this association is absent in lower-grade DCIS, ADH, benign, and normal cells, thereby confirming our in vitro findings using MCF10A cell derivatives. These results suggest a potentially critical role for TRPV4 in the progression of high-grade DCIS.</p>

<title>Cell crowding inhibits ion channels and triggers their plasma membrane relocations</title>
<p>A calcium-permeant ion channel like TRPV4 is known to influence intracellular calcium dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. While activation of TRPV4 typically elevates calcium levels and this potentially increases cell volume<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>, the impact of its inhibition is less clear, given the multifaceted nature of calcium signaling in cell volume control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. This complexity is compounded by compensatory cellular mechanisms and the involvement of other ion channels in response to altered calcium homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Considering these factors, we hypothesized that cell crowding might inhibit calcium-permeant ion channels that are constitutively active at the plasma membrane, including TRPV4, which would then lower intracellular calcium levels and subsequently reduce cell volume via osmotic water movement. To test this, we employed the Fluo-4 calcium assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> to compare relative intracellular calcium levels of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells between ND and confluent (Con) conditions through 4X confocal microscopy imaging with 488 nm excitation. For this calcium assay, we opted for confluent conditions instead of OC conditions to collect the Fluo-4 signal from confluent monolayers of MCF10DCIS cells, which demonstrates comparable cell-crowding induced TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 12A</xref>) as observed in the OC condition. This choice was made because more than one layer of cells was occasionally observed in OC conditions, which would yield overestimation of crowding-dependent intracellular calcium levels. The intracellular Fluo-4 signal under Con conditions was significantly lower than that under ND conditions, as shown in the fluorescence images of ND versus Con cells in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. Time-dependent Fluo-4 images were acquired over 25 minutes. For ND cell images, the average Fluo-4 intensity values were calculated from 10-15 selected cells (highlighted in the white box in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). For Con cell images, intensity values were derived from all cells within the entire 50 μm by 50 μm field of view, as depicted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. After background subtraction, the intensity values were plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>. The temporal Fluo-4 intensity profiles from both ND and Con cells remained largely constant over the measured 20-minute period. However, Con cells exhibited significantly lower Fluo-4 intensity compared to ND cells, indicating reduced intracellular calcium levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Lower Fluo-4 intensity in Con cells than in ND cells was not due to limited Fluo-4 reagent in Con samples. Within cell clusters, cells experiencing crowding exhibited notably lower Fluo-4 levels compared to those at the periphery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 12B</xref>), suggesting that cell crowding had resulted in a decrease in intracellular calcium levels, likely due to the mechanosensitive inhibition of calcium-permeable channels like TRPV4.</p>

However, GSK219 significantly relocates TRPV4 to the plasma membrane in a dose-dependent manner (Supple.

Relative plasma membrane associations with different treatments are quantified for ND <bold>(P)</bold> and OC <bold>(Q)</bold> cells using line analysis. The number of line analyses <bold>(P, Q)</bold> (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was follows: ND and OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> (control: 12 and 8; GSK219 Low: 6 and 7; GSK219 High: 6 and 13; GSK101 Low: 7 and 8; GSK101 High: 7 and 10; 2% PEG: 12 and 12). <bold>(R)</bold> The magnitudes of Fluo-4 spikes by GSK101 and dips by GSK219 show a linear relationship (<italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.69), indicating a negative correlation between them.

However, hyperosmotic stress by 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 (light gray box) led to a noticeable spike only in control ND cells. Additionally, cell crowding conditions (Con) led to a decreased Fluo-4 level (at <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> baseline in the image in <bold>S</bold> and red time trace in <bold>T</bold>); but a reduced in Fluo-4 level diference in shRNA-treated <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (<italic>t</italic>1; <bold>U</bold>) compared to control cases (<bold>S</bold>, <bold>T</bold>), as shown in the image and time trace (<italic>t</italic>1; <bold>V</bold>). <bold>(W)</bold> Relative Fluo-4 time-averaged intensities are plotted for individual control ND (blue) vs. Con (red) cells, and shRNA-treated ND (semi-transparent blue) vs. Con (semi-transparent red) cells.

The decrease in calcium levels by crowding (Con) in shRNA cells is clearly lower than in control cells, reflecting the importance of TRPV4 in mechanosensing cell volume reduction. The number of Fluo-4 average measurements (technical replicates merged from two independent experimental repeats) was follows: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> control and TRPV4 shRNA groups (ND: 19 and 18; Con: 11 and 17). <bold>(X)</bold> PEG 300-induced calcium spikes are significantly lower in shRNA cells (semi-transparent gray) than in control cells (gray), reinforcing TRPV4’s crucial role in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> mechanotransduction.

<p>To investigate whether TRPV4 inhibition was involved in decreased intracellular calcium levels and subsequent relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane, we employed TRPV4-specific pharmacological agents to alter TRPV4 activity and modulate calcium concentrations in ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells without applying cell crowding conditions. To inhibit TRPV4 activity, we used a TRPV4 inhibitor (GSK2193874; GSK219)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> at 0.2 and 1 nM, which we confirmed to have insignificant effects on cell viability in both ND and OC conditions for two days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 13A</xref>). GSK219 treatments immediately caused a modest dip in the Fluo-4 signal -- or intracellular calcium level -- followed by a recovery, indicating cellular homeostatic activity. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> shows Fluo-4 images taken before and at the signal dip after applying 1 nM GSK219, where the dip in the Fluo-4 signal is not visually apparent. However, the temporal profile of Fluo-4 intensity in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, which corresponds to the time points marked in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> (<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>: baseline and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>: dip), clearly shows the dip at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>, indicated by ΔCa (the vertical dashed line between the dip and the baseline). This modest Fluo-4 dip at <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> represents the inhibition of activity by GSK219 on a small population of constitutively active TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane under ND conditions.</p>
<p>In Con cells, 1 nM GSK219 caused a smaller dip in Fluo-4 intensity compared to the one observed in ND cells, with no subsequent changes. This is likely due to fewer constitutively active TRPV4 at the plasma membrane in Con cells than in ND cells. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref> shows Fluo-4 images at the baseline and the dip, and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref> presents the temporal Fluo-4 intensity profile, highlighting the two time points. Indeed, the dip in Fluo-4 intensity induced by GSK219 was smaller for Con <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (mean ΔCa ∼ −39 ± 9) than for ND cells (mean ΔCa ∼ −49 ± 18), as illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>. The dose-dependent (0.2 nM and 1 nM GSK219, labeled 219L and 219H) and cell density-dependent (ND and Con) Fluo-4 signal dips are summarized by the ΔCa values plotted in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H</xref>, showing that the most significant TRPV4 inhibition occurred in ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells treated with 1 nM GSK219 (219H). These findings suggest that a portion of TRPV4 channels that are constitutively active at the plasma membrane became inactive in response to cell crowding and that a significant fraction of TRPV4 channels relocated to the plasma membrane under cell crowding remained inactive.</p>
<p>Administering a TRPV4 activator (GSK1016790A; GSK101)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup> immediately caused a notably greater spike in Fluo-4 signal in Con cells than in ND cells, evidencing that a large number of TRPV4 channels at the plasma membrane were inactive in Con cells. In Con cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 led to a large Fluo-4 signal spike with ΔCa ∼ +2,348 ± 597, while in ND cells, ΔCa was just ∼ +324 ± 130. This difference is depicted in the Fluo-4 images (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref> for ND and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref> for Con) and the time-dependent Fluo-4 intensity plots (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref> for ND and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref> for Con). The dose (101L and 101H representing 0.05 pM and 0.2 pM GSK101) and cell-density (ND and Con) dependent Fluo-4 signal spikes are summarized in the plotted ΔCa values (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). The results show the significant GSK101 dose-responsive activation of previously inactive TRPV4 in Con <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, suggesting that many inactive TRPV4 channels present at the plasma membrane were primed for activation.</p>
<p>Based on the differing effects of GSK219 and GSK101 on immediate intracellular calcium responses, along with lower baseline calcium levels in Con cells compared to ND cells, we hypothesized that cell crowding induces TRPV4 inhibition, leading to reduced intracellular calcium levels, which in turn triggers the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane as a compensatory mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we examined TRPV4 localization changes in response to GSK219 or GSK101 in a dose-dependent manner in both ND and OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells using IF imaging (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref> for higher GSK101/219 concentrations; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 13B</xref> for both concentrations).</p>
<p>Indeed, treating ND cells with the TRPV4 inhibitor GSK219 for 1 hour resulted in significant dose- dependent TRPV4 relocation to the plasma membrane (∼53 ± 7% at 0.2 nM and ∼62 ± 7% at 1 nM), compared to control ND cells (∼15 ± 6%), as shown by line analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4P</xref>). These results indicate that TRPV4 inhibition induces its strategic relocation to the plasma membrane, priming the channels for rapid activation to counteract the effects of mechanically-induced inhibition.</p>
<p>In contrast, in Con cells, where a greater number of inactive TRPV4 channels are likely present at the plasma membrane, GSK101 treatment led to a dose-dependent reduction in plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, likely due to internalization of the activated channels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Q</xref>). This finding is consistent with previous findings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. These data suggest that plasma membrane TRPV4 levels were largely regulated by the channel’s activity status. Specifically, channel activation led to the internalization of TRPV4, while channel inhibition promoted the relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane. This relationship was approximately linear, as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4R</xref>, with intracellular calcium changes inversely proportional to the plasma membrane fraction of TRPV4 (<italic>R</italic>² ≈ 0.69).</p>
<p>Contrary to our expectation, GSK219 treatment in Con cells slightly reduced TRPV4 levels at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Q</xref>). Moreover, higher doses of GSK219 increased nuclear TRPV4 levels in Con cells without affecting cytoplasmic levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 13B</xref>). These findings suggest that further TRPV4 inhibition under crowding conditions triggers a distinct trafficking alteration. Recent studies have implicated nuclear TRPV4 in regulating nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and Ca<sup>2+</sup>- regulated transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, and, in light of this study and our findings, TRPV4 may relocate to the nucleus as a compensatory mechanism to maintain nuclear calcium regulation. This relocation could reflect an adaptive response to preserve calcium-dependent transcriptional programs or other nuclear processes essential for cell survival under mechanical stress.</p>
<p>Given the role of TRPV4 in osmoregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>, we investigated its significant relocation to the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic conditions. In ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, TRPV4 plasma membrane association increased from a baseline of ∼15% to ∼55% following 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 treatment, as shown by line analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4P</xref>). To explore whether TRPV4 inhibition contributed to this relocation, we conducted Fluo-4 assays under the same treatment conditions. The results revealed that osmotic water outflow induced an initial spike in intracellular calcium concentration, followed by a homeostatic relaxation aimed at restoring calcium levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 14A</xref>). This relaxation likely involved the inhibition of ion channels, including TRPV4, and their subsequent relocation to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Consistent with this hypothesis, we confirmed the plasma membrane relocation of other ion channels, namely KCNN4 and PIEZO1, following the same PEG 300 treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 14B</xref>, showing IF images and line analysis results). These findings suggest that the increased TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane under hyperosmotic stress reflects an adaptive response to water outflow, driven by the inhibition and redistribution of ion channels to regulate osmotic balance.</p>
<p>To investigate the role of TRPV4 in mechanotransduction, we used shRNA to silence TRPV4 gene expression, resulting in a ∼50% reduction in TRPV4 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 6B</xref>). We then assessed the effects of TRPV4 silencing on intracellular calcium levels in ND and Con conditions, as well as the immediate calcium response to hyperosmotic stress induced by 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300. In ND cells, hyperosmotic stress triggered a significant calcium spike, as shown in the Fluo-4 image (middle; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4S</xref>) and time trace (blue; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4T</xref>). In contrast, TRPV4 silencing in ND cells led to a lower intracellular calcium level (left; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4U</xref>) and a reduced calcium spike in response to hyperosmotic stress (middle; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4U</xref>, and semi-transparent blue; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4V</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of TRPV4 silencing on intracellular calcium levels was less pronounced in Con cells (semi-transparent red; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4V</xref>) compared to the ND counterpart (semi-transparent blue; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4V</xref>). The relative intracellular calcium levels are summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4W</xref>.</p>
<p>Notably, TRPV4 silencing significantly reduced the immediate calcium spike as summarized in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4X</xref>. This calcium spike was attributed to increased calcium concentration due to hyperosmotically reduced cell volume (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 14A</xref>). Thus, TRPV4 may play a critical role in mechanotransduction, enabling cells to sufficiently reduce their volume in response to mechanical stress (large volume plasticity). To further investigate this, we examined the effect of TRPV4 silencing on ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cell volume reduction in response to hyperosmotic stress. We indeed found that control ND cells underwent a 48% volume reduction in response to 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300, whereas TRPV4-silenced cells only reduced their volume by 27% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Y</xref>). Notably, the reduced cell volume change observed in TRPV4-silenced cells under hyperosmotic conditions supports the idea that the observed calcium spikes are driven by cell volume reduction. This finding reinforces the concept that TRPV4 enhances cellular mechanosensitivity by facilitating volume changes and maintaining calcium homeostasis in response to mechanical stress.</p>

<title>TRPV4 inhibition drives cell volume reduction and increased invasiveness under cell crowding</title>
<p>To elucidate the relationship between TRPV4 inhibition, cell volume reduction, and increased invasiveness under cell crowding, we investigated the effects of TRPV4 activity status on these processes. Specifically, we evaluated how 2-day treatments with GSK101 and GSK219 impacted the cell volumes of ND and OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells.

<p>Under Con conditions, GSK101 triggered significant dose-dependent calcium spikes, leading to corresponding increases in cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In contrast, GSK219 under Con conditions had minimal effects on intracellular calcium levels and did not alter TRPV4 distribution at the plasma membrane, resulting in a slight cell volume reduction at 1 nM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Similarly, PEG 300 caused a modest decrease in cell volume, comparable to the effect of 1 nM GSK219 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). As expected, plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (% PM TRPV4) showed a significant inverse linear correlation with cell volume (<italic>R</italic>² ≈ 0.59) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). These findings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-B</xref>) indicate that increased TRPV4 inhibition and the subsequent reduction in intracellular calcium levels in response to cell crowding are associated with decreased cell volume in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells.</p>
<p>We investigated the connections between TRPV4 activity, plasma membrane association, cell volume changes, and cell invasiveness. Using a collagen-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel matrix-based invasion assay, we evaluated changes in invasiveness after 2-day treatments with GSK101 or GSK219. In ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, 0.2 pM GSK101 mildly suppressed cell invasiveness, while 0.05 pM GSK101 caused no effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). In contrast, GSK219 increased the invasive cell fraction in a dose-dependent manner under ND conditions, mirroring changes in Fluo-4 signals and plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Under OC conditions, GSK101 increased cell volume and suppressed cell invasiveness dose-dependently (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Conversely, GSK219 and PEG 300, which slightly reduced cell volume, increased cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Representative invasion images are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 15A</xref>. These results establish a clear relationship between TRPV4 activity, plasma membrane-associated TRPV4, cell volume, and cell invasiveness. Notably, we observed a significant positive linear correlation between plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 and cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.69) and an inverse relationship between cell volume and cell invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.89).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated cell-crowding induced cell motility changes in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, since invasiveness encompasses both the ability to penetrate and migrate through surrounding tissues. As expected from the increased cortical stiffness of OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), we observed that OC <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells underwent cytoskeletal rearrangements, including the increased formation of stress fibers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Suppl. Fig. 15B</xref>), which likely enhanced cell motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. To assess how TRPV4 inhibition and activation, which reduced and increased cell volume, respectively, affected the motility of ND <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells and the role of these motility changes on cell invasiveness, we conducted single-cell tracking experiments similar to single molecule tracking methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We utilized wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as a nuclear marker, which stained the cell nucleus within 1 hour of incubation with cells. We then analyzed the diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) and directionality (<italic>v</italic>) of single cell movements. We tracked overall single-cell trajectories for 3 hr with 1 min intervals, marking cell displacement over each interval in different colors, ranging from navy for the slowest to red for the fastest (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Consistent with the trend in cell invasiveness, TRPV4 activation with 1 pM GSK101 significantly reduced single-cell movements, while inhibition with 0.2 nM GSK219 and 74.4 mOsm/kg PEG 300 notably increased these movements.</p>
<p>Using the single-cell motility assay, we investigated how TRPV4 enhances cell invasiveness through a mechanotransduction mechanism involving cell-volume reduction. Reducing TRPV4 expression (∼50%) via shRNA diminished the cell volume reduction effect of mechanosensing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4Y</xref>). We predicted that shRNA would also attenuate the increased cell motility effect of mechanosensing in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. Additionally, since reduced TRPV4 in ND cells lowered intracellular calcium level as shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4W</xref>, shRNA effect would follow the effect of GSK219. Indeed, shRNA (Sh-ctrl; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H, 5I</xref>) slightly increased both <italic>D</italic> and <italic>v</italic> of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cell movement, mimicking the effects of GSK219. However, the shRNA disabled the mechanotransduction capability of the cells given that there was no increase in <italic>D</italic> and <italic>v</italic> induced by hyperosmotic stress using 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 (Sh-PEG; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H, 5I</xref>, 5I). This result reinforces the critical role of TRPV4 in increasing cell invasiveness through mechanosensing activity inhibition-induced cell volume reduction.</p>
<p>Interestingly, while GSK219 and hyperosmotic conditions promoted increased cell movement (<italic>D</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>), they also reduced cell directionality (<italic>v</italic>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5J</xref>). This reduction in directionality suggests that while the cells become more mobile, their movements are less targeted, potentially indicating a more random or exploratory behavior under mechanical stress. Remarkably, cell movement increased in proportion to the amount of TRPV4 at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.73) and decreased with greater cell volume (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.89). Cell movement and invasiveness showed a strong linear correlation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>; <italic>R</italic>² ∼ 0.85), suggesting that these behaviors are governed by the same underlying mechanisms. Thus, our motility assay can inform cell invasiveness at the single-cell level.</p>

<title>Mechanosensitive TRPV4 relocation to plasma membrane indicates enhanced invasiveness</title>
<p>We investigated whether the mechanosensitive relocation of TRPV4 to the plasma membrane can reliably predict a cell’s ability to undergo pro-invasive mechanosensitive cell volume reduction. To achieve this, we used changes in cell motility as markers for overall shifts in cell invasiveness, given the strong correlation observed between cell motility and invasiveness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5M</xref>). Our hypothesis is that cells with such mechanotransduction capability, like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells, should show increased plasma membrane association of TRPV4 when inhibited with GSK219 or under hyperosmotic conditions, evidenced by increased cell motility (<italic>D</italic>) while demonstrating the opposite effect with GSK101 treatment.</p>

Notably, none of these cell lines showed motility changes in response to PEG 300 treatment.

This suggests that these cells lack the pro-invasive mechanosensitive cell volume reduction capability observed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells.

However, the changes in plasma membrane TRPV4 occurred over a narrower range (31 – 79%) for MCF10CA1a compared to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells (16 - 75%), reflecting the larger mechanosensitive cell volume plasticity of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. In contrast, MDA-MB-231, ETCC-006, and ETCC-010 cells did not show this scaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q</xref>). Like MCF10AT1 cells, plasma membrane TRPV4 associations in these cells remained at similar percentages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6Q</xref>).</p>
<p>This dichotomy in the presence of a pro-invasive mechanotransduction program is evident in the plots of diffusivity (<italic>D</italic>) increase versus plasma membrane TRPV4 relocation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6R</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6S</xref>), where only MCF10CA1a and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells show a significant increase in both parameters.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study explored how cell crowding, a common condition in diseases and development, impacts cell invasiveness. We employed novel assays to quantify cell invasion and single-cell motility in cells with breast tissue pathologies, including DCIS and ADH, which experience cell crowding due to abnormal proliferation in confined ducts. Our results revealed a mechanotransduction pathway activated by crowding selectively in high-grade DCIS cells, establishing a direct link between crowding and invasiveness. This pathway includes ion channel inhibition, intracellular calcium reduction, compensatory channel relocation to the plasma membrane for priming them for later activation, cell volume reduction and cell stiffening, and increased invasiveness and motility (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, the compensatory relocation of ion channels to the plasma membrane serves as a reliable indicator of an active mechanotransduction pathway. This mechanotransduction capability that enables pro-invasive cell volume reduction distinguishes high-grade DCIS cells from normal, hyperplastic, or lower-grade DCIS cells, supporting previous findings that the ability of cells to reach minimal cell volume promotes efficient invasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.</p>

<caption><title>Cell crowding activates a pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells but not in less aggressive or normal cells.</title>
<p>This cell-crowding-induced pro-invasive pathway involves a cascade of events, including ion channel inhibition, intracellular calcium reduction, cell volume reduction and cortical stiffening, and increased cell invasiveness and motility. In high-grade DCIS cells, calcium-permeable ion channels such as TRPV4 relocate to the plasma membrane upon inhibition, compensating for reduced intracellular calcium levels by priming the channels for later activation under mechanical stress. The pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway is selectively triggered by cell crowding or hyperosmotic stress in high-grade DCIS cells, which exhibit significant TRPV4 plasma membrane relocation, pronounced cell volume reduction, and increased motility and invasiveness. In contrast, less aggressive or normal cells remain significantly less or non-responsive to these stimuli. Notably, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells exhibit greater cell volume reduction compared to other cells, likely due to their larger baseline cell volume at normal density, demonstrating their high cell volume plasticity that correlates with crowding-induced invasiveness. The extent of TRPV4 plasma membrane relocation, cell volume reduction, and increased invasiveness and motility scales with each other, where the increased TRPV4 association with the plasma membrane can robustly serve as a marker of pro-invasive mechanotransduction activation. This mechanotransduction capability sets high-grade DCIS cells apart from less aggressive cells, providing a critical criterion that may help identify high-risk cells with invasive potential. This mechanotransduction capability was also validated in patient specimens, suggesting its relevance in clinical settings. Future investigations will include utilizing TRPV4 localization patterns as a diagnostic tool to assist in pathological grading and as a prognostic marker to identify high-risk DCIS cells likely to activate this pathway under mechanical stress.</p></caption>

<p>Using mass spectrometry, we identified TRPV4 as a crucial component of this pathway, providing insights into how non-invasive breast cancer cells may evolve into invasive phenotypes under mechanical stress. Through Fluo-4 assays and TRPV4 activators and inhibitors, we found that cell crowding triggered TRPV4 inhibition, leading to reduced intracellular calcium and subsequent cell volume reduction in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells. Notably, TRPV4 inhibition prompted its relocation to the plasma membrane, priming it for later activation under suitable signaling conditions to maintain cellular homeostasis. TRPV4 inhibition by cell crowding increased invasiveness and motility, while TRPV4 activation had the opposite effect. Reducing TRPV4 protein expression by 50% via shRNA diminished both calcium decrease and volume reduction under mechanical stress, such as cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions. These TRPV4-knockdown cells did not exhibit increased motility under hyperosmotic conditions, demonstrating TRPV4’s critical role in mechanotransduction-induced invasiveness through lowering cell volume plasticity. Invasive MCF10CA1a cells showed similar but modest mechanotransduction capability. In contrast, other invasive breast cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, exhibited opposing responses to TRPV4 inhibition and activation, highlighting the heterogeneity of TRPV4 roles in invasive cancer progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Our discovery of a selective mechanotransduction pathway in high-grade DCIS cells was further validated through the analysis of patient-derived breast cancer tissues. Plasma membrane association of TRPV4 was predominantly observed in high-grade DCIS and IDC lesions but was absent in lower-grade DCIS and less aggressive pathologies. This selective relocation highlights TRPV4’s critical role in the pro-invasive mechanotransduction pathway unique to high-grade DCIS cells and certain IDC subsets. These findings suggest that plasma membrane-associated TRPV4 may serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying high-grade DCIS lesions.</p>
<p>Our data indicate that ion channels beyond TRPV4 may contribute to pro-invasive mechanotransduction. Notably, SCN11A and KCNN4 showed increased plasma membrane association under cell crowding conditions, suggesting their roles in modulating ion flux and cell volume and thus contributing to the mechanotransduction response. Although PIEZO1 is known to respond to mechanical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, its lesser plasma membrane relocation compared to TRPV4 under cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions suggests a lesser role in promoting invasiveness in this case. Further comparisons are needed to determine the dominant ion channel driving mechanotransduction in high-grade DCIS cells. However, it is evident that cell crowding-induced pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathway involves the coordinated action of multiple ion channels to significantly reduce intracellular calcium levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We made the novel discovery that hyperosmotic conditions, which reduce cell volume through osmotic water efflux, mimic the effects of cell crowding by inducing similar pro-invasive cell volume reduction. Treatment with hyperosmotic agents such as PEG 300 caused TRPV4 to relocate to the plasma membrane and increased cell invasiveness, underscoring TRPV4’s role as a key mechanosensor responding to external mechanical stresses in this pathway. These findings suggest that the convergence of different mechanical stresses, including cell crowding and hyperosmotic stress, serves as a critical trigger for pro-invasive cell volume reduction pathways, activating a unified mechanotransduction signaling cascade.</p>
<p>The study’s insights have far-reaching implications, unlocking new research paths in cancer and biological sciences. By elucidating mechanosensitive responses to cell crowding, we can shed light on tissue development, wound healing, and physiological processes involving cell density changes. The parallels between cell crowding and hyperosmotic conditions in driving pro-invasive behaviors warrant further investigation into the intricate mechanisms of cytoskeleton reorganization, ion channel and transporter relocation, and enhanced cell invasiveness and motility. Importantly, our findings illuminate the mechanotransduction capability of high-grade DCIS cells that differentiate them from less aggressive cells. This understanding paves the way for developing diagnostic and prognostic strategies that leverage the selective intracellular localization patterns of TRPV4 and other mechanosensitive ion channels, ultimately guiding clinical decisions for patients with high-risk DCIS and other cancers.</p>

This mixture was then vortexed and allowed to sit for 15 min. While waiting for the 2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent to finish being prepared, the media from the well of a LabTek II Chambered Coverglass with Cover #1.5 Borosilicate Sterile 8-well plate (Thermo Fisher 155409) was removed and replaced with 200 μL of complete media. Once the 2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent was fully prepared, 200 μL of the reagent was added to the well with 200 μL of complete media. The 8-well plate was then placed at 37 °C and 5% CO₂ for 30 min. Following 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO₂, the 8-well plate was removed from the incubator and placed at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation in the reagent for 30 min at room temperature, the 8-well plate was imaged using the confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser for 30 min with 30-second intervals between images and an exposure time of 200 ms. If the sample was treated, the sample was imaged for 35 min with 30-second intervals, with the treatment being added after 5 minhad elapsed. Added treatments all had a final volume of 200 μL and were composed of: 1 nM GSK 2 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 0.2 nM GSK 2 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 0.2 pM GSK 1 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, 1:1:1 water:media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent, and 0.3 Osm/L PEG 300 in 1:1 media:2X Fluo-4 calcium assay reagent.</p>

<title>Cell motility assay</title>
<p>Cells were first seeded in MatTek 35 mm dishes with No. 1.5 coverslip, 14 mm glass diameter, and Poly-D-Lysine coated glass bottoms (MatTek P35GC-1.5-14-C). Once the cells adhered, they were stained with 10 μg/mL WGA-488 (Thermo Fisher W11261) for 10 min at room temperature. Following the staining, the cells were washed with complete media twice and then incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO₂ for 1 h. During this incubation, the cells received the following treatments: 0.2 pM GSK 101 in complete media for 1 h, 0.05 pM GSK 101 in complete media for 1 h, 1 nM GSK 219 in complete media for 1 h, 0.2 nM GSK 219 in complete media for 1 h, 74.4 mOsm/Kg PEG 300 in complete media for 15 min, and 1:1 hypoosmotic solution in complete media for 15 min. After the incubation, the sample was placed in an OkoLab chamber at 37 °C and 5% CO₂ for imaging. Imaging was completed using a confocal microscope with a 488 nm laser for 3 h with 1-minute intervals.</p>

<title>Cell viability assay</title>
<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MCF10DCIS.com">MCF10DCIS.com</ext-link> cells were plated in a LabTek II 8-well Chambered Coverglass dish (Thermo Fisher 155409) at a seeding density of 10,000 cells per well. Once the cells in the well reached the desired number of days post-confluence, they were stained using Propidium Iodide Ready Flow Reagent (Thermo Fisher R37169). Specifically, 1 drop of propidium iodide (PI) was added to 500 µL of cell growth medium per well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (22°C). After staining, the cells were washed twice with complete growth medium. Next, the cells were stained with 1 µg/mL WGA-488 (Thermo Fisher w11261) in complete growth medium for 15 min at 37°C in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere. Following the incubation with WGA-488, the cells were washed three times with complete growth medium and then incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO₂ to allow WGA migration into the nuclei. Finally, the cells were imaged using confocal microscopy at 4X magnification, with laser excitation at 488 nm for WGA-488 and 560 nm for propidium iodide.</p>

<p>This <bold>fundamental</bold> study provides <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that TRPV4 plays a crucial role in mechanical sensing during cancer cell transition from non-invasive to invasive states, and offers novel insights into metastasis. By employing multiple experimental approaches, including pharmacological and genetic manipulation, as well as advanced imaging techniques, the authors demonstrate a strong correlation between TRPV4 dynamics, calcium homeostasis, and cell volume plasticity. The findings significantly enhance our understanding of mechanotransduction in cancer and present TRPV4 as a promising therapeutic target for inhibiting metastasis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bu et al examined the dynamics of TRPV4 channel in cell overcrowding in carcinoma conditions. They investigated how cell crowding (or high cell confluence) triggers a mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells that leads to large cell volume reduction (or cell volume plasticity) and pro-invasive phenotype.</p>
<p>In vitro, this pathway is highly selective for highly malignant invasive cell lines derived from a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF10CA) compared to the parent cell line, but not present in another triple-negative invasive breast epithelial cell line (MDA-MB-231). The authors convincingly showed that enhanced TRPV4 plasmamembrane localization correlates with high-grade DCIS cells in patient tissue samples. Specifically in invasive MCF10DCIS.com cells they showed that overcrowding or over-confluence leads to a decrease in cell volume and intracellular calcium levels. This condition also triggers the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores (nucleus and potentially endosomes), to the plasma membrane (PM). When these over-confluent cells are incubated with a TRPV4 activator, there is an acute and substantial influx of calcium, attesting the fact that there are high number of TRPV4 channels present on the PM. Long-term incubation of these over-confluent cells with the TRPV4 activator results in the internalization of the PM-localized TRPV4 channels.</p>
<p>In contrast, cells plated at lower confluence primarily have TRPV4 channels localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Long-term incubation of these cells at lower confluence with a TRPV4 inhibitor leads to the relocation of TRPV4 channels to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores and a subsequent reduction in cell volume. Similarly, incubation of these cells at low confluence with PEG 3000 (a hyperosmotic agent) promotes the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is elegantly designed and the findings are novel. Their findings on this mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, calcium homeostasis, cell volume plasticity, motility and invasiveness will have a great impact in the cancer field and potentially applicable to other fields as well. Experiments are well-planned and executed, and the data is convincing. Authors investigated TRVP4 dynamics using multiple different strategies- overcrowding, hyperosmotic stress, pharmacological and genetic means, and showed a good correlation between different phenomena.</p>

<p>The metastasis poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment. During the transition from non-invasive cells to invasive metastasis cells, cancer cells usually experience mechanical stress due to a crowded cellular environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying mechanical signaling during this transition remain largely elusive. In this work, the authors utilize an in vitro cell culture system and advanced imaging techniques to investigate how non-invasive and invasive cells respond to cell crowding, respectively.</p>
<p>The results clearly show that pre-malignant cells exhibit a more pronounced reduction in cell volume and are more prone to spreading compared to non-invasive cells. Furthermore, the study identifies that TRPV4, a calcium channel, relocates to the plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo (patient's samples). Activation and inhibition of TRPV4 channel can modulate the cell volume and cell mobility.

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Bu et al examined the dynamics of TRPV4 channel in cell overcrowding in carcinoma conditions. They investigated how cell crowding (or high cell confluence) triggers a mechano-transduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels in high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells that leads to large cell volume reduction (or cell volume plasticity) and proinvasive phenotype.</p>
<p>In vitro, this pathway is highly selective for highly malignant invasive cell lines derived from a normal breast epithelial cell line (MCF10CA) compared to the parent cell line, but not present in another triple-negative invasive breast epithelial cell line (MDA-MB-231). The authors convincingly showed that enhanced TRPV4 plasmamembrane localization correlates with highgrade DCIS cells in patient tissue samples. Specifically in invasive MCF10DCIS.com cells they showed that overcrowding or over-confluence leads to a decrease in cell volume and intracellular calcium levels. This condition also triggers the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores (nucleus and potentially endosomes), to the plasma membrane (PM). When these over-confluent cells are incubated with a TRPV4 activator, there is an acute and substantial influx of calcium, attesting the fact that there are high number of TRPV4 channels present on the PM. Long-term incubation of these over-confluent cells with the TRPV4 activator results in the internalization of the PM-localized TRPV4 channels.</p>
<p>In contrast, cells plated at lower confluence primarily have TRPV4 channels localized in the nucleus and cytosol. Long-term incubation of these cells at lower confluence with a TRPV4 inhibitor leads to the relocation of TRPV4 channels to the plasma membrane from intracellular stores and a subsequent reduction in cell volume. Similarly, incubation of these cells at low confluence with PEG 3000 (a hyperosmotic agent) promotes the trafficking of TRPV4 channels from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is elegantly designed and the findings are novel. Their findings on this mechanotransduction pathway involving TRPV4 channels, calcium homeostasis, cell volume plasticity, motility and invasiveness will have a great impact in the cancer field and potentially applicable to other fields as well. Experiments are well-planned and executed, and the data is convincing. Authors investigated TRVP4 dynamics using multiple different strategies- overcrowding, hyperosmotic stress, pharmacological and genetic means, and showed a good correlation between different phenomena.</p>
<p>All of my previous concerns have been addressed. The quality of the manuscript has improved significantly.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The metastasis poses a significant challenge in cancer treatment. During the transition from non-invasive cells to invasive metastasis cells, cancer cells usually experience mechanical stress due to a crowded cellular environment. The molecular mechanisms underlying mechanical signaling during this transition remain largely elusive. In this work, the authors utilize an in vitro cell culture system and advanced imaging techniques to investigate how non-invasive and invasive cells respond to cell crowding, respectively.</p>
<p>The results clearly show that pre-malignant cells exhibit a more pronounced reduction in cell volume and are more prone to spreading compared to non-invasive cells. Furthermore, the study identifies that TRPV4, a calcium channel, relocates to the plasma membrane both in vitro and in vivo (patient's samples). Activation and inhibition of TRPV4 channel can modulate the cell volume and cell mobility. These results unveil a novel mechanism of mechanical sensing in cancer cells, potentially offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting cancer metastasis by modulating TRPV4 activity. This is a very comprehensive study, and the data presented in the paper are clear and convincing. The study represents a very important advance in our understanding of the mechanical biology of cancer.</p>
