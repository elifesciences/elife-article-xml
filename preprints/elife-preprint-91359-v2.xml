<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Treg) have been implicated in pain modulation in various inflammatory conditions. However, whether Treg cells hamper pain at steady state and by which mechanism is still unclear. From a meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of murine Treg and conventional T cells (Tconv), we observe that the proenkephalin gene (<italic>Penk</italic>), encoding the precursor of analgesic opioid peptides, ranks among the top 25 genes most enriched in Treg cells. We then present various evidence suggesting that <italic>Penk</italic> is regulated in part by members of the TNF receptor family and the transcription factor Batf. Using mice in which the promoter activity of <italic>Penk</italic> can be tracked with a fluorescent reporter, we also show that <italic>Penk</italic> expression is mostly detected in Treg and activated Tconv in non-inflammatory conditions in the colon and skin. Functionally, Treg cells proficient or deficient for <italic>Penk</italic> suppress equally well the proliferation of effector T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and autoimmune colitis <italic>in vivo</italic>. In contrast, inducible ablation of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg leads to heat hyperalgesia in both male and female mice. Overall, our results indicate that Treg might play a key role at modulating basal somatic sensitivity in mice through the production of analgesic opioid peptides.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory T-cells (Treg), characterized by the expression of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor CD25 and the transcription factor Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hatzioannou et al., 2021</xref>), are known to be key players in immuno-regulation in both humans and mice; too few may lead to autoimmune diseases whereas too many may prevent an efficient immune response to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Over the last few years, several new functions of Treg beyond immunoregulation have been identified in tissue regeneration or local regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Meng et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shime et al., 2020</xref>) for instance. In addition, there is accumulating evidence of a cross-talk between Treg and the nervous system. This includes promotion of oligodendrocyte differentiation or inhibition of neuroinflammation facilitating CNS repair process after brain injuries and preventing cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dombrowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ito et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Lemaitre et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Treg have been involved in the regulation of pain in various models of nerve injury in rats and mice, such as in autoimmune neuritis or chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Austin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duffy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kuhn et al., 2021</xref>). Depletion of Treg has been associated with enhanced pain sensitivity whereas increased Treg number or activity limit pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lees et al., 2015</xref>). Although the current view is that Treg controls pain through their immuno-suppressive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bethea and Fischer, 2021</xref>), whether Treg might regulate pain at steady state is currently unknown. Our results uncover a previously unknown function of Treg that modulates basal somatic sensitivity through the production of analgesic peptides derived from the proenkephalin <italic>Penk</italic> gene.</p>

<title>A meta-signature of murine Treg</title>
<p>Using 11 available transcriptomes retrieved from the GEO website, we generated a Treg molecular signature at steady state in lymphoid tissues, significantly enhancing the robustness of our analysis compared to individual studies. The 25 most differentially expressed genes are depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, with the complete list provided in Table S1. As expected from the sorting strategies used to isolate Treg (detailed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> of the Materials and Methods section), <italic>Il2ra</italic> and <italic>Foxp3</italic> emerged as the most differentially expressed genes in Treg compared to Tconv. Several well-known Treg markers such as <italic>CTLA-4</italic>, <italic>Itgae</italic> (CD103), <italic>Ikzf2</italic> (Helios), <italic>Tnfrsf4</italic> (OX40) and Tnfrsf9 (4-1BB) are also present on this list. Some genes, such as <italic>Gpr83</italic> and <italic>Rgs1</italic>, have been associated with Treg functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Flynn et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Lu et al., 2007</xref>) though their exact roles remain to be fully elucidated. Interestingly, the majority of genes on this list, including <italic>Fam129a</italic>, <italic>Coro2a</italic>, <italic>Osbpl3</italic>, and <italic>Penk</italic>, have unknown functions in Treg.</p>

<title>Penk expression in Treg of lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs and tissues</title>
<p>Using the Immuno-Navigator database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Vandenbon et al., 2016</xref>), which provides a batch-corrected collection of RNA quantification across numerous studies, samples and cell types, we confirm that <italic>Penk</italic> is highly correlated to <italic>Foxp3</italic> in lymphoid organs of mice (r=0.871, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Notably, Treg samples exhibited the highest level of both <italic>Foxp3</italic> and <italic>Penk</italic>. While it has been previously reported that Th2 and Th1 cells can express <italic>Penk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Boué et al., 2012</xref>), they do so to a lesser extent than Treg (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, using publicly available datasets comparing Treg and Tconv, we observe that <italic>Penk</italic> is enriched in the thymus, where Treg are generated, and is also present in peripheral tissues such as visceral adipose fat and muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, the enrichment of <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA in Treg is intrinsic to their generation and is independent of their tissue localization at steady state.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Penk mRNA expression is regulated by TNFR signaling and the BATF transcription factor</title>
<p>To explore possible mechanisms explaining the enrichment of <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA in Treg cells, we examined the Immuno-Navigator dataset to identify genes most correlated with <italic>Penk</italic> and with each other in Treg samples. We represent these correlations as a network where each node is a gene and each edge is a correlation above a certain threshold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Penk</italic> expression is directly correlated to the expression of 5 genes: the TNF receptor family members, <italic>Tnfrsf4</italic> (OX40), <italic>Tnfrsf9</italic> (4-1BB), <italic>Tnfrsf18</italic> (GITR), the transcription factor <italic>Batf</italic> and the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family 39U member 1 <italic>Sdr39u1</italic>. As an illustration, we show the correlation between <italic>Batf</italic> and <italic>Penk</italic> expression in Treg samples (r=0.599, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="557326v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Furthermore, <italic>Penk</italic> is indirectly correlated with <italic>Tnfrsf1b</italic> (TNFR2), <italic>Il2ra</italic> (CD25) and <italic>Cish</italic>, a negative regulator of cytokine signaling. These strong correlations between several TNFR members, the transcription factor <italic>Batf,</italic> and <italic>Penk</italic> suggest a possible regulatory pathway. To explore this possibility, we reanalyzed our previously published dataset on the transcriptome of Treg stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 antibodies and TNFR agonists <italic>in vitro</italic> (Lubrano di Ricco et al., 2020). We observe that addition of TNFR2, OX40 or 4-1BB agonists increases <italic>Penk</italic> expression at 36 hours post-stimulation relative to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Batf</italic> is also increased with TNFR agonists but at an earlier time point (18 hours). Consistent with our hypothesis, a dramatic decrease in <italic>Penk</italic> expression is observed in Treg lacking <italic>Batf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hayatsu et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, analysis of the UniBind database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Puig et al., 2021</xref>) revealed that the transcription factors Batf, Irf-4, Jun and Fosl2 (AP-1 members), RelA (NF-kB signaling), and the master Treg regulator Foxp3 have all been shown by ChIP-Seq to bind to the promoter/enhancer regions of <italic>Penk</italic> in various T-cell subsets (Figure S1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Penk is predominantly expressed by Treg at steady state</title>
<p>Among other roles, <italic>Batf</italic> has been linked to tissue Treg differentiation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Delacher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hayatsu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that tissue Treg might be further enriched in <italic>Penk</italic> relative to lymphoid organs. To track <italic>Penk</italic>-expressing cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we crossed a transgenic mouse model expressing Tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible Cre recombinase under the promoter of <italic>Penk</italic> (Penk<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>) with the ROSA26<sup>TdTomato</sup> reporter mice. In these mice, any cell that expressed <italic>Penk</italic> at the time of TMX administration would become permanently tagged with the tdTomato reporter a few days later.</p>
<p>We investigated the expression of <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA in various immune cell types across multiple tissues by spectral flow cytometry, using a combination of lineage markers (Table S2) and an appropriate gating strategy (Figure S2A). To improve detection of <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA-expressing cells, we also used an anti-mCherry that cross-reacts with TdTomato (Figure S2B). In a UMAP representation of high-dimensional flow cytometry data, the projection of tdTomato expression (indicating <italic>Penk</italic> expression) aligns with the clusters of Treg and a small subset of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells in the lymph nodes (LN) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Compared to LN, <italic>Penk</italic> expression encompasses entire clusters of Treg and activated T cells in the colon, likely due to the lower proportion of naïve T cells in this tissue (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, in CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells (Tconv and Treg), <italic>Penk</italic> expression is higher in the activated CD62L<sup>low</sup> CD44<sup>high</sup> fraction compared to the naive CD62L<sup>high</sup> CD44<sup>low</sup> phenotype (Figure S3). As summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, the highest frequency of <italic>Penk</italic><sup>+</sup> cells is observed in Treg across all analyzed tissues, with the highest frequencies in the colon and the skin. <italic>Penk</italic> expression is also detected in Tconv of the colon and skin, but at lower frequencies than in Treg. All other cell types show low or undetectable <italic>Penk</italic> expression.</p>

<title>Immunosuppressive functions of Treg are unaffected by the lack of enkephalins</title>
<p>To test whether the lack of enkephalins in Treg impacts their suppressive function, we generated mice deficient in enkephalins in the hematopoietic compartment by grafting bone marrow from <italic>Penk</italic> knock-out mice in immunodeficient RAG2-KO mice. Several months after the graft, Treg were sorted from lymphoid organs and tested <italic>in vitro</italic> for their ability to suppress the proliferation of conventional T cells. No significant difference in the suppression of Tconv proliferation is observed between Treg proficient or deficient for <italic>Penk</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, the addition of Naloxone, an irreversible blocker of enkephalin receptors, neither abolishes nor enhances the suppressive function of normal Treg cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, both <italic>Penk</italic>-KO and wild-type Treg isolated from these chimeric mice equally prevented the occurrence of autoimmune colitis induced by the transfer of naive Tconv cells into RAG2-KO mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<title>Heat hyperalgesia in mice deficient for Penk in Treg</title>
<p>To our knowledge, the analgesic function of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg has never been reported. To determine if enkephalins produced by Treg affect pain at steady state, we generated mice deficient in <italic>Penk</italic> by crossing Tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> promoter (Foxp3<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>) with mice transgenic for LoxP sequences flanking exon 2 of <italic>Penk</italic> (Penk<sup>flox</sup>). In these mice (hereafter referred to as LOX), any cell expressing Foxp3 at the time of TMX administration would become deficient for exon 2 of <italic>Penk</italic> a few days later, hence lacking enkephalins.</p>
<p>Using flow cytometry, we observe that <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA expression is reduced by more than half in TMX-treated LOX mice compared to WT mice (Figure S4). Consistent with the Penk-Cre reporter mouse data, <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA expression is very low in non-Treg (CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>-</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> cells) and does not differ significantly between LOX and WT mice. Thus, TMX treatment specifically reduces <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA expression in Treg cells of LOX mice.</p>
<p>Since exon 2 is the precursor of Met-Enkephalin, an endogenous opioid that affects thermal pain sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aman et al., 2016</xref>), we evaluated the sensitivity of these mice to pain induced by heat (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). As controls, we used mice expressing the Cre recombinase and wild-type (WT) at the locus of LoxP sequences insertion. Mice were treated with TMX and evaluated for heat sensitivity at 10 different time points (four before and six after administration of TMX, 2 to 3 days apart). Under these conditions, a significant trend towards lower latency periods (indicative of heat hyperalgesia) is observed in the LOX group compared to WT mice (Figure S5A). Interestingly, the effect is not apparent until seven days after TMX administration. Before TMX administration, WT and LOX mice do not differ in their response to heat (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). However, after TMX administration, LOX mice develop hyperalgesia compared to WT mice, with a 20 percent reduction in their median latency period from day 7 onwards ((8.1 vs. 6.6 sec.), <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The effect of <italic>Penk</italic> deletion in Treg on heat hyperalgesia is sex-independent, as it is observed in both females and males (Figure S5B-C). Moreover, this thermal hyperalgesia in LOX mice is reproduced with a different test in an independent laboratory where WT and LOX mice were sent for further behavioral tests (Figure S5D). Indeed, tests for innocuous (von Frey, cotton swab tests) and noxious (pin prick test) mechanical sensitivity, as well as light touch and proprioception (sticky tape test), fail to show any significant effect of Treg-specific <italic>Penk</italic> deficiency (Figure S5E-H). Importantly, TMX administration does not alter the proportions of skin Treg in LOX compared to WT mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>), indicating that hyperalgesia does not result from an altered distribution of Treg.</p>

<p>Given this result, we next investigated whether Treg could be localized in contact with nociceptive neurons in the skin. Interestingly, some skin Tregs marked by the GFP reporter molecule in our WT and LOX mice can be observed in close contact with free nerve endings labeled with a Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)-specific mAb in the pad skin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Because sensory neurons expressing CGRP are essential for noxious thermal heat, but not mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>), this result suggests that Treg producing enkephalins could act locally on nociception.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The proenkephalin gene <italic>Penk</italic> encodes the precursor of opioid peptides with analgesic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">McLaughlin, 2013</xref>). Enriched expression of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg has been previously reported in several specific contexts, including TCR-transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zelenika et al., 2002</xref>), UVB-exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shime et al., 2020</xref>) or in the brains of mice recovering from stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Ito et al., 2019</xref>) but its role has never been directly addressed. We first explore the possible molecular mechanisms that may explain the preferential expression of <italic>Penk</italic> observed in tissue Treg. Using data mining and gene correlation analysis, we observed that TNFR and Batf might be involved in <italic>Penk</italic> regulation. Batf is known to regulate several genes through partnering with AP-1 and Irf-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Murphy et al., 2013</xref>), and we noted that several ChIP-Seq studies have reported the binding of these transcription factors in regulatory regions of <italic>Penk</italic>. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that TNFR signaling may regulate <italic>Penk</italic> expression in murine T cells through cooperation between Batf, AP-1 and/or Irf-4. Supporting this hypothesis, the AP-1 members Fos and Jun are crucial in <italic>Penk</italic> regulation in the murine hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Sonnenberg et al., 1989</xref>). Additionally, analysis of Penk-Cre reporter mice led us to conclude that <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA is predominantly found in tissue Treg, further supporting the hypothesis that Batf might be a chief regulator of <italic>Penk</italic>. Although <italic>Penk</italic> might be preferentially expressed by activated T cells at steady state (Treg and Tconv), its distribution may be broader in an inflammatory context. Consistent with this, it has been reported that IL-4-treated macrophages are able to reduce neuropathic pain through their ability to produce opioid peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Celik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Pannell et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>A prior study attributed a function to UVB-exposed Treg-derived <italic>Penk</italic> in promoting the growth of epidermal keratinocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and facilitating wound-healing <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shime et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, heightened heat sensitivity in the absence of Treg-derived <italic>Penk</italic> may result from altered keratinocyte homeostasis <italic>in vivo.</italic> Nevertheless, the impact of Treg-derived <italic>Penk</italic> on keratinocyte homeostasis <italic>in vivo</italic> under normal conditions has yet to be conclusively demonstrated.</p>
<p><italic>Penk</italic> expression by CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells has been linked to analgesia in murine models of visceral pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Basso et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boué et al., 2014</xref>). However, the specific involvement of Treg in this process has not been investigated. Further research is required to determine the contribution of Treg-derived enkephalins in models of intestinal inflammatory pain. In neuroinflammatory settings, such as sciatic nerve constriction, the pain modulation by Treg could be contingent upon their immuno-suppressive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davoli-Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duffy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Ledeboer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Shen et al., 2013</xref>), potentially mediated through the secretion of IL-10 or IL-35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davoli-Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Duffy et al., 2019</xref>). Contrary to this notion, our experiments rule out the possibility that hyperalgesia stemmed from a defect in the immuno-suppressive function of Treg. Instead, they strongly indicate a direct implication of enkephalins produced by Treg in nociception, revealing a novel non-immune intrinsic role of Treg in the endogenous regulation of basal somatic sensitivity.</p>

For the <italic>Penk</italic> mapping experiments, Penk<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> were bred with ROSA<sup>tdtomato</sup>. All mice were confirmed to be homozygous for the inducible Cre and at least heterozygous for tdTomato by touchdown PCR (primers sequences available on request). To specifically knock-out the <italic>Penk</italic> gene in Tregs, Foxp3<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup> were crossed with Penk<sup>flox</sup> leading to double heterozygous mice (F1) that were crossed together resulting in double homozygous F2 littermates. All mice used in this study were of F3 generation. Mice were genotyped by touchdown PCR (primers sequences available on request). Tamoxifen (ThermoFisher, Les Ulis, France) was dissolved in peanut oil at the concentration of 40 mg/ml under 37°C agitation and delivered by 200µL oral gavage. All mice were administered tamoxifen only once. Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions and were used for experiments at 8 weeks or older. Mice were exposed to a 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle.

<title>Preparation of cell suspensions</title>
<p>Organs were harvested on ice in PBS 3% fetal calf serum (FCS). Inguinal, brachial and mesenteric LNs and spleens were directly mashed through a 70µm filter and suspended in PBS 3% FCS. Lungs, colons, livers, VAT and skin were dissected, minced then incubated in appropriate digestion buffers (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France) at 37°C for various duration according to manufacturer protocols. Cell suspensions were then passed through a 70µm cell strainer and suspended in PBS 3% FCS. To eliminate dead cells and debris, liver cell suspensions were isolated on a 70:30 Percoll gradient. Rings were collected, washed, and cell pellets were suspended in PBS 3% FCS. ACK Lysing Buffer was used to eliminate red blood cells in the lungs, livers and spleens (lysis performed for 1 min at RT, followed by two washes with PBS), prior to staining for flow cytometry.</p>

<title>Flow-FISH staining</title>
<p>Frozen splenocytes were thawed and washed once in complete RPMI (GIBCO) supplemented with 10% vol/vol FCS (GIBCO). Flow-FISH staining was performed using the PrimeFlow RNA Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and the subsequent anti-mouse Penk probes set (Invitrogen #PF-204) according to manufacturer’s protocol. For flow cytometry staining, after Fc receptor saturation (anti-mouse CD16/32, clone 93, 1:50, Biolegend) and dead cells detection (Fixable Viability Dye, 1:1000, Invitrogen), cells were surface labelled for 30min on ice with the following antibodies: CD8a-BV421 (Clone 53-6.7, 1:200, BD Biosciences), CD44-BV605 (Clone IM7, 1:200, BD Biosciences), CD3e-BV711 (Clone 145-2C11, 1:50, Biolegend), CD4-PE-CF594 (Clone RM4-5, 1:800, BD Biosciences), CD62L-PE-Cy7 (Clone MEL-14, 1:300, BD Biosciences). Intracellular staining with Foxp3-PE antibody (Clone NRRF-30, 1:100, eBioscience) was performed after fixation and permeabilization with the reagents provided in the kit. A second fixation was performed with the reagents provided in the kit before proceeding to the FISH staining. For FISH staining, cells were incubated with the anti-mouse Penk probes set (1:20) for 2h at 40°C. After washes, cells were kept overnight at 4°C in wash buffer containing RNase inhibitors. The day after, amplification steps were performed to increase the signal: cells were first incubated with pre-amplification mix during 1.5h at 40°C, washed and then incubated with amplification mix for an additional 1.5h at 40°C. Cells were then incubated with the label probes (Alexa Fluor 647, 1:100) for 1h at 40°C. Data were acquired on a 4-lasers LSR-Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and fcs files were analyzed with FlowJo as above.</p>

<p>Cells from the spleen and the lymph nodes of Foxp3-GFP mice were isolated and enriched for T-cells with LS column (Miltenyi) using anti-CD19-biotin, aCD11b-biotin and anti-Ter119-biotin. Afterward, enriched T-cells were stained with anti-CD4 PE and anti-CD62L (AF700) and sorted as CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> GFP+ (Treg) or GFP-(Tconv) fractions on a FACS Aria III (BD, France). Then, Tconv and Treg were labeled with CellTrace Violet and CFSE (Thermofisher) respectively before the culture. For T-cell activation, either CD3/CD28 DynaBeads (Thermofisher) or soluble anti-CD3 (1µg/mL) + splenocytes from Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used. When specified, Naloxone hydrochloride (Tocris) was added to the media at the indicated concentration at the beginning of the culture. At the end of the culture, cells were stained with eF780 Fixable Viability Dye before acquisition on LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). To induce colitis, C57Bl/6 Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice were intraperitoneally injected with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup>GFP<sup>-</sup> naive T cells (4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per mouse) isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of wild-type C57Bl/6 Foxp3-GFP mice (kind gift of Dr B.

<title>Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with a mix of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 20 mg/kg xylazine, decapitated with scissors and the glabrous skin of the hindpaw harvested. The skin was then fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for 2h at room temperature (RT). Fixed tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose containing 0.05% sodium azide diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4°C for 48h, and cut with a cryostat (Microm HM550) into 25 µm sections placed directly onto gelatine coated slides. For fluorescent immunostaining, slides were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS + 0.2% triton-X (PBS-T) for 1 hour at room temperature (RT), then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-T overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T, for 2 hours at RT. Slices were finally washed in PBS and cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G containing DAPI (Invitrogen 00-4959-52). The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence staining at the following dilutions: anti-GFP raised in rabbit (1:1000; Chromotek PABG-1), anti-CGRP raised in goat (1:500; Bio-Rad 1720-9007). We also used the following secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit conjugated with Cy3 raised in donkey (Jackson, 711-165-152), anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa-488 raised in donkey (Jackson, 711-545-152), anti-goat conjugated with Cy5 raised in donkey (Jackson, 705-175-147). Images were obtained by epifluorescent microscopy with a motorized fluorescence microscope Axio Imager M2 equipped with a camera Axiocam 705 (Zeiss). Skin slices were imaged using a Colibri 7 light source, 10x/0.30 and 63x/1.25 objectives and the following filters from Zeiss: 02 DAPI, 38 HE eGFP, 43 HE DsRed and 50 Cy5 BP640/30.

<title>Heat sensitivity</title>
<p>For the hot plate test, the BIO-CHP apparatus was used (BIOSEB, France). Mice were placed on a metal plate maintained at 55°C. The response latency, which is the time taken to observe a nocifensive behavior such as jumping, licking or flicking of the hind paws, was recorded. The mice were then immediately removed from the plate upon the recording of a reaction, or within 25s if no response was observed to prevent tissue damage. The test was repeated every two days for a total of four measures before the administration of tamoxifen and four measures starting from D3 post-tamoxifen. Mice remained in their home cage except when being tested on the hot plate. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the mice until the end of the experiment. Noxious heat sensitivity was independently assessed in the Neurodol laboratory with an Hargreaves test. Animals were placed in an acrylic chamber on a heated (30°C) glass plate and acclimated to the test chamber for 30 min during 2 days and then for 30 minutes on the 3rd day prior to testing. Using a plantar analgesia meter (IITC, 40% intensity), a radiant heat source of constant intensity was focused on the plantar surface of the hind paw and the latency of paw withdrawal measured. The heat source was stopped upon paw withdrawal with a cutoff of 20 s to avoid injury. Heat sensitivity test was repeated 3 times on each hind paw with a 5-min interval between tests and the results for each paw were averaged together.</p>

<title>Static mechanical sensitivity</title>
<p>Static mechanical sensitivity was assessed with a von Frey test. Briefly, mice were habituated to transparent Plexiglas chambers on an elevated wire mesh table for at least 30 minutes for two days, and prior to testing. Assessments were performed using a set of calibrated von Frey monofilaments using the Up-Down method, starting with the 0.4 g filament. Each filament was gently applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw for 3 s or until a response such as a sharp withdrawal, shaking or licking of the limb was observed. Rearing or normal ambulation during filament application were not counted. Filaments were applied at five-minute intervals until the threshold was determined. The 50% paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was determined for each mouse on both hind paws.</p>

<title>Dynamic mechanical sensitivity</title>
<p>Dynamic mechanical sensitivity was assessed with the Cotton swab test. Briefly, animals were habituated to transparent Plexiglas chambers on an elevated wire mesh table as described above. The head of a cotton swab was teased and puffed out with forceps until it reached approximately three times its original size. Tests were performed by lightly moving the cotton swab across the surface of the hind paw from heel to toe. If the animal reacted (lifting, shaking, licking of the paw) a positive response was recorded. A negative response was recorded if the animal showed no such behavior. The application was repeated 6 times with a 5-minute interval between applications, and a percentage of positive responses was determined. Paw withdrawal frequency (PWF) was determined for both hind paws of each mouse.</p>

<title>Noxious mechanical sensitivity</title>
<p>Noxious mechanical sensitivity was assessed with the pinprick test. Animals were acclimated to transparent Plexiglas chambers placed on a wire mesh table as described above. A small insect pin (tip diameter = 0.03 mm) was applied 10 times with a 5-minute interval between applications on the plantar side of each hind paw. Care was taken to apply a minimal pressure without penetrating the skin. If the animal showed aversive behavior (lifting, shaking, licking of the paw) a positive response was recorded. A negative response was recorded if the animal showed none of these reactions within 1 seconds of application and a percentage of positive responses were determined. Paw withdrawal frequency (PWF) was calculated by averaging the positive responses for each mouse for each hind paws.</p>

<title>Proprioception test</title>
<p>Animals were placed in an empty plastic cage and allowed to acclimate for 15-20 minutes. A 8mm diameter adhesive paper circle was then applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw covering the footpads, and the animals were immediately placed back in the chamber. The animals were observed until they demonstrated a behavioral response to the adhesive tape, and the latency in seconds to respond was recorded. Inspection of the paw, shaking of the paw or attempting to remove the tape were all considered valid responses. Each animal was habituated 1 time the day prior testing, and then tested 3 times with a 5-minute interval between tests, and the three values averaged for each animal for each hind paws.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on a new role of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in sensory perception, which may have an impact on our understanding of somatosensory perception. The authors identified a previously unappreciated action of enkephalins released by immune cells in the resolution of pain and several upstream signals that can regulate the expression of the proenkephalin gene PENK in Foxp3+ Tregs. The generation of transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in Foxp3+ cells and PENK fate-mapping is novel and generates <bold>compelling</bold> data; they also show a comprehensive analysis of Tregs in control and transgenic mice, longitudinal data on heat sensitivity and co-localization of PENK+ Tregs with thermal sensory neurons in the skin further supporting their hypothesis. The study would be of interest to the biologists working in the field of neuroimmunology and inflammation.</p>

<p>The study addresses the role of enkephalins, which are specifically expressed by regulatory T cells (Treg), in sensory perception in mice. The authors used a combination of transcriptomic databases available online to characterize the molecular signature of Treg. The proenkephalin gene Penk is among the most enriched transcripts, suggesting that Treg plays an analgesic role through the release of endogenous opioids. In addition, in silico analysis suggests that Penk is regulated by the TNFR superfamily; this being experimentally confirmed. Using flow cytometry analysis, the authors then show that Penk is mostly expressed in Treg of the skin and colon, compared to other immune cells. Finally, genetic conditional excision of Penk, selectively in Treg, results in heat hypersensitivity, as assessed by behavior analysis.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors explore mechanisms through which T-regs attenuate acute pain using a heat sensitivity paradigm. Analysis of available transcriptomic data revealed expression on the proenkephalin (Penk) gene in T-regs. The authors explore the contribution of T-reg Penk in the resolution of heat sensitivity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Investigating the potential role of T-reg Penk in the resolution of acute pain is a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The overall experimental design is superficial and lacks sufficient rigor to draw any meaningful conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We hope that the reviewer will reconsider this severe criticism after examining the updated manuscript and results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>(1) The were no TAM controls. What is the evidence that TAM does not alter heat-sensitive receptors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>the impact of TMX on heat perception is not the object of this study. Nevertheless, it appears that heat-sensitivity in controls WT (blue dots) is slightly diminished after TMX administration (Figure 5A), suggesting that heat-sensitive receptors are moderately altered by TMX per se. This reduction is much more pronounced for LOX mice. Thus, although it is possible that TMX play a marginal role on heat sensitivity by itself, the results show a much more pronounced effect of TMX in LOX than in WT, in favor of a role for Penk Treg in heat sensitivity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) There are no controls demonstrating that recombination actually occurred. How do the authors know a single dose of TAM is sufficient?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>these results are now presented in figure S4. A 70% reduction in Penk mRNA is observed in Treg after a single administration of TMX.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Why was only heat sensitivity assessed? The behavioral tests are inadequate to derive any meaningful conclusions. Further, why wasn't the behavioral data plotted longitudinally</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The longitudinal data are presented in figure S5A. New behavioral tests have been performed and the results are now shown in figure S5E-H. Importantly, heat sensitivity was observed in two independent laboratory with two different tests.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study addresses the role of enkephalins, which are specifically expressed by regulatory T cells (Treg), in sensory perception in mice. The authors used a combination of transcriptomic databases available online to characterize the molecular signature of Treg. The proenkephalin gene Penk is among the most enriched transcripts, suggesting that Treg plays an analgesic role through the release of endogenous opioids. In addition, in silico analysis suggests that Penk is regulated by the TNFR superfamily; this being experimentally confirmed. Using flow cytometry analysis, the authors then show that Penk is mostly expressed in Treg of the skin and colon, compared to other immune cells. Finally, genetic conditional excision of Penk, selectively in Treg, results in heat hypersensitivity, as assessed by behavior analysis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and reveals a previously unappreciated role of enkephalins, as released by immune cells, in sensory perception. The rationale in this manuscript is easy to follow, and conclusions are well supported by data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The sensory deficit of Penk cKO appears to be quite limited compared to control littermates.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Aubert et al investigated the role of PENK in regulatory T cells. Through the mining of publicly available transcriptome data, the authors confirmed that PENK expression is selectively enriched in regulatory but not conventional T cells. Further data mining suggested that OX40, 4-1BB as well as BATF, can regulate PENK expression in Tregs. The authors generated fate-mapping mice to confirm selective PENK expression in Tregs and activated effector T cells in the colon and spleen. Interestingly, transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in Tregs resulted in hypersensitivity to heat, which the authors attributed to heat hyperalgesia.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The generation of transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in foxp3 and PENK fate-mapping is novel and can potentially yield significant findings. The identification of upstream signals that regulate PENK is interesting but unlikely to be the main reason why PENK is predominantly expressed in Tregs as both BATF and TNFR are expressed in effector T cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There is a lack of direct evidence and detailed analysis of Tregs in the control and transgenic mice to support the authors' hypothesis. PENK was previously reported to be expressed in skin Tregs and play a significant role in regulating skin homeostasis: this should be considered as an alternative mechanism that may explain the changed sensitivity to heat observed in the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide a detailed analysis of Treg with or without Penk, from their immunosuppressive functions to their colocalization with sensory neurons in the skin, supporting their function as natural analgesics. The alternate hypothesis relative to skin homeostasis is now clearly presented and discussed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Most of my comments should be addressable in a revised manuscript but will require additional analysis.</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>- According to flow cytometry analysis, Penk is expressed mostly in Treg of the skin and colon. What may account for such restricted expression? Where could Treg-released enkephalins act?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now rephrased the paper to emphasize the known role of Batf in tissue Treg differentiation. We believe the Batf dependency of Penk expression is the reason why tissue Treg are more enriched in Penk than Treg from lymphoid organs. This is now clearly discussed.</p>
<p>We also provide a new figure (Figure S1) that shows that binding of Batf and co factors AP1 and IRF4 were reported to bind to Penk regulatory regions. Altogether, the role of Batf in tissue Treg differentiation would explain why tissue Treg such as colon and skin are particularly enriched in Penk. This is now clearly stated in the revised manuscript.</p>
<p>As to know where Treg-released enkephalins act, we performed immunostainings in the skin and observed that Treg could colocalize with sensory neurons (shown in a new figure 5, panel D). This observation raise the hypothesis that  Treg-released enkephalins could act on sensory neurons locally.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Which mechanism can underlie heat hypersensitivity in Penk cKO mice? Which sensory neurons are involved? Are other sensory modalities affected, such as mechanical sensitivity?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above, we show that Treg can be in close contact with thermal sensors neurons producing CGRP. These data are shown in figure 5D. We have also tested may other nociceptive stimulus (innocuous and noxious) and did not detect significant differences. These data are presented as a supplementary figure S5. Whether enkephalins produced by Treg can change the stimulation threshold of various nervous fibers is currently performed by electrophysiology.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- No control is provided to ensure that Penk is selectively excised in Treg cells in cKO mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed additional experiments with fluorescent probes to document Penk mRNA expression in cKO mice. The results on the specific expression of Penk mRNA in various subsets post-TMX are shown in a supplementary figure S4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- The authors acknowledge that Penk from Treg was previously studied in an animal model of inflammatory pain. However, which role these endogenous opioids play is unclear, especially since authors discovered that enkephalins are likely continuously released at steady states. This is not enough discussed in the narrative, which surprisingly does not separate the results from the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The results and discussion are now separated in two sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minors:</p>
<p>- Replace &quot;Fox3 1&quot; with &quot;Fox31&quot; (line 31), &quot;functions 15&quot; with &quot;functions15&quot; (line 43), &quot;BATF 19&quot; with &quot;BATF19&quot; (line 85).</p>
<p>- Text mentions Figure S4 (line 125), which is most likely S3.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Given the most significant finding of this paper is based on the heat-induced pain model, there is surprisingly little analysis of Tregs in this context. The authors analyzed spleen and colon Tregs at steady state, it is unclear whether any of these Tregs are involved in pain sensitivity directly. Skin Tregs or other relevant Tregs to this model should be analyzed in control and Lox mice. This is particularly relevant as PENK expression was previously reported in skin Tregs and plays a significant role in skin homeostasis (Yamazaki et al 2020 PNAS). Does PENK conditional deletion alter Treg frequencies, numbers, and immune suppressive function? Not even spleen or colon Treg were analyzed comparing control and lox mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide evidences showing unaltered immunosuppressive functions of Treg in the absence of Penk (Figure 4), and more importantly unaffected proportions of skin Treg in mice lacking Penk in Treg, at the very site of heat stimulation (Figure 5B-C). We also observed unaffected representation of Treg in the spleen and lymph nodes, but we do not feel that these data are necessary to interpret the results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Given the role of PENK in skin Tregs, could the observed effect in Figure 4 be due to altered skin homeostasis rather than sensitivity to pain?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is referring to a paper where Penk in skin Treg play a role on UV-damaged keratinocytes in vivo (Shime et al., 2020, PNAS). To our knowledge, a role for Penk produced by skin Treg on keratinocytes homeostasis at the steady state is currently unknown. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is now clearly stated and discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors stated that only after 7 days post tamoxifen treatment was heat hyperalgesia observed: deletion of PENK in Treg but not Tconv should be confirmed: is deletion only complete after 7 days or is the effect observed due to indirect effects of altered &quot;normal&quot; Treg function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have performed a kinetics to document Penk deletion at D3, D7 and 30 post-TMX. Results show a specific deletion of Penk in Treg at all time points so we combined all the time points for the representation of the results (Figure S4). As for the indirect effects of “altered” normal function, we now provide the reader with a new figure (Figure 4), showing that Penk deficient Treg are not impaired in their suppressive function in vitro and in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Actual protein/peptide production of enkephalins by Tregs should be confirmed. It is also unclear which peptide(s) can be secreted and presumably responsible for the changes in heat sensitivity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very interesting question that we addressed with a MENK ELISA but without success at reproducing the results. An ongoing project will use mass spectrometry to fully characterize the peptides produced by Treg and activated Tconv.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The analysis of PENK regulation by Tregs is interesting despite them being entirely based on data mining. BATF is a pioneering factor expressed by all activated effector T cells. While the connection between BATF and PENK may explain why the authors observed PENK expression chiefly in activated effectors and Tregs, BATF cannot be the reason why PENK is &quot;predominantly&quot; expressed by Tregs. Similarly, 4-1BB and OX40 can be induced on effector T cells. Is PENK under the control of Foxp3? There are lots of publically available datasets on Foxp3/IL-2 dependent Treg signatures through which this can be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We now provide a supplementary figure (Figure S1), showing a compilation of ChIP Seq studies for various transcription factors in various T cell subsets. We provide the reader with a list of all the TF that have been reported to bind in the regulatory regions of Penk. In agreement with our hypothesis, BATF, FOXP3, IRF4 and several others are present in that list. Further work is needed to decipher the exact contribution of each of those TF to the regulation of Penk in Treg vs activated Tconv that is beyond the scope of this report.</p>
