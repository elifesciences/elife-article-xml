<title>Summary</title>
<p>Fungi display a wide range of lifestyles and hosts. We still know little about the impact of lifestyles, including pathogenicity, on their genome architecture. Here, we combined and annotated 552 fungal genomes from the class Sordariomycetes and examined the association between 12 genomic features and two lifestyle traits: pathogenicity and insect association. We found that pathogens on average tend to have a larger number of protein-coding genes, including effectors, and tRNA genes. In addition, the non-repetitive size of their genomes is larger than that of non-pathogenic species. However, this pattern is not consistent across all groups. Insect endoparasites and symbionts have smaller genome sizes and genes with longer exons; moreover, insect-vectored pathogens possess fewer genes compared to those not transmitted by insects. Our study shows that genes are the main contributors to genome size variation in Sordariomycetes and that seemingly similar pathogens can exhibit distinct genome architectures, depending on their host and vector interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The growing emergence of severe infectious diseases in humans, agriculture, and wildlife caused by fungi, prompts strengthened efforts to uncover the molecular mechanisms of pathogenic traits. This requires understanding the forces shaping the evolution of fungal pathogen genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fisher et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Rokas 2022</xref>). Fungal genome sizes span from 3 Mb in microsporidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biderre et al. 1997</xref>) up to 892 Mb reported in a rust fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Mohanta and Bae 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Tavares et al. 2014</xref>), and fungal pathogens score both among the smallest and the largest of them. Various features of the genome have been implicated in the evolution of the pathogenic lifestyle. These include the evolution of small proteins called effectors that interact with the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stergiopoulos and de Wit 2009</xref>). Other features include specialized gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Raffa and Keller 2019</xref>), horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sahu et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">McDonald et al. 2019</xref>), copy number variation of pathogenicity-relevant genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bergin et al. 2022</xref>), expansion of transposable elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Oggenfuss and Croll 2023</xref>), and compartmentalization of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raffaele and Kamoun 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wacker et al. 2023</xref>). Yet, we still have limited knowledge of which genomic features are specific to pathogenic lifestyle, and if they are equally important across phylogenetically distinct groups of pathogens.</p>
<p>Fungal pathogen genomes, and in particular fungal plant pathogen genomes have been often linked to large sizes with expansions of TEs, and a unique presence of a compartmentalized genome with fast and slow evolving regions or chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raffaele and Kamoun 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Möller and Stukenbrock 2017</xref>). Such accessory genomic compartments were shown to facilitate the fast evolution of effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Dong, Raffaele, and Kamoun 2015</xref>). Also, TE expansions were shown to play a role in the evolution of new virulence genes in emerging pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bao et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wacker et al. 2023</xref>). However, even though such architecture can facilitate pathogen evolution, it is currently recognized more as a side effect of a species evolutionary history rather than a pathogenicity related trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Torres et al. 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, effectors are considered important genes for pathogen evolution, along with the diversification of other gene families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Muszewska et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Baroncelli et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sipos et al. 2017</xref>). As the number of genes is strongly correlated with fungal genome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Stajich 2017</xref>), such expansions could be a major contributor to fungal genome size. Importantly, not all fungal pathogens carry large genomes. At the end of the spectrum are the endoparasites Microsporidia, which have among the smallest known fungal genomes, showing signatures of strong genome contractions, including a reduced gene repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Katinka et al. 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The size of genomes is dictated by the balance of mutation, selection and genetic drift. Neutral evolution hypotheses generate predictions regarding the size of the genomes, the size of their deleterious non-coding parts, the number of genes, and the mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lynch and Conery 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Petrov 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lynch 2007</xref>). In eukaryotes, the efficiency of purifying selection depends on the size of the species’ effective population size (Ne) and will thus determine the rate of loss of slightly deleterious non-coding DNA, including mobile genetic elements or introns, leading to larger genomes with more repetitive content in species with smaller Ne. In bacteria, bias towards deletion rates will lead to shortening of the genome in small Ne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mira, Ochman, and Moran 2001</xref>). In ascomycetes, the evolution of genome size on a broad phylogenetic scale supports the neutral hypothesis of genome evolution, but in different ways. In species with larger genomes, indicators of drift such as increased intron frequency and decreased gene density are associated with genome expansions, but in species with small and medium-sized genomes, those indicators are associated with genome size reductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kelkar and Ochman 2012</xref>). Given the strong impact of both demographic history (Ne) and host-specific adaptations of pathogens on their genomes, we reasoned that further examination of genomic sequences in groups of species with various lifestyles can generate predictions regarding the architecture of pathogenic genomes.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigate how fungal genome size and complexity associates with pathogenic lifestyle in the diverse ascomycete class of Sordariomycetes fungi. Sordariomycetes have rich genomic resources and include species with a wide range of lifestyles, including plant pathogens and saprophytes, and several groups of insect pathogens and mutualists. We studied 552 genomes, including 14 newly sequenced and assembled genomes to answer the following questions: 1) which genomic features predict genome size, 2) which genomic traits are associated with pathogenic and insect-associated species, 3) how gene evolution differs across pathogens.</p>

<title>Genome assemblies and phylogeny of Sordariomycetes</title>
<p>We analyzed 552 genomes from the class Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota) together comprising fungi mostly represented by plant pathogens, saprotrophs, and entomopathogens (Supplementary Table 1). Most genomes were downloaded from NCBI or other sources (Supplementary Table 1) and complemented with 14 genomes sequenced and assembled in this study (Supplementary Table 2). Genome size ranged from 20.7 Mbp in <italic>Ceratocystiopsis brevicomis</italic> (CBS 137839) to 110.9 Mbp in <italic>Ophiocordyceps sinensis</italic> (IOZ07) and the number of <italic>ab initio</italic> gene models ranged from 6,280 in <italic>Ambrosiella xylebori</italic> (CBS 110.61) to 17,878 in <italic>Fusarium langsethiae</italic> (Fe2391). A maximum likelihood tree was generated from 1000 concatenated single-copy conserved proteins and had a 100% bootstrap support for all major nodes except for one (support of 82% for the split between two subclades of Ophiostomatales, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<title>Genome size predictors</title>
<p>We examined the correlation between genome size (bp) and 11 genomic traits, including the number of genes, the repeats proportion in genome assembly, the size of the assembly excluding repeat content (bp), GC content, the mean number of introns per gene, mean intron length (bp), mean exon length (bp), the fraction of genes with introns, mean intergenic length (bp) and the number of tRNA and pseudo tRNA genes.</p>
<p>Most genomic features were correlated with genome size and with each other, with the strongest positive correlation observed between the size of the assembly excluding repeats and the number of genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Exon length, number of genes with introns and GC content were negatively correlated with genome size. We extracted three major principal components from all 11 traits, which together explained 66% of variance among species. The first PC was mostly driven by coding traits (exon length, number of introns, genome without repeats, genes), whereas the second PC was mostly driven by non-coding parts of the genome (repeats, intergenic length, GC and intron length, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). The third PC was mainly driven by the proportion of genes with introns, tRNAs and number of introns. Modeling genome size using these 3 PCs showed that all axes were important predictors of genome size, with PC1 being the strongest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). PC1 also showed negative interaction with PC2 and PC3. This suggests that fungi with large genomes have in general either an excess of non-coding elements or an excess of coding elements but rarely both of them at the same time.</p>
<p>We calculated genome-wide ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) as a proxy for an effective population size (Ne) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kelkar and Ochman 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lefébure et al. 2017</xref>) to determine its association with the non-coding portion of the genome. We found no correlation between dN/dS and non-coding traits such as repeat content, intergenic length, intron length or number of introns (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), therefore we found no confirmation of accumulation of slightly deleterious DNA in species that have high dN/dS indicative of small Ne. As the amount of non-coding elements is generally minimal in our dataset compared to other eukaryotes, such correlation may be difficult to spot. The rate of gene loss was negatively correlated with genome size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), but was not correlated with dN/dS (Spearman’s Rho=-0.05, P-value=0.44). This suggests that variations in deletion rates may influence genome size dynamics in this group of fungi.</p>

<title>Genomic traits associated with pathogenicity</title>
<p>We found that pathogens were not associated with larger genomes, but rather a greater total number of genes, effectors, tRNAs, and fewer non-coding regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, these patterns were not consistent across the tree (Supplementary Table 2). To explore genomic traits associated with pathogenicity, we applied three methods that account for phylogenetic non-independence: an MCMC evolutionary model of binary traits (BayesTraits), phylogenetic logistic regression (Phyloglm), and random forest analysis. We assessed the same 11 genomic traits as before, adding genome size and the number of effectors. All three methods consistently pointed to the number of effectors and tRNA genes as predictors of pathogenicity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). There was no support for a positive association between repeats and pathogenicity, and only one method indicated that pathogens tend to have larger genome sizes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The total number of genes, genome size without repeats, and the number of pseudo tRNAs were also positively associated with pathogenicity in at least two methods.</p>

<p>Our dataset has more pathogenic species than non-pathogenic ones (1.8:1), and this is true in particular for species with medium and large genomes (&gt;50 Mb, 4.5:1). This could represent a genuine pattern or a bias due to the focus on sequencing pathogenic species with larger genomes. Even though we didn’t find an association between pathogenicity and genome size, we accounted for potential sampling bias to test the robustness of our findings. Species were grouped by genome size, and we subsampled equal numbers of pathogenic and non-pathogenic species from each group, repeating the process 10 times. These 10 subsets were analyzed using the same methods in parallel, and nearly all confirmed that the number of effectors and tRNA genes were the strongest predictors of pathogenicity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Genome size analyses yielded mixed results. Out of the 10 random subsets, BayesTraits identified co-evolution of genome size with pathogenicity but with no clear directional trend. In contrast, Phyloglm coefficient estimates for genome size varied, showing either positive or negative associations depending on the subset. The analysis also revealed some evidence of a negative association between pathogenicity and non-coding elements such as repeats, intron length, number of introns, and intergenic regions. This could explain the absence of consistent positive correlation between pathogenicity and genome size, as the predicted increase in gene number in pathogens is likely offset by a reduction in non-coding elements.</p>
<p>We also examined whether associations with pathogenicity are consistent across the entire phylogenetic tree or vary between branches. The model with varying rates of evolution provided a significantly better fit for all genomic traits (Supplementary Table 2).</p>

<title>Genomic traits of insect-associated (IA) species</title>
<p>Our analyses revealed that insect-associated (IA) species tend to have smaller genomes and genes with longer exons on average (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). All three methods consistently showed a positive association between exon length and IA species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, there was support for a negative association between IA species and genome size, genome size excluding repeats, and gene number. Similar to pathogenicity, the evolution of IA traits varied across the phylogenetic tree, as indicated by the covarion models (Supplementary Table 3).</p>

<p>To ensure the association with exon length was not an artifact driven by a specific group of genes or species, we compared exon length and number in one-to-one orthologs between IA and non-IA species from two phylogenetic groups. In both groups, IA species showed longer and fewer exons compared to non-IA species, and no difference was observed in intron length (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). We also tested whether genes with longer exons were more likely to be retained in IA species compared to non-IA species. While genes present in most species within a clade (i.e. genes less likely to be deleted) were enriched for longer exons, this pattern was observed in both IA and non-IA species (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

<title>Pathogens gene evolution depends on lifestyle</title>
<p>Given that our results indicated genome size and gene content vary depending on fungal lifestyle, we investigated how IA pathogens evolve compared to non-IA ones. Using phylogenetic logistic regression, we modeled the IA trait, incorporating key genomic traits one at a time as predictors and including pathogenicity as an interaction term. This analysis was performed separately in three distinct fungal clades (H, M and a O/Ma/D/S comprising four subclades, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Models incorporating genome size and exon length could only be fitted for clade H, revealing a negative association between IA species and genome size, and a positive association with exon length in both pathogens and non-pathogens (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In clades O/Ma/D/S and M, genes showed a stronger negative association with IA in pathogens compared to non-pathogens. In clade H, tRNAs exhibited a stronger negative association with IA in pathogens than in non-pathogens. Additionally, effectors were negatively associated with IA in non-pathogens across all three clades, but not in pathogens.</p>

<p>Host-pathogen interactions often result in rapid gene turnover due to ongoing adaptation to host defense mechanisms, leading to gene family expansions and contractions (Gómez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Luciano et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pendleton et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hartmann and Croll 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stalder et al. 2023</xref>). To explore this, we analyzed a subset of ∼500 gene families to test whether the rate of gene evolution (λ, the rate of gene loss and duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendes et al. 2020</xref>)) differs across species with different lifestyles. Species were categorized into four groups based on their pathogenicity and IA status, and we fitted models with one, two, or four rate parameters. The model with four distinct rates was significantly better than the simpler models (likelihood ratio tests (LRT) 4 vs. 1 rates: χ<sup>2</sup>=7.8, P-value=0; LRT 4 vs. 2 rates: χ<sup>2</sup>=6, P-value=0.002). Gene evolutionary rates were higher in non-IA species and lower in IA species, regardless of pathogenicity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Non-IA pathogens showed the highest evolutionary rates, while IA pathogens exhibited the lowest.</p>
<p>These results indicate that IA species are associated with slower gene evolutionary rates overall, and some IA clades also with fewer genes, particularly in pathogenic species. However, some genes important for pathogens, such as effectors, are not depleted to the same extent as in non-pathogens.</p>

The clades include plant pathogenic fungi (H1, Ma, G, D), entomophathogens (H2.3, H2.4, H2.6), insect symbionts (H2.2), insect-vectored species (M1, O, H2.8), saprotrophs (S, H2.1), and mixed lifestyle groups.

<p>Insect-vectored species (M1, O, H2.8) demonstrated the highest gene losses in genes associated with secondary metabolite pathways, defense mechanisms, and carbohydrate and lipid transport and metabolism (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). This was also evident from the gene losses among different categories of CAZymes (carbohydrate-active enzymes), and SMCs (secondary metabolite clusters), as well as peptidases, transcription factors, and effectors. These patterns remained consistent when focusing solely on plant pathogens (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). The only gene classes that did not exhibit a reduction or showed gains in these three clades were tRNAs, genes involved in cytoskeleton functions, and cell motility (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Other IA species displayed more variability in changes to their gene repertoires, typically showing some gains in SMC genes (H2.1, H2.6). Two clades enriched with non-IA plant pathogens (H1, G) demonstrated the highest gains in host-related genes. Clade H1 experienced the most gene gains in genes related to secondary metabolite pathways, defense mechanisms, carbohydrate and amino acid transport and metabolism, wheres clade G experienced most gene gains in genes related to extracellular structures, secondary metabolite pathways, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and the cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis.</p>
<p>Overall, we observed common gene gains, particularly in CAZy and SMC classes, among many crop (clades H1, G) and some tree pathogens (clade D, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, insect-symbionts (clade H2.2), insect-vectored species, including plant pathogens (clades M1, H2.8, O), and specialized entomopathogens (H2.4, H2.6) exhibited variable levels of gene losses, sometimes in genes critical for host interactions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fungal pathogens are commonly linked to notably large genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raffaele and Kamoun 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wacker et al. 2023</xref>) yet they exhibit considerable diversity in both genome size and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Möller and Stukenbrock 2017</xref>). We focused on the class of Sordariomycetes, which includes fungi with diverse lifestyles, to investigate three questions: first, which genomic traits best explain genome size; second, whether genome size can be attributed to pathogenic lifestyle; and third, whether pathogens share common genomic traits. Our analysis revealed that gene number is the strongest predictor of genome size, followed by non-coding regions. We found no correlation between genome size and pathogenicity. Instead, pathogenicity was on average best explained by the number of effectors and tRNAs, but the overall genome architecture of pathogens was strongly influenced by the type of interacting host and the presence of potential vector species.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Genome size evolution in fungi</title>
<p>We found that the number of genes and their length—specifically, exon length and number—are the primary drivers of genome size in Sordariomycetes. While non-coding regions of the genome also contribute to this, they are less significant and are more frequently found in gene-poor species. These findings suggest that genes and non-coding regions do not evolve in concert or at the same rate.</p>
<p>To determine whether neutral processes can explain genome size in Sordariomycetes, we tested two hypotheses. The first posits that a decrease in effective population size (Ne) reduces the effectiveness of selection, including purifying selection, which in eukaryotes typically leads to a greater accumulation of deleterious non-coding elements and larger genome sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Lynch and Conery 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Lynch 2007</xref>). The second hypothesis suggests that, due to a higher rate of deletions compared to insertions, smaller Ne results in more streamlined genomes, similar to observations in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kuo, Moran, and Ochman 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Mira, Ochman, and Moran 2001</xref>). Using the genome-wide ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) as a proxy for Ne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lefébure et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kelkar and Ochman 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Marino et al. 2024</xref>), we did not find the link between Ne and the non-coding portion of the genome. Although we observed a weak negative correlation between the gene deletion rate and genome size, there was no correlation between the gene deletion rate and dN/dS.</p>
<p>The lack of clear association of dN/dS with the non-coding content could arise from several factors. First, dN/dS may not be an appropriate indicator of Ne, or species analyzed may not be in mutation-selection balance. Second, fungi typically have much more gene-rich genomes than most of other eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Wells and Feschotte 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Merényi et al. 2023</xref>), and the species in this study generally have modest genome sizes, which may weaken the relationship between Ne and the non-coding regions. Lastly, the large non-coding content is often driven by the proliferation of transposable elements (TEs), which are known to be very dynamic. The absence of significant association between dN/dS and TE content on the long evolutionary timescales has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Marino et al. 2024</xref>), suggesting possible variations in selective effects of TEs across different taxonomic groups.</p>
<p>Support for the neutral hypothesis of genome size evolution in our study is indirect. We found that species associated with insects—such as endoparasites and symbionts, therefore species that likely undergo transmission bottlenecks and in effect have reduced Ne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Mira and Moran 2002</xref>)—have smaller genomes and in some cases fewer genes. Additionally, insect-associated species have genes with fewer but longer exons, suggesting the evolution of a more streamlined gene architecture. While these findings align with neutral theories of genome evolution, further research is necessary to identify the primary processes, including any potential selective factors, that drive the dynamics of gene content in fungi.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Genomic predictors of fungal pathogens</title>
<p>Large genome size driven by repeats has often been implicated as one of the hallmarks of fungal pathogens, especially fungal plant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Raffaele and Kamoun 2012</xref>). However, in our analysis of over 500 genomes of Sordariomycetes, we found no evidence supporting a positive association between genome size or repeat content and pathogenic fungi. While a few species with the largest genomes are indeed plant pathogens and possess a high proportion of repeats, such instances appear to be exceptions rather than the rule on a broader scale. Although the high activity of transposable elements can contribute to genome expansion and facilitate the evolution of pathogenicity-related traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hartmann et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Wacker et al. 2023</xref>), our findings suggest that this is not the predominant pathway for fungal pathogen evolution.</p>
<p>We found that the overall number of genes, and genome size without repeats showed positive associations with pathogenicity on average. However, we can only speculate whether this pattern arises from drift or selection. Fungal pathogens comprise a diverse group of species, with specialists or generalists adaptations and varying demographic histories. Pathogens vary from obligate endoparasites, free-living saprotrophs who become opportunistic pathogens, to pathogens of common crops or plants with fluctuating or large Ne. Unfortunately, the specifics of the population dynamics and life histories of many pathogens remain largely unknown. Following the idea that smaller effective population sizes lead to smaller, more streamlined genomes in Sordariomycetes, the higher gene counts in pathogens may imply that most pathogens posses larger Ne compared to non-pathogens. Alternatively, the greater number of genes in pathogens might reflect selective pressures favoring pathogen-specific gene expansions. An arms race between hosts and pathogens drives the continual evolution of new effector gene variants in pathogens, enabling them to evade the host immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Boller and He 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Stalder et al. 2023</xref>). Our findings indicate association of genes important for pathogenicity, such as effectors, with pathogens which can contribute to this overall pattern. In addition, we observe that clades with different lifestyles undergo distinct gene loss and gain dynamics, further suggesting a selective advantage for certain gene duplications.</p>
<p>Effectors and tRNAs were the only specific gene classes we examined in our analysis and they proved to be better associated with pathogenicity than the overall gene count. The significance of effectors in pathogens is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Stergiopoulos and de Wit 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wilson and McDowell 2022</xref>). For instance, mutations in effector genes can provide pathogens with an advantage by enabling them to evade host immune defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Sánchez-Vallet et al. 2018</xref>). The role of tRNA modifications in pathogenicity has also been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hinsch, Galuszka, and Tudzynski 2016</xref>; G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Li et al. 2023</xref>), although the overall count of tRNAs remains less clear. In large eukaryotic genomes, short interspersed nuclear elements can lead to the misannotation of tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gibbs et al. 2004</xref>). Therefore the role of tRNAs in fungal pathogens warrants further investigation. Other gene families could be important predictors of pathogenicity. Carbohydrate-active enzymes profiles are reported to be different in pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Dort et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Haridas et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hane et al. 2019</xref>). Given that overall gene repertoires between pathogens can vary drastically, small-scale evolution of specialized genes or gene families can better reflect fungal transmissions to pathogenic lifestyles.</p>

<title>Different genomic evolutionary pathways for fungal pathogens</title>
<p>Our study showed that the insect-association (IA) trait was negatively correlated with genome size and positively with exon length. Additionally, the total number of genes was also significantly reduced, particularly in insect-transmitted clades. Previous research showed that specialized fungi tend to have smaller genomes than generalist fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Loos et al. 2024</xref>), and the associations we observed between genomic traits and IA species may partially reflect the degree of specialization towards their hosts. In our dataset, IA species include several species of entomopathogens, many of which are host-specific. Plant pathogens vectored by insects are also largely host specific.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is challenging to obtain a comprehensive data on the full range of host species represented in our dataset, which limits our ability to compare genome sizes between specialist and generalist species.</p>
<p>We found significant differences in gene evolution between IA and non-IA pathogens. While non-IA pathogens had the highest gene evolution rates, IA pathogens on average had the lowest. However, among the three clades of IA species included in our study, non-pathogenic species displayed a more pronounced reduction in effector repertoires compared to pathogenic species, highlighting the critical role of these genes across a broad range of fungal pathogens. Two IA clades, Ophiostomatales and Microascales, exhibited losses in gene classes important for host colonization and wood decomposition, such as CAZymes, or secondary metabolite clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Scharf, Heinekamp, and Brakhage 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cantarel et al. 2009</xref>). This is likely because the insect vector often facilitates host entry in these species, rendering many genes redundant and prone to pseudogenization and loss. In the third clade, Hypocreales, patterns of gene losses and gains varied across species. Hypocreales is our dataset’s largest order and includes both specialized and generalist species with diverse host and insect associations. Furthermore, many species within this order have lifestyles that remain poorly understood. Distinguishing between pathogenic and non-pathogenic lifestyles can be challenging, particularly for species found on dead host tissues, which may function as opportunistic pathogens or secondary saprophytes that benefit from decaying matter. These factors may partially contribute to the variation that we see across species.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study shows that genome size of Sordariomycetes is primarily determined by the number of genes, with non-coding regions playing a lesser role. We found no association between pathogenic species and larger genomes or higher repeat content compared to non-pathogenic species. While many pathogens have a high number of genes, especially effectors and tRNAs, this pattern does not hold true for all species. While gene gains are common to some plant pathogens, others, including, insect-vectored plant pathogens show frequent gene losses, including losses in gene classes important for host interactions. Additionally, insect-associated species tend to have smaller genomes and longer exons, likely reflecting their level of specialization toward hosts and vectors—factors that may influence their effective population size. In summary, our findings suggest that the genome architecture of fungal pathogens is mainly shaped by the dynamics of pathogenicity-related genes and the nature of interactions with hosts and other species.</p>

Gene completion was assessed with Busco v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Waterhouse et al. 2018</xref>) using an orthologous gene set from Sordariomycetes. <italic>Ab initio</italic> gene models were obtained with Augustus v.3.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Stanke and Morgenstern 2005</xref>) with different species-specific training files: Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium, Neurospora, Verticillium longisporum1 or Botrytis cinerea (Supplementary Table 1). Next, 31 assemblies were removed based on the low percentage of complete conserved genes (Busco score &lt; 85%) and one due to an excessive number of gene models (<italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>). The number of genes was systematically underestimated (10% on average) compared to the gene numbers that had been submitted to NCBI for the corresponding species, but underestimation was not different between pathogenic or non-pathogenic fungi (Wilcoxon rank sum test, w = 2994, p = 0.57).</p>

<p>The maximum likelihood tree was built from 1000 concatenated genes (retrieved with Busco v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Waterhouse et al. 2018</xref>)) with the highest species representation. Protein alignments were generated with mafft v7.453 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Katoh and Standley 2013</xref>) with E-INS-i method (option ‘--genafpair --ep 0 --maxiterate 1000’), trimmed with trimal v1.4.rev22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Capella-Gutiérrez, Silla-Martínez, and Gabaldón 2009</xref>) with option ‘-automated1’ and converted into a matrix.

<title>Species and trait selection</title>
<p>New and downloaded genome assemblies after filtering together amounted to 573. Few species were represented by more than one strain, in particular, multiple <italic>Ophiostoma</italic> strains sequenced in this study. To avoid potential biases related to the overrepresentation of some species, only one strain per species was retained, leaving 563 species in total, including 11 outgroup species.</p>
<p>Pathogenicity and insect association traits were assigned based on a literature search. Pathogenicity was assigned if the species caused a well-recognized disease, or pathogenicity was experimentally documented in at least one host species. We considered pathogens of plants, animals, and fungi, both obligatory and opportunistic. Insect association included all types of relationships with insects, including pathogenic, symbiotic, and mutualistic. Insect-vectored species were limited to documented cases of insect transmission. Analyzed genomic traits included genome size (bp), number of genes, number of effectors, a fraction of repeat content, size of the assembly excluding repeat content (bp), GC content, the mean number of introns per gene, mean intron size (bp), mean exon size (bp), a fraction of genes with introns, mean intergenic length (bp) and number of tRNA and pseudo tRNA genes. Genome size is equivalent to assembly size after filtering. Genome size excluding repeat content is assembly size excluding regions masked by RepeatMasker (in this study or downloaded from NCBI). Repeat content was calculated as the proportion of masked bases in the raw assembly (after removing contaminated contigs, but before filtering for contig length) compared to the raw assembly size. Gene number corresponds to the number of all <italic>ab initio</italic> gene models obtained with Augustus. GC content is the proportion of GC bases in the total assembly. The mean number of introns per gene, intron and exon size, a fraction of genes with introns, and intergenic length were estimated from gff files with annotated gene models. tRNA and pseudo tRNA genes were obtained with tRNAscan-SE v2.0.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chan et al. 2021</xref>). Effectors were identified from predicted proteins, first by running SignalP v6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Teufel et al. 2022</xref>) to identify proteins containing signal peptides, and then by running EffectorP v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sperschneider and Dodds 2022</xref>) on them to identify effectors.</p>

<title>Correlation of genomic traits with genome size</title>
<p>The phylogenetic generalized least squares (pgls) model of genome size was built with gls function from the R package nlme. Maximum likelihood (ML) method was used, and the phylogenetic relationships were modeled with the Pagel’s lambda correlation structure. We considered 11 genomic traits (except for genome size, and effectors) as explanatory variables. First, the correlations among pairs of genomic traits were calculated after transforming variables to independent contrasts using pic function from the R package ape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Paradis, Claude, and Strimmer 2004</xref>). Pairwise correlations were tested with non-parametric Spearman’s rank correlation test. As it turned out, many variables were strongly correlated with each other. Therefore, instead of including all variables in the model, PCA was run on 11 genomic variables to retain three main components, which explained 33%, 19%, and 13% of the trait variance respectively. The loadings revealed that PC1 was mainly influenced by genic traits (exon length, introns, genome w/o repeats, genes), PC2 by non-coding traits (repeats, intergenic length), whereas PC3 by other traits (tRNA, genes with introns). We fitted the PGLS model with the three main PCs and interactions among them. The model was checked for homogeneity of variance, and normal distribution of residuals, and was refitted after removing 8 outliers. Model fit was assessed using <monospace>anova()</monospace> function. To compute the importance of each component in the model, R<sup>2</sup> was calculated with the R2 function from the rr2 R package after removing each component at a time and comparing it with the full model.</p>

<title>Correlation between dN/dS and non-coding regions</title>
<p>Nonsynnymous to synonymous substitution rate (dN/dS) was calculated as a proxy for effective population size (Ne). Species with a larger Ne are expected to exhibit a lower rate of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate than species with smaller Ne due to stronger constraints on nonsynonymous deleterious mutations. dN/dS was calculated with codeml program in PAML v.4.10.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Yang 2007</xref>), on a codon-wise alignment of 300 random concatenated orthologs identified with Busco. Specifically, for each species, calculations were performed on a subset of ten most closely related species, with one species being the foreground branch and the rest serving as the background. Species, whose dN/dS estimate was based on a comparison with a recently diverged species showed elevated dN/dS values, likely because of the stronger contribution of segregating polymorphism compared to fixed differences to divergence estimates. To account for this time-dependence, logarithm of species divergence times was fitted to a logarithm of dN/dS using generalized least square model, and model residues were taken to serve as dN/dS estimates in further correlations.</p>
<p>To test if species with smaller Ne tend to accumulate more non-coding deleterious material, correlation between phylogenetically independent contrasts of time-corrected dN/dS estimates and log transformed traits such as repeat content, intergenic length, intron length and number were calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation.</p>

<title>Correlation between the gene loss rate and genome size</title>
<p>To test if differences in deletion rate can account for genome size changes, a correlation between the rate of gene loss and genome size was tested. Orthologous gene families for 563 species were determined with OrthoFinder v2.5.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Emms and Kelly 2019</xref>). Gene contractions were estimated by applying a birth-death model of gene evolution with CAFE v5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Mendes et al. 2020</xref>). A single lambda for all branches was estimated, with a poisson distribution for gene family counts at the root. As the likelihood scores could not be computed for all gene families, dataset was limited to 527 gene families present at the root and with a maximum change of 4 genes across species. This procedure has likely led to the removal of many fast evolving and big gene families and provides estimates on the rather conserved set of gene families. Lambda search was run three separate times to assure convergence. The rate of gene loss was calculated by summing gene family contractions and dividing by the calibrated branch length (in My).</p>
<p>Correlation on phylogenetically independent contrasts of log transformed genome size and log transformed gene loss rate was calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation.</p>

<title>Association of genomic traits with pathogenicity and IA</title>
<p>Association of pathogenicity and insect association (IA) with genomic traits was estimated using three approaches, i) a reversible jump MCMC discrete model of evolution implemented in BayesTraits v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pagel and Meade 2006</xref>), ii) a phylogenetic logistic regression with phyloglm function in R package phylolm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ho and Ané 2014</xref>), iii) random forest classification using scikit-learn python (v3) package. In tests of pathogenicity associations, analyses were also run separately within 10 subsets, where each subset comprised an equal number of pathogens and non-pathogens (n = 190,190) sampled from five genome size bins (between 20 and 70 Mbp, with a 10 Mbp step).</p>
<p>BayesTraits tests coevolution of a pair of binary traits, by modeling eight possible transition rates between the two traits (transition of only one trait at a time). We modeled coevolution of each genomic trait with pathogenicity or IA. Genomic traits were converted into binary traits based on their median (0 if below median and 1 if above median), such that trait gain indicates increase of the size of that trait, and trait loss indicates decrease in the size of the trait. For each genomic trait, two models were compared, one with independent and one with dependent evolution of the two traits. In addition, to test if some transition rates are more frequent in one direction (gains vs losses of a trait), four models were run in which we set equal rates of change for the opposite transitions (for example the rate of gain of genome size in pathogens was set to equal the rate of loss of genome size in pathogens), and compared them to dependent models using log Bayes factor. Based on all significant transition changes (gains or losses of one of the trait in the presence of the other) we determined if the genomic trait is positively associated with the pathogenicity/IA (gain of the trait for pathogens/IA, or loss of the trait in non-pathogens/non-IA). Finally, we also compared dependent model with the covarion model in which coevolutionary transitions were allowed to vary across the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Venditti, Meade, and Pagel 2011</xref>). Models were selected if the log Bayes factor surpassed 4. Each model was run three times to check for consistency, for 21 mln iterations, 1 mln burn-in, and thinning of 1000.</p>
<p>Phylogenetic logistic regression was used to fit each genomic trait to pathogenicity/IA using phyloglm function in R with the “logistic_MPLE” method, btol option (searching space limit) set to 30, and 1000 independent bootstrap replicates. Benjamini-Hochberg correction was applied to P-values. Scale of some genomic traits was adjusted. Assembly size with and without repeats was used in unit of 10 Mbp, number of genes in unit of 1000 genes, length of introns and intergenic length in unit of 1 kb, length of exons in unit of 100 bp, number of tRNAs, pseudo tRNAs, and effectors in unit of 100 genes.</p>
<p>To train a machine learning classifier for predicting pathogens and IA species, we tested the accuracy of five classifiers (KNeighbors, SVC, DecisionTree, RandomForest, and GradientBoosting). In each case, randomized grid search and five-fold cross validation was performed on the train data (80%), and balanced accuracy scores were obtained. Scores were averaged across 10 random splits into test and train datasets. Species with missing data were filtered out, and data were rescaled (between 0 and 1) for classification with SVC. As the random forest model showed one of the best scores, we used this model to train on the whole dataset and determine the most important features. Important features were determined using a mean decrease impurity method. In the final model, we used hyperparameters from the data split which gave the best balanced accuracy score. As the samples in the dataset are dependent through phylogenetic relationships, we also determined the impact of phylogeny on the model, by including for each species distances to each node as additional features. We found that node distances never appeared among the top 5 most important features.</p>
<p>Ancestral reconstruction of genome size was performed using fastAnc function in R package phytools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Revell 2011</xref>) and visualized on the tree with ggtree R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Yu 2020</xref>) using the continuous option.</p>
<p>To test association of exon length and exon number between IA and non-IA clades, we obtained these features for 38 one-to-one orthologs found with OrthoFinder (described above). Mean values across IA species were compared to mean values in non-IA species for two clade pairs using paired Mann Whitney U test.</p>
<p>To determine whether long exon genes are more or less likely to be deleted compared to short exon genes, we examined the presence of gene families across different clade members. Gene families found in all clade members represent genes that are less likely to be deleted, whereas gene families present in only a few members of the clade represent genes that are more often deleted. We then compared features of the common and rare gene families in terms of exon length and number, by fitting a negative binomial generalized linear model using <monospace>glm.nb()</monospace> function from the MASS package in R.</p>

<title>Evolution of pathogens with different lifestyles</title>
<p>The insect association (IA) trait was modeled using phylogenetic logistic regression in the phyloglm model, as described earlier, with each of the five genomic traits (genome size, exon length, number of genes, effectors, and tRNAs) tested individually, including pathogenicity as an interaction term. Models were fitted separately for 3 clades comprising species with a combination of pathogenicity and IA traits (H, M and O/Ma/D/S).</p>
<p>To test if the rate of gene evolution varies between pathogenic species that are IA or non-IA, we used the birth-death model implemented in CAFE v5, to fit one, two or four parameters of lambda on a subset of 527 small gene families. Pathogenicity and IA trait states were determined for each node in the phylogeny using function ace in the R package phytools. Model with equal rates of transition was used for IA (ER model) and a model with non-equal transition rates was used for pathogenicity (ADR model). Models were compared using likelihood ratio tests.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study addresses a topic that is frequently discussed in the literature but is under-assessed, namely correlations among genome size, repeat content, and pathogenicity in fungi. Contrary to previous assertions, the authors found that repeat content is not associated with pathogenicity. Rather, pathogenic lifestyle was found to be better explained by the number of protein-coding genes, with other genomic features associated with insect association status. While the results are considered <bold>solid</bold>, confidence in the results would be deepened if the authors were to comprehensively account for potential biases stemming from the underlying data quality of the analyzed genomes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript &quot;Lifestyles shape genome size and gene content in fungal pathogens&quot; by Fijarczyk et al. presents a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset of fungal genomes to investigate what genomic features correlate with pathogenicity and insect associations. The authors focus on a single class of fungi, due to the diversity of lifestyles and availability of genomes. They analyze a set of 12 genomic features for correlations with either pathogenicity or insect association and find that, contrary to previous assertions, repeat content does not associate with pathogenicity. They discover that the number of protein-coding genes, including the total size of non-repetitive DNA does correlate with pathogenicity. However, unique features are associated with insect associations. This work represents an important contribution to the attempts to understand what features of genomic architecture impact the evolution of pathogenicity in fungi.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The statistical methods appear to be properly employed and analyses thoroughly conducted. The manuscript is well written and the information, while dense, is generally presented in a clear manner.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My main concerns all involve the genomic data, how they were annotated, and the biases this could impart to the downstream analyses. The three main features I'm concerned with are sequencing technology, gene annotation, and repeat annotation.</p>
<p>The collection of genomes is diverse and includes assemblies generated from multiple sequencing technologies including both short- and long-read technologies. Not only has the impact of the sequencing method not been evaluated, but the technology is not even listed in Table S1. From the number of scaffolds it is clear that the quality of the assemblies varies dramatically. This is going to impact many of the values important for this study, including genome size, repeat content, and gene number. Additionally, since some filtering was employed for small contigs, this could also bias the results.</p>
<p>I have considerable worries that the gene annotation methods could impart biases that significantly affect the main conclusions. Only 5 reference training sets were used for the Sordariomycetes and these are unequally distributed across the phylogeny. Augusts obviously performed less than ideally, as the authors reported that it under-annotated the genomes by 10%. I suspect it will have performed worse with increasing phylogenetic distance from the reference genomes. None of the species used for training were insect-associated, except for those generated by the authors for this study. As this feature was used to split the data it could impact the results. Some major results rely explicitly on having good gene annotations, like exon length, adding to these concerns. Looking manually at Table S1 at Ophiostoma, it does seem to be a general trend that the genomes annotated with Magnaporthe grisea have shorter exons than those annotated with H294. I also wonder if many of the trends evident in Figure 5 are also the result of these biases. Clades H1 and G each contain a species used in the training and have an increase in genes for example.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the genomes available from NCBI will vary greatly in the quality of their repeat masking. While some will have been masked using custom libraries generated with software like Repeatmodeler, others will probably have been masked with public databases like repbase. As public databases are again biased towards certain species (Fusarium is well represented in repbase for example), this could have significant impacts on estimating repeat content. Additionally, even custom libraries can be problematic as some software (like RepeatModeler) will include multicopy host genes leading to bona fide genes being masked if proper filtering is not employed. A more consistent repeat masking pipeline would add to the robustness of the conclusions.</p>
<p>To a lesser degree, I wonder what impact the use of representative genomes for a species has on the analyses. Some species vary greatly in genome size, repeat content, and architecture among strains. I understand that it is difficult to address in this type of analysis, but it could be discussed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors report on the genomic correlates of the transition to the pathogenic lifestyle in Sordariomycetes. The pathogenic lifestyle was found to be better explained by the number of genes, and in particular effectors and tRNAs, but this was modulated by the type of interacting host (insect or not insect) and the ability to be vectored by insects.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of this study lies in the size of the dataset, and the potentially high number of lifestyle transitions in Sordariomycetes.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main strength of the study is not the clarity of the conclusions.</p>
<p>(1) This is due firstly to the presentation of the hypotheses. The introduction is poorly structured and contradictory in some places. It is also incomplete since, for example, fungus-insect associations are not mentioned in the introduction even though they are explicitly considered in the analyses.</p>
<p>(2) The lack of clarity also stems from certain biases that are challenging to control in microbial comparative genomics. Indeed, defining lifestyles is complicated because many fungi exhibit different lifestyles throughout their life cycles (for instance, symbiotic phases interspersed with saprotrophic phases). In numerous fungi, the lifestyle referenced in the literature is merely the sampling substrate (such as wood or dung), which doesn't mean that this substrate is a crucial aspect of the life cycle. This issue is discussed by the authors, but they do not eliminate the underlying uncertainties.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study combines comparative genomics with other validation methods to identify the factors that mediate genome size evolution in Sordariomycetes fungi and their relationship with lifestyle. The study provides insights into genome architecture traits in this Ascomycete group, finding that, rather than transposons, the size of their genomes is often influenced by gene gain and loss. With an excellent dataset and robust statistical support, this work contributes valuable insights into genome size evolution in Sordariomycetes, a topic of interest to both the biological and bioinformatics communities.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study is complete and well-structured.</p>
<p>Bioinformatics analysis is always backed by good sampling and statistical methods. Also, the graphic part is intuitive and complementary to the text.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work is great in general, I just had issues with the Figure 1B interpretation.</p>
<p>I struggled a bit to find the correspondence between this sentence: &quot;Most genomic features were correlated with genome size and with each other, with the strongest positive correlation observed between the size of the assembly excluding repeats and the number of genes (Figure 1B).&quot; and the Figure 1B. Perhaps highlighting the key p values in the figure could help.</p>
