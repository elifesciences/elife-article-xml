<title>Abstract</title><p>The brain’s ability to appraise threats and execute appropriate defensive responses is essential for survival in a dynamic environment. Humans studies have implicated the anterior insular cortex (aIC) in subjective fear regulation and its abnormal activity in fear/anxiety disorders. However, the complex aIC connectivity patterns involved in regulating fear remain under investigated. To address this, we recorded single units in the aIC of freely moving mice that had previously undergone auditory fear conditioning, assessed the effect of optogenetically activating specific aIC output structures in fear, and examined the organization of aIC neurons projecting to the specific structures with retrograde tracing. Single-unit recordings revealed that a balanced number of aIC pyramidal neurons’ activity either positively or negatively correlated with a conditioned tone-induced freezing (fear) response. Optogenetic manipulations of aIC pyramidal neuronal activity during conditioned tone presentation altered the expression of conditioned freezing. Neural tracing showed that non-overlapping populations of aIC neurons project to the amygdala or the medial thalamus, and the pathway bidirectionally modulated conditioned fear. Specifically, optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-amygdala pathway increased conditioned freezing, while optogenetic stimulation of the aIC-medial thalamus pathway decreased it. Our findings suggest that the balance of positive and negative neuronal activity in the aIC and the distinct efferent circuits interact collectively to modulate fear behavior.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pavlovian fear conditioning is believed to serve a survival function in nature and is widely used as a preclinical model system to understand normal and abnormal fear behavior in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). Functional brain imaging studies consistently implicate the insular cortex (IC) in processing fear and anxiety in humans. Specifically, healthy subjects show increased IC activity with fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), while patients with anxiety disorders exhibit even greater IC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Animal studies also implicate the IC in fear conditioning. For instance, re-exposure of rodents to a fear-conditioned context increases IC activity as measured by c-Fos or cytochrome oxidase staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Additionally, microinjection of cobalt chloride, a non-selective synapse blocker, in the IC disrupts fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>), and post-training electrolytic lesions of the IC attenuate the expression of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>).</p>
<p>Anatomically, the IC is divided into the anterior IC (aIC) and posterior IC (pIC) by the middle cerebral artery. Although they are reciprocally connected, the aIC and pIC have distinct connections with other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Specifically, the pIC receives inputs from the primary somatosensory thalamic nuclei, while the aIC receives strong inputs from the prefrontal cortex and has reciprocal connections with higher-order association thalamic nuclei, such as the mediodorsal thalamus. Given its connections with cortical brain regions, the aIC is ideally positioned to integrate high-level information to regulate behaviors. Although both aIC and pIC have been implicated in fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>), how the aIC connections to different brain regions modulate fear remains unclear.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this study, we investigated how the aIC neurons projecting to different brain regions process auditory fear conditioning. Using single-unit recording, we found that a subset of aIC pyramidal neurons displayed activity that was positively or negatively correlated with a conditioned freezing response, suggesting that the balance of different aIC neuronal activities regulates fear behavior. Neural tracing revealed that distinct population of aIC neurons projects to the amygdala and the medial thalamus. Optogenetic manipulations confirmed that the aIC exerts bidirectional modulation of fear behavior through the aIC-amygdala pathway (increases fear) and the aIC-medial thalamus pathway (decreases fear). Together, our study suggests that different aIC circuits are involved in bidirectional modulation of fear behavior.</p>

<title>aIC activities correlate with conditioned fear</title>
<p>To investigate how conditioned fear is processed by individual aIC neurons, we recorded their activity during the expression of auditory fear (conditioned group) or to tone presentation (control group) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We histologically verified the recording locations to be within the aIC including the dorsal agranular insular cortex (AID), ventral agranular insular cortex (AIV), dysgranular insular cortex (DI), and granular insular cortex (GI) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Most unit signals were recorded from the AID and AIV. We only used well-isolated unit signals from the aIC for analysis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Of the recorded neurons, we analyzed the activity of 108 putative pyramidal neurons from 11 mice, which were distinguished from putative interneurons (n = 8 cells) based on the characteristics of their recorded action potentials (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; see methods for details).</p>

<p>As expected, the auditory fear conditioned mice significantly increased their freezing behavior during the tone conditioned stimulus (CS) presentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>, repeated-measures ANOVA, F(<sub>35,210</sub>) = 11.303, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), particularly during tone-on periods compared to tone-off periods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref> left, paired samples t-test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001). In contrast, control mice that did not undergo auditory fear conditioning showed virtually no freezing during the tone presentation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E, F</xref>).</p>
<p>The mean of all normalized (z-scored) pyramidal neuronal activities recorded in the aIC remained steady during the experiment in both groups (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The conditioned group showed no significant correlation between the normalized firing rate and freezing behavior, nor was there any difference in the mean firing rate between the tone-on and tone-off periods (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Similar trends were observed in the normalized neuronal activity of control mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G, H</xref>). These results suggest that the mean activity of all recorded aIC pyramidal neurons remains relatively constant, regardless of the fear experience.</p>
<p>Several studies report reduction in theta frequency in presence of the CS in several brain regions including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). Similarly, the power of aIC local field potential in the &lt;50 Hz frequency, which includes the theta frequency, tended to be reduced in the conditioned group compared to the control during CS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I, J</xref>). Quantitative analysis revealed that theta frequency (6 Hz) was significantly reduced during, but not before, CS presentation in the conditioned group compared to the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the relationship between firing rates of individual neurons and conditioned freezing behavior in detail, we attempted to identify a population of neurons whose activity changed in response to the conditioned tone stimulus. Using Pearson’s correlation analysis, we identified three types of aIC neuronal responses: neurons whose firing rate increased in parallel with the freezing response (“positive cells”), neurons whose firing rate decreased with freezing (“negative cells”), and neurons that had no significant changes correlated with freezing (“non-responsive cells”). The distribution of all coefficients is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Among the neurons recorded from fear conditioned mice, 29.6% were responsive (n = 32/108) and 70.4% were non-responsive (n = 76/108) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Among the responsive cells, there were proportionally more positive cells (n = 21/32, 65.6%) than negative cells (n = 11/32, 34.4%), but the trend was not statistically significant (binomial proportions test, <italic>P</italic> = 0.11) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Histological analysis of the recording locations of respective neuronal-response types suggested that the positive and negative cells may be located in different layers of the aIC (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The positive cells tended to be recorded in the middle and deep layers (L5 and 6; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, red dots), while the negative cells tended to be recorded in the superficial and middle layers (L2/3, 4, and 5; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, blue dots). Tetrodes that recorded both positive and negative cells tended to be located in the middle layer (L5; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, red and blue gradation dot). The non-responsive cells were recorded from all layers of the aIC. To visualize any differences in firing rate changes among different neuronal-response types in fear conditioned and control mice, the mean normalized firing rate of individual aIC neurons was sorted in ascending order of their respective Pearson’s correlation coefficients (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Negative cells showed relatively higher tone-off firing rates, which decreased during tone presentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, conditioned upper). Positive cells, in contrast, showed a lower tone-off firing rate that increased during tone presentation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, conditioned lower). The non-responsive cells, interestingly, showed an intermediate tone-off firing rate between those of the negative and positive cells and remained relatively constant throughout the recording (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, conditioned middle). The neuronal activity of control mice was similar to the non-responsive cells of the fear conditioned mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, control). Sample raster plots during the five CS presentations and peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH) of a negative and a positive cell consistently show the trend (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The differences in baseline firing rate of different cell-response types are also reflected in raw, not normalized, values (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>; one-way ANOVA, F=6.65, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). These results suggest that subpopulations of pyramidal neurons in the aIC may become primed to respond to the fear-conditioned stimulus.</p>
<p>To visually present the relationship between aIC neuron’s response type and conditioned fear expression, we plotted normalized neuronal activities of each neuronal response type and freezing behavior over the time course of the fear expression test. Analysis revealed a tight relationship between the activity of positive and negative cells and freezing behavior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, G</xref>). The mean activity of positive cells mirrored freezing behaviors, increasing activity at peak freezing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>), whereas the mean activity of negative cells decreased during freezing behavior (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Non-responsive cells showed no apparent changes that were correlated with freezing responses (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficient between mean normalized firing rate and freezing revealed that the activities of the positive and negative neurons were significantly correlated with freezing behavior in opposite directions (positive cell r = 0.81, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; negative cell r = −0.68, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). As expected, no correlation was found for the non-responsive neurons (r = 0.13, <italic>P</italic> = 0.44). For detailed analysis of each neuronal response type’s activity changes that occurs during CS, we compared the absolute values of negative and positive cells in smaller time bins (1 s). The tone-induced firing rate peaks of the negative and positive cells were significantly different (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>, Mann-Whitney Test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05); the negative cells peaked at 10.5 s, while the positive cells peaked at 17.6 s. This difference suggests differential circuits may regulate the activities of different neuron types in response to fear.We also analyzed additional qualities of the aIC neurons, such as the presence of neurons that precisely signaled the beginning or termination of the tone, the tone on-set and tone off-set cells, respectively. However, none of the recorded aIC neurons, neither the conditioned group’s nor the control’s, were tone on-set or tone off-set cells.</p>
<p>We then assessed the correlation between neuronal activity and tone. None of the neuronal activity of control mice (n = 13 cells, 3 mice) significantly correlated with the tone (r = 0.027, <italic>P</italic> = 0.87), but a subset of aIC neurons in conditioned mice showed significant correlation with tone (positive cells, r=0.44, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, n=9; negative cells, r=-0.51, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05, n=5). During the five-tone presentation, however, freezing behavior was still high, and therefore difficult to distinguish whether aIC neuronal activities correlate with freezing, tone, or both. To differentiate what the aIC neuronal activities represents, we carried out a fear extinction experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>) where conditioned freezing behavior reduces gradually over the ten trials (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Just like the five-tone presentation experiment, we found the positive and negative cells that correlated with freezing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>). Pearson’s correlation coefficient between mean normalized firing rate and freezing show that the activities of the positive and negative cells were significantly correlated with freezing behavior in opposite directions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref>; positive cells, r = 0.81, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; negative cells, r = −0.68, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Interestingly, none of the recorded cells correlated with tone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2N</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the positive and negative cells found in the aIC of fear-conditioned mice are highly correlated with freezing behavior, not tone.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Manipulating aIC activities modulate conditioned fear behavior</title>
<p>Our results suggest that the emergence of positive and negative cells following fear conditioning may be critical in regulating freezing (fear) behavior. To investigate this further, we tested whether artificially increasing or decreasing the activity of aIC pyramidal neurons with optogenetics could affect freezing behavior. Viral vectors were used to express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2: AAV-CaMKII-ChR2-eYFP), halorhodopsin (NpHR3: AAV-CaMKII-NpHR3-eYFP), or fluorophore (control: AAV-CaMKII-eYFP) in the aIC pyramidal neurons and we assessed how optical stimulation affects conditioned fear behavior in each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We only analyzed the behavior of mice with confirmed viral expression in the aIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In a separate group of mice, we assessed whether optical stimulation induces aberrant behaviors or affects locomotion with the open field test. Neither activation of ChR2 nor NpHR3 triggered any aberrant behaviors, and locomotion did not differ among groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

ChR2 stimulation increased brain rhythms in the 20 Hz and 40 Hz range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, spectrogram) because light stimulation was delivered at 20 Hz pulses. Continuous light was delivered for NpHR3 stimulation, so it did not induce specific frequency modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, spectrogram).

<p>After confirming that optical activation parameters used in the study does not interfere with locomotion, we examined whether optogenetically manipulating the activity of aIC pyramidal neurons modulates conditioned freezing behavior. As predicted, optogenetic excitation or inhibition of aIC pyramidal neurons in the right hemisphere produced distinct changes in freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). During a 30 s tone+optostimulation, there was no difference in freezing behavior among groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis, <italic>H</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) = 2.489, <italic>P</italic> = 0.288). However, during the tone-off sessions, freezing behavior among groups differed significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis, <italic>H</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) = 22.937, <italic>P</italic> = 0.000; post hoc Mann-Whitney, ChR2 vs. control <italic>P</italic> = 0.000; NpHR vs. control <italic>P</italic> = 0.019). Conditioned freezing responses of the ChR2 group were sustained even after tone+optostimulation ended, and tended to accumulate with repeated stimulations, particularly during the tone-off sessions. This was distinct from the conditioned freezing responses observed in the NpHR3 or control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In the NpHR3 group, freezing immediately decreased after tone+optostimulation ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). When comparing the freezing behavior of each group during their first and last tone+optostimulation trials, inhibition of aIC pyramidal neurons (NpHR3) reduced the freezing level between the first and the last tone+optostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, left; Wilcoxon signed test, <italic>P</italic> =0.063). During the tone-off period, the ChR2 group significantly increased freezing after the last stimulation compared to the first (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, right; Wilcoxon signed test, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01).</p>
<p>These group differences in fear expression were absent in the experiment carried out without optostimulation (ANOVA group effect: <italic>F</italic>(<sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sub>) = 1.076, <italic>P</italic> = 0.354) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I, J</xref>), confirming that group differences in fear expression were induced by the activation or inhibition of pyramidal neurons in the aIC. Likewise, the accumulative influence in behavior was absent without optostimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct aIC circuits bilaterally control conditioned fear</title>
<p>Despite optogenetic modulation of aIC pyramidal neurons affecting fear behavior, the effect was unclear, as there were no differences in freezing behavior during optical stimulation delivery among groups. One possible explanation for this is that the aIC circuits that regulate fear behavior in opposing directions were simultaneously activated to cancel out the effects. To investigate further, we looked into aIC projections to various brain areas that could potentially influence fear behavior. The aIC projects to the amygdala (BLA, basolateral amygdala; and CeA, central amygdala) and the medial thalamus (MD, mediodorsal thalamus; and CM, centromedial thalamus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Of the many brain regions the aIC project to, we focused on these brain areas due to their known involvement in fear regulation and the lack of reciprocal connections between them and the pIC.</p>
<p>To investigate whether the same or different population of neurons in the aIC project to the medial thalamus and the amygdala using retrograde tracer injections (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Two different colors of fluorophore-conjugated Cholera toxin subunit B were injected into the medial dorsal thalamus (Alexa Fluor 594, red) and the amygdala (Alexa Fluor 488, green) in each mouse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B, C</xref>). A week later, fluorophore expression was examined in the aIC region. Surprisingly, none of the neurons in the aIC expressed both green and red fluorophores, suggesting that non-overlapping populations of aIC neurons project to the medial dorsal thalamus and the amygdala (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). The neurons projecting to the medial dorsal thalamus and the amygdala were also located in different layers within the aIC; the aIC neurons projecting to the medial dorsal thalamus appeared mainly in the deep layers (approximately layer 6), while the aIC neurons projecting to the amygdala appeared in a relatively more superficial layer (approximately layer 5). Few aIC→amygdala neurons were present in layer 6, but we found no aIC→medial thalamus neurons in layer 5. The number of aIC neurons projecting to the medial dorsal thalamus was greater than those projecting to the amygdala even though they were populated in a more restricted area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Although the recording location of the positive and negative cells does not exactly match the tracing results, positive cells were recorded from deep layers while negative cells were recorded from middle and superficial layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Collectively, data suggest that the aIC→medial thalamus neurons could be positive cells, while the aIC→amygdala neurons may be negative cells.</p>

<p>To distinguish the roles of the aIC→medial thalamus and the aIC→amygdala projections, we performed bilateral optical stimulation of the respective aIC terminals expressing ChR2 during the expression of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, E</xref>).

<p>Also, when opto-stimulation was turned off, and only the conditioned tone was delivered (retrieval test), there were no differences in the freezing level between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, G</xref>). The results indicate that the behavioral differences were indeed induced by the activation of respective projections. In addition, we compared freezing levels of tone+optostim and tone-off periods to assess whether activation of these pathways produces a lasting effect on behavior. Unlike the phenomenon observed in aIC activation with ChR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), activation of neither the aIC→medial thalamus nor the aIC→amygdala projection produced any lasting behavioral effects between light stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, H</xref>). The tracing and optogenetics manipulation results support the hypothesis that distinct hardwired circuits of the aIC, one projecting to the amygdala and the others projecting to the medial thalamus, regulate conditioned fear bidirectionally.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study shows that neuronal activity in the aIC can regulate conditioned fear behavior bidirectionally via at least two different subpopulations of neurons that project either to the amygdala or the thalamus. Specifically, we found two types of aIC pyramidal neurons whose activity positively or negatively correlates with conditioned fear behavior, consistent with our previous finding that restraint stress-induced defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>) correlate with the activity of aIC pyramidal neurons. While previous studies have reported positive or negative responses to conditioned stimuli in different conditioning paradigms and brain areas, including the pIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), our study found that the ratio of these neurons differed in the aIC. In the pIC, a significantly larger population of positive neurons was reported compared to negative neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), but in the aIC, we found approximately an equal number of positive and negative neurons. The brain’s balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) has been proposed to play a crucial role in its normal functioning. An E/I imbalance has been linked to various disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Our study’s finding of an approximately equal number of positive and negative cells in the aIC, compared to the pIC, suggests that the aIC may be more specialized in maintaining the E/I balance, possibly by activating different circuits.</p>
<p>While both the positive and negative aIC cells showed significant correlations with freezing behavior, their temporal firing rate changes during CS presentation were different. Specifically, the activity of the negative cells dropped before the positive cells increased in response to the CS presentation. Previous studies have demonstrated that temporal differences in the arrival of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can create a time window for local signals to be transmitted while maintaining the global E/I balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). We hypothesize that the observed differences in the temporal activity of the positive and negative aIC cells may provide such a window for orchestrating signal gating and processing. This suggests that the aIC may play a critical role in regulating the balance between excitation and inhibition during fear conditioning.</p>
<p>Although this study was unable to determine what determines an aIC neuron to be a positive or negative response type, we speculate that inputs from different brain areas may influence the different responses. For instance, negative cells may receive input from the prefrontal cortex since whole-brain connectivity analysis of the IC indicated that the prefrontal cortex provides more inputs to inhibitory neurons in the aIC than to excitatory neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Conversely, positive cells may receive input from the amygdala, as the amygdala provides more input to excitatory neurons in the aIC than inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the potential importance of positive and negative neurons in conditioned fear processing, we investigated whether disrupting the E/I balance by optogenetically increasing or decreasing the total output of aIC pyramidal neurons could alter fear behavior (freezing). Our findings demonstrated that fear behavior could be bidirectionally modulated by aIC neuronal activity: exciting aIC neurons increased the fear response, while inhibiting aIC neurons had the opposite effect. These findings have significant clinical implications since they suggest that specifically targeting negative or positive cells for neuromodulation may not be necessary to have a therapeutic effect. Even though the aIC has fine microcircuitry and intricate connections with many brain regions, merely controlling the total output of the aIC may be enough to regulate fear and anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>During the aIC optogenetic stimulation, we observed a phenomenon where brief excitation or inhibition of aIC pyramidal neurons had a residual effect on behavior during the inter-trial period when optic stimulation was off. Another study also reports the cumulative effects of optical activation of ChR2-expressing neurons on freezing behavior even after optic stimulation ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), supporting that it can happen. Although further studies will be necessary to verify what causes this phenomenon, our single unit recording and local field potential analysis during optostimulation support that it is not due to seizure produced by optostimulations. It may occur due to the recruitment of several brain areas modulated by the aIC neurons since activating a more specific circuit, the aIC→medial thalamus or the aIC→amygdala projection, did not produce any lasting effects between light stimulations. Activation or inhibition of the aIC may promote or reduce activation of a recurrent circuit that controls behavior, especially since the aIC has connections with motor-related brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to our finding that optically controlling the total output of the aIC bidirectionally and cumulatively regulates fear behavior, we found that selective activation of distinct non-overlapping population of aIC neurons projecting to different brain regions produced clear-cut bidirectional changes in fear behavior. Specifically, optical activation of the aIC projection to the amygdala enhanced and sustained fear behavior, while activation of the aIC projection to the thalamus reduced fear behavior. Our results are consistent with previous studies reporting that amygdala activation promotes fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), while thalamus activation, especially in the burst firing mode of the MD, reduces fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Although terminal optogenetic stimulation could produce antidromic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), it only activates a subset of aIC neurons projecting to the areas, Therefore, our study demonstrates for the first time that controlling distinct aIC outputs bidirectionally regulate fear behaviors.</p>
<p>Although we do not have a direct link between single-unit recording and aIC projections, the recording locations of the positive and negative cells suggest that medial thalamus projecting neurons could be positive cells while the amygdala projecting neurons may be negative cells. If so, then the activity of the aIC neurons would work as a mechanism to reduce overexpression of fear. Similar to our findings, the insular→central amygdala and the insula→nucleus accumbens differentially regulated fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Since the insular cortex is extensively connected with various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), several redundant circuits may be present in the aIC to fine-tune fear behavior. How the fear promoting and fear reducing aIC circuits compete and cooperate is still unclear and it would be interesting to investigate this in future studies.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the aIC regulates conditioned fear behaviors through bidirectional control on multiple levels, with the balance of positive and negative neuronal activity operating at the local circuit level and different populations of neurons projecting to different brain regions exerting additional control. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural circuits underlying fear behavior and have potential implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for fear and anxiety disorders.</p>

Our research is in accordance with ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). We used F1 hybrids of C57BL/6J × 129/SvJae male mice (10-18 weeks old) in our experiments. The mice were housed at a constant temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and humidity level (50 ± 5%). They were kept in home cages with free access to food and water and subjected to an alternating 12-hour dark-light reversal cycle starting at 9 am.

<p>All mice were handled for at least one week before the experiments. For conditioning, we used a fear conditioning chamber (Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA) equipped with stainless-steel bars on the floor for delivering electric foot shocks, placed inside an isolation box with a camera mounted on its ceiling. A day before conditioning, the mice were habituated in a white acrylic cylinder (context A: diameter * height = 20 * 25 cm) for 10 min. Twenty-four hours after habituation, the mice were exposed to three conditioning tones (CS; 2 kHz, 75 dB) lasting 30 s, which were co-terminated with a foot shock (US: 0.5 mA, 1 s) at 2.5-min inter-trial intervals in the fear conditioning chamber (context B; width * length * height = 18 * 18 * 29 cm). The expression of conditioned fear was tested the following day in context A. The freezing response was defined as the absence of any movement (other than breathing) for &gt;1 sec and was videotaped and manually scored by two investigators who were blinded to the experimental groups.</p>

<title>Single unit recording and expression of conditioned auditory fear</title>
<p>We used a behavioral single-unit recording technique to investigate the activities of individual neurons during exposure to the CS (tone) after auditory fear conditioning. Screening for neuronal activity was carried out in a square black chamber (width * length * height = 20 * 23 * 14 cm). To obtain unit signals, neural signals were amplified (x10,000), filtered (600 Hz to 6 kHz), and digitized (30.3 kHz) using Digital Lynx (Neuralynx, Tucson, AZ). Upon successful identification of unit signals, mice underwent habituation in context A, followed by the auditory fear conditioning process in context B the next day. No neuronal activities were recorded during this period. The day after conditioning, single neurons were recorded in freely behaving mice during the expression of auditory fear in context A. Neuronal activity and videos were recorded simultaneously and synchronized by the Neuralynx data acquisition system. Tone (CS; 2 kHz, 75 dB, lasting 30 s) event times were saved using Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) signals. The baseline was recorded for 3 min, and then behavior and neuronal activities during five CS (30 s), each separated by a 2.5-min inter-trial interval, were recorded. Neuronal signals were manually isolated into single units using Spike Sort 3D (Neuralynx, USA). The quality of isolated unit signals was assessed by L-ratio, isolation distance, inter-spike intervals in the ISI histogram (ISI &gt; 1 ms) provided by the software, and cross-correlation analysis. We only used well-isolated units that were confirmed to be recorded in the aIC (conditioned group: n = 116 neurons, 11 mice; control group: n = 14 neurons, 3 mice) for the analysis.

Since previous studies report changes in theta power with fear conditioning in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we analyzed the difference in theta (6 Hz) between groups in presence and absence of tone.</p>

<title>Surgery for optogenetic studies</title>
<p>For the optogenetic studies, general anesthesia was induced in mice with 2.5% isoflurane (room air as the carrier gas) and maintained at 1.0% (Somnosuite, Kent Scientific) throughout surgical procedures. A 33-gauge blunt needle attached to a Nanofil (WPI, USA) was used for viral injections (500-600 nL/brain site). The injection speed was set at 100 nL/min, and injection needles were placed in the target site for 10 min before and after viral injection. Viruses with an alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIα) promoter, which targets pyramidal neurons, were injected into the aIC (AP: +1.2 mm, ML: −3.4 mm, DV: −1.8 mm) for optogenetic control of excitatory pyramidal neurons. The types of viruses used for the study were AAV2-CaMKIIα-ChR2-EYFP (n=13), AAV2-CaMKIIα-eNpHR3.0-EYFP (n=7), and AAV2-CaMKIIα-EYFP (n=13) (UNC Vector Core, USA). An optic fiber (multimode 62.5-μm core optic fiber) attached to a ceramic ferrule (Thorlabs, USA) was implanted unilaterally into the right aIC (AP: +1.2 mm, ML: −3.4 mm, DV: −1.75 mm). For stimulation of the aIC-amygdala or the aIC-medial thalamus projections, optic fibers were bilaterally implanted in the amygdala (AP: −1.2 mm, ML: ±3.4 mm, DV: −4.25 mm) or the medial thalamus (AP: −1.2 mm, ML: ±1.21 mm, DV: −2.53 mm, angle: ±15°). Optic ferrules were secured onto the skull with self-tapping stainless-steel screws and dental cement (Vertex Dental, Netherlands). Mice for optogenetic experiments were allowed to recover for at least 2 weeks to allow sufficient time for viral expression.</p>

<title>Open field test with optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>To assess whether optostimulation parameters used in our study may influence behavior and interfere with the interpretation of the results, we analyzed the behaviors of mice in the three groups (ChR2, NpHR3, control) with optostimulation recorded in an open field. Mice were released in an open field chamber (50×50×50 cm opaque white acrylic, ∼75 lx) and allowed to explore for 3 min (baseline). Then, five 30-s optostimulations (light on) were delivered with an interval of 30 s (light off). The same optostimulation parameters used for the fear test was applied (ChR2: 20 Hz, 473 nm, 3-8 mW; NpHR3: continuous, 593 nm, 6-8 mW; control: 20 Hz, 473 nm, 3-8 mW). We used the Ethovision software to analyze the velocity (cm/s) of the three groups during baseline, light on, and light off.</p>

<title>Neuronal recording with optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>Changes in single unit activities and brain rhythms (LFP) induced by optostimulation were measured using a custom made optotetrode (microdrive with an optic fiber and 4 tetrodes, Axona, UK) in freely moving mice. The same single unit recording and analysis, and optostimulation parameters were used (see according sections). To obtain LFP signals, neuronal signals were bandpass filtered (0.1 Hz to 8 kHz) and digitized (32 kHz). We inspected possible seizure-like events (ictal activity) generated by optogenetic stimulations with raw traces of LFP and did not find any. Changes in brain rhythm induced by optogenetic stimulation were analyzed by plotting time-frequency spectrograms calculated using the <italic>mtspecgramc</italic> function in the Chronux toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>

<title>Fear expression with optogenetic stimulation</title>
<p>We investigated how optically activating aIC neurons or activating specific output targets of the aIC—either to the amygdala or medial thalamus—modulates conditioned fear. On the day following conditioning, the fear expression of mice was measured with continuous optical stimulation delivered (ChR2: 473 nm, 3-8 mW; NpHR3: 593 nm, 6-8 mW; eYFP: 473 nm, 3-8 mW) during each CS presentation in context A. The fear expression paradigm for the aIC opto-stimulation was the same as the one for the single unit recording study. For the aIC terminal stimulation, bilateral optical stimulation (20 Hz pulses, 473 nm, 1-2 mW) was delivered during CS presentation in either the medial thalamus or the amygdala. Ten CSs were presented with variable inter-CS intervals (40-60 s). The behaviors of mice in each group were videotaped and scored as described above.</p>

<title>Tracer injection surgery</title>
<p>To investigate the distribution of neurons that project to either the amygdala or the medial thalamus, two retrograde tracers (CTB; Cholera toxin B) conjugated with different fluorophores were injected into a mouse. Retrograde tracers were injected into the amygdala (400 nL of 1% Alexa Fluor 488-CTB, AP: −1.2 mm, ML: −3.4 mm, DV: −4.35 mm) and the medial thalamus (400 nL of 1% Alexa Fluor 594-CTB, AP: −1.2 mm, ML: −0.2 mm, DV: −3.4 mm) in each mouse (n=3). The same surgical and injection protocols used for the viral injection in the optogenetic experiments were used.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>After completion of the study, mice were overdosed with 2% avertin. To locate tetrode tips, a small electrolytic lesion was made at the tip of the recording site by passing an anodic current (10 µA, 5 s) through one tetrode channel before the perfusion. Anesthetized mice were transcardially perfused with saline (0.9%) followed by 10% buffered neutral formalin. Brains were removed and stored in 10% formalin for a day, then transferred to a 30% sucrose solution for cryoprotection. Fixed brain tissues were cut and frozen with a microtome (HM525 NX, Thermo Fisher) in coronal sections (40 µm). To locate tetrode tips, brain sections were stained with cresyl violet (Sigma, USA) and examined under a light microscope (Axioscope 5, Carl Zeiss, Germany) to locate lesions. To assess viral vector expression, sectioned brain slices were examined with a fluorescent microscope (Axioscope 5, Carl Zeiss, Germany) with a CoolLED pE 300 series illumination system. The fluorescence of retrograde tracers was imaged using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Germany).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 (SPSS Inc, USA). For normally distributed samples, an unpaired two-tailed t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni was used to compare means between groups. A binomial proportions test was used to compare the difference between the proportions of the positive and negative groups. To compare the means of two groups with unequal variance, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. A Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post hoc analysis was used for comparison among three groups with unequal variance. To compare changes that occur over time, within a group or between groups, repeated measures ANOVA followed by Bonferroni was used.</p>

<p>This work provides a <bold>valuable</bold> characterization of neural activity in the anterior insular cortex during fear. The data were collected using behavior, single unit recording, and optogenetic control of neural activity. The study is a great starting point on the path to testing hypotheses about bidirectional control of behavior via segregated, anatomically defined output populations, since the authors recorded true neural activity, as opposed to bulk calcium flux, which is often used in this kind of experiment. However, the link between spiking, anatomy, and behavior is <bold>incomplete</bold>, and additional controls are necessary to support the claim for associative learning.</p>

<p>The authors sought to test whether anterior insular cortex neurons increase or decrease firing during fear behavior and freezing, bi-directionally control fear via separate, anatomically defined outputs. Using a fairly simple behavior where mice were exposed to tone-shock pairings, they found roughly equal populations that do indeed either increase or decrease firing during freezing. Next, they sought to test whether these distinct populations may also have distinct outputs. Using retrograde tracers they found that the anterior insular cortex contains non-overlapping neurons which project to the mediodorsal thalamus or amygdala. Mediodorsal thalamus-projecting neurons tended to cluster in deep cortical layers while amygdala-projecting neurons were primarily in more superficial layers. Stimulation of insula-thalamus projection decreased freezing behavior, and stimulation of insula-amygdala projections increased fear behavior. Given that the neurons that increased firing were located in deep layers, that thalamus projections occurred in deep layers, and that stimulation of insula-thalamus neurons decreased freezing, the authors concluded that the increased firing neurons may be thalamus projections. Similarly, given that decreased-firing neurons tended to occur in more superficial layers, that insula-amygdala projections were primarily superficial, and that insula-amygdala stimulation increased freezing behavior, authors concluded that the decreased firing cells may be amygdala projections. The study has several strengths though also some caveats.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The potential link between physiological activity, anatomy, and behavior is well laid out and is an interesting question. The activity contrast between the units that increase/decrease firing during freezing is clear.</p>
<p>It is nice to see the recording of extracellular spiking activity, which provides a clear measure of neural output, whereas similar studies often use bulk calcium imaging, a signal that rarely matches real neural activity even when anatomy suggests it might (see London et al 2018 J Neuro - there are increased/decreased spiking striatal populations, but both D1 and D2 striatal neurons increase bulk calcium).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The link between spiking, anatomy, and behavior requires assumptions/inferences: the anatomically/genetically defined neurons which had distinct outputs and opposite behavioral effects can only be assumed the increased/decreased spiking neurons, based on the rough area of the cortical layer they were recorded.</p>
<p>The behavior would require more control to fully support claims about the associative nature of the fear response (see Trott et al 2022 eLife) - freezing, in this case, could just as well be nonassociative. In a similar vein, fixed intertrial intervals, though common practice in the fear literature, pose a problem for neurophysiological studies. The first is that animals learn the timing of events, and the second is that neural activity is dynamic and changes over time. Thus it is very difficult to determine whether changes in neural activity are due to learning about the tone-shock contingency, timing of the task, simply occur because of time and independently of external events, or some combination of the above.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors aim to understand how neurons in the anterior insular cortex (insula) modulate fear behaviors. They report that the activity of a subpopulation of insula neurons is positively correlated with freezing behaviors, while the activity of another subpopulation of neurons is negatively correlated to the same freezing episodes. They then used optogenetics and showed that activation of anterior insula excitatory neurons during tones predicting a footshock increases the amount of freezing outside the tone presentation, while optogenetic inhibition had no effect. Finally, they found that two neuronal projections of the anterior insula, one to the amygdala and another to the medial thalamus, are increasing and decreasing freezing behaviors respectively. While the study contains interesting and timely findings for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying fear, some points remain to be addressed.</p>
