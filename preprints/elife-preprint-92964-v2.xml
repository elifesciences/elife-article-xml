<title>Abstract</title><p>Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) acts as an energy source, a toxin, and a gasotransmitter across diverse biological contexts. We use the robust locomotory responses of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> to high levels of H<sub>2</sub>S to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying its acute perception and adaptive responses. We find that the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked behavioral response is shaped by multiple environmental factors including oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels and nutritional state, and is modulated by various pathways such as insulin, TGF-β, and HIF-1 signaling, as well as by input from O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons. Prolonged exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S activates HIF-1 signaling, leading to the upregulation of stress-responsive genes, including those involved in H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification. This promotes an adaptive state in which locomotory speed is reduced in H<sub>2</sub>S, while responsiveness to other stimuli is preserved. In mutants deficient in HIF-1 signaling, iron storage, and detoxification mechanisms, animals display a robust initial response but rapidly enter a sleep-like behavior characterized by reduced mobility and diminished responsiveness to subsequent sensory stimuli. Furthermore, while acute production of mitochondria-derived reactive O<sub>2</sub> species (ROS) appears to initiate the avoidance response to H<sub>2</sub>S, persistently high ROS promotes an adaptive state, likely by activating various stress-response pathways, without substantially compromising cellular H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification capacity. Taken together, our study provides comprehensive molecular insights into the mechanisms through which <italic>C. elegans</italic> detects, modulates, and adapts its response to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the late Proterozoic era, the rise in oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) levels eliminated hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) from most habitats. Yet, low O<sub>2</sub> levels, along with high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), can persist in enclosed environments where bacteria actively decompose organic matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Olson &amp; Straub, 2016</xref>). H<sub>2</sub>S can easily permeate biological membranes and interfere with various cellular processes. One of the most detrimental effects of H<sub>2</sub>S is the disruption of cellular respiration by remodeling the mitochondrial electron transport chain and inhibiting cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cooper &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Khan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nicholls &amp; Kim, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Romanelli-Cedrez, Vairoletti, &amp; Salinas, 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>The detection and response to chemical signals are crucial for various organisms to interact effectively with their environment. Animals living in H<sub>2</sub>S-rich environments have evolved mechanisms to either avoid or adapt to these conditions, conferring them survival advantages. Species that encounter periodic increases in H<sub>2</sub>S often possess sensing abilities and exhibit avoidance behaviors. For example, benthic species undertake daily vertical migrations between sulfidic and non-sulfidic waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abel, Koenig, &amp; Davis, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Salvanes, Utne-Palm, Currie, &amp; Braithwaite, 2011</xref>). Certain metazoan species have seized the ecological opportunities presented by H<sub>2</sub>S-rich environments through the development of cellular adaptations. Livebearing fish species, for instance, have evolved COX subunits that are more resistant to H<sub>2</sub>S and more efficient at H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kelley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Pfenninger et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>Free-living nematodes feed on bacteria that thrive in decaying organic matter, such as compost. This complex and dynamic environment, where species like <italic>C. elegans</italic> are commonly found, may exhibit significant fluctuations in H<sub>2</sub>S levels over short distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Adams, Farwell, Pack, &amp; Bamesberger, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Budde &amp; Roth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Morra &amp; Dick, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Patange, Breen, Arsuffi, &amp; Ruvkun, 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Rodriguez-Kabana, Jordan, &amp; Hollis, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Romanelli-Cedrez et al., 2024</xref>). Evidence suggests that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has evolved tolerance to prolonged H<sub>2</sub>S exposure by reprogramming gene expression through H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Powell-Coffman, 2010</xref>), and by developing an H<sub>2</sub>S-resistant electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Romanelli-Cedrez et al., 2024</xref>). In particular, low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S are not only well tolerated but can also be beneficial. For instance, exposure to 50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S has been shown to extend the lifespan and enhance thermotolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fawcett, Hoyt, Johnson, &amp; Miller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman, Heinis, &amp; Miller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miller &amp; Roth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Qabazard et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, endogenous H<sub>2</sub>S production in <italic>C. elegans</italic> modulates its interactions with actinobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Patange et al., 2025</xref>). However, exposure to concentrations exceeding 150 ppm proved lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fawcett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miller, Budde, &amp; Roth, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miller &amp; Roth, 2007</xref>). In addition to long-term adaptive mechanisms, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits an acute behavioral response to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Budde &amp; Roth, 2011</xref>). In this study, we investigated whether and how the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> acutely avoids environments rich in H<sub>2</sub>S, how it adapts at the molecular and physiological levels to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, and how these adaptations alter the avoidance response.</p>

<title><italic>C. elegans</italic> increases locomotory activity in response to acute H<sub>2</sub>S exposure</title>
<p>In response to aversive cues, <italic>C. elegans</italic> initiates a pirouette followed by an increase of its locomotory speed to escape the noxious stimuli. When acutely exposed to 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S, the laboratory N2 strain exhibited an increased locomotory speed and enhanced turning behavior, while generally decreasing the frequency of reversals, as a strategy to escape the noxious stimuli (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1A–C</italic></xref><italic>, Figure 1—Video 1</italic>). The maximum speed was reached after 6–8 minutes in H<sub>2</sub>S and returned to the baseline over a period of approximately 1 hour (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1D</italic></xref>). The reduced locomotory speed after 30 minutes in 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S was reversible when these animals were immediately challenged with another stimulus, such as near-UV light (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref>), suggesting that neuromuscular function remains preserved. The magnitude and dynamics of the H<sub>2</sub>S-induced avoidance responses were concentration-dependent. Under our assay conditions, 50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S did not elicit an acute speed increase, and responses to 75 ppm were variable. In contrast, exposure to 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S consistently triggered a robust and reproducible escape response (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref>), consistent with earlier reports that H<sub>2</sub>S at 50 ppm exerts beneficial effects, while H<sub>2</sub>S at 150 ppm is toxic to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fawcett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miller &amp; Roth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Qabazard et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether low levels of H<sub>2</sub>S might be preferable or even attractive to the animals, we exposed wild type animals to a linear gradient of H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref>; See methods for details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bretscher, Busch, &amp; de Bono, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chang, Chronis, Karow, Marletta, &amp; Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gray et al., 2004</xref>). Animals were allowed to move freely on a thin layer of bacteria within a microfluidic chamber containing an H<sub>2</sub>S gradient ranging from 150 ppm at one end to 0 ppm at the other. As expected, <italic>C. elegans</italic> robustly avoids 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S but does not accumulate at the extreme end of 0 ppm <italic>(</italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1G, H</italic></xref><italic>).</italic> The highest proportion of animals was found in the region with approximately 40 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S. These data suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a potent repellent for <italic>C. elegans</italic> at high concentrations but as an attractant at low levels.</p>

<title>Candidate gene screen identifies signaling pathways required for H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotion</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory response in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we conducted a candidate gene screen for mutants that failed to increase their locomotory speed upon exposure to an acute rise of H<sub>2</sub>S level to 150 ppm. Our analysis prioritized genes that are either known to be, or potentially involved in, sensory responses to gaseous stimuli in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals (<bold><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></bold>). We began by examining mutants affecting globins, guanylate cyclases, and cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels, which are involved in O<sub>2</sub> or CO<sub>2</sub> sensing in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as well as wild isolates and other previously characterized mutants with defective responses to gas stimuli (<bold><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Persson et al., 2009</xref>). Given the essential role of K<sup>+</sup> channels in acute hypoxia sensing in mammals, we also screened all potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) channel mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gao, Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Ortega-Saenz, &amp; Lopez-Barneo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Weir, Lopez-Barneo, Buckler, &amp; Archer, 2005</xref>). To explore how the H<sub>2</sub>S sensory signals were transmitted within the neural circuit, we assayed mutants with defects in ciliogenesis or cilia-mediated signaling, as well as animals deficient in neurotransmission involving classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, or biogenic amines. Finally, considering that mitochondrial function is central to H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification, we included mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) mutants and key factors implicated in H<sub>2</sub>S and superoxide clearance. Together, these functionally diverse categories allowed us to survey a wide spectrum of potential mechanisms contributing to the behavioral response to H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
<p>In the screen, a collection of mutants displayed reduced speed response, whereas only a few exhibited a lack of omega-turn and/or reversal responses to H<sub>2</sub>S (<bold><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></bold>). The reversal inhibition upon H<sub>2</sub>S exposure and its rebound following H<sub>2</sub>S withdrawal appeared to vary substantially across experiments for N2, suggesting that differences in population density, food availability, and animals’ physiological state prior to the assay may matter. Nevertheless, our screen revealed that signaling pathways, including cGMP, insulin and TGF-β signaling, contributed to H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked avoidance (<bold><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></bold>). A naturally occurring variant of the neuropeptide receptor gene <italic>npr-1</italic>, previously implicated in the modulation of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> sensing, also affected locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S (<bold><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></bold>). In addition, mitochondrial components, including those involved in respiration and H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification, played critical roles in triggering and maintaining escape behavior in H<sub>2</sub>S. In contrast, we did not find evidence that globins, K<sup>+</sup> channels, or biogenic amine signaling contributed significantly to the behavioral avoidance to H<sub>2</sub>S (<bold><italic>Supplementary file 1</italic></bold>).</p>

<title>cGMP signaling in ASJ cilia contributes to H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance</title>
<p>One group of mutants exhibiting reduced locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S had defects in ciliogenesis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2A–C</italic></xref>). This group included <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants lacking cilia, <italic>dyf-3</italic> mutants with reduced cilia length, and <italic>dyf-7</italic> mutants in which ciliogenesis occurs but the cilia are not anchored to their sensilla and are not exposed to the external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Heiman &amp; Shaham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Murayama, Toh, Ohshima, &amp; Koga, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Starich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Swoboda, Adler, &amp; Thomas, 2000</xref>). These findings suggest that ciliogenesis and exposure of cilia to the external environment are essential for animals to escape H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. In addition, these mutants exhibited consistently high reversal rate, likely associated with their reduced locomotory speed (<xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A–F</italic></xref>). Cilia-mediated sensory responses often involve the activation of guanylate cyclases and the opening of cGMP-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Ferkey, Sengupta, &amp; L’Etoile, 2021</xref>). We observed significantly attenuated locomotory speed in response to H<sub>2</sub>S in <italic>tax-4</italic> or <italic>tax-2</italic> mutants, which lack key subunits of cilia-enriched cGMP-gated channels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>, E</italic>). In a comprehensive survey of all guanylate cyclase mutants, the <italic>daf-11</italic> strain emerged as the only mutant showing speed response defects in the avoidance of H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>, supplementary file 1</italic>). Similar to the cilia mutants, animals deficient in <italic>daf-11</italic> had low speed, attenuated omega turns, and constantly high reversal rate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). Selective expression of <italic>daf-11</italic> in ASJ neurons, but not in other neurons, partially restored the speed response to acute H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figures 2F</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). In addition, the H<sub>2</sub>S response defect of <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants was also rescued by selective expression of its cDNA in ASJ neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 2G</italic></xref>), suggesting that the receptor guanylate cyclase DAF-11 and the CNG channel TAX-4 act at least partially in ASJ neurons to promote acute avoidance to H<sub>2</sub>S. To validate the role of ASJ neurons in H<sub>2</sub>S responses, we blocked neurotransmission from ASJ using the catalytic domain of <italic>Tetanus Toxin (TeTx</italic>), which impairs neurosecretion by specifically cleaving synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>).

Surprisingly, using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6s to monitor a direct response of ASJ neurons to H<sub>2</sub>S, we observed no H<sub>2</sub>S-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients under any of the tested conditions, whereas CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases were readily detected (<xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). These findings suggest that although ASJ neuronal activity and neurosecretion contribute to the H<sub>2</sub>S responses, ASJ neurons are unlikely to serve as the primary H<sub>2</sub>S sensor.</p>

<title>Starvation modulates H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance</title>
<p>In the candidate gene screen, another set of mutants with reduced speed responses to H<sub>2</sub>S had previously been shown to be defective in response to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008</xref>). Specifically, the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked speed response was reduced in mutants deficient in nutrient-sensitive signaling, including the insulin receptor DAF-2, the TGF-β ligand DAF-7, and the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3A–C</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, mutants lacking other CO<sub>2</sub> response modulators, such as the calcineurin subunits TAX-6 and CNB-1, also failed to respond to H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). In addition to the abolished speed response, we also observed that the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked omega-turn response was nearly abolished in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, and high proportion of animals exhibited persistently high reversal rate regardless of H<sub>2</sub>S stimulation (<xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D– F</xref>).

Given that H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked speed response was modulated by the nutrient-sensitive pathways, we further explored whether the locomotory response to H<sub>2</sub>S was sensitive to the nutrient state.

Compared to the laboratory reference strain N2, wild isolates display robust responses to high O<sub>2</sub> but reduced sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beets et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carrillo, Guillermin, Rengarajan, Okubo, &amp; Hallem, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kodama-Namba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>). It is thought that the unique O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> responses of N2 strain evolved during its domestication on solid media at atmospheric gas concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sterken, Snoek, Kammenga, &amp; Andersen, 2015</xref>). We hypothesized that wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains might also exhibit an attenuated response to H<sub>2</sub>S, and therefore included a set of wild strains in our candidate gene screen. Consistent with this hypothesis, wild isolates including CB4855, CB4856, and CB4858 exhibited reduced locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3E</italic></xref><italic>, Figure 3— figure supplement 1J</italic>).</p>
<p>A naturally occurring variation in the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 predominantly determines the differences in locomotory responses to O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> between the laboratory N2 strain and wild isolates. The NPR-1(215F) variant found in wild isolates is less active than the NPR-1(215V) found in N2 animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">de Bono &amp; Bargmann, 1998</xref>). We wondered whether the variations in the <italic>npr-1</italic> gene also contribute to differences in the acute response to H<sub>2</sub>S. The absence of <italic>npr-1</italic> was sufficient to reduce the speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S, suggesting that active NPR-1 signaling promotes H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3F</italic></xref>). NPR-1(215V) primarily acts within the RMG interneurons to modulate responses to environmental stimuli by inhibiting signal output from these neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 3G</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>).

Furthermore, optogenetic stimulation of RMG interneurons using channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) significantly dampened the locomotory response to H<sub>2</sub>S in N2 animals, suggesting that high RMG activity inhibits H<sub>2</sub>S responses (<xref rid="fig3-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K</xref>).</p>
<p>The perception of 21% O<sub>2</sub> involves the soluble guanylate cyclases GCY-35/GCY-36 and the downstream cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels TAX-4/TAX-2 in the URX, AQR, and PQR O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons, which relay the signals to RMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Busch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheung, Cohen, Rogers, Albayram, &amp; de Bono, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Couto, Oda, Nikolaev, Soltesz, &amp; de Bono, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Persson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Zimmer et al., 2009</xref>).

Consistent with earlier studies, we also observed differential expression of a set of SKN-1 targets in response to chronic H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miller et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Niu et al., 2011</xref>).

Surprisingly, we detected a rapid increase in the expression of genes associated with intracellular H<sub>2</sub>S production, including the methanethiol oxidase-encoding gene <italic>semo-1</italic> and the mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase-encoding gene <italic>mpst-3</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4E, F</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Philipp et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Qabazard et al., 2014</xref>). Elevated expression of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase has similarly been reported in sulfide spring fish, suggesting a conserved response mechanism to H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Kelley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Mathew, Schlipalius, &amp; Ebert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Qabazard et al., 2014</xref>). However, the functional implications of increased expression of H<sub>2</sub>S synthesis genes remains unclear.</p>
<p>When exposed to H<sub>2</sub>S for 12 hours, the differentially expressed genes showed reduced overlap with those identified at earlier time points (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that distinct defense strategies may be employed at various stages of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. Furthermore, substantial overlap was observed between the sets of genes induced by 50 ppm and 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S after 1h or 2h exposure. However, this overlap decreased significantly after 12 hours exposure (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H–J</xref>). Additionally, we noticed that 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S specifically triggered the expression of the HIF-1 regulator <italic>rhy-1</italic> and the HIF-1 target <italic>nhr-57</italic> at all exposure time points, a response that was less pronounced at 50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figures 4E, F</italic></xref><bold><italic>, </italic></bold><xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E, K</xref> and <xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">L</xref>).

<title>Locomotory speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S is modulated by HIF-1-induced detoxification</title>
<p>Given that HIF-1 signaling is robustly activated shortly after H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (<xref rid="fig4-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miller et al., 2011a</xref>), we next sought to determine how HIF-1 signaling might contribute to H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked avoidance response, and began by examining the effects of HIF-1 stabilization. Acclimating animals in 1% O<sub>2</sub> for 12 hours or longer significantly decreased the speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S, indicating that HIF-1 stabilization inhibits the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked avoidance behavior (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref>). To confirm this observation, we examined several mutants with stabilized HIF-1. The conserved proline-4-hydroxylase PHD/EGL-9 and the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein are required for HIF-1 degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kaelin &amp; Ratcliffe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Semenza, 2010</xref>). Disruption of either <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>vhl-1</italic> leads to HIF-1 stabilization under normoxic conditions. Similar to the effect of prolonged hypoxia, both mutants exhibited a markedly reduced locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5B</italic></xref>). Interestingly, the omega-turn and reversal responses to H<sub>2</sub>S were also substantially inhibited in <italic>egl-9</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). In contrast, the locomotory speed response to 1% O<sub>2</sub> remained largely unaffected in <italic>egl-9</italic> deficient animals (<xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting a selective impairment of the H<sub>2</sub>S response. In addition, expressing the non-degradable forms of HIF-1, <italic>hif-1</italic>(P621A or P621G), under the pan-neuronal <italic>unc-14</italic> promoter or under the endogenous <italic>hif-1</italic> promoter, was sufficient to inhibit H<sub>2</sub>S evoked speed responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5C</italic></xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the activation of HIF-1 signaling during prolonged H<sub>2</sub>S or hypoxia exposure mediates an adaptive response associated with reduced behavioral responses to H<sub>2</sub>S, and that HIF-1 stabilization in neurons alone is sufficient to promote this behavioral adaptation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, animals lacking HIF-1 signaling have previously been shown to display increased sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S and become paralyzed rapidly upon exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants exhibited a brief increase in speed upon H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, which rapidly declined to baseline levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5D</italic></xref>). They also displayed a stronger initial omega-turn response and greater inhibition of the reversal rate than WT (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5E, F</italic></xref>), confirming that animals deficient in HIF-1 signaling are sensitized to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. This transient avoidance behavior was also observed in <italic>egl-9; hif-1</italic> and <italic>vhl-1; hif-1</italic> double mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5G, H</italic></xref>), suggesting that this phenotype is linked to the absence of HIF-1 signaling.

Further supporting increased sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S in <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants, the locomotory speed response of <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants to subsequent near-UV light stimulation was nearly abolished after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, whereas <italic>egl-9</italic> mutants and WT animals remained fully responsive <italic>(</italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5I</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. The reduced movement and lack of responsiveness to other stressors in <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants resemble the stress-induced sleep-like behavior previously observed in response to noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Byrne Rodgers &amp; Ryu, 2020</xref>). Prompted by this observation, we next explored whether HIF-1-induced detoxification genes were also required to maintain H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked behavioral responses (<xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similar to <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants, <italic>sqrd-1</italic> and <italic>ethe-1</italic> mutants displayed brief responses to H<sub>2</sub>S, with locomotory activity rapidly returning to baseline levels <italic>(</italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure</italic> 5J, K</xref>, <xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>). However, both mutants responded normally to 1% O<sub>2</sub>, suggesting a specific hypersensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity (<xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the contribution of additional genes whose expression was upregulated in response to H<sub>2</sub>S, including the sulfhydrylase/cysteine synthase-encoding genes <italic>cysl-1</italic>, <italic>cysl-2</italic>, and <italic>cysl-3</italic>, as well as <italic>semo-1</italic>. Disrupting any of these genes phenocopied the responses observed in <italic>hif-1, ethe-1</italic>, or <italic>sqrd-1</italic> mutants, while they displayed normal responses to 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 5L</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig5-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, K–P</xref>). These observations suggest that while the HIF-1-induced H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification system is not essential for the initial sensing of H<sub>2</sub>S, it is required to maintain animals’ locomotory activity in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>

<p>To complement our genetic analysis, we pharmacologically depleted labile irons.

One possibility is that low iron levels compromise H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification capacity, as the detoxification enzyme ETHE-1 requires iron for its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kabil &amp; Banerjee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pettinati, Brem, McDonough, &amp; Schofield, 2015</xref>).

<title>Mitochondrial function modulates H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotion responses</title>
<p>The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is not only the primary target of H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, but is also an essential component of the H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cooper &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Khan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nicholls &amp; Kim, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Romanelli-Cedrez et al., 2024</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that ETC plays a central role in the locomotory response to H<sub>2</sub>S. Indeed, mutating the genes critical for ETC function, including <italic>gas-1</italic>, <italic>clk-1</italic>, <italic>mev-1,</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic>, impaired the H<sub>2</sub>S-evocked speed and reversal responses (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7A–D</italic></xref><italic>, Figure 7— figure supplement 1A–D)</italic>. These data suggest that a functional ETC is required to trigger and support H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked avoidance behavior or that dysfunctional ETC induces an adaptive response to cellular stressors. Consistently, exposing animals to rotenone, an ETC complex I inhibitor, robustly inhibited the speed responses to H<sub>2</sub>S at all time points we tested (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7E</italic></xref>).

However, a 2-hour exposure to rotenone abolished the H<sub>2</sub>S-evocked speed response without increasing the basal locomotory speed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7E</italic></xref>), suggesting that prolonged ETC inhibition may either impair the cellular capacity to support H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked behavioral responses or drive animals’ adaptation to cellular stress and consequently reduce their locomotory response to H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>

All <italic>sod</italic> single mutants exhibited a robust initial response to 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S <italic>(</italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7F, G</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>. Interestingly, the mitochondrial SOD mutants <italic>sod-2</italic> and <italic>sod-3</italic>, as well as <italic>sod-5</italic>, showed an initial burst of locomotory activity followed by a rapid decline in speed in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S <italic>(</italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7F, G</italic></xref><italic>)</italic>, but maintained a high locomotory speed in response to 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig7-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In the quintuple <italic>sod-1; sod-2; sod-3; sod-4; sod-5</italic> mutant, which lacks all superoxide dismutases and presumably accumulates higher ROS levels, the H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked speed and omega-turn responses were nearly abolished, and the proportion of animals exhibiting reversals remained consistently high, a pattern resembling that of <italic>egl-9</italic> and ETC mutants <italic>(</italic><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7G</italic></xref>, <xref rid="fig7-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). Similar to <italic>sod-2</italic> and <italic>sod-3</italic>, the quintuple <italic>sod</italic> mutant exhibited robust speed response to 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the quintuple mutants responded normally to near-UV light after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>—figure supplement 1H)</italic>, indicating that their neuromuscular function remains largely preserved. Therefore, high ROS levels in <italic>sod</italic> mutants do not substantially compromise the detoxification capacity required for survival in H<sub>2</sub>S. Instead, high ROS appears to promote adaptation to H<sub>2</sub>S-induced stress, presumably by activating several stress-responsive pathways such as HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1, and DAF-16/FOXO (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 7H</italic></xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Patten, Germain, Kelly, &amp; Slack, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Animals’ behavior and physiology are profoundly influenced by the environments in which they evolved. The laboratory strain N2, which is adapted to low atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations, robustly avoids both gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Beets et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Carrillo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kodama-Namba et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>). Upon acute exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S above 75 ppm, N2 exhibits an avoidance behavior characterized by reorientation and increased locomotion. This response is significantly reduced in wild isolates. These divergent responses between the laboratory strain and wild isolates are primarily driven by variations in the <italic>npr-1</italic> gene, which encodes a neuropeptide receptor, suggesting that <italic>C. elegans</italic> has undergone rapid evolutionary adaptation to its environment.</p>
<p>The behavioral response to a specific sensory stimulus is usually shaped by an interplay of multiple environmental and physiological cues. We observe that conditions dampening <italic>C. elegans’</italic> response to CO<sub>2</sub> also impair the response to H<sub>2</sub>S. Specifically, the speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S is significantly inhibited at high O<sub>2</sub> levels, and in mutants with defective insulin or TGF-β pathway that signal starvation. However, despite these shared modulation, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S sensing involve distinct molecular mechanisms. For example, CO<sub>2</sub> responses are mediated by the guanylate cyclase GCY-9 in BAG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hallem et al., 2011</xref>), which is dispensable for H<sub>2</sub>S sensing. In addition, acute exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S induces stronger reorientation but delayed acceleration compared to CO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting different sensing and information processing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bretscher et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, even though responses to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S are modulated by overlapping regulatory mechanisms, the two gases are detected by distinct sensors and processed differently.</p>
<p>In a candidate gene survey, we excluded the potential involvement of globins, K<sup>+</sup> channels, biogenic amines, and most guanylate cyclases in H<sub>2</sub>S responses. However, we observed that H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance requires the activity of guanylate cyclase DAF-11 in ASJ neurons, as well as neurosecretion from these neurons. Since the DAF-11 pathway and neurosecretion from ASJ neurons regulate developmental programs that modify sensory functions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Murakami, Koga, &amp; Ohshima, 2001</xref>), it is not surprising that <italic>daf-11</italic> mutants display pleiotropic phenotypes including impaired H<sub>2</sub>S and CO<sub>2</sub> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008</xref>). In addition, we did not detect an H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked calcium transient in ASJ neurons. Therefore, although ASJ neurons and DAF-11 activity are clearly required, the exact sensory neurons, circuits, and molecular triggers mediating acute H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Miller et al., 2011a</xref>), H<sub>2</sub>S exposure substantially alters the gene expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, including those involved in H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification and iron homeostasis pathways. The repression of <italic>ftn-1</italic> and induction of <italic>smf-3</italic> observed during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S depletes intracellular labile iron. Iron is a critical cofactor required for the activity of many enzymes and supports a wide range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Dev &amp; Babitt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hentze, Muckenthaler, &amp; Andrews, 2004</xref>). One important enzyme that requires labile iron as cofactor is PHD/EGL-9, which targets HIF-1 for degradation. Changes in iron availability are therefore expected to modulate EGL-9 activity, which in turn alter the expression of HIF-1-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Liochev, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Myllyharju &amp; Kivirikko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Read, Bentley, Archer, &amp; Dunham-Snary, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Xu &amp; Moller, 2011</xref>). However, ETHE-1, a key H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification enzyme upregulated upon HIF-1 stabilization, also requires iron for its persulfide dioxygenase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Kabil &amp; Banerjee, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Pettinati et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked responses under varying iron availability are determined by the combined effects of labile iron on HIF-1 signaling and on the H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification enzymes, among other factors. For instance, although reduced iron availability in <italic>smf-3</italic> or BP-treated animals may promote the HIF-1 induced detoxification pathways by inactivating EGL-9, the actual enzymatic clearance of H<sub>2</sub>S is impaired due to low ETHE-1 activity. Supporting this, <italic>smf-3</italic> mutants and BP-treated animals display increased sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S, including enhanced initial omega-turn responses and rapid inhibition of locomotion. In contrast, increased iron availability in <italic>ftn-1</italic> mutants or FAC-treated animals likely delays iron depletion during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, preserving ETHE-1 detoxification capacity and postponing the onset of HIF-1-mediated adaptations that are associated with reduced locomotion. This may explain the sustained high locomotory speed observed in <italic>ftn-1</italic> mutants or FAC-treated animals. In the absence of HIF-1, iron supplementation only partially improves the locomotory response to H<sub>2</sub>S, likely because the H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification system including ETHE-1 cannot be transcriptionally induced. The modest effect observed may instead reflect correction of iron deficiency in <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>At concentrations below 50 ppm, H<sub>2</sub>S is well tolerated or even preferred, with beneficial effects such as improved thermotolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Budde &amp; Roth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fawcett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Horsman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Miller &amp; Roth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Qabazard et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, behavioral avoidance is absent below 50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S, suggesting that escape behavior is triggered only when H<sub>2</sub>S is not efficiently detoxified. This led us to hypothesize that animals with enhanced detoxification capacity would show reduced avoidance of otherwise toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Indeed, the speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S is attenuated when the detoxification program is upregulated under conditions of constitutive activation of HIF-1, such as in <italic>egl-9</italic> or <italic>vhl-1</italic> mutants, after prolonged exposure to 1% O<sub>2</sub>, or when HIF-1 signaling is specifically activated in neurons. These observations support the idea that the initial avoidance response to H<sub>2</sub>S is likely driven by acute toxicity, while the subsequent decline in speed reflects a rapid activation of adaptive mechanisms, particularly through stabilization of HIF-1. The fact that wild type animals remain responsive to other stimuli after prolonged H<sub>2</sub>S exposure suggests that reduced locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S reflects active desensitization rather than general paralysis. However, persistently high H<sub>2</sub>S exposure is likely to exhaust cellular defense systems, leading to toxicity and paralysis. By contrast, the rapid loss of locomotion observed in <italic>hif-1</italic> mutants and detoxification-defective mutants is mediated by a mechanism distinct from adaptation. Their loss of responsiveness to other stimuli after H<sub>2</sub>S exposure suggests that these animals likely become sensitized and rapidly intoxicated by H<sub>2</sub>S due to impaired detoxification. Therefore, H<sub>2</sub>S exposure promotes a behavioral program that includes an initial reorientation and acceleration responses followed by a progressive adaptation driven by cellular detoxification processes. A similar behavioral program has been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> during noxious heat exposure, which induces short-term heat avoidance followed by long-lasting cytoprotective adaptation and a gradual reduction in avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Byrne Rodgers &amp; Ryu, 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The interaction of H<sub>2</sub>S with mitochondrial ETC is multifaceted, acting as an electron donor at low concentrations and becoming a potent toxicant at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Szabo et al., 2014</xref>), in part by promoting superoxide generation through complex IV inhibition and reverse electron transport at complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cooper &amp; Brown, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Khan et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Nicholls &amp; Kim, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Romanelli-Cedrez et al., 2024</xref>). We propose that mitochondria play a dual role in H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory avoidance. On one hand, the mitochondrial ETC contributes to H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification and promotes adaptation. On the other hand, toxic levels of H<sub>2</sub>S remodel the ETC, leading to increased ROS production, which may serve as a trigger for the avoidance response. Supporting the idea that acute mitochondrial ROS generation initiates avoidance of high H<sub>2</sub>S levels, short-term rotenone exposure, known to promote mitochondrial ROS formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Ochi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Ramsay &amp; Singer, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zorov et al., 2014</xref>), substantially increases locomotory speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Onukwufor et al., 2022</xref>). Meanwhile, the speed response to high H<sub>2</sub>S is fully suppressed by rotenone. This inhibition could result either from excessive mitochondrial ROS generated by rotenone, which may dampen the H<sub>2</sub>S-triggered ROS spike, or from direct complex I inhibition, which may disrupt other H<sub>2</sub>S signaling processes required to initiate avoidance. However, persistent mitochondrial ROS production appears to suppress high locomotory speed and inhibit responsiveness to H<sub>2</sub>S, as observed after 2-hour rotenone exposure, in mitochondrial ETC mutants, and in animals lacking all superoxide dismutases. One likely explanation is that mitochondrial ROS can activate a variety of stress-responsive pathways, including HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1, and DAF-16/ FOXO signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Patten et al., 2010</xref>), priming animals’ adaptation to prolonged stress rather than causing toxicity. This is supported by the observation that even though SOD-deficient animals do not display strong initial locomotory responses to H<sub>2</sub>S, they remain responsive to other stimuli after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, suggesting that high ROS levels do not compromise general viability or the H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification capacity. Therefore, we favor a model in which mitochondrial ROS exert a biphasic effect on H<sub>2</sub>S-induced avoidance, facilitating H<sub>2</sub>S detection and avoidance under acute conditions, and contributing to locomotory inhibition when it is chronically elevated.</p>
<p>In summary, this study unveils a novel behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic> in their avoidance to H<sub>2</sub>S. The speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S is intricately shaped by environmental context, integrating inputs from other sensory cues such as food availability and O<sub>2</sub> levels. Although we did not identify the specific neural circuit mediating H<sub>2</sub>S signaling, our findings suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S-induced locomotion arises from acute remodeling of mitochondrial ETC and mitochondrial ROS production. We emphasize the vital role of the HIF-1-induced detoxification pathways and iron homeostasis in protecting against H<sub>2</sub>S-induced mitochondrial toxicity. In future work, it will be important to delineate the neural circuits underlying H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory avoidance and to clarify how H<sub>2</sub>S-induced changes in mitochondrial respiration and labile iron pools shape these responses.</p>

<title>Behavioral assays</title>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>S evoked locomotion activity was monitored as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Laurent et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, OP50 bacteria were seeded on the assay plates 16 hours before use. The border of bacterial lawn was removed using a PDMS stamp. For each assay, 25 to 30 day-one adult animals were picked onto assay plates, allowed to settle down for 15 minutes, and subsequently sealed within microfluidic chambers. A syringe pump (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus) was employed to deliver gas mixtures into the microfluidic chamber at a constant flow of 3 ml/min. The rapid switch between different gas mixtures were controlled by Telfon valves coupled with ValveBank Perfusion Controller (AutoMate Scientific). The locomotory activity at different gas mixtures were monitored using a high-resolution camera (FLIR) mounted on a Zeiss Stemi 508 microscope. Videos were captured at a rate of 2 frames per second, starting with a 2-minute recording in 7% O<sub>2</sub>, followed by 10 or 11 minutes in H<sub>2</sub>S, and ending with 7% O<sub>2</sub>. For the long-term recording in H<sub>2</sub>S, video capture commenced with a 2-minute period in 7% O<sub>2</sub>, followed by a duration of 148 minutes in 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S, and concluded with a final 2-minute interval in 7% O<sub>2</sub>. For each strain or condition, 3 to 4 replicates were performed.</p>
<p>Near-UV light experiments were conducted to assess whether animals remained responsive following a 30-minute incubation in 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S balanced with 7% O<sub>2</sub>. For each experiment, 6-minute videos were recorded. The first 2 minutes captured the baseline locomotion of the animals under white light, followed by 2 minutes of exposure to near-UV light (435 nm, 0.7 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), and concluded with 2 minutes of white light. 3 to 4 replicates were performed, with approximately 15 animals recorded per replicate.</p>
<p>The H<sub>2</sub>S gradient experiment was performed in a PDMS chamber connected to a pump delivering gas at 0.5 ml/min. To establish a gradient ranging from 150 ppm to 0 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S, we pumped 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S balanced with 7% O<sub>2</sub> into one side and 7% O<sub>2</sub> into the opposite side. After 25 minutes, the number of animals in each of the 5 sections was counted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><italic>Figure 1G</italic></xref>). Four replicates were performed, each using 30 day-one adult animals.</p>
<p>To assess the effects of rotenone on H<sub>2</sub>S evoked locomotory response, day-one adult animals were subjected to 10 μM rotenone for 10min, 30min, 1 hour and 2 hours on the drug containing plates. Subsequently, the rotenone-treated animals were assayed on the standard assay plates without the drug. To explore the impact of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) (F5879, Sigma-Aldrich) and 2,2′-Bipyridyl (BP) (D216305, Sigma-Aldrich) on behavioral response to H<sub>2</sub>S, L4 animals were exposed to 100 μM FAC or 5 mg/ml BP for 16 hours in the presence of bacterial food. The FAC or BP treated animals were assayed on FAC or BP containing plates, respectively.</p>
<p>Optogenetic experiments were performed as previously outlined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Transgenic L4 animals were exposed to 100 μM all-trans retinal (ATR) (R2500, Sigma) in the dark for 16 hours. The ATR-fed animals were assayed with the illumination of 70 μW/mm<sup>2</sup> blue light during the whole assay period. Blue light was emitted from an ultra-high-power LED lamp (UHP-MIC-LED-460, Prizmatix), and the light intensity was determined using a PM50 Optical Power Meter (ThorLabs). To minimize the effect of transmitted light on the transgenic animals, a long-pass optical filter was used to eliminate the lights with short wavelengths during picking. All videos of behavioral analysis were analyzed using a home-made MATLAB program Zentracker (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wormtracker/zentracker">https://github.com/wormtracker/zentracker</ext-link>).

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript explores behavioral responses of C. elegans to hydrogen sulfide, which is known to exert remarkable effects on animal physiology in a range of contexts. The possibility of genetic and precise neuronal dissection of responses to H2S motivates the study of responses in C. elegans. The revised manuscript does not seem to have significantly addressed what was lacking in the initial version.</p>
<p>The authors have added further characterization of possible ASJ sensing of H2S by calcium imaging but ASJ does not appear to be directly involved. Genetic and parallel analysis of O2 and CO2 responsive pathways do not reveal further insights regarding potential mechanisms underlying H2S sensing. Gene expression analysis extends prior work. Finally, the authors have examined how H2S-evoked locomotory behavioral responses are affected in mutants with altered stress and detoxification response to H2S, most notably hif-1 and egl-9. These data, while examining locomotion, are more suggestive that observed effects on animal locomotion are secondary to altered organismal toxicity as opposed to specific behavioral responedse</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript provides a wide range of intriguing observations, but mechanistic insight or a synthesis of disparate data is lacking.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors establish a behavioral paradigm for avoidance of H2S and conduct a large candidate screen to identify genetic requirements. They follow up by genetically dissecting a large number of implicated pathways - insulin, TGF-beta, oxygen/HIF-1, and mitochondrial ROS, which have varied effects on H2S avoidance. They additionally assay whole-animal gene expression changes induced by varying concentrations and durations of H2S exposure.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The implicated pathways are tested extensively through mutants of multiple pathway molecules. The authors address previous reviewer concerns by directly testing the ability of ASJ to respond to H2S via calcium imaging. This allows the authors to revise their previous conclusion and determine that ASJ does not directly respond to H2S and likely does not initiate the behavioral response.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Despite the authors focus on acute perception of H2S, I don't think the experiments tell us much about perception. I think they indicate pathways that modulate the behavior when disrupted, especially because most manipulations used broadly affect physiology on long timescales. For instance, genetic manipulation of ASJ signaling, oxygen sensing, HIF-1 signaling, mitochondrial function, as well as starvation are all expected to constitutively alter animal physiology, which could indirectly modulate responses to H2S. The authors rule out effects on general locomotion in some cases, but other physiological changes could relatively specifically modulate the H2S response without being involved in its perception.</p>
<p>I am actually not convinced that H2S is directly perceived by the C. elegans nervous system at all. As far as I can tell, the avoidance behavior could be a response to H2S-induced tissue damage rather than the gas itself.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper sets out to achieve a deeper understanding of the effects of hydrogen sulfide on C. elegans behavior and physiology, with a focus on behavior, detection mechanism(s), physiological responses, and detoxification mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper takes full advantage of the experimental tractability of C. elegans, with thorough, welldesigned genetic analyses.</p>
<p>Some evidence suggests that H<sub>2</sub>S may be directly detected by the ASJ sensory neurons.  The paper provides interesting and convincing evidence for complex interactions between responses to different gaseous stimuli, particularly an antagonistic role between H<sub>2</sub>S and O2 detection/response.  Intriguing roles for mitochondria and iron homeostasis are identified, opening the door to future studies to better understand the roles of these components and processes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The claim that worms' behavioral responses to H<sub>2</sub>S are mediated by direct detection is incompletely supported. While a role for the chemosensory neuron ASJ is implicated, it remains unclear whether this reflects direct detection. Other possibilities, including indirect effects of ASJ and the guanylyl cyclase daf-11 on O2 responses, are also consistent with the authors' data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment and agree that the role of ASJ neurons in H<sub>2</sub>S detection was not clear. We included new experiments and revised our text to make it clearer.</p>
<p>Since our initial analyses suggest a role of ASJ neurons in H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory responses (Figure 2F and G), We thought that this would offer us a starting point to dissect the neuronal circuit involved in H<sub>2</sub>S responses. Expression of the tetanus toxin catalytic domain in ASJ, which blocks neurosecretion, inhibited H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory speed responses (Figure 2H), suggesting that neurosecretion from ASJ promotes H<sub>2</sub>S-evocked response (Lines 162–165). We then performed calcium imaging of ASJ neurons in response to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. However, while we observed CO<sub>2</sub>-evoked calcium transients in ASJ using GCaMP6s, we did not detect any calcium response to H<sub>2</sub>S, under several conditions, including animals on food, off food, and with different H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations and exposure times (Figure2—Figure supplement 2E and F) (Lines 166–170). Since signaling from ASJ neurons regulates developmental programs that modify sensory functions in C. elegans (Murakami et al., 2001), the involvement of ASJ neurons is not specific to H<sub>2</sub>S and ASJ neurons are unlikely to serve as the primary H<sub>2</sub>S sensor (Discussed in Line 449–458). Therefore, the exact sensory neuron, circuit and molecular triggers mediating acute H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Our subsequent investigation on mitochondrial components suggests that a burst of mitochondrial ROS production may be the trigger for H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance, as transient exposure to rotenone substantially increases baseline locomotory speed (Figure 7E) (Line 391–396). However, to initiate avoidance behavior to H<sub>2</sub>S, mitochondrial ROS could potentially target multiple neurons and cellular machineries, making it challenging to pinpoint specific sites of action. Nevertheless, we agree that further dissection of the neural circuits and mitochondrial signaling in H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance will be important and should be explored in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The role of H<sub>2</sub>S-mediated damage in behavioral responses, particularly when detoxification pathways are disrupted, remains unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment and fully agree with the concern raised. The same issue was also noted by the other reviewers. We agree that decreased locomotory responses in H<sub>2</sub>S-sensitized animals can arise from distinct causes, either systemic toxicity or behavioral adaptation, and distinguishing between these is critical. We have included new experiments and revised the text to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that increased initial omega turns and a rapid loss of locomotion in hif-1 and detoxification-defective mutants including sqrd-1 and ethe-1 likely reflect an enhanced sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity due to their failure to induce appropriate adaptative responses (Figure 5D–F, Figure 5J–L, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1F–P).  Supporting this, hif-1 mutants become less responsive to unrelated stimuli (near-UV light) after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I).</p>
<p>In contrast, egl-9 and SOD-deficient animals show reduced initial omega-turn and reduced speed responses (Figure 5B, Figure 7G, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1A and B, and Figure 7—Figure supplement 1F and G), although both egl-9 and sod mutants respond normally to the other stimuli prior or after H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1C, and Figure 7—Figure supplement 1H). Since disrupting egl-9 stabilizes HIF-1 and upregulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cellular defense against H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, the enhanced detoxification capacity in egl-9 mutants likely increases animals’ tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>S, thereby reducing avoidance to otherwise toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Similarly, persistently high ROS in SOD deficient animals activates a variety of stress-responsive signaling pathways, including HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1 and DAF-16/ FOXO signaling (Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021; Patten et al., 2010), facilitating cellular adaptation to redox stress and reducing animals’ responsiveness to toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Taken together, these findings support the view that reduced locomotory speed during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure can arise from distinct mechanisms: early systemic toxicity in hif-1 and detoxificationdefective mutants, versus enhanced cellular adaptation in egl-9 and SOD mutants. We have integrated the relevant information across the result section and discussed this in Lines 485-536.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The findings of the paper are somewhat disjointed, such that a clear picture of the relationships between H<sub>2</sub>S detection, detoxification mechanisms, mitochondria, and iron does not emerge from these studies. Most importantly, the relative roles of H<sub>2</sub>S detection and integration, vs. general and acute mitochondrial crisis, in generating behavioral responses are not convincingly resolved.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that our presentation did not fully connect different findings into a cohesive picture. To address this, we have acquired new data, and revised the abstract, results and discussion sections to clarify two phases of H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked responses: an initial avoidance behavior upon H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, followed by a later phase of adaption and detoxification when the escape is not successful.</p>
<p>In brief, we began with the basic characterization of H<sub>2</sub>S-induced locomotory speed response, followed by a candidate gene screen to identify key molecules and pathways involved in initial speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S. Subsequently, we focused on three major intersecting pathways that contributed to the acute behavioral response to H<sub>2</sub>S. These include cGMP signaling, which led to the identification of ASJ neurons; nutrient-sensitive pathways that modulate behavioral responses to both H<sub>2</sub>S and CO2; and O2sensing signaling, whose activation inhibits responses to H<sub>2</sub>S. However, the molecules and neurons in these pathways, including ASJ, likely play modulatory roles and are unlikely to serve as the primary H<sub>2</sub>S sensors. Our subsequent analysis, however, suggests that mitochondria play a critical role in triggering avoidance behavior upon H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. Brief treatment with rotenone, a potent inducer of ROS, led to marked increase in locomotory speed (Figure 7E). This suggests the possibility that a burst of ROS production triggered toxic levels of H<sub>2</sub>S (Jia et al., 2020) may initiate the avoidance behavior.</p>
<p>When the initial avoidance fails, H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification programs are induced as a long-term survival strategy. The induction of detoxification programs appears to enhance tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure and contributes to the gradual decrease of locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S. We now provide a clearer image of how different pathways modulate H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification and adaptation (see our responses to other comments). Briefly, mutants defective in detoxification, such as hif-1 and other detoxification-defective mutants, showed stronger initial omega-turn response and a rapid loss of locomotion. This loss of locomotion is likely caused by early cellular toxicity as the mutants failed to respond to other unrelated stimuli (nearUV light) after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I). Likewise, smf-3 mutants and BP-treated animals were hypersensitive to H<sub>2</sub>S (Figure 6D and E, and Figure 6—Figure supplement 1G and I), likely due to impaired H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification under low iron conditions, as iron is a co-factor required for the activity of the H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification enzyme ETHE-1 (Figure 5K and Figure 5—Figure supplement 1E).</p>
<p>In contrast, reduced locomotion and response in other contexts such as egl-9 mutants and SODdeficient animals reflect H<sub>2</sub>S-induced adaptive mechanism rather than toxicity as they remain responsive to the other stimuli after H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. Since disrupting egl-9 stabilizes HIF-1 and upregulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cellular defense against H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, the enhanced detoxification capacity in egl-9 mutants likely increases animals’ tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>S, thereby reducing avoidance to otherwise toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Similarly, persistently high ROS in SOD deficient animals activates a variety of stress-responsive signaling pathways, including HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1 and DAF-16/ FOXO signaling (Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021; Patten et al., 2010), facilitating cellular adaptation to redox stress and reducing animals’ responsiveness to toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Therefore, different animals decline their locomotory speed to the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S through distinct mechanisms. We have integrated the relevant information across the result section and discussed this in Lines 485-536.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>H<sub>2</sub>S is a gas that is toxic to many animals and causes avoidance in animals such as C. elegans. The authors show that H<sub>2</sub>S increases the frequency of turning and the speed of locomotion. The response was shown to be modulated by a number of neurons and signaling pathways as well as by ambient oxygen concentrations. The long-term adaptation involved gene expression changes that may be related to iron homeostasis as well as the homeostasis of mitochondria.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors provide many pieces that will be important for solving how H<sub>2</sub>S signals through neuronal circuits to change gene expression and physiological programs. The experiments rely mostly on a behavioral assay that measures the increase of locomotion speed upon exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S. This assay is then combined with manipulations of environmental factors, different wild-type strains, and mutants. The mutants analyzed were obtained as candidates from the literature and from transcriptional profiling that the authors carried out in worms that were exposed to H<sub>2</sub>S. These studies imply several genetic signaling pathways, some neurons, and metabolism-related factors in the response to H<sub>2</sub>S. Hence the data provided should be useful for the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the supportive comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>On the other hand, many important aspects of the underlying mechanisms remain unsolved and the reader is left with many loose ends. For example, it is not clear how H<sub>2</sub>S is actually sensed, how sensory neurons are activated and signal to downstream circuits, and what the role of ciliated and RMG neurons is in this circuit. It remains unclear how signals lead to gene expression and physiological changes such as metabolic rewiring. Solving all this would clearly be beyond the scope of a single manuscript. Yet, the manuscript also does not focus on understanding one of these central aspects and rather is all over the place, which makes it harder to understand for readouts that are not in this core field. Multiple additional methods and approaches exist to dig deeper into these mechanisms in the future, such as neuronal calcium imaging, optogenetics, and metabolic analysis. To generate a story that will be interesting to a broad readership substantial additional experimentation would be required. Further, in the current manuscript, it is often difficult to understand the rationales of the experiments, why they were carried out, and how to place them into a context. This could be improved in terms of documentation, narration/explanation, and visualization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment, which has also been raised by the other reviewers. We agree that our initial submission was poorly presented. We also acknowledge the fact that some aspects, such as detailed neural circuit and sensory transduction, still remain unresolved. We have now included additional experiments and revised the manuscript to clarify the logic of our experiments, provided better context for our findings, and improved both the narrative flow and data visualization to make the manuscript more accessible to readers. We now provide a clearer image of how different pathways interact to modulate the initial avoidance response, and the H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification and behavioral habituation during prolonged H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. The following response is similar to the one for reviewer #1.</p>
<p>In brief, we began with the basic characterization of H<sub>2</sub>S-induced locomotory speed response, followed by a candidate gene screen to identify key molecules and pathways involved in initial speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S.

This suggests the possibility that a burst of ROS production triggered toxic levels of H<sub>2</sub>S (Jia et al., 2020) may initiate the avoidance behavior.</p>

The manuscript is well-written in communicating the complex physiology around C. elegans behavioral responses to H<sub>2</sub>S and in appropriately citing prior and related relevant work.</p>
<p>There are three parts to the manuscript.</p>
<p>In the first, an immediate behavioral response-increased locomotory rate-upon exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S is characterized. The experimental conditions are critical, and data are obtained from exposure of animals to 150ppm H<sub>2</sub>S at 7% O2. The authors provide evidence that this is a chemosensory response to H<sub>2</sub>S, showing a requirement for genes encoding components of the cilia apparatus and implicating a role for tax-4 and daf-11. Neuron-specific rescue in the ASJ neurons suggests the ASJ neurons contribute to the response to H<sub>2</sub>S. One caveat is that previous work has shown that the dauer-constitutive phenotype of daf-11 mutants can be suppressed by ASJ ablation, suggesting that there may be pervasive changes in animal nervous system signaling that are ASJ-dependent in daf-11 mutants, which may indirectly alter chemosensory responses to H<sub>2</sub>S. More direct methods to assess whether ASJ senses H<sub>2</sub>S, e.g. using calcium imaging, would better assess a direct role for the ASJ neurons in a behavioral response to H<sub>2</sub>S. The authors also point out interesting parallels between the response to H<sub>2</sub>S and CO2 though provide some genetic data separating the two responses. Importantly, the authors note that when aerotaxis (O2sensing and movement) in the presence of bacterial food is intact, as in npr-1 215F animals, the response to H<sub>2</sub>S is abrogated. Mutation in gcy-35 in the npr-1 215F background restores the H<sub>2</sub>S chemosensory response.</p>
<p>There is a second part of the paper that conducts transcriptional profiling of the response to H<sub>2</sub>S that corroborates and extends prior work in this area.</p>
<p>The final part of the paper is the most intriguing, but for me, also the most problematic. The authors examine how H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory behavioral responses are affected in mutants defective in the stress and detoxification response to H<sub>2</sub>S, most notably hif-1. Prior genetic studies have established the pathways leading to HIF-1 activation/stabilization, as well as potential downstream mechanisms. The authors conduct logical genetic analysis to complement studies of the hif-1 mutant and in part motivated by their transcriptional profiling studies, examine the role of iron sequestration/free iron in the locomotory response to H<sub>2</sub>S, and further speculate on how the behavior of mutants defective in mitochondrial function might be affected by exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
<p>In some regard, this part of the manuscript is interesting because the analysis begins to connect how the behavior of an animal to a toxic compound is affected by mutations that affect sensitivity to the toxic compound. However, what is unclear is what is being studied at this point. In the context, of noting that H<sub>2</sub>S at 150ppm is known to be lethal, its addition to mutants clearly sensitized to its effects would be anticipated to have pervasive effects on animal physiology and nervous system function. The authors note that the continued increased locomotion of wild-type animals upon H<sub>2</sub>S exposure might be due to the byproducts of detoxification or the detrimental effects of H<sub>2</sub>S. The latter explanation seems much more likely, in which case what one may be observing is the effects of general animal sickness, or even a bit more specifically, neuronal dysfunction in the presence of a toxic compound, on locomotion. As such, what is unclear is what conclusions can be taken away from this part of the work.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unclear significance and experimental challenges regarding the study of locomotory responses to animals sensitized to the toxic effects of H<sub>2</sub>S under exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment, which has also been raised by the other reviewers. We agree that our initial submission left several important questions open, and we acknowledge the fact that some aspects, such as detailed neural circuit and sensory transduction, still remain unresolved. Nevertheless, we acquired new data and revised our text, aiming to clarify the distinct mechanisms underlying the reduced locomotion in different mutants during prolonged H<sub>2</sub>S exposure.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that increased initial omega turns and a rapid loss of locomotion in hif-1 and detoxification-defective mutants including sqrd-1 and ethe-1 likely reflect an enhanced sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity due to their failure to induce appropriate adaptative responses (Figure 5D–F, Figure 5J–L, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1F–P).  Supporting this, hif-1 mutants become less responsive to unrelated stimuli (near-UV light) after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I).</p>
<p>In contrast, egl-9 and SOD-deficient animals show reduced initial reorientation and reduced speed responses (Figure 5B, Figure 7G, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1A and B, and Figure 7—Figure supplement 1F and G), although both egl-9 and sod mutants respond normally to the other stimuli prior or after H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1C, and Figure 7—Figure supplement 1H). Since disrupting egl-9 stabilizes HIF-1 and upregulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cellular defense against H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, the enhanced detoxification capacity in egl-9 mutants likely increases animals’ tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>S, thereby reducing avoidance to otherwise toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Similarly, constant high ROS in SOD deficient animals activates a variety of stress-responsive signaling pathways, including HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1 and DAF-16/ FOXO signaling (Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021; Patten et al., 2010), facilitating cellular adaptation to redox stress and reducing animals’ responsiveness to toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Taken together, these findings support the view that reduced locomotory speed during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure can arise from distinct mechanisms: early systemic toxicity in hif-1 and detoxification-defective mutants, versus enhanced cellular adaptation in egl-9 and SOD mutants. We have integrated the relevant information across the result section and discussed this in Lines 485-536.</p>

<p>To better substantiate a role for H<sub>2</sub>S detection, it would be useful for the authors to image Ca responses to H<sub>2</sub>S in ASJ in WT and unc-13, and to rule out the possibility that the requirement for daf-11 in ASJ reflects a role in O2 rather than H<sub>2</sub>S detection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As suggested, we performed calcium imaging of ASJ neurons using GCaMP6s. As previously described, 3% CO<sub>2</sub> evoked a calcium transient in ASJ (Figure 2—figure supplement 2F). To investigate whether H<sub>2</sub>S evoked a calcium transient in ASJ neurons, we tested several conditions, including animals on food or off food, with different H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations (~75 or ~150ppm), and different exposure time (4 or 8 mins). However, we did not detect a calcium response to H<sub>2</sub>S in ASJ under any of the conditions tested (Figure2—figure supplement 2E) (Lines 166–168). Given that neuronspecific rescue of daf-11 or tax-4 mutants pointed to a role of ASJ neurons in promoting H<sub>2</sub>S responses, we sought to determine how ASJ neurons were involved. Expression of the tetanus toxin catalytic domain in ASJ neurons, which blocks neurosecretion, inhibited H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory speed responses (Figure 2H), similar to the phenotypes observed in daf-11 and daf-7 mutants (Figure 2C and D) (Lines 162–165). These results confirm that ASJ activity and neurosecretion contribute to the H<sub>2</sub>S responses, although ASJ is unlikely to serve as the primary H<sub>2</sub>S sensor. One potential explanation is that DAF-7 released by ASJ controls the starvation program, which in turn modulates the animal’s response to H<sub>2</sub>S. We also discussed this in Lines 449–458.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The paper would be significantly strengthened by testing the possibility (as the authors acknowledge in lines 348-52) that disruption of detoxification mechanisms reduces sustained behavioral responses to H<sub>2</sub>S because of physiological damage. Authors use acute exposure to high O2 for this purpose earlier in the paper, but not to probe the consequences of loss of hif-1 and detoxification factors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion. As the reviewer highlighted, we attributed the brief locomotory speed responses to H<sub>2</sub>S observed in hif-1 mutants to the lack of detoxification response, leading to the rapid intoxication of the animals. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, we observed that hif-1 and the detoxification mutants displayed a stronger initial reorientation response (omega turns) and a more rapid decline in speed and reversals compared to wild type (Figure 5 D–F). Second, to test if hif-1 mutants were indeed more susceptible to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, we exposed WT and hif-1 animals to H<sub>2</sub>S for 30 mins and subsequently tested their ability to respond to near-UV light. Unlike WT animals, the speed response to near-UV light was inhibited in hif-1 mutants (Figure 5I), suggesting that exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S for 30 min causes a stronger toxicity in animals deficient of HIF-1 signaling. Third, hif-1 and detoxification mutants displayed a sustained high speed in response to 1% O<sub>2</sub> , suggesting the specific impairment of H<sub>2</sub>S response. The data were presented in Lines 318–347, and were further discussed this in Lines 485–508.</p>

<p>To better understand whether mitochondrial damage has a role in H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked behavior, it might be useful for the authors to determine whether general ROS response pathways are important for H<sub>2</sub>S behavioral responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. As suggested, we investigated whether ROS detoxification pathways contribute to H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory speed responses by analyzing mutants in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) family. These experiments, together with other observations, suggest that mitochondrial ROS play a dual role in H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotion. The relevant results were presented in Lines 401–425, and were further discussed in Lines 509–536.</p>
<p>First, we found that increased mitochondrial ROS formation, either induced pharmacologically by rotenone or genetically in mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) mutants (Ishii et al., 2013; Ochi et al., 2016; Ramsay &amp; Singer, 1992; Yang &amp; Hekimi, 2010; Zorov, Juhaszova, &amp; Sollott, 2014), suppressed the behavioral response to toxic H<sub>2</sub>S (Figure 7A–E). This indicates that mitochondrial ROS plays a significant role in H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked responses. One likely explanation is that high ROS formation may dampen the H<sub>2</sub>S-triggered ROS spike, or may impair other H<sub>2</sub>S signaling processes required to initiate avoidance. Second, consistent with previous reports (Onukwufor et al., 2022), we observed that shortterm rotenone exposure (&lt;1 hour) significantly increased baseline locomotory speed. Given that toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels promote ROS formation (Jia et al., 2020), our findings suggest that acute mitochondrial ROS production by toxic levels of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure may serve as a trigger for the avoidance response.</p>
<p>In contrast, animals with sustained mitochondrial ROS production do not have an increased baseline locomotory speed. This effect was observed after 2 hours of rotenone exposure, in mitochondrial ETC mutants, and in animals lacking all SOD enzymes (Figures 7A–K). A likely explanation for the reduced basal locomotory speed during sustained mitochondrial ROS production is the activation of ROSresponsive signaling pathways including HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1, and DAF-16/FOXO (Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021; Patten, Germain, Kelly, &amp; Slack, 2010), which may promote adaptation to prolonged oxidative stress (Figure 7H). Notably, unlike hif-1 mutants, SOD-deficient animals remained as responsive as WT to other stimuli after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 7—figure supplement 1H), indicating that elevated ROS levels do not compromise overall viability or the ability to detoxify H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results support a model in which mitochondrial ROS exerts a biphasic effect on H<sub>2</sub>S-induced avoidance. It enhances detection and avoidance under acute stress but contributes to locomotory suppression when ROS levels remain elevated chronically.</p>

<p>The way the manuscript is presented could be improved without much effort by rewriting/editing. For the reader, it is hard at present to understand the rationales of the experiments, why they were carried out, and how to place them into a context. This could be improved on three levels:</p>
<p>(1) Documentation</p>
<p>(2) Narration/Explanation</p>
<p>(3) Visualization</p>
<p>(1) Documentation</p>
<p>Not all of the results in the text are well documented. The results should be described with more details in the written text and improved documentation and quantification of the results. Example:</p>
<p>Turning behavior is mentioned as an important aspect of the response to H<sub>2</sub>S. There is no citation given but this effect is not well documented. The authors image the animals and could provide video footage of the effect, could quantify eg turning/pirouettes, and provide the data. At the moment the manuscript largely relies on measuring the increase in speed, but the reader is left wondering what other behavioral effects occur and how this is altered in all of the mutant and other conditions tested. Just quantifying speed reduces the readout and seems like an oversimplification to characterize the behavioral response.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for this comment. We now provide a video footage of the H<sub>2</sub>S effects (Figure 1—Video 1). As suggested, we analyzed the recordings to extract reorientation (omega-turns) and reversals. These analyses are now included in the Supplemental file 1 with representative panels displayed in Figure 5 and supplements to Figures 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. Even though the mutant effects on omega-turns were often subtle, and reversal responses showed considerable variability (likely due to differences in population density, food availability, or animals’ physiological state prior to the assay), this analysis has proven valuable for distinguishing mutants that exhibit adaptation from those that display hypersensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity. For instance, although both SOD-deficient and BP-treated animals failed to increase their locomotory speed in H<sub>2</sub>S (Figure 6E and Figure 7G), they exhibited distinct omega-turn responses (Figure 6—figure supplement 1I and Figure 7—figure supplement 1F), suggesting that different mechanisms likely underlie the locomotory defects of these two animals. We have integrated the omega-turn and reversal data into the text and discussed under relevant contexts.</p>

<p>Generally, the description of the results part is very brief and it is often not clear why a certain experiment was carried out and how.

<p>Line 97ff: The authors performed a candidate screen yet it is not described why which genes were chosen. Are there also pathways that were tested that turned out to not be involved?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. To address this, we have added a new section, explaining the rationale for selecting genes and pathways in our candidate screen. Briefly, we focused on genes known or predicted to be involved in sensory responses to gaseous stimuli in C. elegans and mammals, including globins and guanylate cyclases (21% O<sub>2</sub> sensing), potassium channels (acute hypoxia), and nutrientsensitive pathways (CO<sub>2</sub> responses). We also included mutants defective in sensory signal transduction and neurotransmission. In addition, mitochondrial mutants were analyzed because mitochondria play a central role in H<sub>2</sub>S detoxification. The pathways that contributed to the acute H<sub>2</sub>S response included cGMP, insulin, and TGF-β signaling, as well as mitochondrial components. In contrast, globins, potassium channels, and biogenic amine signaling did not appear to play significant roles under our assay conditions. The results of the candidate screen are described in Lines 106–138 and summarized in Supplementary File 1.</p>

<p>nhr-49 appears suddenly in the results part and it is not clear why it was tested and how the result links. Is nhr-49 a key transcription factor that is activated by H<sub>2</sub>S sensory or physiological response, and does it control the signaling or protective changes induced by H<sub>2</sub>S?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. As suggested, we revised the text to present the information more clearly. In our candidate gene screen, a set of mutants exhibiting reduced speed responses to H<sub>2</sub>S has previously been shown to be defective in response to CO<sub>2</sub> stimulation (Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008). These included animals deficient in nutrient-sensitive pathways, including insulin, TGF-beta, and NHR49, which were reported by Sternberg’s lab to exhibit dampened responses to CO<sub>2</sub> (Hallem &amp; Sternberg, 2008) (Lines 173–179). We also included a simply cartoon to further illustrate this (Figure 3C).</p>
<p>The nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 has been implicated in a variety of stress responses, including starvation (Van Gilst, Hadjivassiliou, &amp; Yamamoto, 2005), bacterial pathogen (Naim et al., 2021; Wani et al., 2021), and hypoxia (Doering et al., 2022). The nhr-49 mutants exhibited a rapid decline in locomotory speed during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure, implicating a role in sustaining high speed in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>S. Furthermore, we observed that fmo-2, a well-characterized target gene of NHR-49, was significantly upregulated after 1 hour of exposure to 50 and 150 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S (Supplementary file 2), suggesting that NHR-49 signaling is rapidly activated by H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. Exactly how NHR-49 contributes to H<sub>2</sub>S response requires further investigation.</p>

<p>Adding a model/cartoon summary that describes the pathways tested and their interaction would be helpful in some of the figures for the reader to keep an overview of the pathways that were tested.

<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added a series of models/cartoons to illustrate the different pathways and their interactions.

<p>Introduction and line 93: The authors mention that 50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S has beneficial effects on lifespan yet does not have a detectable phenotype.&quot; Are there any concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S that cause attraction of C. elegans and what is the preferred range if it exists? Could this be measured in an H<sub>2</sub>S gradient?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. We performed an H<sub>2</sub>S gradient assay, which suggests that wild type animals are attracted toward low concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>S around 40 ppm (Figure 1G and H) (Lines 95–104). These results suggest that H<sub>2</sub>S acts as a strong repellent for C. elegans at high concentrations but as an attractant at low levels. This dual role may be ecologically relevant, as wild C. elegans lives in complex and dynamic environments where H<sub>2</sub>S levels likely fluctuate over short distances (Adams, Farwell, Pack, &amp; Bamesberger, 1979; Budde &amp; Roth, 2011; Morra &amp; Dick, 1991; Patange, Breen, Arsuffi, &amp; Ruvkun, 2025; Rodriguez-Kabana, Jordan, &amp; Hollis, 1965; Romanelli-Cedrez, Vairoletti, &amp; Salinas, 2024).</p>

<p>More work could be conducted establishing the neuronal circuitry involved in the initial, tractable response to H<sub>2</sub>S.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. Since our initial analyses suggest a role of ASJ neurons in H<sub>2</sub>S-evoked locomotory responses (Figure 2F and G), We thought that this would offer us an entry point to dissect the neuronal circuit involved in H<sub>2</sub>S responses. Expression of the tetanus toxin catalytic domain in ASJ, which blocks neurosecretion, inhibited H<sub>2</sub>S evoked locomotory responses (Figure 2H), suggesting that neurosecretion from ASJ promotes the speed response to H<sub>2</sub>S (Lines 162– 165). We then performed calcium imaging of ASJ neurons in response to H<sub>2</sub>S exposure. However, while we observed CO<sub>2</sub> -evoked calcium transients in ASJ using GCaMP6s, we did not detect any calcium response to H<sub>2</sub>S, under several conditions, including animals on food, off food, and with different H<sub>2</sub>S concentrations and exposure times (Figure2—Figure supplement 2E and 2F) (Lines 166–168). Since signaling from ASJ neurons regulates developmental programs that modify sensory functions in C. elegans, including CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> responses (Murakami, Koga, &amp; Ohshima, 2001), the involvement of ASJ neurons is not specific to H<sub>2</sub>S responses and ASJ neurons are unlikely to serve as a primary H<sub>2</sub>S sensor (Discussed in Line 449–458). Therefore, the exact sensory neuron, circuit and molecular triggers mediating acute H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance behavior remain to be elucidated.</p>
<p>Our subsequent investigation on mitochondrial components suggests that a burst of mitochondrial ROS production may be the trigger for H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance, as transient exposure to rotenone substantially increases baseline locomotory activity (Figure 7E) (Line 391–396). However, mitochondrial ROS could potentially target multiple neurons and cellular machineries to initiate avoidance behavior to H<sub>2</sub>S, making it challenging to pinpoint specific sites of action. Nevertheless, we agree that further dissection of the neural circuits and mitochondrial signaling in H<sub>2</sub>S avoidance will be important and should be explored in future studies. We discussed this in Lines 509–536.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am not sure how to overcome the challenges involved in reaching conclusions from the decreased locomotory responses of animals that are sensitized to the effects of H<sub>2</sub>S. Perhaps this conundrum could be discussed in more detail in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We agree that decreased locomotory speed during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure can arise from distinct causes, either systemic toxicity or adaptation, and distinguishing between these is critical. We have included new experiments and revised the text to clarify this issue.</p>
<p>Our data suggest that increased initial omega turns and a rapid loss of locomotion in hif-1 and detoxification-defective mutants including sqrd-1 and ethe-1 likely reflect an enhanced sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity due to their failure to induce appropriate adaptative responses (Figure 5D–F, Figure 5J–L, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1F–P).  Supporting this, hif-1 mutants become less responsive to unrelated stimuli (near-UV light) after 30 minutes of H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I).</p>
<p>In contrast, egl-9 and SOD-deficient animals show reduced initial reorientation and reduced speed responses (Figure 5B, Figure 7G, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1A and B, and Figure 7—Figure supplement 1F and G), although both egl-9 and sod mutants respond normally to the other stimuli prior or after H<sub>2</sub>S exposure (Figure 5I, Figure 5—Figure supplement 1C, and Figure 7—Figure supplement 1H). Since disrupting egl-9 stabilizes HIF-1 and upregulates the expression of numerous genes involved in cellular defense against H<sub>2</sub>S toxicity, the enhanced detoxification capacity in egl-9 mutants likely increases animals’ tolerance to H<sub>2</sub>S, thereby reducing avoidance to otherwise toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Similarly, persistently high ROS in SOD deficient animals activates a variety of stress-responsive signaling pathways, including HIF-1, NRF2/SKN-1 and DAF-16/ FOXO signaling (Lennicke &amp; Cocheme, 2021; Patten et al., 2010), facilitating cellular adaptation to redox stress and reducing animals’ responsiveness to toxic H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Taken together, these findings support the view that reduced locomotory speed during H<sub>2</sub>S exposure can arise from distinct mechanisms: early systemic toxicity in hif-1 and detoxificationdefective mutants, versus enhanced cellular adaptation in egl-9 and SOD mutants. We have integrated the relevant information across the result section and discussed this in Lines 485–536.</p>
