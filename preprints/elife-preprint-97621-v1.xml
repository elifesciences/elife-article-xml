<title>Abstract</title><p>The burgeoning abilities of pathogens and tumor cells to evade immune responses underscore the urgent need for innovative vaccination platforms based on a variety of biological mechanisms. The current logistical challenges associated with cold-chain (i.e. low-temperature) transportation particularly impacts access to vaccines in the global south. We recently discovered organelles called migrasomes, and herein we investigate the potential of migrasomes as an alternative vaccination platform. Their inherent stability and their enrichment with immune-modulating molecules make migrasomes promising candidates, but their low yield presents a hurdle. We address this problem through our engineered migrasome-like vesicles (eMigrasomes), which emulate the biophysical attributes of natural migrasomes with substantially improved yield. We show that eMigrasomes loaded with a model antigen elicit potent antibody responses and maintain stability at room temperature. We demonstrate that eMigrasomes bearing the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein induce robust humoral protection against the virus. Our study demonstrates the potential of eMigrasome-based vaccines as a unique, robust, and accessible alternative to traditional methods.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>To face the imminent challenges of emerging infectious diseases, and to realize the not-yet-fulfilled promise of cancer vaccines, new types of vaccination platforms based on different basic biological principles are urgently needed. The huge success of mRNA vaccines in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic further supports the importance of developing vaccine platforms based on different underlying biological mechanisms <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. However, the application of mRNA-based vaccines, or other forms of traditional vaccine, has been hampered by the requirement for complicated cold-chain transportation, in which the materials are constantly maintained at low temperature <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. For most parts of the world, especially the global south, it is vitally important to develop vaccines which do not require cold-chain transportation.</p>
<p>Migrasomes are recently discovered organelles of migrating cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. During migrasome formation, long membrane tethers named retraction fibers are pulled out at the trailing edge of migrating cells by the force generated by the movement of the cells. Migrasomes are formed on retraction fibers by a complicated process involving multiple components <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In the final expansion step, the growth of migrasomes is driven by assembly of nanometer-scaled tetraspanin-enriched microdomains (TEMs) into micrometer-scaled tetraspanin-enriched macrodomains (TEMAs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, migrasomes are highly enriched with components of TEMs — such as tetraspanins, integrins, and cholesterol — and formation of migrasomes is dependent on the presence of these molecules. For example, overexpression of Tspan4 can promote migrasome formation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, while removing cholesterol can block migrasome formation. Theoretical modelling, <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of migrasome formation, and membrane stiffness measurement by atomic force microscopy have revealed mechanistic insights into migrasome formation. These approaches showed that tetraspanin- and cholesterol-enriched macrodomains have highly elevated membrane stiffness, which is the key factor to drive the bulging of retraction fibers into migrasomes; as a result, migrasomes are highly rigid <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. More recently, it was shown that assembly of TEMs can repair damaged membranes by restricting the spread of membrane rupture. In liposomes containing Tspan4 and cholesterol, detergent-induced membrane damage can be rapidly repaired, and Tspan4-embedded liposomes are highly resistant to damage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>One defining feature of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains is the enrichment of immune-modulating molecules such as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. This group of molecules contains many key signaling molecular complexes which regulate the immune response, including antigen receptors, antigen-presenting molecules, co-receptors, antigen receptor accessory molecules, and co-stimulatory or inhibitory molecules <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Since migrasomes are largely composed of TEMs, members of the IgSF are also enriched in migrasomes. This property, in addition to the high stability of migrasomes, prompted us to explore the possibility of developing a migrasome-based vaccine.</p>
<p>One key obstacle to developing a migrasome-based delivery system and migrasome-based vaccines is the very low yield of migrasomes. To generate migrasomes, cells must be grown at very low density to allow them to migrate, and a migrating cell can only generate a relatively low number of migrasomes in a process that takes hours to finish <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. In this study, by using the biophysical insights we gained from investigating migrasome formation, we successfully overcome this key obstacle. We developed a method which mimics the key biophysical features of migrasome formation while vastly improving the yield of migrasome-like vesicles. We named these vesicles as engineered migrasomes (eMigrasomes). Using eMigrasomes loaded with the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA), we successfully demonstrate that eMigrasomes are a highly effective, room temperature-stable vaccine platform which generate a strong immunoglobulin G (IgG) response. Finally, we demonstrate that eMigrasomes loaded with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S protein) can generate a strong protective humoral response against SARS-CoV-2. In summary, our study demonstrates that the eMigrasome-based vaccine platform is stable at room temperature, highly effective, and uses an unconventional immunological mechanism, which could be useful in certain scenarios where conventional vaccine platforms are less successful.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>By serendipity, we found that hypotonic shock induces rapid formation of migrasome-like structures on retraction fibers in Tspan4-GFP-expressing cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>). Similar phenomena had also been observed in recent studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> . 10 seconds after hypotonic shock, the Tspan4 signal started to become enriched on retraction fibers. These Tspan4-enriched domains then grew into migrasome-like structures. After reaching its peak intensity, the Tspan4-GFP signal started to diffuse away from the migrasome-like structure, which was accompanied by shrinkage of the migrasome-like structure. 440 seconds after hypotonic shock, most of the hypotonic shock-induced migrasome-like structures disappeared (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1a</xref>, Supplementary Video 1). We found that the size of the migrasome-like structures negatively correlated with osmolarity: the lower the osmolarity, the larger the migrasome-like structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1b</xref>, 1c). To study the role of osmolarity in the formation of migrasome-like structures, we set up an imaging protocol which allowed us to carry out live-cell imaging while lowering the osmolarity in a step-wise manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1d</xref>). We found that step-wise application of the hypotonic shock significantly increased the duration time of the migrasome-like structures. In cells undergoing 5 steps of hypotonic shock, 50% of the migrasome-like structures were still stable 6 minutes after the final step of hypotonic shock; in contrast, in cells undergoing one step of hypotonic shock, 50% of the migrasome-like structures shrunk back or fused with their neighbors within 1.5 minutes. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1e</xref>, 1f, Supplementary Video 2, 3).</p>

<p>We realized that the amount of migrasome-like structures generated by hypotonic shock depends on the number of retraction fibers. We also realized that the majority of the plasma membrane can be the source of membrane for migrasome-like structures. We reasoned that if we shrink the cells by disrupting the cytoskeleton, the shrinkage will cause the retraction of the cell edge toward the center. At the same time, the cells will be adhering to the bottom of the culture plate at various points by focal adhesion. These adhesion sites will keep the plasma membrane in place, thus serving as anchor points for generation of membrane tethers. If this scenario is true, contraction of the cell will generate large numbers of membrane tubes in a way similar to retraction fiber formation during migration. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with different doses of latrunculin A (LatA), a reagent widely used for disruption of microfilaments, before applying the step-wise hypotonic shock. As expected, we found that treating cells with LatA caused shrinking of the cells. We also observed the massive formation of membrane tethers in the area which was occupied by the cell before shrinkage. Importantly, we observed significantly enhanced formation of migrasome-like structures from these newly formed membrane tethers in a LatA dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1g</xref>, 1h).</p>
<p>It is well established that cells can counter a change of osmolarity with regulated volume change <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. To test whether regulated volume change can affect the formation of migrasome-like structures, we knocked down SWELL1, a key component of the volume-regulated anion channel which maintains a constant cell volume in response to osmotic changes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We found that knockdown of SWELL1 significantly enhanced the formation of migrasome-like structures. This result suggests that formation of migrasome-like structures can be enhanced by reducing the capacity of cells to regulate their volume during osmolarity change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1i</xref> -1k).</p>
<p>Under normal physiological conditions, the extracellular space typically contains a substantial amount of sodium. Throughout all the aforementioned experiments, the buffer employed predominantly consisted of sodium as the prevailing cation. Cations are known for their role in regulation of cell volume. Next, we tested the effect of different cations on the formation of migrasome-like structures. We reasoned that if different cations have different abilities to regulate cell volume during osmolarity change, we may be able to find an easy way to attenuate the regulated cell volume change, thus promoting the formation of migrasome-like structures. To do that, we first replaced the medium with isotonic buffers containing different cations, then we added water step-wise to reduce the osmolarity. We found that indeed different cations have different abilities to promote the generation of migrasome-like structures. Substitution of sodium with equal molar potassium, cesium or choline significantly enhanced the generation of migrasome-like structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1l</xref>, 1m).</p>
<p>Tspan4 is the key protein that promotes migrasomes formation, and all the experiments described above were carried out in Tspan4-GFP-expressing cells. To test whether Tspan4 can promote the formation of migrasome-like structures, we treated mCherry- or Tspan4-mCherry-expressing cells with step-wise hypotonic shock, and then observed the formation of migrasome-like structures by WGA staining, which labels migrasomes effectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We found that indeed Tspan4-mCherry significantly enhanced the formation of migrasome-like structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>, 2b). Similar results held for Tspan1 and CD82, which are also migrasome-promoting tetraspanins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c</xref>, 2d, S1a, S1b). Previously, we reported that cholesterol is essential for migrasome formation. We treated cells with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which selectively extracts cholesterol from the plasma membrane. We found that addition of MβCD rapidly destroyed the readily formed migrasome-like structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2e</xref>, 2f). This suggests that, similar to migrasomes, the structural integrity of migrasome-like structures depends on cholesterol. Recently, we reported that formation of migrasomes is dependent on SMS2. We found that treating cells with SMS2-IN-1, a selective inhibitor of SMS2, significantly inhibits the formation of migrasome-like structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g</xref>, 2h). Finally, we tested whether the formation of migrasome-like structures can occur in cells other than NRK cells. Indeed, all the cells we tested were able to support the formation of migrasome-like structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1n</xref>).</p>

<p>Because of the mechanistic similarity between migrasomes and migrasome-like structures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2i</xref>), and because of the artificial nature of the procedure to generate these structures, we named these migrasome-like structures as engineered migrasomes (eMigrasomes).</p>
<p>Based on these results, we designed a protocol to generate and isolate eMigrasomes (eMigs) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a</xref>). In this protocol, cells cultured in flasks were pretreated with high-potassium DPBS (K-DPBS) containing LatA and then the osmolarity was reduced by adding water in a step-wise manner. The flask then was subjected to moderate rotation to separate poorly-adhering cell bodies and tightly-adhering eMigs. The supernatant containing the majority of cell bodies was discarded and the eMigs attached to the bottom were harvested by pipetting. No trypsinization was applied to ensure optimal protection of the integrity of eMigs. To remove remaining cell bodies, crude eMigs were subjected to differential centrifugation followed by a gravity-dependent filtration through a 6-μm filter. eMigs in the flowthrough were concentrated by high-speed centrifugation. This protocol generated eMigs in a high yield. By microscopic examination, every individual cell robustly generates eMigs (Supplementary Video 4). By confocal microscopy analysis, the isolated eMigrasomes are round vesicles with different sizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). To measure the size of eMigrasomes, we carried out a confocal-based analysis using Hough circle transformation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b</xref>). We found that eMigrasomes have a size range from 1.4 μm - 6.6 μm, with a median size of 1.6 μm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3c</xref>). Since negative staining might distort the shape of membrane vesicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3d</xref>), we carried out cryo-EM analysis of eMigrasomes. Under cryo-EM, eMigrasomes appeared as intact round vesicles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3e</xref>). Notably, the eMigs were not contaminated with significant amounts of intracellular membranes, as western blotting of purified eMigs showed very little contamination from other organelles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>).</p>

<p>Previously we reported that migrasomes can become leaky before rupture. We wondered whether eMigrasomes can also become leaky. To test this, we added eMigrasomes into isolation buffer loaded with Cy5 and 40 kDa dextran-TMR. At room temperature, eMigrasomes rapidly become leaky to Cy5, a fluorescent dye that does not pass intact membranes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3g</xref>). During the 48 hours after preparation, eMigrasomes gradually become leaky to 40 kDa dextran-TMR, which mimics the size of a normal protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3g</xref>, 3h).</p>
<p>Next, we tested the stability of eMigrasomes at room temperature. Surprisingly, eMigrasomes are highly stable. Even after 14 days at room temperature, the morphology of eMigrasomes did not change significantly, and the number of eMigrasomes was only slightly reduced (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3i</xref>, 3j). However, if we treated isolated eMigrasomes with MβCD, most of them deformed and ruptured within 30 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3k</xref>). This suggests a crucial contribution of cholesterol to the stability of isolated eMigrasomes.</p>
<p>The stable nature of eMigs prompted us to explore the possibility of using eMigs as carriers for delivery of proteins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4a</xref>). We found that membrane proteins (e.g. the cell surface receptor PD1) can be easily loaded onto eMigrasomes by simply overexpressing these proteins in cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4b</xref>). To load cytosolic proteins, we fused them with the transmembrane domain followed by the polybasic tail of syntaxin 2 (STX2). This allowed us to successfully load the cytosolic protein ovalbumin (OVA) onto the plasma membrane and thus onto eMigrasomes, referred as mOVA for membrane-tethered OVA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4c</xref>).</p>

<title>An eMigrasome-based vaccine</title>
<p>Next, we explored the potential of eMigrasomes as an antigen carrier for vaccines. First, we employed OVA, a well-established model antigen, to evaluate eMigrasomes as a platform for antigen delivery. We used imaging and immunoblotting to confirm the presence of the mOVA-mCherry protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4d</xref>, 4e). It is worth noting that the mOVA antigen was highly enriched in isolated eMigrasomes compared to the host cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4e</xref>). We immunized mice with OVA-loaded eMigrasomes (eM-OVA) via different routes and found that intravenous injection resulted in the highest IgG antibody titer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>). eM-OVA induced the antigen-specific IgG response in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4g</xref>). The IgG response induced by eM-OVA at 20 μg/mouse was comparable to traditional Alum/OVA at 50 μg/mouse (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4h</xref>). Together, these data suggest that eM-OVA elicits a strong IgG response compared to traditional alum-based immunization.</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the stability of the immunogenicity of eM-OVA over a period of 14 days at room temperature. For this purpose, we placed the purified OVA-loaded eMigrasomes in a test tube at room temperature without adding any reagents to inhibit protein degradation. After 14 days of room temperature storage, the amount of intact OVA was roughly the same as in freshly purified eM-OVA, and the IgG response induced by eM-OVA remained unchanged during this period (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4i</xref> - 4k).</p>

<title>An eMigrasome-based vaccine induces a strong humoral protective response against SARS-CoV-2</title>
<p>We next explored eMigs as a platform to carry the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S protein). To prevent the S protein from being broken down by proteases, we mutated the furin site of the S protein. MCA-205 cells were used to express the S protein with an mCherry tag. After isolating the eMigs, we used imaging to confirm the presence of the Spike protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5a</xref>). Immunization of WT C57BL/6J mice with the Spike-loaded eMigs (eM-S) resulted in a strong antibody response against the S protein, which was further improved by a second shot (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5b</xref>, 5d). To assess the neutralizing capacity of the antisera provoked by eM-S, we utilized a replication-competent, infectious VSV chimera incorporated with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for a neutralization test (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5c</xref>), similar to the previously reported system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. This genetically altered VSV chimera virus features the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, substituting its native surface glycoprotein (G), making the VSV chimera reliant on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for cellular entry. The Venus-based fluorescence reporter system offers high sensitivity. The neutralizing power of antisera against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was assessed by calculating the percentage of Venus-positive infected cells when treated with serum versus mock controls. The antisera, stimulated by an initial immunization with eM-S, neutralized the recombinant VSV-Venus-SARS-CoV2 up to a dilution titer of approximately 300 to achieve 50% neutralization (NT<sub>50</sub>). A secondary booster immunization further enhanced the neutralization capability with an NT<sub>50</sub> up to 4000 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5e</xref>, 5f). Together, these results indicate that antigen-carrying eMigs can induce a strong humoral protective response against SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this manuscript, we describe a method to rapidly generate eMigrasomes from cultured mammalian cells. We developed a simple method to load membrane or cytosolic proteins onto eMigrasome. Using OVA as a model antigen, we demonstrate that eMigrasomes are a highly effective, temperature-stable vaccine platform which can elicit antibody response with a very small amount of antigen. Finally, we show that eMigrasomes can be used to generate effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our study provides the proof of concept for developing eMigrasome-based vaccines.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate the efficiency of eMigrasome-based vaccines using a model antigen or an antigen from a coronavirus. The benefit of using a model antigen is that there are readily available experimental systems. The benefit of using a well-characterized virus antigen is that it allows us to reliably test the efficacy of our vaccine platform in a realistic setting. We are aware that due to the experimental nature of this work, it is unlikely that the eMigrasome platform will be used to generate mainstream preventive vaccines in the foreseeable future. However, there is a very real possibility of developing eMigrasomes into therapeutic vaccines against cancer or other diseases with unmet medical needs, or into preventive vaccines against pathogens for which the current vaccine platforms do not work. Our investigation regarding the biophysical and cellular mechanisms of eMigrasome formation makes it possible for further optimizing eMigrasome generation in a rational manner.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that eMigrasomes can be an effective vaccine platform. In addition, we speculate that eMigrasomes may also emerge as a versatile delivery system for a range of applications. The high rigidity and self-repair capacity of migrasomes, which is caused by enrichment of tetraspanins and cholesterol, makes migrasomes highly stable, and thus suitable as delivery carriers in various <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. More importantly, the physiological roles of migrasomes indicate that they have naturally evolved as carriers for delivering materials and information <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our previous work showed that during embryonic development, migrasomes which are highly enriched with signaling molecules, such as chemokines, growth factors and morphogens, are deposited at various spatially defined locations, where they act as sustained-release capsules to liberate the signaling molecules. In this way, migrasomes affect multiple aspects of embryonic development including organ morphogenesis and angiogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Additionally, in cultured fibroblast cells, migrasomes are enriched with a selected set of full-length, translationally competent mRNAs. When these mRNA-enriched migrasomes are taken up by neighboring cells, the mRNA can escape the endo-lysosome system of recipient cells and be translated into protein, thus modifying the behaviors of the recipient cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Finally, in cells experiencing mild mitochondrial damage, the damaged mitochondria can be selectively transported into migrasomes and then evicted from the cell in a process named as mitocytosis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In summary, multiple types of cargos, including materials and information, can be enriched in migrasomes under different settings, and migrasomes can be deposited at spatially defined locations in diverse biological settings to affect a broad range of biological processes, including cell-cell communication. Since eMigrasomes capture certain key features of migrasomes, it is our speculation that we may able to develop eMigrasomes into a delivery system for diverse cargo types including nucleic acids, proteins, small molecules and even organelles.</p>

<p>A T75 flask was coated with 4 μg/ml of fibronectin. 1x10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> Cells were seeded into the pre-coated flask, allowed to grow for 14-16 hours.</p>
<p>II. eMigrasome induction</p>
<p>Cortical actin disruption was achieved by discarding the culture medium and rinsing the cells once with PBS. Then, 7.5 ml of K-DPBS containing 2 μM of Latrunculin-A was added to the flask. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Hypotonic stimulation was performed by placing the flask on an orbital shaker inside the CO<sub>2</sub> incubator and adjusting the speed to 40 rpm. The stimulation was progressively introduced by adding 1.5 ml, 1.8 ml, or 2.2 ml of deionized water at three-minute intervals. Following this, the speed of the orbital shaker was increased to 60 rpm for five minutes.</p>
<p>III. eMigrasome purification</p>
<p>First, the bubbles were harvested using the following procedure. The supernatant containing cell bodies was discarded. The flask’s bottom was gently washed once with hK-DPBS (60% K-DPBS matching the current osmolarity). Subsequently, 4 ml of hK-DPBS-BSA (60% K-DPBS containing 1 mg/ml BSA) was added to the flask. Gentle pipetting was employed to detach the eMigrasomes, and the resultant solution was collected into a conical tube. This step was repeated once, and the collected solutions were combined.</p>
<p>To remove the remaining cell bodies, a process of differential centrifugation and gravity-dependent filtration was used. Initially, the solution was centrifuged at 300 x g at 4°C for 10 minutes, after which the supernatant was collected. The same process was repeated at 500 x g for 10 minutes. The collected supernatant was poured into a filter cup containing a pre-rinsed 6 μm parylene filter (Hangzhou Branemagic Medical Technology, F-PAC007). The filter was pre-rinsed with 100% ethanol followed by hK-DPBS-BSA. The flow-through was then collected in a low-protein-binding conical tube (Eppendorf, 0030122240).</p>
<p>To concentrate the eMigrasomes, the solution was centrifuged at 20,000 x g at 4°C for 30 minutes. In the event of a large volume, a longer time may be necessary. The supernatant was discarded, and the eMigrasome pellet was resuspended in PBS. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA analysis, and the PBS volume was adjusted to reach the desired eMigrasome concentration. For long-term storage, it was recommended that the eMigrasomes were stored as a pellet, with a small volume of hK-DPBS-BSA to cover it. This measure was adopted to minimize eMigrasome loss due to container adsorption.</p>

<title>Negative staining TEM</title>
<p>Isolated eMigrasomes underwent fixation by the addition of an equal volume of 2.5% glutaraldehyde (GA). A droplet of the fixed eMigrasome sample was deposited onto a copper grid for 15 minutes. Excess sample was blotted off with filter paper. The grid was promptly washed with a droplet of double distilled water (ddH<sub>2</sub>O), stained with 1% uranyl acid for one minute, and then further washed with two droplets of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Remaining water was blotted off using filter paper and the grid was allowed to air-dry fully before imaging was conducted via transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5k">
<title>Cryo-EM sample preparation and image acquisition</title>
<p>Quantifoil Cu grids (200 mesh, R2/2) underwent glow-discharging using a plasma cleaning device (PDC-32G, Harrick Plasma). Each EM grid was applied with 4 µl sample and vitrified by plugging into liquid ethane using the Vitrobot Mark IV system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cryo-EM samples were examined using an FEI Tecnai Arctica 200 kV transmission electron microscope, and images were captured at a magnification of 23.5 kx using an FEI Falcon II direct electron detector, with a dose approximately around 15 e−Å−2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5l">
<title>eMigrasome quantification using flow cytometry</title>
<p>Isolated eMigrasomes were suspended in h-KDPBS containing 1 μg/ml Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA, Thermo, W11262). Various dilutions were prepared to ensure at least one dilution had a concentration ranging from 1000 to 10000 eMigrasomes per μl. Data were collected using a CytoFlex LX cytometer (Beckman). The threshold for forward scatter (FSC) was manually set to 4000 to detect small particles. Events that were double positive for B525-FITC and Y610-mcherry were gated as eMigrasomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5m">
<title>Size analysis by Hough Circle Transforming</title>
<p>Size analysis of isolated eMigrasomes was conducted using ImageJ, complemented by the Hough Circle Transform plugin. Sum slices processing of Z-stack was applied to the 488 channel of the confocal images, representing the fluorescence signal from Tspan4-GFP. The image was subsequently converted to an 8-bit grayscale. Edge detection was performed using the “Find Edges” function to identify individual eMigrasomes. Subsequently, the “Threshold” function was applied to encompass the majority of the fluorescent signal from the eMigrasomes. Hough Circle Transform analysis was then utilized with the following parameters: Easy mode; Minimum = 3 pixels; Maximum = 24 pixels; Hough score threshold = 0.9. All output options were selected.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5n">
<title>Immunoblotting</title>
<p>Cells or eMigrasomes were subjected to lysis using a 2% SDS solution in 50 mM Tris buffer, followed by heating at 95 °C. The protein concentration of the samples was assessed using a BCA kit (Vazyme, E112-02-AB). The lysates were diluted to the desired concentration and then denatured via the addition of loading buffer (Beyotime, P0015). The proteins were segregated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Epizyme, PG112 or Yeasen, 36255ES10), and subsequently transferred to a 0.45 μm PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPVH00010) in accordance with a standard protocol. The blot was blocked with 5% milk in TBST and left to incubate overnight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. The blot was then washed thrice with TBST and incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour. Finally, the blot underwent three more washes prior to signal detection via chemiluminescence imaging (CYANAGEN, XLS070P or Thermo, 34075), utilizing a ChemiDoc MP Imaging System (Biorad).</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting included: anti-integrin α5 (CST, 4705T), anti-Na-K-ATPase (CST, 3010S), anti-histone H3 (CST, 4499S), anti-lamp2 (Sigma), anti-calnexin (abcam, ab22595). anti-GFP (Roche, 11814460001 or abcam, ab290), anti-GAPDH (Proteintech, 60004-1-Ig), anti-TIM23 (BD, 611222), anti-S1 (Sinobio, 40591-MM42), anti-ovalbumin (santa cruz, sc80587 or abcam, ab181688), anti-mCherry (abcam, ab125096). Primary antibodies were diluted using Solution 1 (Takara, NKB-101). Secondary antibodies used for immunoblotting included peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-035-003) and peroxidase AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-035-003). Secondary antibodies were diluted using 5% milk in TBST.</p>

<title>Immunization</title>
<p>For systemic immunization, mice were intravenously administered eM-OVA dissolved in 100 µL PBS, or intraperitoneally administered a mixture containing 50 μg OVA in 50 μL PBS (Sigma; A5503) and 50 μL Imject® Alum (Thermo; 77161). For nasal immunization, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane and subsequently intranasally administered 20 μg eM-OVA dissolved in 30 μL PBS. For subcutaneous immunization, 20 μg eM-OVA in 100 µL PBS was administered through injections on both sides of the buttock.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s5q">
<title>Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)</title>
<p>Serum was prepared from whole blood by centrifugation. The levels of antigen-specific antibody were determined using a direct ELISA method. Briefly, a 96-well plate were coated overnight at 4 °C with antigen (2 μg/mL). The wells were then blocked with PBS containing 10 % fetal calf serum before the addition of serially diluted serum. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Between each step, wells were washed with PBST. The colorimetric reaction was carried out using the 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA Substrate. The reaction was stopped with 2 N H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and absorbance at 450 nm was read using a multimode reader. For quantification of OVA-IgG and Spike-IgG, a standard curve was generated using serially diluted anti-OVA antibody (Santa Cruz; sc-80589) and anti-Spike antibody (Sino Biological; 40591-MM42), respectively.</p>

<p>The study, from the group that pioneered migrasome, describes a novel vaccine platform derived from this newly discovered organelle.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This is an excellent study by a superb investigator who discovered and is championing the field of migrasomes. This study contains a hidden &quot;gem&quot; - the induction of migrasomes by hypotonicity and how that happens. In summary, an outstanding fundamental phenomenon (migrasomes) en route to becoming transitionally highly significant.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Innovative approach at several levels. Migrasomes - discovered by Dr Yu's group - are an outstanding biological phenomenon of fundamental interest and now of potentially practical value.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I feel that the overemphasis on practical aspects (vaccine), however important, eclipses some of the fundamental aspects that may be just as important and actually more interesting. If this can be expanded, the study would be outstanding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors' report describes a novel vaccine platform derived from a newly discovered organelle called a migrasome. First, the authors address a technical hurdle in using migrasomes as a vaccine platform. Natural migrasome formation occurs at low levels and is labor intensive, however, by understanding the molecular underpinning of migrasome formation, the authors have designed a method to make engineered migrasomes from cultured, cells at higher yields utilizing a robust process. These engineered migrasomes behave like natural migrasomes. Next, the authors immunized mice with migrasomes that either expressed a model peptide or the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Antibodies against the spike protein were raised that could be boosted by a 2nd vaccination and these antibodies were functional as assessed by an in vitro pseudoviral assay. This new vaccine platform has the potential to overcome obstacles such as cold chain issues for vaccines like messenger RNA that require very stringent storage conditions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present very robust studies detailing the biology behind migrasome formation and this fundamental understanding was used to form engineered migrasomes, which makes it possible to utilize migrasomes as a vaccine platform. The characterization of engineered migrasomes is thorough and establishes comparability with naturally occurring migrasomes. The biophysical characterization of the migrasomes is well done including thermal stability and characterization of the particle size (important characterizations for a good vaccine).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>With a new vaccine platform technology, it would be nice to compare them head-to-head against a proven technology. The authors would improve the manuscript if they made some comparisons to other vaccine platforms such as a SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine or even an adjuvanted recombinant spike protein. This would demonstrate a migrasome-based vaccine could elicit responses comparable to a proven vaccine technology. Additionally, understanding the integrity of the antigens expressed in their migrasomes could be useful. This could be done by looking at functional monoclonal antibodies binding to their migrasomes in a confocal microscopy experiment.</p>
