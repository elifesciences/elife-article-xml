<title>Abstract</title><p>Dense microbial communities, like the gut and soil microbiomes, are dynamic societies. Bacteria can navigate these environments by deploying proteins (effectors) that alter foreign cells’ behavior. Immunity proteins preferentially protect neighboring sibling cells, in contrast to canonical toxin-antitoxin systems. A prevailing hypothesis is that when immunity proteins are bound to specific (cognate) protein partners, it is sufficient to disrupt their function; further, there is little-to-no crosstalk with other (non-cognate) effectors. Here, we build on sporadic reports challenging these hypotheses. We show that immunity proteins from a newly defined protein family can bind and protect against non-cognate PD-(D/E)XK-containing effectors from diverse phyla. We describe the domains essential for binding and function and show that binding alone is insufficient for protective activity. Moreover, we found that these effector and immunity genes co-occur in individual human microbiomes. These results expand the growing repertoire of bacterial protection mechanisms and force us to reconsider how non-cognate interactions impact community structure within complex ecosystems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Specificity between protein-protein interactions is key for several biological processes, such as metabolism, development, and intercellular signaling. Binding to an incorrect partner or disrupted binding of the specific (cognate) protein can cause a diseased state or cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. For bacterial social behaviors, cognate protein-protein interactions between cells impact organism fitness and community structure, such as excluding foreign cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The importance of specificity between cognate partners in social behaviors remains largely unchallenged. In other contexts, flexible (“promiscuous”) binding allows protein partners to retain their interactions when undergoing rapid mutational changes, such as during immune recognition of viral particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Unknown is whether flexible binding between noncognate proteins can occur during bacterial social behaviors. An expanded protective function would reveal new bacterial behaviors that influence individual fitness and community structure in dynamic ecosystems.</p>
<p>Microbes often exist within dense, multi-phyla communities, like the human gut microbiome, where they communicate and compete with neighbors. Bacteria can use effector-immunity protein (EI) pairs in these environments to gain advantages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Unlike toxin-antitoxin systems in which a single cell produces both toxic and neutralizing proteins, bacteria inject cell-modifying proteins (effectors) directly into neighboring cells via several contact-dependent transport mechanisms, including the type VI secretion system (T6SS), type IV secretion system (T4SS), and contact-dependent inhibition (CDI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Clonal siblings produce the matching immunity protein that modifies the effector’s activity. For lethal effectors, both clonal and non-clonal cells are negatively impacted when binding is disrupted or absent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. These interactions between EI pairs can shape community composition by changing bacterial fitness.</p>
<p>The binding specificity between matching EI pairs has historically defined immunity protein protection, but recent studies raise doubts. Antitoxins have multiple mechanisms for neutralizing their cognate toxin, usually within a single cell. By contrast, EI pairs interact within a neighboring cell which puts unique restrictions on both their protection mechanisms and their evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The predominant model is that T6SS-associated EI pairs act like a tumbler lock-and-key, where each effector protein has a single cognate partner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Most immunity proteins bind their cognate effectors, often at the active site, to neutralize effector activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. As such, EI pairs typically have increased protein-protein specificity between matching pairs to protect sibling cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, experiments with engineered proteins reveal that changes to an immunity protein could allow it to bind effectors other than its cognate partner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Also, the T6SS-associated effector and immunity proteins from <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> subsp. <italic>enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, which are phylogenetically close, bind each other <italic>in vitro</italic> and protect against the other <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. These studies suggest that the predominant model needs to be revised to explain the breadth of immunity protein protection.</p>
<p>We studied an EI pair in <italic>Proteus mirabilis</italic> to examine the prevailing model. This opportunistic pathogen resides in human and animal guts and can cause recurrent and persistent urinary tract infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> encodes a lethal T6SS-dependent EI pair that impacts competition and collective motility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The molecular functions of the putative effector and immunity proteins remained unknown. Here, we characterized this EI pair and determined the critical residues for activity, leading to the discovery of two protein families. We showed that these immunity proteins bind non-cognate effectors produced by bacteria from different phyla. Our results indicated that binding was insufficient to neutralize effector proteins within this immunity protein family. Further, we found that these flexible EI pairs from various phyla naturally co-occur in individual human microbiomes. This work provides compelling evidence for cross-protection and supports a fundamental reinterpretation of EI pairs and their ecological significance.</p>

<title>RdnE is a DNA nuclease and seeds a PD-(D/E)XK subfamily</title>
<p>To compete against other strains, <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> strain BB2000 needs both the <italic>idrD</italic> gene and the T6SS, suggesting that the <italic>idrD</italic>-encoded protein functions as a T6SS-associated effector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Similar effectors often contain an enzymatic domain in the C-terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. As a result, we investigated the function of the final 138 amino acids at IdrD’s C-terminus, now named RdnE for <underline>r</underline>ecognition <underline>D</underline>NA <underline>n</underline>uclease <underline>e</underline>ffector. We measured bacterial growth using a strain derived from BB2000 that has disruptions in its native <italic>idrD</italic> and downstream genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. These <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> cells had 1000 fewer cells per mL when engineered to overproduce RdnE <italic>in trans</italic> than the negative control containing no RdnE protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). An equivalent growth pattern occurred in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells under the same conditions (Supplemental Figure 1). Thus, RdnE was lethal <italic>in vivo</italic>. RdnE’s initial 86 amino acids contain a PD-(D/E)XK motif, which is suggestive of nucleotide degradation. The PD-(D/E)XK superfamily includes proteins with broad functions, including effectors that degrade DNA or RNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Three residues in the catalytic site—D, D/E, and K—are required for activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, we changed the corresponding residues in RdnE (D39, E53, and K55) to alanine, separately and together.</p>

</fig>
<p><italic>P. mirabilis</italic> producing these mutant proteins showed growth equivalent to the negative control lacking RdnE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We also noticed that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells that were producing RdnE had morphologies that were indicative of DNA damage or stress. These cells were elongated, and the DAPI-stained DNA was distributed irregularly within the cells (Supplemental Figure 1). Cells producing a defunct D39A mutant (RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>) did not have this appearance (Supplemental Figure 1). Therefore, the PD-(D/E)XK motif was essential for growth arrest.</p>
<p>The importance of the PD-(D/E)XK motif for activity suggested that RdnE was a nuclease, but defining its molecular target required direct analysis. We synthesized RdnE with a C-terminus FLAG epitope tag using <italic>in vitro</italic> translation because of its lethality (Supplemental Figure 1). We measured the protein concentrations, added phage lambda DNA (methylated or unmethylated) to progressively higher RdnE protein concentrations, and then performed agarose gel electrophoresis analysis. Degradation of lambda DNA occurred in the presence of RdnE, regardless of the DNA methylation state (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The RdnE<sub>D39A</sub> construct caused a slight reduction in lambda DNA, while the negative control showed no DNA loss (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). RdnE also caused a reduction in plasmid DNA, indicating its endonuclease activity (Supplemental Figure 1). These results revealed that RdnE caused DNA degradation <italic>in vitro</italic> in a PD-(D/E)XK-dependent manner.</p>
<p>RdnE likely has two different domains, as there is a region directly following the PD-(D/E)XK motif. A two-domain architecture is similar to that described for DNases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and other T6SS effectors like some PoNe-containing DNases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. We made independent deletions of each potential RdnE domain to assess whether both were essential for DNase activity. One construct deleted the first alpha helix without disturbing the catalytic residues; the other deleted the region after the PD-(D/E)XK motif, which we termed “region 2.” The resulting proteins, produced via <italic>in vitro</italic> translation, were assayed for DNase activity as described above. The truncated proteins resulted in no loss of lambda DNA (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that both domains are necessary for degradation activity.</p>
<p>We next asked whether RdnE homologs also act as DNA nucleases. A bioinformatics search revealed the closest RdnE homolog (outside of <italic>Proteus</italic>) was found in the Actinobacteria, <italic>Rothia dentocariosa</italic> C6B. <italic>Rothia</italic> species are inhabitants of the normal oral flora, dwelling in biofilms within the human oral cavity and pharynx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. The two RdnE proteins (<italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE and <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE) share approximately 55% amino acid sequence identity, mostly within the PD-(D/E)XK domain, and have similar predicted secondary structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Given this, we hypothesized that <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE also acted as a DNA nuclease.</p>
<p>We analyzed <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE for PD-(D/E)XK-dependent DNA nuclease activity. We produced it and a predicted null mutant, <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>, using <italic>in vitro</italic> translation. Samples containing the <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE<sub>D39A</sub> protein or a negative control had similar DNA levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast, samples with the wild-type <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE protein showed a loss of lambda DNA regardless of methylation state, indicating that <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE also had DNA nuclease activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). To further analyze RdnE’s architecture, we exchanged region 2 between the <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE and <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnE sequences and assayed for nuclease activity. The hybrid proteins degraded lambda DNA, unlike the negative control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). While DNA degradation by these trans-phyla hybrid proteins required more protein than the wild-type enzymes, the cross-phyla protein fragments could complement one another. These data indicated that these RdnE proteins form a novel PD-(D/E)XK-containing DNA nuclease subfamily.</p>

<title>RdnI binds and neutralizes RdnE</title>
<p>Effectors have cognate immunity proteins, often adjacently located on the chromosome. We hypothesized that the gene adjacent to <italic>rdnE</italic> in BB2000<italic>, rdnI</italic> (previously named “<italic>idrE”</italic>), encodes the cognate immunity protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). RdnI did not have defined domains, and its function was unknown. We assessed RdnI’s activity using microscopic and cell growth analysis. Swarming <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> cells are normally elongated with DAPI-stained DNA found along the cell body (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). By contrast, swarming cells producing RdnE <italic>in trans</italic> did not elongate, had a reduced DAPI signal, and had an accumulation of misshapen cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Cell shape and DNA-associated fluorescence levels returned to normal when cells concurrently produced the RdnE and RdnI proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). RdnI production also rescued cell growth in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells producing RdnE (Supplemental Figure 2). These data suggest that RdnI inhibits RdnE’s lethality.</p>

<p>To determine whether RdnI provided protection against injected RdnE within mixed communities, we used swarm competition assays, which combine one-to-one mixtures of <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> strains and then measure dominance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The control strain was wild-type strain BB2000 (herein called “BB2000”), which naturally produced RdnE and RdnI. The other was strain ATCC29906, which did not naturally produce RdnE and RdnI. These two strains formed a visible boundary between swarming monoculture colonies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). The mixed-strain colony merged with BB2000 in one-to-one competitions, demonstrating BB2000’s dominance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). A similar outcome was seen when ATCC29906 was producing Green Fluorescent Protein (GFPmut2). However, BB2000 did not outcompete ATCC29906 engineered to produce RdnI with a C-terminal StrepII epitope tag (“RdnI-StrepII”), seen by a merging of the mixed-strain colony with ATCC29906 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, RdnI protected cells against injected RdnE within mixed communities.</p>

For <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis, we used bacterial two-hybrid assays (BACTH) in which the reconstitution of the T18 and T25 fragments of adenylate cyclase results in the colorimetric change to blue in the presence of the substrate, X-gal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Constructed vectors contained genes for RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>-FLAG, RdnI-StrepII, or GFPmut2 on the C-termini of the T18 or the T25 fragments. When the reporter strain produced RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>-FLAG or RdnI-StrepII with GFPmut2, the resultant yellow color was equivalent to when X-gal was absent (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). There was also minimal color change when an individual protein was produced on both fragments (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the reporter strains made blue colonies when X-gal was present and the cells concurrently produced RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>-FLAG and RdnI-StrepII. These results indicated that RdnE and RdnI bind to each other <italic>in vivo</italic>. We used batch <italic>in vitro</italic> co-immunoprecipitation assays to confirm the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding result. Separate <italic>E. coli strains</italic> produced either RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>-FLAG or had a negative control, exogenous FLAG-BAP (<italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial alkaline phosphatase with a FLAG epitope tag) added to cell lysate. An anti-FLAG western blot showed both FLAG-BAP (∼ 50 kDa) and RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>-FLAG (∼ 17 kDa) in the soluble and elution fractions. RdnI-StrepII eluted with RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>-FLAG but not the negative control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). The western blot results corresponded with the Coomassie blue-stained gels (Supplemental Figure 2). Overall, our data showed that <italic>Proteus</italic> RdnE and RdnI form a cognate EI pair. However, questions about their prevalence among bacteria remained, because RdnE and RdnI matched no known effector or immunity families.</p>

<p>We next constructed maximum likelihood trees to examine the relationship between the identified proteins. Both the RdnE and RdnI trees diverged from the species tree (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and each other (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Proteins from evolutionarily distant bacteria appeared to share more similarities compared to those from more closely related genera. These results are consistent with potential horizontal gene transfer seen for other EI pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the differences in phyla and gene neighborhoods, the RdnE and RdnI proteins displayed the defining characteristics of protein families. The predicted secondary structures of the RdnE proteins were similar even though the amino acid sequences differed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, Supplemental Figure 3). The RdnE proteins showed two distinct domains, as with the <italic>Proteus</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic> results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>): the PD-(D/E)XK region followed by a sequence variable region (region 2). Further, the predicted tertiary structures were consistent with PD-(D/E)XK folds (three β-sheets flanked by two α-helices, α/β/α) found in other proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, Supplemental Figure 4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. These findings suggested that domains in RdnE are conserved across diverse phyla and the sequences seed a distinct PD-(D/E)XK subfamily.</p>
<p>While immunity proteins within a family have diverse overall amino acid sequences, conserved secondary structures and some conserved residues are not uncommon among immunity protein families. Indeed, they are often used to characterize these families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. We found that, while the RdnI proteins shared minimal primary amino acid sequence identity, they were predicted to contain several α-helices (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>, Supplemental Figure 3) and had similar AlphaFold2-predicted tertiary structures (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, Supplemental Figure 4). We also discovered a region with three alpha-helices and several conserved residues, which we named the “conserved motif” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, the addition of this conserved motif indicates that the RdnI architecture mirrors that of the two-domain RdnE proteins (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Therefore, the RdnI conserved motif may also indicate a novel immunity domain and seed a protein family.</p>

<p>We deployed a structure-function approach to determine the conserved motif’s role in the <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI’s activity. Bioinformatics using AlphaFold2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and Consurf<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> revealed seven highly conserved residues within this region; four of these (Y197, H221, P244, E246) clustered together within the AlphaFold2 structure and are identical between sequences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>). In a sequence-optimized (SO) RdnI, we individually changed each of these four to alanine and discovered that each alanine-substituted variant behaved like the wildtype and inhibited RdnE activity (Supplemental Figure 5). We then replaced all seven residues (Y197, S235, K258, and the original four) with alanine (<italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI<sub>7mut</sub>-StrepII) and found that, unlike wild-type <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII, this construct was not protective in swarm competition assays (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).

<p>Given that the conserved motif and nearby regions are likely involved in function, we queried for potential functions in the remainder of the RdnI protein. We engineered variants that were either (1) the first 85 amino acids, (2) amino acids 150 to 305, which contained an intact conserved motif, or (3) amino acids 235 to 305, which contained the last alpha helix of the conserved motif (Supplemental Figure 3). None of these constructs protected against RdnE’s lethality <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), demonstrating that the entire protein is likely essential for function. The variant containing the first 85 amino acids of <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI was the only construct to bind <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE, indicating that the N-terminal region is sufficient for binding between this <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> EI pair (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, binding is necessary but insufficient for neutralization, and the neutralization activity likely resides within the second half of RdnI. These results, as well as the functional domain swaps between the <italic>Proteus</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic> RdnE proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), contradicted the prevalent model’s assertion that one-to-one binding is both necessary and sufficient for immunity protein function against a cognate effector.</p>
<p>Therefore, we explored the relationship between non-cognate RdnE and RdnI proteins from various phyla. We first asked whether non-cognate RdnI immunity proteins could protect against injected <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE. Using the swarm competition assays, we competed BB2000 against ATCC29906 engineered to produce RdnI homologs from <italic>R. dentocariosa</italic>, <italic>P. jejuni</italic>, or <italic>P. ogarae</italic> (<italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII, <italic><sup>Prevotella</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII, and <italic><sup>Pseudomonas</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII, respectively). BB2000 dominated the swarm when ATCC29906 produced GFPmut2, <italic><sup>Prevotella</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII, or <italic><sup>Pseudomonas</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

Consistent with these findings, the RdnI immunity proteins from <italic>Proteus</italic> and <italic>Rothia</italic> consistently bound <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE<sub>D39A</sub> in <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, but the <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> variants did not (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, Supplemental Figure 7). Thus, <italic><sup>Rothia</sup></italic>RdnI bound and protected against <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE, demonstrating that cross-protection between non-cognate EI pairs from different phyla is possible, provides a fitness benefit during competition, and influences community structure.</p>
<p>Given that the entire immunity protein is necessary for protection, we next evaluated which region(s) of RdnI allowed for cross-protection. We first moved the conserved motif of the three foreign RdnI homologs into <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII and measured neutralizing activity using swarm competition assays and binding activity using BACTH. The conserved motifs from <italic>Rothia</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> were sufficient to preserve <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI’s neutralizing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) and binding functions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). However, the conserved motif from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was insufficient to neutralize <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>), even though the construct could still bind <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE<sub>D39A</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). We then moved the <italic>Proteus</italic> conserved motif into the RdnI variants from <italic>Prevotella</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, but the motif was insufficient to confer neutralizing (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>) or binding function (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>). These results showed that binding RdnE is necessary but not sufficient for RdnI protection. Further, within RdnI, the conserved motif is necessary for neutralization.</p>

<title>RdnE and RdnI proteins from diverse phyla are present in individual human microbiomes</title>
<p>Our findings indicate that immunity proteins such as RdnI could provide a broader protective umbrella for a cell beyond inhibiting the effector proteins of their siblings. If so, one would expect to find evidence of RdnE and RdnI homologs from different phyla in the same environment or microbial community. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing about 500,000 publicly available microbiomes (metagenomes) for the specific <italic>rdnE</italic> and <italic>rdnI</italic> genes examined in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). 2,296 human and terrestrial metagenomes contained reads matching with over 90% identity to these <italic>rdnE</italic> sequences (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The reads mapped to the expected niche for each organism, underscoring the presence of these specific effector proteins in naturally occurring human-associated microbiomes.

Stringent detection parameters were utilized, so the true number could be higher. We then compared the abundance of <italic>rdnI to rdnE</italic>, since metagenomic coverage (i.e., the number of short reads that map to a gene) approximates the underlying gene’s abundance in the sampled community. In most gut samples, <italic>rdnI</italic> recruited more reads than <italic>rdnE</italic>, although there was substantial variance (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using these results as a foundation, we propose an alternate model of “EI skeleton keys,” in which flexible (“promiscuous”) binding between immunity and effector proteins enables protection in mixed-species communities (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This model expands the current paradigm of (selective) cognate EI partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> and has far-reaching implications for immunity protein evolution and molecular function. Unlike most known immunity proteins that fit within the prevailing model, we demonstrated that flexible EI binding is necessary but not sufficient to neutralize RdnE. We also showed that both RdnE and RdnI proteins have multiple domains, one conserved with functional activity and the other variable across phyla. The combined findings point to a two-step mechanism for RdnI protection: the N-terminal variable-sequence domain mediates binding to an effector, while the C-terminal conserved domain is required for neutralization in a function that has yet to be determined (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>The RdnE and RdnI protein families have parallel structural organizations. RdnE’s conserved region contains the enzymatic PD-(D/E)XK motif, which is necessary for DNA nuclease activity. Its variable region comprises the second half of the protein, which is also necessary for degradation activity. Despite amino acid variability among variants, these domains can be swapped between phyla and retain function. On the other hand, RdnI’s variable and conserved regions likely determine binding and function, respectively. <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI’s first 85 amino acids are sufficient and necessary for binding <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnE, while the conserved motif, found in the last two-thirds of RdnI, is necessary for function. RdnI’s protective ability can be preserved when the conserved motif is swapped between species, even among those that cannot otherwise bind. The interchangeability between domains in RdnE and RdnI variants could reflect constraints on their evolutionary paths.</p>
<p>Compared to the prevailing model, our proposed skeleton-key model better explains RdnI’s conserved motif, orphan immunity genes, and other non-cognate protein interactions. Sequence diversity among EI pairs is often attributed to the coevolution between effector and immunity proteins, which is thought to maintain specificity and binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. However, this coevolution model does not fully explain immunity proteins’ conserved regions or the presence and protective activity of orphan immunity proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. A recent study with the Tri1 immunity protein shows that it has conserved enzymatic activity, allowing for protection against foreign effectors, but there is no cross-binding between non-cognate EI pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. This data suggests that conserved enzymatic activity can be maintained alongside the coevolution necessary for strict cognate pair binding. Therefore, we propose that EI protein domains may evolve independently instead of coevolution across the full protein. For example, RdnE’s PD-(D/E)XK motif and RdnI’s conserved motif might need to be maintained for activity, while the variable domains may diversify in sequence more freely. Depending on the selective pressures, the variable regions could reinforce specificity between cognate EI pairs as they coevolve, like the Tri1 family. Additional evolutionary analysis would reveal how the balance between specificity and flexibility evolves in EI pairs, both within domains and across the entire protein.</p>
<p>Flexible protection likely applies beyond contact-dependent EI pairs. Indeed, this model is conceptually similar to the cross-binding seen in type II antitoxins and bacteriocins. Within the ParD antitoxin family, 45% of the twenty antitoxins tested show cross-protective activity with at least one non-cognate ParE toxin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. For the E group of colicins, non-cognate immunity proteins show a lower binding affinity than for their cognate immunity proteins, but they still offer cross-protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Similarly, immunity proteins from <italic>Carnobacterium piscicola</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> offer cross-protection against the other’s cognate bacteriocin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In these systems, as with RdnE-RdnI, flexible binding between a harmful protein and a non-cognate neutralizing protein can result in a potential fitness advantage for the bacteria.</p>
<p>When considering the impacts on community structure, the broadened activity of RdnI proteins against RdnE effectors from multiple phyla likely increases bacterial fitness, which is advantageous in dense environments. RdnI production increased cells’ fitness and modified the community in experimental setups like the swarm competition assays as it enabled vulnerable bacteria to inhabit previously restricted spaces. Supporting this experimental data, both gut and oral metagenomes showed evidence of multiple <italic>rdnE-rdnI</italic> pairs within individual samples, particularly between <italic>Rothia</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic>. Interestingly, the oral microbiome had roughly equivalent abundance between the effector and immunity genes, which might reflect that bacteria occupy distinct spatiotemporal niches within oral microbiomes, e.g. <italic>R. dentocariosa</italic> is predominantly on tooth surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. By contrast, <italic>rdnI</italic> genes had greater abundance compared to <italic>rdnE</italic> in the gut microbiomes, which may reflect the greater diversity in member species and community structures found in the gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Orphan immunity genes are indeed a known phenomenon in T6SS EI literature but are usually documented through single isolate sequencing. This community level assessment affirms the presence of <italic>rdnI</italic> orphan genes on a population scale and points to relatively widespread immunity genes in hundreds or thousands of samples.</p>
<p>Given the ability of immunity genes to protect against non-cognate effectors, the presence of diverse orphan <italic>rdnI</italic> genes hints at the ecological complexity surrounding RdnE and RdnI. This community of immunity proteins is reminiscent of the model for shared immunity proteins within an ecosystem, also called a “hyper-immunity state,” which was seen among colicins in wild field mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. In this hyper-immunity state, a set of immunity proteins shared among a community could offer an advantage against pathogens. Invading bacteria would be unable to protect themselves from certain effectors while the community would be protected as they share the immunity proteins necessary for defense. Flexible binding like RdnI could contribute to such a “hyper-immunity state” to help a bacterial community maintain its niche.</p>
<p>Indeed, bacteria have a diverse set of protective measures to ward off foreign effectors in addition to flexible immunity proteins. Recent work has identified non-specific mechanisms of protection including stress-response, physical barriers, and a stronger offense<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Orphan immunity genes also exist throughout many bacterial genomes and may be a part of this system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>, for example, these genes offer a fitness advantage in mouse microbiomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Our data extends the current repertoire of protection mechanisms by adding another tool: a flexible immunity protein collection, where each immunity protein acts as a skeleton key against a wider class of effectors. This collection could be useful in dense, diverse communities where contact-dependent competition using EI pairs is critical to maintain one’s population. Taken together, the physical interactions between, and evolution of, effector and immunity proteins remain a rich area for new explorations.</p>

<p>We used several standard protocols for vector construction. Seamless ligation cloning extract (SLiCE) was adapted from Zhang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Restriction-digest reactions were based on manufacturer’s protocols. Overlap extension (SOE) PCR Amplification was adapted from Heckman 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> DNase assay</title>
<p>RdnE proteins were produced using the New England Biolabs PURExpress <italic>In Vitro</italic> Protein Synthesis Kit (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich MA). Template DNA contained the <italic>rdnE</italic> gene and required elements specified by the PURExpress kit. We adapted this protocol from prior <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-degradation assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Reactions were performed with 250 ng of template DNA (no template DNA added to negative control reaction) and incubated at 37°C for two hours. Protein amount was determined using an anti-FLAG western blot with a known gradient of FLAG-BAP (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 ng). Synthesized protein (2.5, 5, and 10 ng) was added to 0.5 µg of lambda DNA (methylated and unmethylated), 5 µL of New England Biolabs Buffer 3.1, and up to a final volume of 25 µL. For plasmid DNase assays, 10 ng of synthesized protein was added to 250 ng of circular or linear plasmid DNA (pids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>). This reaction was incubated for one hour at 37°C, then Proteinase K (New England Biolabs Inc., Ipswich MA) was added and incubated for an additional 15 minutes at 37°C. Reaction was then run on a 1% agarose gel for analysis.</p>

<title><italic>E. coli</italic> liquid growth and viability assays</title>
<p>Overnight cultures were grown at 37°C in a shaking incubator in LB broth with appropriate antibiotics. Cultures were normalized to an optical density at 595 nm (OD<sub>595</sub>) of 1 and diluted 1:100 into LB broth with 35 μg/mL kanamycin, with and without 200 nM anhydrotetracycline (aTc). Some samples were analyzed for OD<sub>595</sub> every thirty minutes for 16 hours in a 96-well plate using a TECAN. Other samples were incubated at 37°C for 6 hours while rocking. At indicated time points, 100 μL of sample was removed, diluted, and then plated on fresh LB agar plates to measure colony forming units per mL (CFU) after overnight growth at 37°C using standard protocols.</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>We performed microscopy on <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> strain <italic>idrD</italic>::Tn5 (Cm<sup>R</sup>) (also called, <italic>idrD</italic>*), which has a transposon insertion to disrupt <italic>rdnE</italic> and <italic>rdnI</italic> expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, carrying either vector pBBR1-NheI or pDS0002 (producing RdnE) and on <italic>E. coli</italic> carrying either pBBR1-NheI, pDS0002, or pDS0048 (producing RdnE<sub>D39A</sub>). <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> cells were normalized to OD<sub>595</sub> of 0.1 after overnight growth in LB broth supplemented with kanamycin. Cells were inoculated onto CM55 swarm pads containing 10 µg/mL DAPI and 10 nM aTc and grown in humidified chambers at 37°C. Images were taken at five and six hours after growth. From overnight cultures, <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown in LB broth plus kanamycin until mid-logarithmic phase and then mounted directly onto glass slides. Glass coverslips were sealed with nail polish. For all microscopy, we captured phase contrast and DAPI (150 ms exposure) images using a Leica DM5500B microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove IL) and CoolSnap HQ CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson AZ) cooled to −20°C. MetaMorph version 7.8.0.0 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA) was used for image acquisition.</p>

<title>Sequence Optimized RdnI</title>
<p>The <italic>P. mirabilis rdnI-StrepII</italic> sequence was difficult to genetically engineer into due to its low GC% content (23%). As such, we engineered the sequence to have a higher GC%, called “Sequence optimized (SO) <italic><sup>Proteus</sup></italic>RdnI-StrepII” but no change to the amino acid sequence. The change to the nucleotide sequence did not affect the construct’s ability to offer protection to a vulnerable strain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>).</p>

<title>Swarm competition assay</title>
<p>The swarm competition (territoriality) assay was adapted from Wenren et. al. 2013<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. 5 mL cultures were grown in LB broth with appropriate antibiotics overnight in a 37°C rocking incubator. Overnight cultures were normalized to an OD<sub>595</sub> of 1. For the competition samples, the strains were mixed 1:1. 2 μL of each sample were inoculated onto CM55 agar with the appropriate antibiotic. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 22 hours and then photographed and assessed for boundary formation.</p>

<title>BACTH assay</title>
<p>The vectors are described in Battesti and Bouveret 2012<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> with an added linker region between the T25 or T18 fragments and multiple cloning sites. BTH101 cultures were grown at 30°C overnight in LB broth with kanamycin and carbenicillin. 10 μL of the overnight culture were inoculated onto LB agar with kanamycin, carbenicillin, 1 mM IPTG, and 0 or 40 μg/mL of X-gal (Thermo Fisher, Waltham MA), and grown at 30°C for 24 hours. Color was amplified by an additional 24 hours at 4°C, and then samples were imaged.</p>

<title>FLAG co-immunoprecipitation assays</title>
<p>The protocol was adapted from Cardarelli et. al. 2015<sup>2</sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were harvested from LB broth, grown for either 3 hours after induction with 200 nM aTc at 37°C or 16 to 20 hours at 16°C after induction with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RdnE-containing samples were lysed in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Selleck Chemicals LLC, Houston TX), via bead bashing for 20 minutes at 4°C. RdnI-containing samples were lysed in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 180 mM NaCl, and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail via 10x 10 second sonication pulses. The soluble fraction for both samples was obtained after centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 minutes. FLAG epitope containing samples were incubated with prepared resin for two hours at 4°C. The resin was then washed twice (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 1% Tween-20), incubated with approximately 1 mL of the soluble fraction of the RdnI-StrepII-containing samples for another 2 hours, and washed thrice more. The protein was finally eluted with 50 μL of 300 ng/μL 3x FLAG peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 45 minutes at 4°C. Sample buffer (63 mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-Mercaptoethanol) was added to samples, boiled at 95°C for 10 minutes, and frozen at −80°C.</p>

<title>SDS-Page and Western blotting</title>
<p>The protocol was adapted from Cardarelli et. al. 2015<sup>2</sup>. Protein samples were separated by gel electrophoresis using 13% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels and either transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA) or stained with Coomassie blue (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA). Western blot membranes were probed with primary antibody (either 1:4000 rabbit anti-FLAG [Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis MO] or 1:4000 mouse anti-StrepII [Genscript, Piscataway NJ]) for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4°C and with secondary antibody (either 1:5000 goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse respectively conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) [KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg MD]) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were finally visualized using Immun-Star HRP substrate kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA) and the Chemidoc XRS system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). TIFF files were analyzed on Fiji (ImageJ, Madison, WI).</p>

<title>Bioinformatics search for RdnE and RdnI homologs</title>
<p>A BLAST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> search of the <italic>P. mirabilis</italic> RdnE protein sequence revealed seven RdnE homologs from a variety of species. The downstream genes of these RdnE homologs were identified using the DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI) Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M). The seven RdnE and RdnI amino acid sequences were separately aligned with MUSCLE using Jalview<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. These alignments were then used as seeds for a second homology search using HMMERsearch (HmmerWeb version 2.41.2) and the Ensembl Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The two data sets were then compared for genomes that contained both <italic>rdnE</italic> and <italic>rdnI</italic> genes next to one another within their respective genomes. Any EI pairs that contained disrupted PD-(D/E)XK motifs within their RdnE sequence were removed.</p>

<title>Gene neighborhood and primary conservation analyses</title>
<p>Gene neighborhoods were obtained using JGI’s IMG/M Neighborhood viewer and then redrawn using Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Inc., 2022).

<title>Metagenomic analyses</title>
<p>A sourmash-based approach was used to screen approximately 500,000 public metagenomes stored on NCBI’s SRA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sourmash-bio/2022-search-sra-with-mastiff">https://github.com/sourmash-bio/2022-search-sra-with-mastiff</ext-link>) for the presence of the ten genomes shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>. Hits with a containment score greater than 0.2 were downloaded for further analysis, representing 9,137 metagenomes. Each metagenome was then mapped with bbmap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> against the 10 <italic>rdnE</italic> and <italic>rdnI</italic> sequences with a stringency of 90% (minid = 0.9), along with quality filtering (trim1 = 20, minaveragequality = 10). After mapping, metagenomes were retained if they had (1) a mean coverage greater than 2X, (2) at least one base covered greater than 5X, and (3) more than half of the bases on reference <italic>rdnE-rdnI</italic> sequence receiving coverage. 2,857 metagenomes met these criteria, of which 2,296 contained <italic>P. mirabilis</italic>, <italic>R. dentocariosa</italic>, <italic>P. jejuni</italic>, or <italic>P. ogarae</italic> sequences and could be confidently assigned to samples obtained from the human gut or oral microbiome or from terrestrial sources. Gene-level coverage in a sample was then summarized as each gene’s average nucleotide’s coverage.

<p>This work presents <bold>valuable</bold> information about the specificity and promiscuity of toxic effector and immunity protein pairs. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is currently <bold>incomplete</bold>, as there is concern about the methodology used to analyze protein interactions, which did not take potential differences in expression levels, protein folding, and/or transient interaction into account. Other methods to measure the strength of interactions and structural predictions would improve the study. The work will be of interest to microbiologists and biochemists working with toxin-antitoxin and effector-immunity proteins.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Knecht, Sirias et al describe toxin-immunity pair from Proteus mirabilis. Their observations suggest that the immunity protein could protect against non-cognate effectors from the same family. They analyze these proteins by dissecting them into domains and constructing chimeras which leads them to the conclusion that the immunity can be promiscuous and that the binding of immunity is insufficient for protective activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and the data are very well presented and could be potentially interesting. The phylogenetic analysis is well done, and provides some general insights.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Conclusions are mostly supported by harsh deletions and double hybrid assays. The later assays might show binding, but this method is not resolutive enough to report the binding strength. Proteins could still bind, but the binding might be weaker, transient, and out-competed by the target binding.</p>
<p>2. While the authors have modeled the structure of toxin and immunity, the toxin-immunity complex model is missing. Such a model allows alternative, more realistic interpretation of the presented data. Firstly, the immunity protein is predicted to bind contributing to the surface all over the sequence, except the last two alpha helices (very high confidence model, iPTM&gt;0.8). The N terminus described by the authors contributes one of the toxin-binding surfaces, but this is not the sole binding site. Most importantly, other parts of the immunity protein are predicted to interact closer to the active site (D-E-K residues). Thus, based on the AlphaFold model, the predicted mechanism of immunization remains physically blocking the active site. However, removing the N terminal part, which contributes large interaction surface will directly impact the binding strength. Hence, the toxin-immunity co-folding model suggests that proper binding of immunity, contributed by different parts of the protein, is required to stabilize the toxin-immunity complex and to achieve complete neutralization. Alternative mechanisms of neutralization might not be necessary in this case and are difficult to imagine for a DNAse.</p>
<p>3. Dissection of a toxin into two domains is also not justified from a structural point of view, it is probably based on initial sequence analyses. The N terminus (actually previously reported as Pone domain in ref 21) is actually not a separate domain, but an integral part of the protein that is encased from both sides by the C terminal part. These parts might indeed evolve faster since they are located further from the active site and the central core of the protein. I am happy to see that the chimeric toxins are active, but regarding the conservation and neutralization, I am not surprised, that the central core of the protein fold is highly conserved. However, &quot;deletion 2&quot; is quite irrelevant - it deletes the central core of the protein, which is simply too drastic to draw any conclusions from such a construct - it will not fold into anything similar to an original protein, if it will fold properly at all.</p>
<p>4. Regarding the &quot;promiscuity&quot; there is always a limit to how similar proteins are, hence when cross-neutralization is claimed authors should always provide sequence similarities. This similarity could also be further compared in terms of the predicted interaction surface between toxin and immunity.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks more like a regular toxin-immunity couple, where some cross-reactions with homologues will, of course, be possible, depending on how far the sequences have deviated. Nevertheless, taking all of the above into account, these results do not challenge toxin-immunity specificity dogma.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Knecht et al entitled &quot;Non-cognate immunity proteins provide broader defenses against interbacterial effectors in microbial communities&quot; aims at characterizing a new type VI secretion system (T6SS) effector immunity pair using genetic and biochemical studies primarily focused on Proteus mirabilis and metagenomic analysis of human-derived data focused on Rothia and Prevotella sequences. The authors provide evidence that RdnE and RdnI of Proteus constitute an E-I pair and that the effector likely degrades nucleic acids. Further, they provide evidence that expression of non-cognate immunity derived from diverse species can provide protection against RdnE intoxication. Overall, this general line of investigation is underdeveloped in the T6SS field and conceptually appropriate for a broad audience journal. The paper is well-written and, aside from a few cases, well-cited. As detailed below however, there are several aspects of this paper where the evidence provided is somewhat insufficient to support the claims. Further, there are now at least two examples in the literature of non-cognate immunity providing protection against intoxication, one of which is not cited here (Bosch et al PMID 37345922 - the other being Ting et al 2018). In general therefore I think that the motivating concept here in this paper of overturning the predominant model of interbacterial effector-immunity cognate interactions is oversold and should be dialed back.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>One of the major strengths of this paper is the combination of diverse techniques including competition assays, biochemistry, and metagenomics surveys. The metagenomic analysis in particular has great potential for understanding T6SS biology in natural communities. Finally, it is clear that much new biology remains to be discovered in the realm of T6SS effectors and immunity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have not formally shown that RdnE is delivered by the T6SS. Is it the case that there are not available genetics tools for gene deletion for the BB2000 strain? If there are genetic tools available, standard assays to demonstrate T6SS-dependency would be to interrogate function via inactivation of the T6SS (e.g. by deleting tssC).</p>
<p>For swarm cross-phyla competition assays (Figure 4), at what level compared to cognate immunity are the non-cognate immunity proteins being expressed? This is unclear from the methods and Figure 4 legend and should be elaborated upon. Presumably these non-cognate immunity proteins are being overexpressed. Expression level and effector-to-immunity protein stoichiometry likely matters for interpretation of function, both in vitro as well as in relevant settings in nature. It is important to assess if native expression levels of non-cognate cross-phyla immunity (e.g. Rothia and Prevotella) protect similarly as the endogenously produced cognate immunity. This experiment could be performed in several ways, for example by deleting the RdnE-I pair and complementing back the Rothia or Prevotella RdnI at the same chromosomal locus, then performing the swarm assay. Alternatively, if there are inducible expression systems available for Proteus, examination of protection under varying levels of immunity induction could be an alternate way to address this question. Western blot analysis comparing cognate to non-cognate immunity protein levels expressed in Proteus could also be important. If the authors were interested in deriving physical binding constants between E and various cognate and non-cognate I (e.g. through isothermal titration calorimetry) that would be a strong set of data to support the claims made. The co-IP data presented in supplemental Figure 6 are nice but are from E. coli cells overexpressing each protein and do not fully address the question of in vivo (in Proteus) native expression.</p>
<p>Lines 321-324, the authors infer differences between E and I in terms of read recruitment (greater abundance of I) to indicate the presence of orphan immunity genes in metagenomic samples (Figure 5A-D). It seems equally or perhaps more likely that there is substantial sequence divergence in E compared to the reference sequence. In fact, metagenomes analyzed were required only to have &quot;half of the bases on reference E-I sequence receiving coverage&quot;. Variation in coverage again could reflect divergent sequence dipping below 90% identity cutoff. I recommend performing metagenomic assemblies on these samples to assess and curate the E-I sequences present in each sample and then recalculating coverage based on the exact inferred sequences from each sample.</p>
<p>A description of gene-level read recruitment in the methods section relating to metagenomic analysis is lacking and should be provided.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors discovered that the RdnE effector possesses DNase activity, and in competition, P. mirabilis having RdnE outcompetes the null strain. Additionally, they presented evidence that the RdnI immunity protein binds to RdnE, suppressing its toxicity. Interestingly, the authors demonstrated that the RdnI homolog from a different phylum (i.e., Actinomycetota) provides cross-species protection against RdnE injected from P. mirabilis, despite the limited identity between the immunity sequences. Finally, using metagenomic data from human-associated microbiomes, the authors provided bioinformatic evidence that the rdnE/rdnI gene pair is widespread and present in individual microbiomes. Overall, the discovery of broad protection by non-cognate immunity is intriguing, although not necessarily surprising in retrospect, considering the prolonged period during which Earth was a microbial battlefield/paradise.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors presented a strong rationale in the manuscript and characterized the molecular mechanism of the RdnE effector both in vitro and in the heterologous expression model. The utilization of the bacterial two-hybrid system, along with the competition assays, to study the protective action of RdnI immunity is informative. Furthermore, the authors conducted bioinformatic analyses throughout the manuscript, examining the primary sequence, predicted structural, and metagenomic levels, which significantly underscore the significance and importance of the EI pair.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The interaction between RdnI and RdnE appears to be complex and requires further investigation. The manuscript's data does not conclusively explain how RdnI provides a &quot;promiscuous&quot; immunity function, particularly concerning the RdnI mutant/chimera derivatives. The lack of protection observed in these cases might be attributed to other factors, such as a decrease in protein expression levels or misfolding of the proteins. Additionally, the transient nature of the binding interaction could be insufficient to offer effective defenses.</p>
<p>2. The results from the mixed population competition lack quantitative analysis. The swarm competition assays only yield binary outcomes (Yes or No), limiting the ability to obtain more detailed insights from the data.</p>
<p>3. The discovery of cross-species protection is solely evident in the heterologous expression-competition model. It remains uncertain whether this is an isolated occurrence or a common characteristic of RdnI immunity proteins across various scenarios. Further investigations are necessary to determine the generality of this behavior.</p>

<p>This work presents valuable information about the specificity and promiscuity of toxic effector and immunity protein pairs. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is currently incomplete, as there is concern about the methodology used to analyze protein interactions, which did not take potential differences in expression levels, protein folding, and/or transient interaction into account. Other methods to measure the strength of interactions and structural predictions would improve the study. The work will be of interest to microbiologists and biochemists working with toxin-antitoxin and effector-immunity proteins.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewers for considering this manuscript. We agree that this manuscript provides a <italic>valuable</italic> and cross-discipline introduction to new EI pair protein families where we focus on the EI pair’s flexibility and impacts on community structure. As such, we believe we have provided a <italic>solid</italic> foundation for future studies to examine non-cognate interactions and their possible effects on microbial communities. This, by definition, leaves some areas “incomplete” and, therefore, open for further investigations. While the methods we show do take into account potential differences in binding assays, we will more explicitly address how “expression, protein folding, and/or transient binding” may play into this expanded EI pair model upon revision and temper the discussion of the proposed model. We have responded to the reviewers’ public comments (italicized below).</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p>Note: Reviewer 1, who appeared to focus on a subset of the manuscript rather than the whole, based their comments on several inaccuracies, which we discuss below. We found the tone in this reviewer's comments to be, at times, inappropriate, e.g., using &quot;harsh&quot; and &quot;simply too drastic&quot; to imply that common structure-function analyses were outside of the field-standard methods. We also note that the reviewer took a somewhat atypical step in reviewing this manuscript by running and analyzing the potential protein-complex data in AlphaFold2 but did not discuss areas of low confidence within that model that may contradict their conclusions. We are concerned their approach muddled valid scientific criticisms with problematic conclusions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Knecht, Sirias et al describe toxin-immunity pair from Proteus mirabilis. Their observations suggest that the immunity protein could protect against non-cognate effectors from the same family. They analyze these proteins by dissecting them into domains and constructing chimeras which leads them to the conclusion that the immunity can be promiscuous and that the binding of immunity is insufficient for protective activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and the data are very well presented and could be potentially interesting. The phylogenetic analysis is well done, and provides some general insights.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Conclusions are mostly supported by harsh deletions and double hybrid assays. The later assays might show binding, but this method is not resolutive enough to report the binding strength. Proteins could still bind, but the binding might be weaker, transient, and out-competed by the target binding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The phrasing of structure-function analyses as “harsh” is a bit unusual, as other research groups regularly use deletions and hybrid studies. Given the known caveats to deletion and domain substitutions, we included point-mutation analyses for both the effector and immunity proteins, as found on lines 105 - 113 and 255 - 261 in the current manuscript. These caveats are also why we coupled the in vitro binding analyses with in vivo protection experiments in two distinct experimental systems (E. coli and P. mirabilis). Based on this manuscript’s introductory analysis (where we define and characterize the genes, proteins, interactions, phylogenetics, and incidences in human microbiomes), the next apparent questions are beyond the scope of this study. Future approaches would include analyzing purified proteins from these effector (E) and immunity (I) protein families using biochemical assays, such as X-ray crystallography, circular dichroism spectroscopy, among others.</p>
<p>(Interestingly, most papers in the EI field do not measure EI protein affinity (Jana et al., 2019, Yadav et al., 2021). Notable exceptions are earlier colicin research (Wallis et al., 1995) and a new T6SS EI paper (Bosch et al., 2023) published as we submitted this manuscript.)</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. While the authors have modeled the structure of toxin and immunity, the toxin-immunity complex model is missing. Such a model allows alternative, more realistic interpretation of the presented data. Firstly, the immunity protein is predicted to bind contributing to the surface all over the sequence, except the last two alpha helices (very high confidence model, iPTM&gt;0.8). The N terminus described by the authors contributes one of the toxin-binding surfaces, but this is not the sole binding site. Most importantly, other parts of the immunity protein are predicted to interact closer to the active site (D-E-K residues). Thus, based on the AlphaFold model, the predicted mechanism of immunization remains physically blocking the active site. However, removing the N terminal part, which contributes large interaction surface will directly impact the binding strength. Hence, the toxin-immunity co-folding model suggests that proper binding of immunity, contributed by different parts of the protein, is required to stabilize the toxin-immunity complex and to achieve complete neutralization. Alternative mechanisms of neutralization might not be necessary in this case and are difficult to imagine for a DNAse.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s comment, we again reviewed the RdnE-RdnI AlphaFold2 complex predictions with the most updated version of ColabFold (1.5.2-patch with PDB100 and MMseq2) and have included them at the end of the responses [1].</p>
<p>However, the literature reports that computational predictions of E-I complexes often do not match experimental structural results (Hespanhol et al., 2022, Bosch et al., 2023). As such, we chose not to include the predicted cognate and non-cognate RdnE-I complexes from ColabFold (which uses AlphaFold2) and will not include this data in revised manuscripts. (It is notable that reviewer 1 found the proposed expanded model and research so interesting as to directly input and examine the AI-predicted RdnE-RdnI protein interactions in AlphaFold2.)</p>
<p>Discussion of the prevailing toxin-immunity complex model is in the introduction (lines 45-48) and Figure 5E. Further, there are various known mechanisms for neutralizing nucleases and other T6SS effectors, which we briefly state in the discussion (lines 359 - 361). More in-depth, these molecular mechanisms include active-site blocking (Benz et al., 2012), allosteric-site binding (Kleanthous et al., 1999 and Lu et al., 2014), enzymatic neutralization of the target (Ting et al., 2021), and structural disruption of both the active and binding sites (Bosch et al., 2023). Given this diversity of mechanisms, we did not presume to speculate on the as-of-yet unknown mechanism of RdnI protection.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Dissection of a toxin into two domains is also not justified from a structural point of view, it is probably based on initial sequence analyses. The N terminus (actually previously reported as Pone domain in ref 21) is actually not a separate domain, but an integral part of the protein that is encased from both sides by the C terminal part. These parts might indeed evolve faster since they are located further from the active site and the central core of the protein. I am happy to see that the chimeric toxins are active, but regarding the conservation and neutralization, I am not surprised, that the central core of the protein fold is highly conserved. However, &quot;deletion 2&quot; is quite irrelevant - it deletes the central core of the protein, which is simply too drastic to draw any conclusions from such a construct - it will not fold into anything similar to an original protein, if it will fold properly at all.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer’s comment highlights why we turned to the chimera proteins to dissect the regions of RdnE (formerly IdrD-CT), as the deletions could result in misfolded proteins. (We initially examined RdnE in the years before the launch of AlphaFold2.) However, the reviewer is incorrect regarding the N-terminus of RdnE. The PoNe domain, while also a subfamily of the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily, forms a distinct clade of effectors from the PD-(D/E)XK domain in RdnE (formally IdrD-CT) as seen in Hespanhol et al., 2022; this is true for other DNAse effectors as well.  Many studies analyzing effectors within the PD-(D/E)XK superfamily only focus on the PD-(D/E)XK domain, removing just this domain from the context of the whole protein (Hespanhol et al., 2022; Jana et al., 2019). Of note, in RdnE, this region alone (containing the DNA-binding domain) is insufficient for DNAse activity (unlike in PoNe).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Regarding the &quot;promiscuity&quot; there is always a limit to how similar proteins are, hence when cross-neutralization is claimed authors should always provide sequence similarities. This similarity could also be further compared in terms of the predicted interaction surface between toxin and immunity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer 1 points out a fundamental property of protein-protein interactions that has been isolated away from the impacts of such interactions on bacterial community structure. We have provided the whole protein alignments in supplemental figure 3, the summary images in Figure 3D, and the protein phylogenetic trees in Figure 3C. We encourage others to consider the protein alignments as percent amino acid sequence similarity is not necessarily a good gauge for protein function and interactions. RuBisCo is one example of how protein sequence similarity can be small while functions remain highly conserved. These data are publicly available on the OSF website associated with this manuscript <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/scb7z/">https://osf.io/scb7z/</ext-link>, and we hope the community explores the data there.</p>
<p>In consideration of the enthusiasm to deeply dive into the primary research data, we have included the pairwise sequence identities across the entire proteins here: Proteus RdnI vs. Rothia RdnI: 23.6%; Proteus RdnI vs. Prevotella RdnI: 16.3%, Proteus RdnI vs. Pseudomonas RdnI: 14.6%; Rothia RdnI vs. Prevotella RdnI: 22.4%, Rothia RdnI vs. Pseudomonas RdnI: 17.6%; Prevotella RdnI vs. Pseudomonas RdnI: 19.5%. (As stated in response to reviewer 1 comment 2, we do not find it appropriate to make inferences based on AlphaFold2-predicted protein complexes.)</p>
<p><italic>Overall, it looks more like a regular toxin-immunity couple, where some cross-reactions with homologues are possible, depending on how far the sequences have deviated. Nevertheless, taking all of the above into account, these results do not challenge toxin-immunity specificity dogma.</italic></p>
<p>In this manuscript, we did not intend to dismiss the E-I specificity model but rather point out its limitations and propose an important expansion of that model that accounts for cross-protection and survival against attacks from other genera. We agree that it is commonly considered that deviations in amino acid sequence over time could result in cross-binding and protection (see lines 364-368). However, the impacts of such cross-binding on community structure, bacterial survival, and strain evolution have rarely been considered or addressed in prior literature, with exceptions such as in Zhang et al., 2013 and Bosch et al., 2023. One key insight we propose and show in this manuscript is that cross-binding can be a fitness benefit in mixed communities; therefore, it could be selected for evolutionarily (lines 378-380), even potentially in host microbiomes.</p>

<p>We agree that analyses focusing on flexible non-cognate interactions and protection are underdeveloped within the T6SS field and are not fully explored within a community structure. These ideas are rapidly growing in the field, as evidenced by the references provided by the reviewer. As stated earlier, we did not intend to overturn the prevailing model but rather propose an expanded model that accounts for protection against attacks from foreign genera.</p>

<p>P. mirabilis strain ATCC29906 does not encode the rdnE and rdnI genes on the chromosome (NCBI BioSample: SAMN00001486) (line 151). Production of the RdnI proteins, including the cognate Proteus RdnI, comes from equivalent transgenic expression vectors. Specifically, the rdnI genes were expressed under the flaA promoter in P. mirabilis strain ATCC29906 (Table 1) for the swarm competition assays found in Figure 2C and Figure 4. This promoter results in constitutive expression in swarming cells (Belas et al., 1991; Jansen et al., 2003).</p>

<p>This comment raises the challenges with metagenomic analyses. It was difficult to balance specificity to a particular species’ DNA sequence with the prevalence of any homologous sequence in the sample. Given the distinction in binding interactions among the examined four species, we opted to prioritize specificity, accepting that we were losing access to some rdnE and rdnI sequences in that decision. We chose a 90% identity cutoff, which, through several in silica controls, ensured that each sequence we identified was the rdnE or rdnI gene from that specific species. For the Version of Record, we will revisit this decision and consider trying to account for sequence divergence by lowering the identity cutoffs as suggested.</p>

<p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer and hope that grant reviewers’ share this colleague’s enthusiasm for understanding the detailed molecular mechanisms of RdnE-RdnI binding across genera. We will continue to emphasize such caveats as the next frontier is clearly understanding the molecular mechanisms for RdnI cognate or non-cognate protection. We address the concerns regarding expression levels in the response to reviewer 2, comment 2.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The mixed swam assay is needed when studying T6SS effectors that are primarily secreted during Proteus’ swarming activity (Saak et al. 2017, Zepeda-Rivera et al. 2018). This limitation is one reason we utilize in vitro, in vivo, and bioinformatic analyses. Though the swarm competition assay yields a binary outcome, we are confident that the observed RdnI protection is due to interaction with a trans-cell RdnE via an active T6SS. By contrast, many manuscripts report co-expression of the EI pair (Yadev et al., 2021, Hespanhol et al., 2022) rather than secreted effectors, as we have achieved in this manuscript.</p>

<p>[1] The Proteus RdnE in complex with either the Prevotella or Pseudomonas RdnI showed low confidence at the interface (pIDDT ~50-70%); this AI-predicted complex might support the lack of binding seen in the bacterial two-hybrid assay. On the other hand, the Proteus and Rothia RdnI N-terminal regions show higher confidence at the interface with RdnE. Despite this, the C-terminus of the Proteus RdnI shows especially low confidence (pIDDT ~50%) where it might interact near RdnE’s active site (as suggested by reviewer 1). Given this low confidence and the already stated inaccuracies of AI-generated complexes, we would rather wait for crystallization data to inform potential protection mechanisms of RdnI.</p>
