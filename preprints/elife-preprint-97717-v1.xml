<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Cre-loxP technology, a cornerstone in fate mapping and in vivo gene function studies, faces challenges in achieving precise and efficient conditional mutagenesis through inducible systems. In this study, we introduce two innovative genetic tools designed to overcome these limitations. The first, loxCre, facilitates conditional gene targeting by allowing any CreER line to induce Cre expression with significantly enhanced efficiency. The second, roxCre, enables DreER-mediated Cre release, paving the way for intersectional genetic manipulation that permits both increased precision and efficiency. Both tools incorporate a fluorescent reporter for genetic lineage tracing, revealing efficient gene knockout in cells marked by the reporter simultaneously. These strategies hold great potential for precise and efficient exploration of lineage-specific gene functions, marking a significant advancement in genetic research methodologies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genetic modification such as gene knockout in a precise spatiotemporal manner forms the basis for understanding cellular and molecular mechanisms in multiple biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The powerful Cre-loxP recombination system is the most widely used approach employed to knockout or over-express specific genes <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Cre recombinase, derived from bacteriophage P1 gene, targets short palindrome DNA sequence loxP (34bp) and recombines two loxP-flanked sequences for deletion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Application of the Cre-loxP system in mouse genetics has revolutionized gene functional analysis and significantly advanced our understanding of many developmental and pathophysiological processes at the molecular level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. To date, most of the mouse genes have been successfully targeted by two loxP sites (floxed allele), which could be recombined by cell-type specific Cre lines. For many <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic studies, a tissue-specific gene knockout approach has been widely used as a gold standard to dissect gene function in a particular cell type during a biological process.</p>
<p>While constitutively active Cre is robust and efficient in recombination for gene deletion, Cre lacks temporal control when the promoter driving Cre is active from the embryonic to the adult stage. Therefore, a temporally active Cre is needed to avoid early mortality as a result of the ablation of an indispensable gene at a key developmental stage. To overcome the temporal limitation of Cre, CreER, the fusion of Cre with a mutated estrogen receptor, is generated to enable its activation only after tamoxifen (Tam) treatment, and interaction of ER with Tam induces nuclear translocation of CreER from the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. As a result, the activity of inducible CreER could be controlled by Tam treatment, thus restricting CreER activity at a specific time window and permitting gene functional analysis at a higher spatiotemporal resolution than Cre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. As the loxP-flanked sequences and their locations in genome or chromatin influence its accessibility for recombination, the recombination efficiency of CreER varies significantly among different floxed alleles, ranging from easy-to inert-to-recombine alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. For example, CreER has high efficiency in targeting the easy-to-recombine alleles such as generic reporter <italic>R26-tdT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, but exhibits low efficiency on some other reporters such as <italic>R26-Confetti</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, or may not excise some floxed gene alleles that are inert or resistant for targeting, leading to failure of gene deletion in some tdT<sup>+</sup> cells and causing false-positive tracing fate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). In other words, tdT expression may not always necessarily denote gene deletion in the labeled cells. The notion that the pattern of Cre-expression based on a reporter (e.g. <italic>R26-tdT</italic>) represents the pattern of Cre-mediated recombination is less rigorous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. It is therefore not correct to assume the successful deletion of the gene of interest based on the deletion of another gene (or reporter) by the same CreER mouse line.</p>

<p>One way to increase the recombination efficiency of CreER is to treat mice with many times of Tam, as the high dosage of Tam in theory could increase the chances of CreER-mediated recombination. However, the increased dosage of Tam treatment is toxic and could lead to many side effects on the phenotype, creating confounding effects on the study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. To increase the inducible recombination efficiency of floxed alleles, Lao et al. reported a mosaic mutant analysis with spatial and temporal control of recombination (MASTR), in which initial FlpoER-mediated recombination induces GFPCre expression, that subsequently recombines floxed alleles effectively in GFP<sup>+</sup> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Similarly, a Flp-induced mosaic analysis system with Cre or Tomato (MASCOT) has been reported to express Cre and reporter simultaneously in a cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. While MASTR and MASCOT enable spatiotemporal labeling of mosaic mutant cells utilizing the current resources of floxed mouse lines, it may not be suitable for effective gene knockout at a tissue/population level due to low recombination efficiency initiated by Flp recombinase. In order to improve the inducible recombination efficiency, Tian et al. have also reported a self-cleaved inducible CreER (sCreER) that switches inducible CreER into a constitutively active Cre, effectively recombining floxed allele for gene manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, self-cleaved inducible Cre mice have to be newly generated each time for targeting different promoters, which is time-consuming and the system is not compatible with current resources largely based on CreER mouse lines. A recent study has reported an iSuRe-Cre strategy to induce and report Cre-dependent genetic modifications utilizing conventional CreER tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The reporter expression reflects gene knockout in cells by <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic>. However, two limitations hinder its widespread applications. First, without any induction, the <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> transgene is leaky in some tissues such as heart and skeletal muscle. Second, the initial recombination for releasing the <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> allele induced by CreER is far from efficient in some tissues compared with easy-to-recombine alleles such as <italic>R26-tdT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, limiting its usage for efficient gene knockout at a tissue level. Thus, a new method is needed to ensure gene knockout in cells as effectively and efficiently as recombination on easy-to-recombine alleles, thus allowing efficient gene deletion at a population level.</p>
<p>Conventional Cre-loxP system uses tissue-specific promoter to drive Cre, thus the precision of genetic targeting solely depends on promoter activity. Now it is known that many promoters are not as specific as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The ectopic or unwanted Cre expression in other cell types may result in unspecific cell labeling or gene deletion, leading to many confounding issues or controversies in multiple fields of research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, some cell types cannot be clearly distinguished by one marker from another, and thus could not be specifically and genetically targeted by only one gene promoter-driven recombinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To circumvent this limit, dual recombinases-mediated genetic targeting utilizes two promoters to independently drive Cre and Dre<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Dre is another bacteriophage recombinase that targets rox sites and is orthogonal to the Cre-loxP system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While cells of interest could be labeled by specific reporters that are responsive to dual recombinases, gene deletion requires a final readout on singular Cre recombinase for targeting floxed gene alleles.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed two genetic strategies: roxCre and loxCre, in which the <italic>rox-Stop-rox</italic> (RSR) and <italic>loxP-Stop-loxP</italic> cassettes are respectively inserted into the <italic>Cre</italic> coding region, such that Cre transcription and translation are not properly carried out before the removal of the <italic>Stop</italic> cassette. We did not detect any spontaneous leakiness by roxCre or loxCre. We found that CreER-induced loxCre effectively deletes genes in reporter-labeled cells, ensuring efficient gene knockout for the evaluation of lineage-specific gene function. In addition, DreER-induced roxCre efficiently deletes genes in cells for both specific and efficient intersectional genetic studies. We expect that these tools would overcome the issues of inefficient and non-specific genetic modifications, enhancing our ability to more precisely manipulate genes in a particular cell lineage for a better understanding of gene functions in multiple biomedical fields.</p>

<title>Design of roxCre for DreER-induced mCre expression</title>
<p>A sequential genetic approach has been recently reported to delete genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, which uses Dre-induced CreER expression by removing the <italic>loxP-Stop-loxP</italic> sequence ahead. As aforementioned, the recombination carried out by the released CreER for excising floxed gene alleles may not be as efficient as reporters (e.g. <italic>R26-tdT</italic>). A possible strategy to control Cre activity is to engineer a rox-flanked <italic>Stop</italic> sequence ahead of its DNA (<italic>R26-RSR-Cre</italic>) that will be removed after Dre-rox recombination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, such a strategy is not ideal, as the upstream transcriptional <italic>Stop</italic> sequence might not completely prevent <italic>Cre</italic> transcription, leading to the leakiness issue associated with the <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, for instance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). We then inserted a longer <italic>Stop</italic> sequence or reversed the direction of the <italic>Cre</italic> DNA by generating <italic>R26-RSR-Cre2</italic> and <italic>R26-R-reverseCre-R</italic> lines, respectively, that still displayed heavy leakiness as Cre was independently activated for recombination without being crossed with a Dre mouse line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-G</xref>). To enable efficient dual recombinases-mediated gene knockout, we need to design a strategy for DreER-induced expression of a constitutively active Cre, and the system should not exhibit leakiness.</p>
<p>We first generated roxCre, in which an RSR cassette was inserted into the coding region of <italic>Cre</italic>, splitting <italic>Cre</italic> into N- and C-terminal segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). After removal of RSR by Dre-rox recombination, Cre is recombined containing one remaining rox site within its coding sequence, hereafter termed as modified Cre (mCre, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). To ensure that mCre has the same recombination efficiency as a conventional Cre, we inserted a rox sequence at 12 different sites of <italic>Cre</italic> individually, most of which were located between helix domains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). As insertions of additional amino acids of rox would change the original sequence of Cre, potentially leading to reduced activity, we screened for their recombination efficiency by transfecting cells with 12 versions of mCre (mCre1 to mCre12) and the responding GFP reporter (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). We found that mCre1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, and 11 displayed a comparable efficiency as the conventional Cre; whereas mCre5, 8, 9, and 12 exhibited impaired recombination efficiency (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref>, L). These data demonstrate that at least some of the mCre generated in our study were as efficient as the conventional Cre <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>
<p>Next, we sought to screen for the most robust version of mCre <italic>in vivo.</italic> We generated four roxCre knock-in mice based on mCre1, 4, 7, and 10 as determined from the above <italic>in vitro</italic> screening (Figure S1-S2). In these roxCre lines, RSR inserted into <italic>Cre</italic> was removed by Dre-rox recombination resulting in the generation of mCre (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). We then used hepatocyte- and endothelial cell-specific promoters albumin (Alb) and VE-cadherin (Cdh5) to drive roxCre, and generate <italic>Alb-roxCre1-tdT</italic>, <italic>Cdh5-roxCre4-tdT</italic>, <italic>Alb-roxCre7-GFP</italic>, and <italic>Cdh5-roxCre10-GFP</italic> knock-in mice, respectively (Figure S1-S2). No fluorescence signal was detected in <italic>Alb-roxCre1-tdT</italic>, <italic>Cdh5-roxCre4-tdT</italic>, <italic>Alb-roxCre7-GFP</italic>, and <italic>Cdh5-roxCre10-GFP</italic> knock-in mice (Figure S1-S2), demonstrating no reporter leakiness without Dre-rox recombination. These mice were crossed with <italic>R26-GFP</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> or <italic>R26-tdT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> reporters. Nor did we detect leakiness as a result of any Cre activity when they were crossed with <italic>R26-tdT</italic> or <italic>R26-GFP</italic> reporter (Figure S1-S2). These data demonstrate that roxCre was functionally efficient yet non-leaky.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>DreER-induced mCre robustly recombines inert alleles</title>
<p>The mCre system was originally designed for inducible gene knockout to study biological functions. To more rigorously evaluate the recombination effectiveness among different versions of mCre, we used an inducible DreER to temporally and specifically release mCre in hepatocytes or endothelial cells. Although mCre efficiently labeled virtually all targeted cells (Figure S3A-E), a strong Cre is not needed to drive easy-to-recombine alleles such as <italic>R26-tdT</italic> reporter in this case. To identify a strong mCre, we attempted to target one of the most inert alleles for recombination, <italic>R26-Confetti</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, which is often used as reporters for clonal analysis due to its sparse labeling with rare recombination events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In the Cre-loxp recombination principle, Cre can remove the sequence between two loxp sites that have the same transcription direction and turn over the sequence in the middle of two loxp sites that have the opposite transcription direction. As the recombination efficiency of CreER is limited, <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> only can be recombined into YFP, or nGFP (nuclear GFP), or mCFP (membrane CFP), or RFP (Figure S3F).</p>
<p>We first crossed <italic>R26-DreER;R26-Confetti</italic> mice with <italic>Alb-roxCre1-tdT</italic> (group 1) and <italic>Alb-roxCre7-GFP</italic> (group 2) mice, and Tam-induced Dre-rox recombination yielded <italic>Alb-mCre1-tdT</italic> and <italic>Alb-mCre7-GFP</italic> mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In this system, the constitutively active mCre would completely remove the sequence between two loxp sites that have the same transcription direction, and recombine <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> into two sets of reporter pairs: YFP-nGFP pair and mCFP-RFP pair, which could be detected in a single hepatocyte due to the poly-nuclear or polyploidy feature of hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). In each pair, reporters can equally express, as mCre is strong enough to turn over the sequence in the middle of two loxp sites that have the opposite transcription direction (Figure S3G). Therefore, we used YFP/mCFP to detect mCre recombination efficiency and tdT/RFP or GFP to trace its endogenous reporter activity that was driven by Alb promoter in <italic>Alb-mCre1-tdT</italic> and <italic>Alb-mCre7-GFP</italic> mice, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Besides, <italic>Alb-CreER</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup><italic>;R26-Confetti</italic> was used as a control under the same Tam treatment (group 3, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>In fact, DreER-rox recombination in hepatocytes is not 100%. Therefore, we quantified YFP and mCFP expression in hepatocytes with DreER-rox recombination to evaluate the strength of mCre activity. We found sparse YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (0.39 ± 0.04%) in <italic>Alb-CreER;R26-Confetti</italic> mice. On the other hand, 99.94 ± 0.02% of tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (DreER recombined) were YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> in <italic>R26-DreER;Alb-roxCre1-tdT;R26-Confetti</italic> mice; and 76.83 ± 3.20% of GFP<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes (DreER recombined) were YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> in <italic>R26-DreER;Alb-roxCre7-GFP;R26-Confetti</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). Similarly, we found that 39.81 ± 2.61% of tdT<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells and 74.15 ± 3.64% of GFP<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells in small intestine were YFP<sup>+</sup> or mCFP<sup>+</sup> in <italic>R26-DreER;Cdh5-roxCre4-tdT;R26-Confetti</italic> and <italic>R26-DreER;Cdh5-roxCre10-GFP;R26-Confetti</italic> mice, respectively, compared with sparse labeling in <italic>Cdh5-CreER;R26-Confetti</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>). Similar results were also observed in other tissues and organs (Figure S4).

Immunostaining for tdT, β-catenin, GS, and E-CAD on liver sections revealed similar levels of β-catenin and GS expression in the 3D mutant liver than the control liver (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). However, expression of β-catenin and GS almost disappeared in the 4W mutant sample compared with the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), suggesting efficient deletion of <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> and down-regulation of Wnt signaling downstream gene target GS. Western blotting against β-catenin and qRT-PCR against <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> of purified tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes at 4W post-Tam revealed a near complete loss of Ctnnb1 at both the protein and mRNA levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H-K</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we respectively generated two genetic tools based on roxCre and loxCre to enhance the effectiveness of Cre-mediated gene deletion even under the control of a less efficient DreER or CreER driver. The <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> line permitted efficient recombination to release mCre, which greatly enhanced the effectiveness of subsequent gene deletion in tdT<sup>+</sup> cells. The inclusion of a fluorescent reporter with roxCre or loxCre allele allowed us to readily detect cells with gene deletion, thus facilitating further detailed characterization of these cells both <italic>in situ</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the strategy of roxCre further enhances the precision for cell fate mapping with genetic deletion simultaneously in Dre<sup>+</sup>Cre<sup>+</sup> cells through intersectional genetic targeting. For example, we have showcased the power of roxCre for genetic manipulation in peri-central hepatocytes, resulting in efficient gene knockout in tdT<sup>+</sup> hepatocytes specifically. Additionally, we have demonstrated the efficient deletion of <italic>Wls</italic> and <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> genes in tdT<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells and hepatocytes, respectively, by combining <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> adaptors with CreER lines. Altogether, we have demonstrated that the <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> mouse line could be widely applicable to any CreER-bearing mouse for enhancing its effectiveness in genetic modification with simultaneous cell lineage tracing in multiple biomedical research fields.</p>
<p>Coupling gene deletion with reporter activity can greatly facilitate the accuracy of studying gene function in targeted cells by <italic>in situ</italic> investigation with or without specific cell isolation for <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments. Assuming successful gene deletion in the cell type of interest because of efficient cell labeling by a lineage-specific reporter mediated by the same Cre is incorrect, as recombination efficiency varies significantly among different mouse lines. In fact, many factors can potentially impact Cre-loxP recombination efficiency. Concerning the recombinase enzyme, the type of recombinase, the strength of the promoter that drives the recombinase, the expression level of the recombinase, and the translocation efficiency of an inducible recombinase such as CreER from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after Tam induction could all influence the recombination efficiency. For the targeted DNA sites, the genomic loci where targeted sites are placed, loxP-flanked sequence length, and even the inserted DNA sequence <italic>per se</italic> could also influence the recombination efficiency. We clearly observed the differences in recombination efficiency of different alleles (e.g. <italic>R26-tdT</italic>, <italic>R26-tdT2</italic>, and <italic>R26-Confetti</italic>), even located in the same genomic locus (e.g. Rosa26) mediated by the same CreER under the same Tam treatment protocol, as evidenced by high efficiency in <italic>R26-tdT</italic>, medium efficiency in <italic>R26-tdT2</italic>, and low efficiency in <italic>R26-Confetti</italic>. Importantly, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> was found to be efficient for recombination mediated by CreER, which was comparable to that of the <italic>R26-tdT</italic> allele, thus enabling efficient labeling of cells of interest. Furthermore, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> also enabled CreER to efficiently ablate genes in any cells that had been genetically traced with tdT, synchronizing genetic modification and lineage tracing in the labeled cells.</p>
<p>Despite the high demand in the quest for efficient genetic modification in genetically labeled cells is significant, no efficient tool has been available to date. A previous study attempted to generate an adaptor for CreER to efficiently delete genes in reporter-labeled cells by a transgenic <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. However, the leakiness of <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> on the Rosa26 locus was too high in the male germline. Therefore, a transgenic mouse line was reconstructed subjected to <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> mediated recombination, which still displays consistently leaky recombination in some tissues such as cardiac and skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The leakiness was likely due to the inability of the <italic>Stop</italic> cassette to completely block the transcription of <italic>Cre</italic> in <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic>. Consistently, we also found leakiness as a result of <italic>Cre</italic> transcription even in the presence of <italic>Stop</italic> ahead in the <italic>R26-Stop-Cre</italic> mouse line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These leaky events, despite being at different levels, demonstrate that transcription of recombinases such as Cre could not be easily inhibited. Instead of blocking its transcription by <italic>Stop</italic>, we inserted <italic>Stop</italic> in between the N- and C-terminus of <italic>Cre</italic>, thus preventing Cre expression completely at the translational level. We found that the removal of <italic>Stop</italic> rendered mCre, which efficiently recombined different types of alleles examined in our study. Additionally, we also observed inefficient recombination in hepatocyte-specific <italic>Alb-CreER;iSuRe -Cre</italic> mice, rendering this line less effective in conditional gene deletion in hepatocytes at a population level. In contrast, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> was an easy-to-recombine allele for <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> mediated recombination, allowing tdT labeling and gene deletion simultaneously in the majority of hepatocytes. Therefore, our <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> line has circumvented the leakiness issue associated with <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic>, exhibited as an easy-to-recombine allele for CreER targeting, and synchronized fate mapping with efficient genetic modification robustly, efficiently and temporally in the same cells.</p>
<p>The efficiency of CreER-loxP recombination depends not only on the location of the loxP-containing alleles but also on the strength of CreER driven by an active promoter. For instance, <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> was an easy-to-recombine allele compared with other tested R26 alleles, but the recombination efficiency to release mCre for subsequent recombination depends on the strength of the selected CreER lines for genetic targeting. It is known that different CreER mouse lines vary significantly for recombination, largely due to the differences in expression levels of CreER and Tam induction efficacy. Therefore, we should select a relatively stronger CreER line for efficient recombination on <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> to release mCre for gene deletion at a population level. In addition to bulk gene deletion, the <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> also offers an alternative way for mosaic analysis of gene function by sparse labeling. Previous studies have used Cre-loxP to over-express gene and fluorescence reporter simultaneously in a cell for functional genetic mosaic (ifgMosaic) analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. While ifgMosaic could over-express some dominantly negative genes for functional study, this system could not take advantage of rich resources from many conventionally available floxed mouse lines for loss-of-function study. Mosaic mutant analysis with spatial and temporal control of recombination (MASTR) utilized FlpoER for tissue-specific expression of GFPCre to delete floxed genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Compared with FlpoER lines, CreER is a more broadly used recombinase that most laboratories use in gene deletion experiments. A recent study using dual recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (MADR) also permits stable labeling of mutant cells expressing transgenic elements from defined chromosomal loci<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, the use of viruses and electroporation, albeit convenient and rapid, are inefficient to specifically target any type of cells for <italic>in vivo</italic> studies. The powerful mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) enables simultaneous lineage tracing of a pair of mutant and control sibling cells with distinct fluorescence reporters, allowing precise mosaic analysis of gene function in any cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the MADM cassette has to be combined with the mutant null allele, which is not readily available for synchronizing reporter expression and genetic modification in cells of interest. The ensured gene deletion with tdT reporter by <italic>R26-roxCre-tdT</italic> could be coupled with any present CreER and loxP alleles for potential mosaic analysis. This could be achieved by adjusting Tam at a lower dosage so that the recombination efficiency to release mCre could be low in cells of interest for sparse tdT labeling. We believe that <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> could be useful for robust, efficient, and temporal gene deletion at a population level and mosaic analysis at a single-cell level with improvement in the future.</p>
<p>In this study, we deleted the Wnt signaling gene <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in hepatocytes to present how roxCre and loxCre respectively enable efficient recombination. The impact of deleting <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in a specific hepatocyte lineage on homeostasis, development, and injury recovery requires further investigation. Besides, roxCre and loxCre should be involved in more gene functional studies, in which knocking out genes continuously leads to embryonic death due to their crucial role in development.Both loxCre and roxCre incorporate a fluorescent reporter tdT for genetic lineage tracing, revealing efficient gene knockout in cells marked by the reporter simultaneously. In other words, one reporter tdT can only show cells with gene knockout. One direction to improve the current <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> for mosaic analysis in the future is to generate a second distinct surrogate reporter for wild-type cells as an internal control during mosaic analysis, similar to that in the MADM system.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Shi and colleagues report the use of modified Cre lines in which the coding region of Cre is disrupted by rox-STOP-rox or lox-STOP-lox sequences to prevent the expression of functional protein in the absence of Dre or Cre activity, respectively. The main purpose of these tools is to enable intersectional or tamoxifen-induced Cre activity with minimal or no leaky activity from the second, Cre-expressing allele. It is a nice study but lacks some functional data required to determine how useful these alleles will be in practice, especially in comparison with the figure line that stimulated their creation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The new tools can reduce Cre leak in vivo.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Activity of R26-loxCre line. As the authors point out, the greatest value of this approach is to accomplish a more complete Cre-mediated gene deletion using CreER transgenes that are combined with low-efficiency floxed alleles using their R26-loxCre line that is similar to the iSure Cre reported by Benedito and colleagues. The data in Figure 5 show strong activity at the Confetti locus, but the design of the newly reported R26-loxCre line lacks a WPRE sequence that was included in the iSure-Cre line to drive very robust protein expression. Thus while the line appears to have minimal leak, as the design would predict, the question of how much of a deletion increase is obtained over simple use of the CreER transgene alone is a key question for use by investigators. This is further addressed in Figure 6 where it is compared with Alb-CreER alone to recombine the Ctnnb1 floxed allele. They demonstrate that recombination frequency is clearly improved, but the western blot in Figure 6E does not look like there was a large amount of remaining b-catenin to remove. These data are certainly promising, but the most valuable experiment for such a new tool would be a head-to-head comparison with iSure (or the latest iSure version from the Benedito lab) using the same CreER and target floxed allele. At the very least a comparision of Cre protein expression between the two lines using identical CreER activators is needed.</p>
<p>(2) In vivo analysis of mCre activities. Why did the authors not use the same driver to compare mCre 1, 4, 7, and 10? The study in Figure 2 uses Alb-roxCre for 1 and 7 and Cdh5-roxCre for 4 and 10, with clearly different levels of activity driven by the two alleles in vivo. Thus whether mCre1 is really better than mCre4 or 10 is not clear.</p>
<p>(3) Technical details are lacking. The authors provide little specific information regarding the precise way that the new alleles were generated, i.e. exactly what nucleotide sites were used and what the sequence of the introduced transgenes is. Such valuable information must be gleaned from schematic diagrams that are insufficient to fully explain the approach.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work presents new genetic tools for enhanced Cre-mediated gene deletion and genetic lineage tracing. The authors optimise and generate mouse models that convert temporally controlled CreER or DreER activity to constitutive Cre expression, coupled with the expression of tdT reporter for the visualizing and tracing of gene-deleted cells. This was achieved by inserting a stop cassette into the coding region of Cre, splitting it into N- and C-terminal segments. Removal of the stop cassette by Cre-lox or Dre-rox recombination results in the generation of modified Cre that is shown to exhibit similar activity to native Cre. The authors further demonstrate efficient gene knockout in cells marked by the reporter using these tools, including intersectional genetic targeting of pericentral hepatocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The new models offer several important advantages. They enable tightly controlled and highly effective genetic deletion of even alleles that are difficult to recombine. By coupling Cre expression to reporter expression, these models reliably report Cre-expressing i.e. gene-targeted cells, and circumvent false positives that can complicate analyses in genetic mutants relying on separate reporter alleles. Moreover, the combinatorial use of Dre/Cre permits intersectional genetic targeting, allowing for more precise fate mapping.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The scenario where the lines would demonstrate their full potential compared to existing models has not been tested. Mosaic genetics is increasingly recognized as a key methodology for assessing cell-autonomous gene functions. The challenge lies in performing such experiments, as low doses of tamoxifen needed for inducing mosaic gene deletion may not be sufficient to efficiently recombine multiple alleles in individual cells while at the same time accurately reporting gene deletion. Therefore, a demonstration of the efficient deletion of multiple floxed alleles in a mosaic fashion would be a valuable addition.</p>
<p>In addition, a drawback of this line is the constitutive expression of Cre. When combined with the confetti line, the reporter cassette will continue flipping, potentially leading to misleading lineage tracing results. Constitutive expression of Cre is also associated with toxicity, as discussed by the authors in the introduction. These drawbacks should be acknowledged.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors report a new version of the iSuRe-Cre approach, which was originally developed by Rui Benedito's group in Spain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10239-4">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-10239-4</ext-link>). Shi et al claim that their approach shows reduced leakiness compared to the iSuRe-Cre line. Shi et al elaborate strongly about the leakiness of iSuRe-Cre mice, although leakiness is rather minor according to the original publication and the senior author of the study wrote in a review a few years ago that there is no leakiness (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100509">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2021.100509</ext-link>). Furthermore, a new R26-roxCre-tdT mouse line was established after extensive testing, which enables efficient expression of the Cre recombinase after activation of the Dre recombinase.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors carefully evaluated the efficiency and leakiness of the new strains and demonstrated the applicability by marking peri-central hepatocytes in an intersectional genetics approach, amongst others. I can only find very few weaknesses in the paper, which represents the result of an enormous effort. Carefully conducted technical studies have considerable value. However, I would have preferred to see a study, which uses the wonderful new tools to address a major biological question, rather than a primarily technical report, which describes the ongoing efforts to further improve Cre and Dre recombinase-mediated recombination.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Very high levels of Cre expression may cause toxic effects as previously reported for the hearts of Myh6-Cre mice. Thus, it seems sensible to test for unspecific toxic effects, which may be done by bulk RNA-seq analysis, cell viability, and cell proliferation assays. It should also be analyzed whether the combination of R26-roxCre-tdT with the Tnni3-Dre allele causes cardiac dysfunction, although such dysfunctions should be apparent from potential changes in gene expression.</p>
<p>The R26-GFP or R26-tdT reporters, Alb-roxCre1-tdT, Cdh5-roxCre4-tdT, Alb-roxCre7-GFP, and Cdh5-roxCre10-GFP demonstrate no leakiness without Dre-rox recombination (Figure S1-S2). Is there any leakiness when the inducible DreER allele is introduced but no tamoxifen treatment is applied? This should be documented. The same also applies to loxCre mice.</p>
<p>The enhanced efficiency of loxCre and roxCre systems holds promise for reducing the necessary tamoxifen dosage, potentially reducing toxicity and side effects. In Figure 6, the author demonstrates an enhanced recombination efficiency of loxCre mice, which makes it possible to achieve efficient deletion of Ctnnb1 with a single dose of tamoxifen, whereas a conventional driver (Alb-CreER) requires five dosages. It would be very helpful to include a dose-response curve for determining the minimum dosage required in Alb-CreER; R26-loxCre-tdT; Ctnnb1flox/flox mice for efficient recombination.</p>
<p>In the liver panel of Figure 4F, tdT signals do not seem to colocalize with the VE-cad signals, which is odd. Is there any compelling explanation?</p>
<p>The authors claim that &quot;virtually all tdT+ endothelial cells simultaneously expressed YFP/mCFP&quot; (right panel of Figure 5D). Well, it seems that the abundance of tdT is much lower compared to YFP/mCFP. If the recombination of R26-Confetti was mainly triggered by R26-loxCre-tdT, the expression of tdT and YFP/mCFP should be comparable. This should be clarified.</p>
<p>In several cases, the authors seem to have mixed up &quot;R26-roxCre-tdT&quot; with &quot;R26-loxCre-tdT&quot;. There are errors in #251 and #256. Furthermore, in the passage from line #278 to #301. In the lines #297 and #300 it should probably read &quot;Alb-CreER; R26-loxCre-tdT;Ctnnb1flox/flox&quot;&quot; rather than &quot;Alb-CreER;R26-tdT2;Ctnnb1flox/flox&quot;.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) It is a nice study but lacks some functional data required to determine how useful these alleles will be in practice, especially in comparison with the figure line that stimulated their creation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for this comment. For the usefulness of these alleles, figure 3 shows that specific and efficient genetic manipulation of one cell subpopulation can be achieved by mating across the <italic>DreER</italic> mouse strain to the <italic>rox-Cre</italic> mouse strain. In addition, figure 6 shows that <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> can effectively ensure Cre-loxP recombination on some gene alleles and for genetic manipulation. The expression of the tdT protein is aligned with the expression of the Cre protein (Alb roxCre-tdT and R26-loxCre-tdT, figure 2 and figure 5), which ensures the accuracy of the tracing experiments. We believe more functional data can be shown in future articles that use mice lines mentioned in this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The data in Figure 5 show strong activity at the Confetti locus, but the design of the newly reported R26-loxCre line lacks a WPRE sequence that was included in the iSure-Cre line to drive very robust protein expression.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for coming up with this point in the manuscript. In the <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> mice knock-in strategy, the WPRE sequence is added behind the <italic>loxCre-P2A-tdT</italic> sequence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) the most valuable experiment for such a new tool would be a head-to-head comparison with iSure (or the latest iSure version from the Benedito lab) using the same CreER and target foxed allele. At the very least a comparison of Cre protein expression between the two lines using identical CreER activators is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we will compare <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> with <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> by using <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> and target <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Why did the authors not use the same driver to compare mCre 1, 4, 7, and 10? The study in Figure 2 uses Alb-roxCre for 1 and 7 and Cdh5-roxCre for 4 and 10, with clearly different levels of activity driven by the two alleles in vivo. Thus whether mCre1 is really better than mCre4 or 10 is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for raising this concern. After screening out four robust versions of mCre, we generated these four roxCre knock-in mice. It is unpredictable for us which is the most robust mCre <italic>in vivo</italic>. It might be one or two mCre versions that work efficiently. For example, if <italic>Alb-mCre1</italic> was competitive with <italic>Cdh5-mCre10</italic>, we can use them for targeting genes in different cell types, broadening the potential utility of these mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Technical details are lacking. The authors provide little specific information regarding the precise way that the new alleles were generated, i.e. exactly what nucleotide sites were used and what the sequence of the introduced transgenes is. Such valuable information must be gleaned from schematic diagrams that are insufficient to fully explain the approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your careful suggestions.</p>
<p>We will provide schematic figures as well as nucleotide sequences for mice generation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The scenario where the lines would demonstrate their full potential compared to existing models has not been tested.</p>

<p>We are grateful for this suggestion. We will compare <italic>iSuRe-Cre</italic> with <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> by using <italic>Alb-CreER</italic> and target <italic>R26-Confetti</italic> in the revised manuscript.</p>

Therefore, a demonstration of the efficient deletion of multiple floxed alleles in a mosaic fashion would be a valuable addition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your constructive comments. Mosaic analysis using sparse labeling and efficient gene deletion would be our future direction using roxCre and loxCre strategies. We will include some discussion of using such strategy in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) When combined with the confetti line, the reporter cassette will continue flipping, potentially leading to misleading lineage tracing results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional comments. Indeed, the confetti used in this study can continue flipping, which would lead to potentially misleading lineage tracing results. Our use of R26-Confetti is to demonstrate the robustness of mCre for recombination. Some multiple-color mice lines that don’t flip have been published, for example, R26-Confetti2(10.1038/s41588-019-0346-6) and Rainbow (10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.120.045750). These reporters could be used for tracing Cre-expressing cells, without concerns of flipping of reporter cassettes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Constitutive expression of Cre is also associated with toxicity, as discussed by the authors in the introduction.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your professional comments. The toxicity of constitutive expression of Cre and the toxicity associated with tamoxifen treatment in CreER mice line (10.1038/s44161-022-00125-6) are known to the field. This study can’t solve the toxicity of the constitutive expression of Cre in this work. Many mouse lines with constitutive Cre driven by different promoters are present across various fields, representing similar toxicity. To solve this issue, it would be possible to construct a new strategy that enables the removal of Cre after its expression.</p>

<p>We gratefully appreciate your valuable comment. The roxCre and loxCre mice mentioned in this study provide more effective methods for inducible genetic manipulation in studying gene function. We hope that the application of our new genetic tools could help address some major biological questions in different biomedical fields in the future.</p>

<p>We are sorry that we mistakenly spelled R26-loxCre-tdT into R26-roxCre-tdT in our manuscript. We have not generated R26-roxCre-tdT mouse line. We also thank the reviewer for concerns about the toxicity of high Cre expression. The toxicity of constitutive expression of Cre and the toxicity of tamoxifen treatment of CreER mice line (10.1038/s44161-022-00125-6) are known to the field. This study can’t solve the toxicity of the constitutive expression of Cre in this work.

<p>In this study, we come up with new mice tool lines, including <italic>Alb roxCre1-tdT</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre4-tdT</italic>, <italic>Alb roxCre7-GFP</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre10-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic>. As the data shown in supplementary figure 1, supplementary figure 2, and figure 4D, <italic>Alb roxCre1-tdT</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre4-tdT</italic>, <italic>Alb roxCre7-GFP</italic>, <italic>Cdh5 roxCre10-GFP</italic> and <italic>R26-loxCre-tdT</italic> are not leaky. Therefore, if there is any leakiness driven by the inducible DreER or CreER allele, the leakiness is derived from the DreER or CreER. We will supplement relevant experimental data in the revision.</p>
