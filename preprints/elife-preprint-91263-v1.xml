<title>Abstract</title><p>Epileptic seizures induce aberrant neurogenesis from resident neural stem cells (NSCs) in the dentate gyrus of the adult mouse hippocampus, which has been implicated in depletion of the NSC pool and impairment of hippocampal function. However, the mechanisms regulating neurogenesis after seizures remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that Shh from mossy cells is a major source of Shh signaling activity after seizures, by which mossy cells contribute to seizure-induced neurogenesis and maintenance of the NSC pool. Deletion of Shh from mossy cells attenuates seizure-induced neurogenesis. Moreover, in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, NSCs pool are prematurely depleted after seizure-induced proliferation, and NSCs have impaired self-renewal. Likewise, lack of Shh from mossy cells accelerates age-related decline of the NSC pool with accompanying reduction of self-renewal of NSCs outside the context of pathology such as seizures. Together, our findings indicate that Shh from mossy cells is critical to maintain NSCs and to prevent exhaustion from excessive consumption in aging and after seizures.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the dentate gyrus (DG) of the adult hippocampus, neural stem cells (NSCs) are preserved beyond development in a special niche where newborn neurons are generated and integrated into the hippocampal circuit throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Imayoshi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). NSCs in the adult DG are maintained in a quiescent state, thus adult neurogenesis begins by activating NSC proliferation, followed by differentiation and maturation of newborn neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Urbán et al., 2019</xref>). NSC proliferation and subsequent differentiation in the adult DG are influenced by neuronal activity and the processing of multiple external stimuli and have been shown to be dysregulated after brain insults and in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kempermann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Moreno-Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; Praag et al., 1999a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Epileptic seizures are known to strongly induce adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Jessberger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Jessberger and Parent, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Parent et al., 1997</xref>). Normally, increased neurogenesis has been shown to contribute to hippocampus-dependent learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Deng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>). However, seizure-induced newborn neurons have morphological abnormalities, and many ectopically migrate into the hilus of the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Parent et al., 1997</xref>) contributing to formation of aberrant neuronal circuits in the hippocampus. These ectopic neurons are implicated in cognitive impairment as well as in the development of repeated spontaneous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lybrand et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies showed that once NSC proliferation is activated, NSCs are consumed after a series of cell divisions for neuronal production, resulting in the reduction of neurogenesis and the decline of the NSC pool with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Encinas et al., 2011</xref>; Harris et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>). Excessive neuronal production induced by neuronal hyperactivity has been linked to accelerated consumption of NSCs and leads to depletion of the NSC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>). Despite these studies, little is known about the mechanisms by which seizures induce neurogenesis and how NSCs are regulated in pathogenic conditions to result in NSC pool depletion.</p>
<p>NSCs are regulated by numerous signaling molecules from other niche cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonafina et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Morales and Mira, 2019</xref>). Dysregulation of the NSC niche in pathological conditions has been suggested to contribute to aberrant NSC behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Li and Guo, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Salta et al., 2023</xref>). There are several different types of neurons in close proximity to NSCs in the DG. A recent series of studies demonstrated that hippocampal neuronal networks between these niche neurons regulate neuronal activity-induced neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asrican et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Song et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). Mossy cells are excitatory neurons in the dentate hilus that provide glutamatergic inputs to newborn granule neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Chancey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scharfman, 2016</xref>). Mossy cells are among the most sensitive neurons to afferent excitation in the hippocampus and are vulnerable to continuous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Scharfman, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Sloviter et al., 2003</xref>). Mossy cell activity modulates NSC proliferation depending on the intensity of activation: only highly activated mossy cells increase NSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). These studies suggest a potential connection between seizure-induced mossy cell hyperexcitation and the aberrant neurogenesis seen after seizures.</p>
<p>We previously found that Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a morphogen inducing cell proliferation, is expressed by mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Dysregulation of Shh signaling activity has been reported in epileptic seizures where increased Shh signaling and Shh expression were observed in the hippocampus of temporal lobe epilepsy patients and epileptic rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Pitter et al., 2014</xref>; Zhang et al., 2016). Manipulation of Shh receptors in NSCs has shown that increased Shh signaling in NSCs drives NSC proliferation and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Antonelli et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choe and Pleasure, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Daynac et al., 2016</xref>). These findings may indicate contributions of Shh in seizure induced neurogenesis. However, the source and regulation of Shh that regulates neurogenesis, especially during seizure activity, remains undefined. Direct evidence connecting Shh signaling and neural activity with seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis has not been examined.</p>
<p>In this study, we identify mossy cells as a major source of Shh during epileptic seizures and find that activation of Shh signaling promotes neurogenesis following seizures. Seizure-induced neurogenesis is attenuated by selective deletion of Shh in mossy cells. Our data also show that Shh from mossy cells is needed to preserve the NSC pool after seizure-induced neurogenesis. Interestingly, even though seizure-induced neurogenesis is reduced in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, deletion of Shh also results in premature depletion of the NSC pool after seizures. We find that Shh from mossy cells is important for NSCs to return to the stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that Shh deletion in mossy cells results in premature decline of NSC pool with age even without seizures, and that NSCs are less able to return to the stem cell state after proliferation without mossy cell supplied Shh. Together, our results indicate that Shh derived from mossy cells increases proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs during seizure-induced neurogenesis, thereby ensuring that the NSC pool is sustained.</p>

<title>Shh signaling is activated by seizures and contributes to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis</title>
<p>To understand the role of Shh signaling in seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis, we first investigated whether Shh signaling is activated upon induction of seizure activity. Expression of Gli1, a downstream transcription factor of Shh signaling, is transcriptionally induced upon activation of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lee et al., 1997</xref>). In the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the DG, Gli1 expression and activation of Shh signaling are seen exclusively in NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bottes et al., 2020</xref>). To confirm this, using Gli1<sup>CreER</sup> mice crossed with Cre-dependent red fluorescent protein (tdTomato) reporter mice (Ai14)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ahn and Joyner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>), we labeled Gli1 expressing cells in the DG with tdTomato. One day after a 3-day tamoxifen treatment, we observed that about 90% of tdTomato labeled cells in the SGZ were Sox2+ S100B-cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>), comprising Sox2+ GFAP+ radial glial cell population. This confirms that NSCs are Shh responsive and that Gli1 expression in the SGZ is essentially restricted to NSCs. Thus, we used Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice, which carry the nuclear LacZ (nLacZ) transgene driven by the promoter of Gli1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Ihrie et al., 2011</xref>) as a sensitive readout for the activation of Shh signaling in NSCs and examined the number of Gli1-nLacZ+ cells, which represent Shh-responding cells, in SGZ after seizure induction. We induced seizures with consecutive intraperitoneal (IP) injection of low dose kainic acid (KA) in Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice and found that Gli1-nLacZ+ Shh-responding cells in the SGZ are significantly increased 3 days post seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>). These data show that Shh signaling activity is increased in NSCs after KA-induced seizures.</p>

<p>To investigate whether Shh contributes to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis, we analyzed Shh knock-in heterozygote (Shh<sup>EGFP-Cre/+</sup>, from here on referred as Shh<sup>+/-</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Harfe et al., 2004</xref>). We found that Gli1-nLacZ+ Shh-responding cells in the SGZ of Shh<sup>+/-</sup>; Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice were significantly reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref></bold>), indicating that the level of Shh signaling in NSCs is decreased in these mice. We also observed that Gli1-nLacZ+ cells failed to increase after seizure induction in these mice, indicating that Shh signaling activity is not upregulated with seizure activity in Shh<sup>+/-</sup> mice. We then investigated whether seizures induced aberrant neurogenesis in Shh<sup>+/-</sup> mice. After induction of seizures by KA, we injected 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) for 5 days to label newborn neurons and analyzed the number of BrdU labeled DCX+ newborn neurons at 3 days after the last BrdU injection (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). In WT mice, the number of BrdU+ DCX+ newborn neurons dramatically increased after seizure induction. However, this was significantly reduced in Shh<sup>+/-</sup> mice by comparison (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-H</xref></bold>). Ectopic migration of newborn neurons into the hilus is known to occur in post-seizure neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lybrand et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Parent et al., 1997</xref>). Shh<sup>+/-</sup> mice have a reduction in ectopic hilar dentate neurons (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>). These results demonstrate that Shh contributes to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title><italic>Shh</italic> expression is induced in hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus by seizure induction</title>
<p>To further understand the role of Shh in seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis, we sought to identify the source of Shh ligands in the DG, particularly after seizures. Shh<sup>EGFP-Cre/+</sup> mice were crossed with Ai14 reporter mice (from here on referred as Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Ai14) and seizures were induced. One-week after seizure induction, we found that there was specific tdTomato expression in the dentate hilus of Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Ai14 mice both with and without seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></bold>). Since inhibitory interneurons and mossy cells are both prominent dentate hilar cell types, we explored which of these are included in the tdTomato+ cells. Co-immunostaining with the cell type markers showed that the majority of tdTomato+ cells were GluR2/3+ mossy cells but with a much smaller number of Parvalbumin+ interneurons expressing tdTomato (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the cell types reflected in the population of tdTomato+ cells did not change with seizure induction, thus indicating that in the hilus, seizures did not lead to ectopic expression of Shh in cells that normally don’t express the ligand (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></bold>). Interestingly, we found that tdTomato+ cells were dominantly observed in the dorsal GluR2/3+ mossy cells but not in the ventral hippocampus (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). These data suggest that dorsal mossy cells are the major source of Shh in DG in both the naive and post-seizure hippocampus. We also observed increased numbers of Shh-responding NSCs of the SGZ upon seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>). Therefore, we next tested the possibility that the amount of <italic>Shh</italic> expression is upregulated by seizures in mossy cells. To address this, we visualized <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA in the dentate gyrus using RNAscope in situ hybridization technology. Consistent with the results from Shh<sup>Cre/+</sup>; Ai14 mice, we observed that <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA is enriched in the dentate hilus (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></bold>). Furthermore, <italic>Shh</italic> expression was dramatically increased throughout the dentate hilus from anterior to posterior of dorsal DG at 24 hours after seizure induction. Combining RNAscope with immunofluorescence, we analyzed the number of <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA puncta in the GluR2/3+ mossy cells and found significantly increased <italic>Shh</italic> in mossy cells after seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref></bold>). Taken together, these data support the conclusion that mossy cells are the local source of <italic>Shh</italic> in the DG and that <italic>Shh</italic> mRNA expression is increased upon seizure activity.</p>

<title>Shh from mossy cells contributes to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis</title>
<p>To examine the role of Shh derived from mossy cells in seizure-induced activation of Shh signaling, we generated mossy cell-selective conditional <italic>Shh</italic> knock-out (Shh-cKO) mice by crossing a floxed <italic>Shh</italic> allele (Shh<sup>fl</sup>) with calcitonin receptor-like receptor (Crlr)-Cre mice, in which Cre-mediated recombination is induced in mossy cells and a subset of CA3 neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jinde et al., 2012</xref>). We first tested whether deletion of Shh in mossy cells affects Shh signaling using Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice. We found that the number of Gli1-nLacZ+ cells was significantly decreased in Shh-cKO mice compared with control mice (Crlr-Cre Shh<sup>+/+</sup> mice and Shh<sup>+/+</sup>, Shh<sup>fl/+</sup> and Shh<sup>fl/fl</sup> without the Cre transgene were used as controls) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref></bold>). 3 days after seizure induction, Gli1-nLacZ+ cells were significantly increased in control mice. However, this increase was not observed in Shh-cKO; Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice, in which Gli1-nLacZ+ cells were rarely detected in the SGZ. We found that there were comparable number of Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs in Shh-cKO mice compared with control mice (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3</xref></bold>), indicating that reduction of Gli1-nLacZ+ cells is not due to general loss of NSCs. These data suggest that Shh from mossy cells is responsible for Shh signaling in the DG, and that Shh signaling fails to be upregulated by seizures in the absence of Shh from mossy cells.</p>

<p>Since we found impairment in seizure-induced activation of Shh signaling in Shh-cKO mice, we next investigated whether Shh from mossy cells is involved in seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis. The mice were treated with BrdU for 5 days, starting one day after seizure induction, and analyzed for the number of BrdU labeled DCX+ newborn neurons at 3 days after the last BrdU injection (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). We found that the number of DCX+ BrdU+ newborn neurons was comparable between control and Shh-cKO mice in the KA treatment-naive condition, suggesting that deletion of Shh from mossy cells does not significantly affect baseline neurogenesis in this timeframe. After seizure induction, the number of BrdU+ DCX+ newborn neurons were significantly increased in both groups. However, we found that the number of BrdU+ DCX+ newborn neurons was significantly reduced in Shh-cKO mice compared to control mice after seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref></bold>), indicating that deletion of Shh in mossy cells attenuates seizure-induced neurogenesis. Together, these data indicate that mossy cells function as a critical source of Shh for Shh signaling activity of NSCs, and that Shh derived from mossy cells contributes to seizure-induced neurogenesis.</p>

<title>Mossy cells control adult neurogenesis though Shh in an activity-dependent manner</title>
<p>A previous study showed that neuronal activity triggers secretion of Shh from hippocampal neurons in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Since mossy cells undergo hyperactivation during seizures, we hypothesized that once activated by seizures, mossy cells increase secretion of Shh and contribute to seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis. To test whether neuronal activity in mossy cells increases neurogenesis, we used a chemogenetic approach to activate mossy cells. Crlr-Cre mice were crossed with Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) activator mice (RC::L-hM3Dq) which express excitatory G-protein-coupled receptor hM3Dq with mCherry upon Cre recombination (from here on referred as Crlr-Cre;hM3Dq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Sciolino et al., 2016</xref>)(<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). In Crlr-Cre;hM3Dq mice, mCherry+ recombined cells were observed specifically in the dentate hilus throughout dorsal and ventral hippocampus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref> and S4</bold>). As previously reported, we found that over 90% of mCherry+ expressing cells are GluR2/3+ mossy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Jinde et al., 2012</xref>), and that these made up 66% of the GluR2/3+ mossy cells in the dentate hilus (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref></bold>). Since the high dose of Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), frequently used in the DREADD system has a risk of causing behavioral abnormalities and might have contributory effects on neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">MacLaren et al., 2016</xref>), we instead used Clozapine (CLZ) to induce neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we administrated CLZ to both RC::L-hM3Dq control and Crlr-Cre;hM3Dq mice to normalize the possible side-effects of CLZ administration. 1.5 hours after CLZ injection, we observed that expression of c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, was significantly increased in the hilus of Crlr-Cre;hM3Dq mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref></bold>); we also confirmed that over 70% of GluR2/3+ mCherry+ mossy cells were activated (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). To investigate the effect of mossy cell neuronal activity on neurogenesis, the mice received BrdU for 5 days concomitant with CLZ treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref></bold>) and were analyzed three days after the last BrdU injection.

We therefore next investigated whether Shh signaling activity is activated by mossy cell neuronal activity using Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice. After 6 days of CLZ administration (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref></bold>), we found that Gli1-nLacZ+ were significantly increased in the SGZ of Crlr-Cre;hM3Dq;Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice, compared with RC::L-hM3Dq;Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4M</xref></bold>), suggesting that Shh signaling activity is upregulated in NSCs by mossy cell neuronal activity. To test the role of Shh in mossy cell neuronal activity-induced neurogenesis, we deleted Shh in mossy cells and investigated whether neuronal activity in mossy cells induces neurogenesis using Crlr-Cre;Shh<sup>fl/fl</sup>;hM3Dq mice.

<p>Since mossy cells project their axons to the contralateral DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Botterill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Houser et al., 2020</xref>), we then examined whether mossy cell neuronal activity influences neurogenesis in the contralateral DG. To address this, we stereotaxically injected Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the excitatory G-protein-coupled receptor hM3Dq-mCherry under the human synapsin promoter (AAV::hSyn-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) into the DG of Crlr-Cre mice (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref></bold>). The mice were treated with CLZ to activate hM3Dq and analyzed 1.5 hours after CLZ injection. We found the specific infection of dorsal mossy cells in the AAV-injected side of the DG and contralateral projection of infected mossy cells in the inner and middle molecular layer in the contralateral DG (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5B</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">D</xref></bold>). We also confirmed that CLZ injection increases the expression of c-fos in the AAV::hM3Dq infected mossy cells of the DG on the injected side (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5SE</xref>-<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">G</xref></bold>). To test whether mossy cell neuronal activity induces neurogenesis in contralateral DG, we injected AAV virus at 4-5 weeks old, and after 4 weeks recovery, mice received BrdU for 5 days concomitant with CLZ treatment and were analyzed three days after the last BrdU injection (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5H</xref></bold>). We found that the number of newborn neurons was significantly increased on the contralateral DG of AAV::hM3Dq injected mice (<bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5I</xref> and <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5J</xref></bold>), indicating that mossy cell neuronal activity contributes to increasing neurogenesis in the contralateral DG.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that Shh can be secreted from axons and anterogradely transported to distal regions along the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Beug et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Peng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Su et al., 2017</xref>). These reports, together with our findings, raise the possibility that increased Shh expression after seizures is transported to the contralateral DG, thereby allowing mossy cells to regulate contralateral neurogenesis with neuronal activity. To address this possibility, we deleted Shh in mossy cells in a unilateral hemisphere of DG by injecting AAV::Cre-P2A-tdTomato (AAV::Cre-tdTomato) into the DG of Shh<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice at 4-5 weeks old and investigated seizure-induced neurogenesis in the contralateral DG in two-month-old mice (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6A</xref></bold>). We found that infection by of AAV::Cre-tdTomato was restricted to the injected DG. Dorsal mossy cells send projections to the inner and middle molecular layer of DG bilaterally into both hemispheres along the septo-temporal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Botterill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Houser et al., 2020</xref>). We found tdTomato+ mossy cell projections in the contralateral DG from the DG ipsilateral to the injection site (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6B</xref></bold>), indicating that AAV::Cre-tdTomato infected mossy cells. Shh expression is observed predominantly in dorsal mossy cells (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref></bold>). We observed AAV::Cre-tdTomato infection in 40% of total GluR2/3+ mossy cells and 52% of GluR2/3+ dorsal mossy cells in the DG ipsilateral to the injection site (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6C</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6D</xref></bold>). We then tested whether Shh deletion affects contralateral neurogenesis <bold>(<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6E</xref>)</bold> and found that seizure-induced neurogenesis was attenuated in the contralateral DG of mice injected with AAV::Cre-P2A-tdTomato, in which DCX+ BrdU+ newborn neurons induced by seizure activity were significantly reduced compared with mice injected with AAV::mCherry control virus (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6F</xref> and <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6G</xref></bold>). This suggests that mossy cells control contralateral neurogenesis by regulating Shh expression after seizures. Together with our findings that Shh expression was increased by seizure (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref></bold>), these data demonstrate that increased Shh following seizures may be transported and contribute to neurogenesis in the contralateral DG.

<title>Deletion of Shh in mossy cells leads to reduction of the NSC pool after seizure-induced neurogenesis</title>
<p>Whether there is a functional benefit of increased <italic>Shh</italic> expression in mossy cells following seizure activity remains unclear, considering that seizure-induced aberrant neurogenesis negatively affects hippocampal function. Recently, it was shown that a population of quiescent NSCs in the adult DG, once activated to proliferate and produce neurons, can return to quiescence rather than being consumed by terminal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Botterill et al., 2021</xref>; Harris et al., 2021). This mechanism is suggested to contribute to the long-term persistence of NSCs and maintenance of neurogenesis throughout life by decelerating NSC pool exhaustion. Since Shh is important for proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choe and Pleasure, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lai et al., 2003</xref>), we investigated whether Shh from mossy cells is involved in maintenance of NSCs after proliferation. We labeled proliferating NSCs with BrdU in the drinking water for 5 days after seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). 4 weeks after BrdU administration, we analyzed the number of NSCs retaining BrdU, as previously addressed (Harris et al., 2021). Proliferated NSCs labeled by BrdU are eliminated from the NSC pool once they differentiate into neurons, whereas NSCs that have returned to the stem cell state after proliferation will be detected as BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs even 4 weeks after proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). We found that seizure induction increases the number of BrdU+ Sox2+ proliferating NSCs at day 0 (last day of BrdU labeling) in both control and Shh-cKO mice compared with the no seizure condition, although it was significantly attenuated in Shh-cKO mice compared with control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref></bold>). 4 weeks after BrdU labeling, we found that the number of BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs were increased in seizure-induced mice compared with no seizure-induced mice, as expected from the increased proliferation after seizure (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref></bold>). However, the number of BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs in Shh-cKO mice was significantly reduced compared with seizure-induced control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref></bold>). To assess the persistence of NSCs’ identity after seizure-induced proliferation, we calculated the fraction of NSCs that persist as NSCs 4 weeks after proliferation by dividing the number of BrdU-retaining Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs at 4 weeks with the number of BrdU+ Sox2+ proliferating NSCs at day 0 (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>). We found that the fraction of NSCs that retain stem cell identity after proliferation was comparable in control mice with and without seizure induction. This indicates that even though seizures induce NSCs to proliferate, they return to the stem cell state in the same ratio <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>)</bold>. In contrast, we found that the fraction of NSCs that returned to the stem cell state in Shh-cKO mice was significantly reduced after seizure-induced proliferation (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref></bold>), suggesting that NSCs are less likely to return to their stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation in the absence of Shh from mossy cells.</p>

<p>Seizures increase NSC proliferation and subsequent neurogenesis in the short term. However, it has been suggested that increased neurogenesis induced by neuronal hyperactivity accelerates consumption of NSCs and leads to depletion of NSC pool over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>). Since NSCs in Shh-cKO mice had fewer NSCs that returned to their stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation, we next investigated the consequences on the NSC pool after seizure-induced neurogenesis. We analyzed the number of Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs 4 weeks after BrdU labeling (which is 5 weeks after seizure induction). We found that the number of Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs in the SGZ of control mice are comparable with and without seizures, suggesting that the NSC pool size is maintained at least 5 weeks after seizure induction in control mice (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref></bold>). However, in Shh-cKO mice, the number of Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs was significantly reduced 5 weeks after seizure induction (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref></bold>), suggesting that deletion of Shh in mossy cells leads to premature depletion of the NSC pool after seizure induced neurogenesis. Taken together, these data imply that Shh from mossy cells is required for maintaining the NSC pool after seizure-induced neurogenesis, and that Shh from mossy cells contribute to the NSCs’ return to their stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation, thus preventing NSC pool depletion.</p>

<title>Loss of Shh from mossy cells accelerates age-related decline of the NSC pool</title>
<p>NSCs in the adult DG self-renew and return to a quiescent state after proliferation more often in aged mice than in young mice, which is thought to be the mechanism for maintaining the NSC pool during the aging process (Harris et al., 2021). We therefore next investigated whether deletion of Shh in mossy cells influences the aging related NSC pool decline using 9- to 11-month-old aged mice.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we showed that hilar mossy cells are the source of Shh in the dentate gyrus, and that <italic>Shh</italic> expression and signaling activity in the DG are increased by seizure activity and contribute to seizure-induced neurogenesis. Deletion of Shh from mossy cells attenuated the typical induction of neurogenesis by seizures. However, it also led to the reduction of the NSC pool after seizure-induced neurogenesis. Based on our results, we propose a hypothetical model for NSC pool regulation by mossy cells, in which hilar mossy cells provide Shh, which is important for NSC proliferation and self-renewal to maintain the NSC pool, thereby preventing excessive consumption of NSCs after the increased NSC proliferation that occurs during seizure activity.</p>
<p>We found that seizure-induced neurogenesis was attenuated in Shh-cKO mice, in which Shh signaling activity was diminished and failed to be activated upon seizure. However, neurogenesis in Shh-cKO mice was still significantly increased by seizure induction. This suggests that there must be additional signaling molecules and factors inducing neurogenesis following seizures in addition to Shh. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is also upregulated after seizures and has also been suggested to be important in seizure induced neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Madsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Mardones and Gupta, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Qu et al., 2017</xref>). KA-injection activates proliferation of both NSCs and intermediate progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lugert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Sierra et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous findings demonstrated that activation of Wnt signaling contributes to both NSCs and intermediate progenitor expansion whereas Shh signaling activity increases NSC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choe and Pleasure, 2013</xref>). Thus, these signaling pathways may function together to induce and regulate neurogenesis following seizures, and Shh from mossy cells may contribute to proliferation of NSCs during seizure activity.</p>
<p>Previous research has demonstrated that mossy cell neuronal activity increases NSC proliferation through direct excitatory glutamatergic signaling onto NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yeh et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, Shh has been shown to inhibit the activity of glutamate transporters and increase extracellular glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Feng et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the possibility that in addition to increasing Shh signaling activity in NSCs, Shh from mossy cells may also contribute to increasing glutamatergic signaling onto NSCs. Our results show that neurogenesis induced by mossy cell neuronal activity was compromised in Shh-cKO mice. Considering this together with our findings, this may be the result of concomitant reduction of Shh signaling activity and glutamatergic signaling onto NSCs in the absence of Shh from mossy cells. Whether Shh from mossy cells influences glutamatergic signaling to NSCs needs further investigation. However, the combination of increased Shh signaling and glutamatergic signaling activity by Shh from mossy cells may be an additional mechanism for mossy cell-mediated neurogenesis with seizures.</p>
<p>Previous studies indicated that NSCs in the adult DG proliferate multiple times once they are activated, and that NSCs display self-renewal through both symmetric and asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bonaguidi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bottes et al., 2020</xref>; Harris et al., 2021). How the number and type of cell divisions of adult NSCs is regulated remains elusive. However, there are several findings suggesting that Shh signaling activity is involved in symmetric self-renewal and in regulating the number of cell divisions. <italic>In vivo</italic> live imaging of NSCs in adult DG using two different Cre lines for labeling NSCs demonstrated that NSCs undergo symmetric self-renewal only at the first cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bottes et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, in their study, Gli1-CreER tagged NSCs show long-term self-renewal capacity, and symmetric self-renewal was observed more abundantly in Gli1-CreER tagged NSCs than in Ascl1-CreER tagged NSCs, suggesting that Shh-responding NSCs have robust symmetric self-renewal capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bottes et al., 2020</xref>). In chick spinal cord development, high Shh signaling activity has been shown to increase symmetric self-renewal of neuroepithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Saade et al., 2017</xref>). Although whether similar mechanism is adapted to regulate NSC proliferation in adult DG needs to be elucidated, this raises the possibility that increased Shh from mossy cells following seizures promotes the self-renewal of NSCs though symmetric cell division and contribute to maintaining the NSC pool. Furthermore, a study pulse-labeling NSCs by H2B-GFP demonstrated that NSCs in 6-month-old mice undergo a greater number of cell divisions compared with 1.5-month-old juvenile mice (Harris et al., 2021). Single cell RNA sequencing results showed that direct Shh signaling target genes, Gli1 and Ptch1 expression are enriched in NSCs of aged mice compared to young mice (Harris et al., 2021). Thus, there is a possibility that Shh signaling activity is elevated in aged NSCs, which may contribute to self-renewal and increase of cell division with age. Given this, the reduced self-renewal and number of cell divisions may be a plausible explanation for the decreased ratio of NSCs that retain stem cell state in Shh-cKO mice after seizure induction and aging. Our data showed that the number of NSCs was significantly reduced in Shh-cKO aged mice, whereas it was comparable with control mice at two months of age. Accordingly, we found that NSCs were less likely to return to their stem cell state in aged, but not 2-month-old Shh-cKO mice. These observations suggest that Shh from mossy cells becomes especially critical for maintaining the NSC pool with age. NSC pool reduction in Shh-cKO mice may result from accumulated impairment of NSC self-renewal over time. Together, our results support the conclusion that Shh signaling activity is important for maintaining the NSC pool during both seizure and aging, and that mossy cell-derived Shh promotes long term stem cell potency of NSCs.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed that mossy cells receive inputs intrinsic and extrinsic to the hippocampus and are involved in hippocampus-dependent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Scharfman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). There is great interest in whether mossy cell-mediated neurogenesis is involved in other forms of activity that can induce neurogenesis, such as exercise and environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kempermann, 2008</xref>; Praag et al., 1999b). Whether neurogenesis induced by these types of activity leads to depletion of the NSC pool requires further investigation. We believe that mossy cell-derived Shh-mediated NSC regulation provides new insight into the mechanisms regulating the maintenance of the NSC pool while also increasing neurogenesis. In addition, there is evidence that Alzheimer’s disease model mice with seizures have premature deletion of the NSC pool after increased neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fu et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings provide a potential role for Shh to prevent the depletion of NSC after seizures, in which mossy cells function as a major source of Shh in the DG. Thus, modulation of mossy cell Shh expression in neurodegenerative diseases may be a therapeutic approach for maintaining the NSC pool and preserving neurogenesis during neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings contribute important new insights to further understand how seizures and aging lead to dysregulation in NSC behaviors.</p>

<title>Mice</title>
<p>All mice used in this study were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Mouse colonies were maintained at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in accordance with National Institutes of Health and UCSF guidelines. The following mouse lines were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine): Gli1<sup>CreERT2/+</sup> (stock #007913, RRID:MGI:3053957), Rosa-Ai14 (Stock #007908, RRID:MGI:J:155793), Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> (stock #008211, RRID:MGI:J:79392), Shh<sup>EGFP-Cre/+</sup> (stock #005622, RRID:MGI:3053959), Shh<sup>flox/flox</sup> (stock #004293, RRID:MGI:1934268), Crlr-Cre (stock #023014, RRID:MGI: 5523525). Rosa-CAG-LoxP2272-GFP-LoxP-mCherry-hM3Dq-LoxP2272-LoxP (RC::L-hM3Dq) mice were generously provided by Dr. Zachary Knight (University of California, San Francisco, also available from Jackson laboratory, stock # 026943, “RRID:MGI: 5771785 ”). Both male and female mice were analyzed with no distinction, except for seizure induction experiments, where only male mice were used. There was no difference in the number of newborn neurons and radial NSCs between Crlr-Cre Shh<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Crlr-Cre Shh<sup>fl/fl</sup> RC::L-hM3Dq at 2-month-old and 9- to 11-month-old without clozapine administration (<bold><xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7</xref></bold>). Thus, in the study of long-term tracing of NSCs in aged mice, both Crlr-Cre;Shh<sup>flox/flox</sup> and Crlr-Cre;Shh<sup>flox/flox</sup>; RC::L-hM3Dq mice were used as Shh-cKO mice.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic injection of Adeno-associated viruses (AAV)</title>
<p>One month old mice were anesthetized with Isoflurane (Piramal) in the sealed box and placed on stereotaxic instrument (Kopf). Anesthesia was maintained during surgery using a veterinary vaporizer (Surgivet). Unilateral stereotaxic injections were performed into the right dorsal dentate hilus (anteroposterior: -2.0 mm from Bregma, mediolateral: 1.9 mm, dorsoventral: 2.25 mm). All injections were performed using a Nanojector III (Drummond Scientific) with a glass capillary, pre-pulled by vertical micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument company, P-30). 500 nL of virus was injected at a rate of 60 nl/min. After the virus was delivered, the glass capillary was left in place for another 5 min to allow for diffusion of the virus away from the needle tract and was then slowly withdrawn. The mice recovered in a warm cage after suturing of the incision and then returned to their home cages. After 3-4 weeks of recovery, mice were subjected to the experiments at two-month-old. For Shh deletion experiments, either AAV-hSyn-mCherry (Addgene, 114472-AAV5) or AAV-hSyn-Cre-P2A-dTomato (Addgene, 107738-AAV5) were injected at a titer of 3.0 x 10<sup>11</sup> GC/ml. For chemogenetic activation of mossy cell experiments, either AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (Addgene, 50459-AAV8) or AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (Addgene, 44361-AAV8) were injected at a titer of 4.0 x 10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml.</p>

<title>Seizure induction by Kainic acid administration</title>
<p>Seizure induction was performed by consecutive intraperitoneal injection of low dose kainic acid (KA, Enzo Life Sciences, dissolved in saline (0.9% NaCl)) in two-month-old male mice. Mice received KA initially at a dose of 5 mg/kg. Then 20 min after initial injection, the mice consecutively received 2.5 mg/kg KA injection every 20 min until an initial Racine stage 4/5 seizure was observed, which are defined as rearing with forelimb clonus (stage 4); rearing and falling with forelimb clonus (generalized motor convulsions, stage 5)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Racine, 1972</xref>). Mice that did not display stage 4/5 seizure after receiving total 30 mg/kg of KA were excluded from the experiments. Mice receiving no KA treatment were used as naive mice controls.</p>

<title>Tamoxifen, 5-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine and Clozapine administration</title>
<p>Tamoxifen (Sigma) was dissolved in corn oil with 10% of ethanol at 50 mg/ml. Gli1<sup>CreER/+</sup>;Ai14 mice were orally administered 5 mg of tamoxifen once a day for three days at two-month-old and analyzed one day after last tamoxifen injection. For analyzing neurogenesis by 5-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-labeling, mice were intraperitoneally injected with BrdU (Sigma) dissolved in saline at a dose of 50 mg/kg once a day for 5 days at two-month-old and analyzed 3 days after last BrdU injection. For long-term tracing of BrdU-labeled NSCs in the experiments for NSC persistence analysis, mice were provided 1 mg/ ml of BrdU in the drinking water for 5 days at 2 or 9- to 10-months old and analyzed on the last day of BrdU administration (day 0), or 10 days or 4 weeks after BrdU administration. For induction of neuronal activity by Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools, mice were administrated with clozapine (CLZ, Sigma) by intraperitoneal injection at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg once a day and by drinking water (0.1 mg/100 ml) for 6 days. CLZ drinking water was replaced every 2 days. In the experiments testing induction of neuronal activity by c-fos expression, mice were perfused at 1.5 h after intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 mg/kg of CLZ. For the analysis of Shh-responding cells using Gli1<sup>nLacZ/+</sup> mice in DREADD experiments, mice were given CLZ for 6 days and perfused on the last day of CLZ administration. To investigate neurogenesis in DREADD experiments, mice were given CLZ for 6 days, and starting on the second day of CLZ administration, mice were also given 50 mg/ ml of BrdU by intraperitoneal injection once a day for 5 days and perfused 3 days after the last BrdU injection.</p>

<title>Tissue preparation</title>
<p>The mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS, pH 7.2. Brains were dissected and postfixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. For cryoprotection, fixed brains were stored in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4°C. The brain was embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Tissue Tek, Sakura Finetek, 25608-930) and frozen at -80°C for cryosectioning. Frozen brains were serially sectioned with Leica CM 1850 or 1950 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) in the coronal plane at 16 μm thickness. Every fifteenth sections (each slice 240 μm apart from the next) were serially mounted on individual Colorfrost Plus Microscope Slides (Fisher Scientific) in order from anterior to posterior and preserved at -20°C until use.</p>

<title>Cell counting</title>
<p>Images were acquired using a CSU-W1 spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon) and Axioscan Z.1 (Carl Zeiss). NIH ImageJ (RRID:SCR_003070) was used for cell counting. Cell counting was performed in the DG of the hippocampus in a series of sections that were collected by serial mounting on fifteen individual glass slides. Marker-positive cells in the indicated areas of the DG were counted in a series of sections on a single glass slide that contained DG at the same anatomical level between each group. The counts were then multiplied by the number of intervals between sections to estimate the total number of marker-positive cells in the DG. To quantify c-fos+ cell density in dentate hilus, c-fos+ cells were manually counted and normalized to the area size of hilus that are measured by ImageJ. For counting the total number of NSCs in the DG, radial NSCs were identified with a radial GFAP+ process extending from a Sox2+ nucleus in the subgranular zone of the DG. Persistence of NSC identity in each animal was calculated by dividing the total number of BrdU+ Sox2+ GFAP+ radial NSCs at 10 days or 4 weeks after BrdU administration by the total number of BrdU+ Sox2+ NSCs on the day of last BrdU administration (day 0) in the same group.</p>

<p>Summary: Seizure stimuli has long been recognized to exhibit potent effects on adult neurogenesis, from depletion of the NSC pool to promoting aberrant migration of adult-born neurons. However, the identity and source of extrinsic signals is still incompletely understood. The work by Noguchi et al., demonstrates that Shh from mossy cells is a major source of Shh signaling after KA-mediated acute seizures. This work is interesting because mossy cells undergo hyperactivation during seizures, so this study provides a mechanistic link between mossy cell neuronal activity control of neurogenesis through Shh signaling. Weaknesses are that only male mice were analyzed in the seizure induction experiments and several control groups are missing for seizure induction, tamoxifen induction, and the DREADD experiment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The study uses rigorous and specific genetic approaches (e.g., GliLacZ/+ mice; ShhEGFP-Cre/+ mice; mossy cell selective conditional Shh knockout using Crlr-Cre mice) to demonstrate Shh signaling is activated by seizures in mossy cells and contributes to aberrant neurogenesis.</p>
<p>2. Use of DREADDs (Crlr-Cre; hM3Dq) to show mossy cells control adult neurogenesis through Shh in an activity-dependent manner.</p>
<p>3. Demonstration that Shh deletion in mossy cells leads to reduction of the NSC pool uses stringent methods and analysis, including BrdU pulse-chase and co-labeling with NSC markers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The analysis of Shh deletion in mossy cells and influences of aging related NSC pool decline is not well connected with the rest of the study on the expression/requirement of Shh in mossy cells to regulate seizure-induced neurogenesis. To promote cohesion, the authors should examine/discuss what happens to mossy cells during aging - it is similar or different to what happens to mossy cell neuronal activity during seizures?</p>
<p>2. Only male mice were analyzed in the seizure induction experiments, leaving open the possibility of sex differences since previous reports suggest sex differences in adult neurogenesis.</p>
<p>3. Several control groups are missing:</p>
<p>
-For seizure induction: missing vehicle (instead of no KA treatment).</p>
<p>
-For TAM induction: missing corn oil only to check leakiness and specificity of transgene.</p>
<p>
-For DREADD experiment: missing vehicle (to control for hM3 non-specific effects)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The mechanisms by which seizures induce neurogenesis has remained unclear. Prior work from the authors demonstrated Mossy cell expressed Shh, that altered Shh expression follows epileptic seizures, and that Shh is a neural mitogen. Here authors show that Shh from mossy cells, which are well positioned between the pyramidal and granule cell layers, are a major source of signaling after seizures, contributing to seizure-induced neurogenesis. Moreover, they find that Mossy cell-sourced Shh is required for self-renewal of NSCs even outside of the context of seizures.</p>
<p>SVZ Gli1 expression was detected in NSCs and Gli1 reporter activity follows kainate-induced seizures. Heterozygous Shh mice show reduced seizure induced Shh signaling and reduced neurogenesis. After localizing Shh production to Mossy cells, authors removed Shh from Mossy cells and found reduced neurogenesis. By activating mossy cells through chemogenetic DREADD, they found that the effect of mossy cells on SVZ neurogenesis is activity-dependent, that Shh signaling activity is upregulated in NSCs by mossy cell neuronal activity, and that the induction of neurogenesis by mossy cell neuronal activity is compromised in the absence of Shh from mossy cells. In a series of experiments incorporating AAV DREADD, they find that mossy cell activity can contribute to neurogenesis in contralateral DG, and that seizure induced Shh may be transported along mossy axons. To examine long-term effects, they study mice several weeks after seizure, and find that suggesting that NSCs are less likely to return to their stem cell state after seizure-induced proliferation in the absence of Shh from mossy cells, and that Shh from mossy cells contributes to persistence of the NSC state during aging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The results are compelling and impactful, and the study is extremely well done. The various genetic lines in the study ensure robust results. Adequate consideration of statistics, methods of quantification, and avoidance of artifact is given.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
None identified.</p>

<p>1. The analysis of Shh deletion in mossy cells and influences of aging related NSC pool decline is not well connected with the rest of the study on the expression/requirement of Shh in mossy cells to regulate seizure-induced neurogenesis. To promote cohesion, the authors should examine/discuss what happens to mossy cells during aging - it is similar or different to what happens to mossy cell neuronal activity during seizures?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We believe that both are similar mechanisms. Seizure induced neurogenesis increases NSC proliferation, which increases demand of Shh to increase self-renewal. Similarly, we assume that increased NSC decline in Shh cKO mice is due to the increased demand of Shh for self-renewal of NSC with aging. It has been shown that NSCs in young mice generally don’t self-renew and instead are consumed after one or two rounds of cell division. On the other hand, NSCs in old mice are known to undergo more rounds of cell division compared with younger mice. This suggests that NSCs may be more dependent on signals driving self-renewal in aged-mice. Our suggestion is that Shh from mossy cells  contributes to minimising the NSC pool decline with aging, and therefore loss of Shh from mossy cells results in increased decline of the NSC pool in aged-Shh cKO mice. This aligns with our hypothesis that Shh from mossy cells contributes to maintenance of the NSC pool.</p>
<p>What is the exact mechanism regulating the shift of proliferation capacity of NSC with aging remains unclear and would be an interesting topic for future studies. In addition, whether mossy cell neuronal activity is decreased with age or Shh release/expression is compromised in aged animals remains to be elucidated. Considering these factors together, the brain region(s) and other factors that regulate neuronal activity of mossy cell thereby controlling Shh release and how these are dysregulated in pathological conditions and in aging will be important studies for future research.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Seizure induced neurogenesis was observed in both male and female mice. Considering that, we assumed that mossy cell derived Shh regulates seizure induced neurogenesis also in female mice. However, we agree with the reviewers’ comments. We can not exclude the possibility that female mice reacts to KA or seizures differently from male mice, or that Shh from mossy cells might have distinct effects in female mice in that paradigm. It is also an interesting possibility that female specific behaviors may affect mossy cell activation and also regulate neurogenesis though Shh. Because these are large and unresolved questions, we elected to leave potential sex difference in mossy cell regulated neurogenesis for future research.</p>

<p>1. Several control groups are missing:</p>
<p>-For seizure induction: missing vehicle (instead of no KA treatment).</p>
<p>-For TAM induction: missing corn oil only to check leakiness and specificity of transgene.</p>
<p>-For DREADD experiment: missing vehicle (to control for hM3 non-specific effects)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>About missing vehicles in KA treatments, we used saline (0.9% NaCl) as a vehicle for Kainic acid, which is commonly used as a vehicle for water soluable reagents in adult neurogenesis experiments. In addition, the average volume of KA solution that mice received intrapenitorially for seizure induction was less than 500ul, which is less than recommended maximum volume in NIH and UCSF. We have not tested if the saline injection makes a difference in our experiments but based on previous reports using saline, we believe that saline would not affect our experimental results.</p>
<p>About Tamoxifen injections, the Gli1-CreER mice have been widely used for fate tracing analysis including in our previous research where Gli1-CreER mice have shown specific recombination in Gli1-expressing NSCs. Our results in this study have shown consistently that Gli1-CreER;;Ai14 mice label NSCs in the dentate gyrus. Given this, we believe that our result using Gli1-CreER line are not affected by non-specific recombination without tamoxifen.</p>
<p>About Clozapine (CZL) injection, we decided to administer CLZ in both control and DREADD animals considering the possible side-effects of CLZ. We agree with the reviewer that our experiment cannot exclude the possibility that expression of hM3Dq affects neurogenesis without CLZ or CNO. However, although we have not included the analysis using saline as a control in our experiments, we have tested that both transgenic and virus-injected mice DREADD expressing mice respond to CLZ and activate neuronal activity of mossy cells compared with control animals. Therefore, we believe that it does not affect the interpretation of our data that mossy cell neuronal activity controls neurogenesis.</p>
<p>We appreciate reviewers' carefully considered comments and we will apply suggested controls to our future research.</p>
