<abstract><p>Brain metastasis (BrM) is a serious complication of advanced cancers and remains difficult to predict before clinical symptoms appear. To investigate shared transcriptional features of BrM across tumour types, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from malignant epithelial cells derived from six carcinoma types, including lung, breast, colorectal, renal, prostate, and melanoma. We applied ScaiVision, a supervised representation learning method, to classify tumour samples based on BrM status. The models achieved high predictive accuracy (area under the ROC curve &gt; 0.90) across all six cancer types. This analysis identified a consistent multi-cancer gene expression signature associated with BrM, defined at single-cell resolution. To evaluate the clinical relevance of this signature, we assessed its presence in tumour-educated platelets (TEPs) from blood samples of patients with and without BrM. The signature was detectable in platelet RNA and distinguished patients with BrM from those without, indicating that features of the BrM-associated expression program are reflected in blood-derived material. These findings demonstrate that a transcriptional signature of brain metastasis can be identified across multiple tumour types using scRNA-seq and neural network-based analysis. The detectability of this signature in TEPs supports its relevance in a non-invasive context and provides a basis for further investigation into its utility for BrM risk assessment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain metastases (BrM) are the most common intracranial tumours, occurring in approximately 20% of adult cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. They represent a devastating complication of systemic malignancy, with limited treatment options and poor survival outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Most BrMs arise from primary cancers of the lung, breast, melanoma, and other solid tumours, and their development often portends neurologic decline and dismal prognosis. Despite improvements in cancer care, effective means to predict, detect, or prevent BrM remain an unmet clinical need<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. In particular, the absence of robust biomarkers for early identification of patients at risk for BrM hampers timely intervention and surveillance strategies. This clinical burden and diagnostic gap underscore the urgency for deeper biological insights into BrM pathogenesis and markers of metastatic potential.</p>
<p>Recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have begun to characterise the cellular and molecular architecture of BrMs, although significant knowledge gaps persist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Single-cell approaches allow high-resolution dissection of the tumour microenvironment, revealing diverse cell types and states that contribute to brain metastatic colonisation. Notably, emerging scRNA-seq studies have identified certain conserved stromal and immune features across BrMs from different cancers. For example, cancer-associated fibroblasts within brain metastatic lesions display a remarkably conserved activation profile characterised by abundant type I collagen and wound-healing signatures, mirroring fibrotic programs seen in primary tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, metastasis-associated myeloid cells (including resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages) in BrM often converge on shared phenotypic states; for instance, coexisting pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and immunosuppressive (M2-like) macrophage subsets have been observed across brain metastases of various origins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. These conserved fibroblast and macrophage responses suggest that disparate tumour types co-opt parallel microenvironmental programs when colonising the brain. However, translating such biological insights into clinical diagnostics or therapies is not straightforward. In particular, the question remains how to leverage single-cell discoveries to identify predictive markers of BrM before metastases become clinically evident.</p>
<p>A multi-cancer approach to this question is especially valuable given that BrMs arise from multiple tumour lineages. To date, many studies of BrM have been siloed by cancer type, focusing, for example, on BrM in lung cancer or in breast cancer separately. While such studies have yielded important tumour-specific insights (for instance, single-cell analyses in lung adenocarcinoma have identified a distinct subpopulation of brain metastasis-associated tumour cells in the primary lung tumour, marked by genes such as S100A9, which correlates with subsequent BrM development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>), they may overlook metastasis mechanisms that are shared across diseases. A comparative, cross-tumour analysis can reveal universal drivers and biomarkers of brain metastatic spread that single-tumour studies might miss. Indeed, evidence is mounting that certain BrM-associated gene expression changes in the tumour microenvironment (e.g. in stromal or immune compartments) are conserved irrespective of the cancer’s tissue of origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Identifying such common signatures could inform broadly applicable diagnostic tools.</p>
<p>In light of the above, the present study leverages scRNA-seq across multiple cancer types to identify BrM-associated markers in primary tumours. We used an interpretable deep learning framework, Scailyte AG’s in-house platform, ScaiVision to extract biologically meaningful features from scRNAseq data while maintaining model transparency. ScaiVision employs supervised representation learning to generate low-dimensional, yet biologically relevant, embeddings that distinguish BrM cells from their primary tumour counterparts. Through integrated gradients-based feature attribution analysis, our model identifies the individual genes that drive classification decisions, thus enabling direct biological interpretation of its output. This architecture allows for cross-tumour generalisation while preserving cell-type specific signals critical for the identification of metastasis-associated features. We further employed these genes to create a scoring system that uncovers cells responsible for brain tropism and analysed the plausible mechanism of action of these cells intrinsically as well as in coordination with the microenvironment. The resultant BrM signature was also detectable in liquid biopsies, specifically tumour-educated platelets, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection and risk stratification. More broadly, this strategy demonstrates how interpretable machine learning applied to single-cell data can uncover clinically actionable biomarkers and mechanistic insights into metastatic progression across cancer types, offering a blueprint for similar applications in other metastatic or treatment-resistant disease contexts.</p>

<title>Modelling Brain Metastasis and Primary Cancers with Interpretable Neural Networks</title>
<p>Despite advancements in diagnostic techniques and therapeutic interventions, brain metastases (BrMs) remain associated with disproportionately high rates of morbidity and mortality. This clinical challenge underscores the urgent need to uncover robust molecular biomarkers that can facilitate early diagnosis, patient stratification, and development of targeted therapies across primary malignancies predisposed to cerebral dissemination. To address this unmet need, we designed a computational workflow centred on elucidating the transcriptional determinants of brain metastasis using single-cell transcriptomic profiles. Recognizing that conventional deep learning frameworks often function as “black boxes” and lack interpretability with respect to the biological relevance of features, we implemented a fully interpretable representation learning architecture tailored for single-cell classification. This framework enabled us not only to distinguish BrM samples from their primary tumour counterparts with high accuracy, but also to extract highly discriminative gene signatures that may define the metastatic phenotype at the single-cell level.</p>
<p>Our approach is grounded in the biological hypothesis that cells occupying transcriptionally similar states are likely to share functional and developmental programs, allowing us to infer the metastatic potential of individual cells based on gene expression similarities. Using this principle, we aimed to identify BrM-specific molecular programs and construct a brain metastasis signature enrichment score to evaluate their presence across individual cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We curated a dataset comprising single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 115 patient samples, including 21 brain metastases and 94 primary tumours (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). This dataset was divided into a training cohort (n=70; 13 BrM, 57 primary) and a validation cohort (n=45; 8 BrM, 37 primary) to support robust model development and independent performance assessment. To avoid bias from differences in cellular composition between primary and metastatic tumours, we restricted the model training to epithelial cells only (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Previous studies support the improved accuracy of epithelial cell-specific scRNA-seq signatures, emphasizing the importance of cell-type specificity in biomarker development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>To initiate model training (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>), we first selected highly variable genes (HVGs) from the gene expression matrix, reducing dimensionality while retaining key variance associated with biological signal. From this representation, representative cells were randomly sampled to ensure diversity and avoid sampling bias. Subsequently, the data were processed through a series of convolutional filters, which scanned across features to learn localized transcriptional patterns indicative of BrM or primary origin. These filter activations were passed through a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function to introduce non-linear transformations, followed by Top-K pooling, which retained the most informative features for classification optimizing model performance through extensive hyperparameter tuning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. The pooled features were then fed into a fully connected output layer with a SoftMax function, yielding class probabilities that distinguish BrM from primary samples. We trained a total of 300 deep learning models across six independent Monte Carlo cross-validation splits, each for up to 50 epochs, and retained the model weights corresponding to the epoch with the lowest validation loss to prevent overfitting. Evaluation metrics such as classification accuracy and cross-entropy log-loss demonstrated consistent performance and training stability across splits (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 1B-D</xref>), attesting to the robustness and generalizability of our learning architecture.</p>
<p>For downstream biological interpretation, we selected models exhibiting high discriminatory performance, defined as Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) &gt; 0.9 in the training set and AUC &gt; 0.8 in the validation set (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Further evaluation was made including accuracy and cross-entropy log-loss. This stringent filtering yielded a final ensemble of 223 predictive models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 1B-D</xref>), each capable of reliably identifying transcriptional features associated with metastatic potential. The high predictive accuracy of these models, coupled with their interpretability, lays a strong foundation for dissecting the molecular programs underpinning BrM.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of Gene Signature with High Accuracy in Prediction of BrM from Epithelial cells</title>
<p>To uncover the molecular drivers underpinning model predictions, we performed a systematic feature attribution analysis using Integrated Gradients (IG), implemented via the Captum.ai interpretability library<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This approach enables a principled estimation of each input gene’s contribution to the model’s output by integrating gradients of the prediction probability with respect to the input features. We applied IG across our ensemble of high-performing deep learning models to generate an aggregated attribution matrix that prioritizes genes based on their relevance in distinguishing brain metastasis (BrM) from primary tumour cells. Through this aggregation, we derived a consensus ranking of genes based on their mean attribution scores, ultimately identifying 173 highly variable genes (HVGs) with consistently high explanatory power across models. The top 20 most influential genes from this list are visualized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, while the complete ranked gene set is provided in Supplementary Table 2. We collectively refer to these genes as the BrM signature, representing a core set of transcriptional features that may be mechanistically or functionally linked to brain metastatic progression and therefore warrant further experimental validation and therapeutic exploration.</p>

</fig>
<p>To assess the biological relevance and predictive utility of the BrM signature across individual cells, we computed a relative metastatic potential score for each epithelial cell, spanning both BrM and primary tumor origins, using the UCell scoring framework, a rank-based enrichment scoring method optimized for single-cell datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). As anticipated, epithelial cells derived from histologically confirmed brain metastases exhibited consistently high metastatic potential scores, validating the sensitivity of our signature to known metastatic phenotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, a subset of epithelial cells within primary tumour samples also received high metastatic potential scores, suggesting the presence of transcriptionally primed subpopulations with latent metastatic capabilities. This finding reinforces the notion that metastatic potential can be heterogeneous within primary tumours and highlights the potential of our signature to prospectively identify high-risk cell populations prior to dissemination. Moreover, the BrM signature demonstrated robust predictive capacity across multiple cancer types (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>), further supporting its cross-tumour applicability and biological generalizability. To further stratify by metastatic potential, cells were binned into high-scoring (top 20%), mid-scoring (20-80%), and low-scoring (bottom 20%) groups. Differential pseudobulk gene expression analysis comparing high- and low-scoring cells identified significant transcriptional differences associated with elevated metastatic potential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), including upregulation of pathways related to extracellular matrix remodelling, extracellular structural organization, synaptic signalling, and cell adhesion in cells with high metastatic scores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These pathways are well-known contributors to metastatic processes, underscoring the biological validity of our signature.</p>
<p>To capture the dynamic progression from primary to metastatic states, we analysed paired scRNA-seq data from primary lung tumours and matched brain metastases from two patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, enabling direct assessment of our BrM signature across the metastatic continuum. Following standard preprocessing, BrM scores were computed for each cell using our established gene signature. As expected, scores were elevated in brain metastases, particularly within epithelial cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A-B</xref>). To map the trajectory of metastatic progression, we employed pseudotime analysis using Monocle2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Cells were embedded using DDRTree, revealing a pseudotemporal axis that strongly correlated with BrM scores, further validating the signature’s ability to capture transcriptional progression from primary to metastatic states (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). To pinpoint genes with dynamic regulation across this trajectory, we applied GeneSwitches R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, identifying key genes activated or repressed over pseudotime. Genes such as ZBTB16, NFIA, NKD1, and SOX6 were switched on, while DOCK2, IGHA1, and MUC1 were switched off (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2C</xref>). These genes include transcription factors and surface proteins with potential roles in metastatic transition and niche adaptation.</p>
<p>Gene ontology analysis of these temporally regulated genes revealed enrichment of biological processes including cell proliferation, adhesion, lymphocyte activation, and immune development. Notably, immune-related pathways, such as B-cell receptor signalling and phagocytic engulfment, were selectively upregulated during later stages of pseudotime, implicating them in the final stages of metastatic establishment within the brain (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2D</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>VEGF Signalling Correlates with BrM Score and Distinguishes Cell-Cell Networks in Primary Tumours and Brain Metastases</title>
<p>To broaden the scope of our analysis, we applied the BrM signature across the entire single-cell dataset, which includes a range of tumour and stromal cell types. This confirmed high BrM scores in cells from established brain metastases but also identified high-scoring cells within primary tumours, supporting the signature’s potential to flag cells at risk of metastasis even before dissemination. High-scoring cells were found across multiple cancer types (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figures 3A-C</xref>), and across diverse cell populations including monocytes, endothelial cells, neuroepithelial cells, and neutrophils. Following our established stratification (top 20%, middle 60%, bottom 20%), differential pseudobulk gene expression analysis revealed distinct transcriptional programs in high-scoring cells. These were enriched in pathways related to extracellular matrix remodelling, immune modulation, chemotaxis, and cell adhesion (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3D</xref>), processes closely tied to metastatic progression.</p>
<p>Recognizing the BrM signature’s ability to identify metastatic potential across both tumour and stromal compartments, we next investigated cell-cell communication networks that might drive this phenotype. Tumour-stroma communication is well-documented as a key factor in cancer metastasis and treatment response, particularly within the complex microenvironment of the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Using CellChat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> to identify the differential number of interactions between high- vs low-scoring cells, we found that several signalling pathways were significantly upregulated in high-scoring cells, with ANGPT emerging as the most enriched. VEGF signalling was also markedly more active in high-scoring cells compared to low-scoring ones (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Endothelial cells were key players in this communication, particularly through the VEGFA-VEGFR1 ligand-receptor axis, known to be associated with metastatic progression in various cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3E</xref>). To validate these findings, we used LIANA (LIgand-receptor ANAlysis tool<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>), a consensus-based tool aggregating multiple cell-cell interaction algorithms. LIANA analysis confirmed the dominant role of epithelial cells as senders and endothelial cells as receivers in high-scoring populations and again highlighted VEGFA-VEGFR1 as a central interaction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B-C</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine whether communication patterns varied by tumour site, we separately analysed high-scoring cells from primary tumours and BrM samples. While VEGF signalling remained a consistent feature across both contexts, the structure of the interaction networks shifted. In primary tumours, epithelial cells played a more prominent signalling role, whereas dendritic cells were more influential within BrM sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). These findings point to a dynamic reconfiguration of VEGF-related communication networks as metastases establish in the brain.</p>
<p>Finally, we explored the transcriptional dynamics of VEGF target genes during metastatic progression. Using literature-derived VEGF targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and UCell scoring, we observed a gradual increase in VEGF target expression across cells binned by BrM score (in 10% increments), with expression peaking in the highest-scoring group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). This trend was supported by a strong correlation between VEGF signalling scores and BrM scores (R = 0.7, p &lt; 2.2e-16) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3F</xref>). These results underscore the importance of VEGF signalling not just as a marker, but potentially as a functional driver of metastatic transition. Together, our findings suggest that VEGF-mediated tumour-stroma interactions, particularly via VEGFA-VEGFR1, are critical in supporting the emergence and survival of metastatic cells in the brain.</p>

<title>Gene Regulatory Network Analysis Identifies ETS1 as a Putative Regulator of VEGF-driven Brain Metastasis</title>
<p>VEGF signalling has been consistently implicated in angiogenesis and metastatic progression, and our previous analyses suggest its involvement across diverse tumour lineages in brain metastasis. To investigate the regulatory control underpinning this VEGF-driven BrM phenotype, we examined transcriptional regulatory networks that may govern VEGF pathway activity during metastatic progression.</p>
<p>We analysed single-cell RNA-seq data from two patients with matched primary lung tumours and brain metastases, previously used in our pseudotime analyses. Cells were stratified into nine equal-sized bins according to their BrM signature score distribution, allowing us to trace regulatory changes across a continuum of BrM potential. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were independently inferred for each bin using CellOracle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, enabling the identification of transcription factors (TFs) with differential connectivity as a function of metastatic progression. In the highest BrM score group, where VEGF pathway gene expression was also most pronounced, TFs such as MYC, STAT1, MEF2C, and notably ETS1 demonstrated high degree centrality (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating their potential importance in coordinating pro-metastatic transcriptional programs. Among these, ETS1 emerged as a particularly compelling candidate due to its well-established role in regulating VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and tissue invasion. By comparing TF connectivity across bins, we observed a progressive increase in ETS1 regulatory influence, paralleling VEGF pathway activation and BrM score enrichment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We next focused on characterising ETS1 activity in the broader multi-cancer dataset to assess its relevance in a VEGF-driven BrM context. Although ETS1 transcript abundance was modest, consistent with known limitations of scRNA-seq in capturing TFs, its expression levels increased with higher BrM scores (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). To better quantify its regulatory activity, we extracted ETS1 target genes from the inferred CellOracle networks and calculated a UCell enrichment score for each cell based on the expression of these downstream targets. This GRN-derived ETS1 activity score exhibited a clear upward trajectory across BrM score bins (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that ETS1 not only correlates with VEGF-driven metastatic potential, but may also act as a functional regulator of the transcriptional programs underlying this phenotype.</p>
<p>Together, these findings highlight ETS1 as a putative transcriptional regulator of VEGF-associated gene networks in brain metastasis. By integrating regulatory network inference with activity scoring and expression profiling, we reveal a layered regulatory architecture that underlies the VEGF-driven BrM phenotype. This approach allows us to sensitively detect key transcriptional drivers, even when expression alone is insufficient, and underscores the value of network-based strategies for dissecting the regulatory basis of metastasis to the brain.</p>

<title>Spatial Transcriptomics Reveal VEGF-Driven Microenvironments in BrM Regions</title>
<p>To expand our transcriptomic insights, we analysed spatial transcriptomics data derived from four patients diagnosed with colorectal brain metastases. This approach enabled us not only to validate the BrM signature directly within the tissue architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> but also to investigate how metastatic potential varies across distinct microanatomical regions of the tumour and improve our understanding of metastasis biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We applied UCell scoring to map BrM signature activity across the entirety of each spatial transcriptomic slide. Remarkably, cells exhibiting high BrM signature scores were not confined solely to the tumour core; instead, they extended into peripheral tumour regions, including areas proximal to blood vessels and sites of tumour-associated inflammation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4A</xref>).

</fig>
<p>To further dissect molecular differences underpinning these variations, we performed differential gene expression analysis comparing high-scoring regions (top 20% BrM signature activity) to all other tumour areas. This analysis identified enrichment of pathways involved in mitochondrial function, endosomal transport, vesicle localization, and Ras signalling (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings highlight active cellular processes potentially driving or sustaining metastatic behaviour within these spatially distinct niches.</p>
<p>Given the well-established role of VEGF signalling in promoting brain metastasis, we next utilised CellChat to characterize spatial patterns of intercellular communication. VEGF-mediated interactions were consistently prominent across all patient samples, particularly between tumour cells and blood vessel-associated stromal regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, these VEGF-enriched zones strongly overlapped with regions exhibiting elevated BrM signature scores (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), reinforcing the link between VEGF signalling and enhanced metastatic capacity. To visualize these dynamics in situ, we projected VEGF pathway activity directly onto spatial maps of tumour sections. This projection revealed pronounced enrichment of VEGF signalling in tumour-adjacent vascular niches and inflammation-associated areas, microenvironments critical for tumour-stromal crosstalk and likely contributors to metastatic progression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we examined the spatial distribution of the key VEGF signalling ligand-receptor pair VEGFA-VEGFR1, which we previously identified as in the pan-cancer scRNA-seq data. Spatial mapping revealed enrichment of VEGFA-VEGFR1 interactions specifically within high-scoring metastatic regions. This ligand-receptor interaction was predominantly localized in regions associated with active tumour growth and inflammation, indicating its likely role in promoting metastatic dissemination and tumour cell survival within the metastatic microenvironment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). This suggests that VEGFA-VEGFR1 signalling plays a pivotal role in supporting tumour cell survival, angiogenesis, and dissemination within the brain metastatic niche, as a central axis that facilitate metastatic progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Drug repurposing analysis identifies Pazopanib as a potential therapeutic candidate targeting VEGF-driven brain metastasis</title>
<p>To identify potential therapeutic compounds capable of reversing the transcriptional programs associated with high metastatic risk, specifically those linked to VEGF-driven brain metastasis, we employed the ASGARD R package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> on our integrated multi-cancer single-cell RNA-seq dataset. Cells were stratified according to their BrM scores, with the top 20% defined as high- BrM and the bottom 20% as low-BrM. Differential gene expression analysis was then conducted using limma, comparing high- versus low-scoring cells to identify genes consistently up- or downregulated in the metastatic state.</p>
<p>The resulting differentially expressed genes served as input to ASGARD’s drug repurposing pipeline, which mines the extensive L1000 drug-response dataset, comprising over 590,000 compound profiles, to identify small molecules capable of reversing the metastatic gene expression signature.

<p>Among the top-ranking candidates was Pazopanib, a multi-kinase inhibitor with known clinical activity in metastatic cancer, and a well-established inhibitor of VEGF receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Given our earlier findings implicating VEGF signalling as a key driver of the BrM phenotype, we further examined Pazopanib’s mechanism of action across cancer types in our dataset. Using ASGARD, we extracted the predicted Pazopanib-responsive genes in high BrM-scoring cells and mapped these targets onto cell types and signalling pathways (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Pazopanib’s regulatory footprint included modulation of VEGF-associated gene expression in epithelial tumour cells, endothelial compartments, and stromal fibroblasts, indicating potential to disrupt both tumour-intrinsic and microenvironmental drivers of metastasis. Further experimental validation is required to assess its efficacy in BrM-specific models, and to explore potential synergy with existing therapies. By directly targeting the transcriptional underpinnings of VEGF-associated metastatic programs, Pazopanib could serve as a precision therapeutic agent to mitigate the risk or progression of brain metastasis across multiple tumour types.</p>

<title>BrM Scoring Is Detectable in Tumour-Educated Platelets of BrM patients</title>
<p>Given the clinical need for non-invasive, real-time biomarkers to monitor metastatic disease progression, we sought to determine whether our brain metastasis (BrM) gene signature could be detected in peripheral blood samples from cancer patients. Liquid biopsy approaches, such as blood-based transcriptomic profiling, offer several advantages over tissue biopsies, including minimal patient discomfort, feasibility for repeated sampling, and the potential for dynamic disease monitoring over time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To investigate this, we leveraged a publicly available bulk RNA-sequencing dataset derived from tumour-educated platelets (TEPs) collected from patients representing seven distinct cancer types. This cohort included individuals with and without metastatic disease, allowing us to compare transcriptional profiles between these two clinical states. As a preliminary step, we focused on the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signalling pathway, owing to its well-established role in promoting angiogenesis and metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Analysis revealed that the mean mRNA expression of VEGF pathway genes was significantly elevated in patients with metastatic cancer compared to healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01). However, when comparing patients with primary tumours to those with brain metastases, VEGF gene expression did not differ significantly (p = NS) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>), indicating that VEGF, although elevated in general metastatic disease, lacks the specificity required to distinguish brain metastases from primary tumours.</p>

</fig>
<p>We next assessed the performance of our 20-gene BrM signature in the same dataset. Remarkably, all 20 BrM genes were significantly upregulated in TEPs from patients with brain metastases compared to both healthy donors (p &lt; 0.01 for each gene) and patients harbouring only primary tumours (p &lt; 0.05 for each gene) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Importantly, none of the BrM signature genes showed differential expression between the primary tumour and healthy groups (p = NS for all), underscoring the specificity of the signature for metastatic brain involvement.</p>
<p>These findings demonstrate that, unlike VEGF, the BrM signature yields a robust, metastasis-specific transcriptional signal in circulating platelets. This distinct molecular profile enables accurate discrimination between brain-metastatic and non-metastatic cases, thereby positioning the BrM signature as a promising candidate for a blood-based biomarker of metastatic progression in a clinically relevant liquid biopsy context. They underscore its translational potential for early detection, prognosis, and monitoring of metastatic brain disease in cancer patients, offering a powerful, non-invasive tool for guiding therapeutic decision-making and surveillance.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Brain metastases (BrMs) represent a difficult clinical challenge in oncology. They are the most common intracranial tumours in adults and occur in an estimated 9-17% of all cancer patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Notably, BrMs arise most frequently from lung cancers, breast cancers, and melanomas, these three primaries collectively accounting for roughly 70% of all BrM cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The prognosis of patients with BrM is poor, and early detection is notoriously difficult because there are no routine brain metastasis screening protocols and current imaging modalities have limited sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Consequently, many BrMs go undiagnosed until they become symptomatic, at which point therapeutic options are largely palliative. This clinical reality underlines the urgent need for improved strategies to predict and detect BrMs at a stage when intervention might substantially improve patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>A central insight from our study is the power of a multi-cancer analytical framework to uncover shared mechanisms underlying brain metastasis (BrM), beyond tumour-specific constraints. Prior efforts to define metastasis-associated transcriptional programs have largely been restricted to individual tumour types, limiting their generalisability across malignancies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. In contrast, recent evidence suggests that metastatic lesions arising from distinct primaries can converge on common gene expression states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Guided by this principle, we integrated scRNA-seq data from multiple tumour types to identify a BrM-associated gene signature that transcends tissue of origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We applied ScaiVision’s supervised representation learning framework to train neural networks that classify BrM status at single-cell resolution. This approach learns tumour-agnostic low-dimensional representations that maximise separation between BrM and non-BrM cells, while preserving biological granularity.</p>
<p>Unlike conventional cluster-based or pseudobulk analyses, this method avoids averaging artefacts and enables interpretable models. Feature attribution using integrated gradients yielded a robust set of BrM-associated genes, ranked by their contribution to classification. Importantly, the resulting signature was reproducible across independent cohorts and computational strategies, supporting its generalisability. Collectively, these findings establish that a robust, cross-cancer BrM transcriptional programme can be derived from single-cell data, offering a framework for mechanistic dissection and translational development.</p>
<p>Scoring cells across our integrated dataset confirmed that the BrM signature is broadly conserved across tumour types and cellular compartments. Brain metastases from diverse primaries, lung, breast, renal, converged on a shared transcriptional programme, underscoring a common set of molecular adaptations required for brain colonisation. Despite distinct genetic lineages, metastatic cells consistently upregulated genes linked to angiogenesis, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, and intercellular signalling. Importantly, BrM signature genes extended beyond tumour-intrinsic expression. Many encode secreted ligands or receptors mediating tumour-microenvironment communication. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed robust crosstalk between malignant and host brain cells, with pro-angiogenic signalling, particularly via the VEGF pathway, emerging as a recurrent axis. This interactional footprint was conserved across metastases, suggesting a generalised mechanism of stromal engagement. Notably, VEGF family members such as VEGFA and PlGF were consistently upregulated, implicating VEGF, VEGFR1 signalling in endothelial disruption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, consistent with prior studies. These signals are known to trigger MMP-mediated ECM degradation and junctional disassembly, facilitating tumour extravasation into brain parenchyma. Our signature’s enrichment for angiogenesis and ECM remodelling aligns closely with established mechanisms of metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, reinforcing its biological relevance and potential utility in identifying pan-cancer vulnerabilities in BrM.</p>
<p>To further validate and contextualise the BrM signature, we integrated spatial transcriptomics and external datasets. Spatial profiling of brain metastasis tissue confirmed that key signature genes exhibit precise localisation patterns consistent with tumour-host interaction niches. Angiogenic ligands such as VEGFA were enriched at the tumour-stroma interface, while their cognate receptors (e.g., VEGFR1) were expressed by adjacent endothelial and immune cells, providing spatial evidence for the ligand-receptor crosstalk inferred from single-cell data. This co-localisation underscores the in-situ relevance of the BrM programme and its role in shaping the metastatic niche. Cross-cohort validation using independent scRNAseq datasets from matched primary and brain metastatic samples demonstrated consistent upregulation of BrM signature genes in brain lesions across cancer types. Signature scores robustly distinguished metastases from their primary counterparts, confirming the signature’s generalisability and specificity for the metastatic state.</p>
<p>To explore the BrM signature’s clinical utility, we assessed its detectability in peripheral blood. Transcriptomic analysis of tumour-educated platelets (TEPs) revealed clear expression of signature genes in patients with brain metastases, but not in non-metastatic controls, supporting the notion that circulating platelets capture tumour-derived signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. While VEGF-related transcripts were consistently enriched, they lacked sufficient specificity. By contrast, the broader BrM signature reliably distinguished brain metastases from primary tumours across cancer types, reflecting a distinct transcriptional programme associated with brain tropism. These observations highlight the potential of the BrM signature as a non-invasive biomarker. Its expression across diverse tumour origins and enrichment in matched metastatic samples position it as a candidate for early detection and risk stratification. In particular, the ability to detect signature transcripts in TEPs offers a feasible path toward liquid biopsy-based diagnostics. Such an assay could complement imaging by identifying metastasis prior to radiographic detection and enabling real-time monitoring of disease activity behind the blood-brain barrier. Given the frequency of brain metastases in malignancies such as lung, breast, and melanoma, a platelet-based test could have broad translational relevance in guiding surveillance and treatment response.</p>
<p>Among high BrM-scoring cells, MYC and ETS1 emerged as dominant transcriptional regulators, highlighting their potential role in driving brain metastasis. Both factors are established oncogenic drivers, with c-Myc coordinating programmes spanning proliferation, metabolic reprogramming, immune modulation, and angiogenesis, key processes in metastatic progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. ETS1, a master regulator of invasion and neo-angiogenesis, was especially prominent due to its direct activation of matrix-remodelling enzymes and VEGF signalling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Notably, ETS1 activity increased in parallel with BrM scores, implicating it in the gradual acquisition of metastatic traits. Elevated ETS1 activity suggests a central role in preparing the metastatic niche, particularly through ECM remodelling and vascular co-option—mechanisms critical for colonisation of the brain. ETS1 has also been linked to the induction of L1CAM, a neural adhesion molecule that facilitates tumour cell adaptation to the brain microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, further reinforcing its contribution to brain-tropic behaviour.</p>
<p>The functional relevance of this axis is underscored by our drug repurposing analysis, which identified pazopanib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor with brain-penetrant properties, as a candidate therapeutic. Pazopanib has shown intracranial activity in clinical settings, including regression of brain metastases in patients resistant to prior therapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Similar agents, such as sunitinib, have demonstrated efficacy in lung cancer with brain metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, supporting the premise that BrM-high cells depend on angiogenic signalling for survival and expansion. These findings point to the feasibility of anti-angiogenic strategies in curbing metastatic outgrowth within the brain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study delineates a transcriptional programme underpinning brain metastasis, anchored by regulators such as MYC and ETS1, and captured by a robust BrM gene signature. This work provides mechanistic insight into metastatic adaptation at the brain interface and presents actionable avenues for diagnosis and treatment. Further functional studies and prospective validation will be essential to translate these insights into clinical tools for early detection and targeted intervention, ultimately improving outcomes for patients at risk of or living with brain metastases.</p>

<title>Drug Repurposing Screen</title>
<p><italic>In silico</italic> drug repurposing was performed using ASGARD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> with default parameters. Normalized scRNA-seq counts from cells grouped by metastatic score (low score = control) served as input, comparing against the LINCS L1000 drug perturbation database. Drug scores were calculated, identifying candidates with significant scores across relevant comparisons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4l">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Analyses were performed in R (v4.3.1). Comparisons between groups were made using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. P-values from multiple tests were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg method (FDR &lt; 0.05) A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant for other tests.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper applies ScaiVision, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based supervised representation learning method, to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from six carcinoma types. The goal is to identify a pan-cancer gene expression signature of brain metastasis (BrM) that is both interpretable and clinically useful. The authors report:</p>
<p>(1) High classification accuracy for distinguishing primary tumours from brain metastases (AUC &gt; 0.9 in training, &gt; 0.8 in validation).</p>
<p>(2) Discovery of a 173-gene BrM signature, with a robust top-20 core.</p>
<p>(3) Evidence that the BrM signature is detectable in tumour-educated platelets (TEPs), enabling a potential non-invasive biomarker.</p>
<p>(4) Mechanistic analyses implicating VEGF-VEGFR1 signaling and ETS1 as central drivers of BrM.</p>
<p>(5) A computational drug repurposing screen highlighting pazopanib as a candidate therapeutic.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Biological scope:</p>
<p>Integration of six tumour types highlights shared mechanisms of brain metastasis, beyond tumour-specific studies.</p>
<p>(2) Interpretability:</p>
<p>Use of integrated gradients on ScaiVision models identifies genes that drive classification, linking predictions to interpretable biology.</p>
<p>(3) Multi-modal validation:</p>
<p>BrM signature validated across scRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, pseudotime analyses, and liquid biopsy data.</p>
<p>(4) Translational potential:</p>
<p>Detection in TEPs provides a promising path toward a blood-based biomarker.</p>
<p>(5) Therapeutic angle:</p>
<p>Drug repurposing analysis identifies VEGF-targeting compounds, with pazopanib highlighted.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Methodological contribution is limited:</p>
<p>ScaiVision is an existing proprietary framework; the paper does not introduce a new method.</p>
<p>No baseline comparisons (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, scVI, simple MLP) are presented, so the added value of CNNs over simpler models is unclear.</p>
<p>(2) Data constraints:</p>
<p>The dataset size is modest (115 samples, of which 21 are BrM), though thousands of cells per sample.</p>
<p>Training relies on patient-level labels, with subsampling to generate examples - a multi-instance learning setup that could be benchmarked more explicitly.</p>
<p>(3) Validation gaps:</p>
<p>Biomarker detection in platelets is based on retrospective bulk RNA-seq; no prospective patient validation is included.</p>
<p>Mechanistic claims (ETS1, VEGF) are computational inferences without wet-lab validation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This important study describes a deep learning framework that analyzes single-cell RNA data to identify tumor-agnostic gene signature associated with brain metastases. The identified signature uncovers key molecular mechanisms like VEGF signaling and highlights its potential therapeutic targets. It also assessed the performance of the gene signature in liquid biopsy and showed that the brain metastases signature yields a robust, metastasis-specific transcriptional signal in circulating platelets, suggesting potential for non-invasive diagnostics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The approach is multi-cancer, identifying mechanisms shared across diseases beyond tumor-specific constraints.</p>
<p>(2) Robust and explainable deep learning method workflow that utilized scRNA-seq data from various cancer types, demonstrating solid predictive accuracy.</p>
<p>(3) The detection of the BrM signature in tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) indicates a promising avenue for developing liquid biopsy assays, which could significantly enhance early detection capabilities.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The paper lacks a thorough comparison with other reported signatures in the literature, which could help contextualize the performance and uniqueness of the authors' findings.</p>
<p>(2) The model training focused solely on epithelial cells, potentially overlooking critical contributions from stromal and immune cell types, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment.</p>
<p>(3) While the results are promising, there is a need for validation across tumor types not included in the training set to assess the generalizability of the signature.</p>
<p>Achievements:</p>
<p>The authors have made significant progress toward their aims, successfully identifying a transcriptional signature that is associated with brain metastasis across multiple cancer types. The results support their conclusions, showcasing the BrM signature's ability to distinguish between metastatic and primary tumor cells and its potential usability as a non-invasive biomarker.</p>
<p>This study has the potential to make a substantial impact in oncological research and clinical practice, particularly in the management of patients at risk for brain metastasis. The identification of a gene signature applicable across various tumor types could lead to the development of standardized diagnostic tools for early detection. Moreover, the emphasis on non-invasive diagnostic techniques aligns well with the current trends in precision medicine, making the findings highly relevant for the broader medical community.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The article develops a CNN-based metastasis scoring system to distinguish cell subsets with high brain metastatic potential and validates its performance using patient platelet data. The robustness of this approach is further demonstrated across diverse single-cell and spatial datasets from multiple cancers, supported by transcription factor and gene set analyses, as well as novel drug identification pipelines. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that reinforces the central theme of the study.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Development of a CNN-based scoring system to reveal the potential of brain metastasis that is robust across multiple cancer cell types, validated by multiple datasets. Other approaches, including transcription factor analyses, cell-cell communication analysis, and spatial transcriptomic, etc., were included to strengthen the work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The author could identify/validate more signaling pathways beyond the VEGF pathway since it's well known in metastasis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work provides a gene signature for brain metastases derived from an integrated single-cell dataset of six carcinomas. A key rationale for their approach is the notion that metastases originating from different organs may converge upon a similar set of transcriptional states, representing shared functional and developmental programs. By combining primary tumor and metastatic brain tumor, the authors leverage an interpretable deep-learning approach to identify a multi-cancer single-cell dataset to predict brain metastases from a primary tumor that is more robust and generalizable than a signature derived from an individual cancer type. They employ a variety of single-cell tools to identify a putative mechanism of action for metastatic progression to the brain involving VEGF-related signaling, and find some evidence supporting this hypothesis in spatial data. A drug repurposing analysis is performed to identify a potential therapeutic candidate for VEGF-driven brain metastasis, and they demonstrate an intriguing possibility for using their brain metastasis signature in a blood-based test in the clinic.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>An interpretable deep-learning approach allows both for high-accuracy classification of brain metastases from primary tumors and the identification of a gene signature. Much work goes into validating the gene signature in different contexts and different modalities, and presents a cohesive picture of metastasis progression. The analysis highlighting certain cells within the primary tumor that may be more likely to metastasize is interesting, and the demonstration of the difference in mean expression of their signature in bulk RNASeq of tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) has strong implications for the clinic.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors derive the signature from cancerous epithelial cells, citing a desire to avoid bias from differences in cellular composition; yet much of the downstream analysis is performed across different cancer types and different cell types; differential analysis was then performed between the highest scoring cells vs lowest scoring cells, but there does not appear to be any consideration/adjustment for cell type composition at this stage, which could bias results. Given that the signature was initially identified in epithelial cells, there seems to be a leap to applying the signature to immune and stromal compartments. Perhaps the proof is in the pudding, yet it raises the question of what would have happened if the authors had not restricted the initial step of their signature generation to the epithelial cells.</p>
<p>In addition, although a cohesive story around VEGF is presented, VEGF was merely one of the several signaling pathways upregulated. There were quite a few others (ANGPT, CDH1, CADM, IGF), which are not addressed by the authors. VEGF is, of course, very well studied, and while the authors do distinguish their signature from VEGF in the context of TEP, it leaves open the question of whether one of the other highlighted genes may be equally powerful and more feasible (because there are fewer genes) to get into the clinic.</p>
<p>The cell-cell communication analysis seems somewhat weak, although using a standard set of tools. Most of the analysis was done based on single-cell data, without the spatial context, and the authors highlighted epithelial cells as the senders for the VEGF pathway; yet in the Visium data, the expression of the signature seems highest in non-tumor cells, and the strongest interactions seem to be quite spatially separated (Figure 5C and 5E).</p>
