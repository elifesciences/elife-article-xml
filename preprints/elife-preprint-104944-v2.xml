<abstract><p>When a population of bacteria are exposed to a bactericidal antibiotic most cells die rapidly. However, a sub-population of antibiotic-tolerant cells known as “persister cells” can survive for prolonged periods, and antibiotic tolerance can be strongly induced in a population by stresses such as nutrient deprivation. However, the pathways required to maintain viability in this setting, and how they are regulated are poorly understood. To identify genetic determinants of antibiotic tolerance in mycobacteria, we carried out transposon mutagenesis insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) screens in <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> (<italic>Mabs</italic>) exposed to bactericidal translation-inhibiting antibiotics. This analysis identified genes essential for the survival of both spontaneous persister cells as well as for stress-induced tolerance, allowing the first genetic comparison of these states in mycobacteria. Pathway analysis identified multiple genes involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), including the catalase-peroxidase <italic>katG</italic>, which contributed to survival in both stressed and un-stressed populations. In addition, we found that endogenous ROS were generated following antibiotic exposure, and that hypoxia significantly impaired bacterial killing. Thus, in <italic>Mabs</italic>, the lethality of some antibiotics is amplified by toxic ROS accumulation, and antibiotic-tolerant cells require detoxification systems to remain viable.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A key goal of antibiotic therapy is, in conjunction with the immune system, to eradicate the infecting bacteria. While many common bacterial infections respond rapidly to antibiotics, with 1-2 weeks of therapy sufficient to achieve high cure rates, there are also infections where bacterial clearance is slow and often incomplete<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This challenge is exemplified by mycobacterial infections. Fully-susceptible <italic>Mtb</italic> requires multiple antibiotics for four months or longer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, and infections by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) such as <italic>Mycobacterium abscessus</italic> (<italic>Mabs</italic>) are often even more difficult to eradicate; <italic>Mabs</italic> often requires treatment for 12-18 months, and even then has a 50% relapse rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>While the ability of mycobacteria to escape antibiotic-mediated killing is multifactorial, the phenomenon of antibiotic tolerance is likely an important contributor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Studies dating from the 1940s noted that when a population of susceptible bacteria were exposed to a bactericidal antibiotic such as penicillin, the majority of the population died within a few hours, but that a small sub-population of cells remained viable for days<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, these antibiotic-tolerant cells referred to as “persister cells” had not acquired a mutation conferring heritable antibiotic resistance, and do not grow in the presence of the antibiotic. Rather, they had entered into a readily-reversable phenotypic state where, despite antibiotic-mediated inhibition of critical processes, they are able to survive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. In addition, a number of physiologic stresses increase antibiotic tolerance in a population, as bacterial cell death is markedly slowed by stresses such as nutrient deprivation or acidic pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, these same stresses are encountered in the lysosome of an activated immune cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, and studies of pathogens isolated from activated macrophages indeed show a strong immune-mediated increase antibiotic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, paradoxically, the immune system can actually impede bacterial eradication by antibiotics.</p>
<p>Antibiotic tolerance has been studied extensively in model systems such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which has provided important insights, but also highlighted uncertainties of current models. Several different regulators of antibiotic tolerance have been identified in <italic>E. coli</italic> including the HipBA toxin-antitoxin system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, guanosine pentaphosphate ((p)ppGpp) synthesis by RelA/SpoT enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, and the activity of Lon protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In each of these models, the postulated mechanism is to arrest cell division and render the process targeted by antibiotics non-essential. However, important questions remain unanswered. It is unclear how cells remain viable when critical processes such as transcription or translation are blocked by antibiotics, as well as how the process is regulated and induced by stress. Even the mechanism of cell death following antibiotic exposure itself has been a matter of debate - originally antibiotics were presumed to kill bacteria as a direct result of inhibition of their target molecule, such as β-lactam antibiotics disrupting cell wall integrity, directly leading to mechanical cell lysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. However, a number of studies, largely from <italic>E. coli</italic>, have demonstrated that in addition to the initial target inhibition, which may be bacteriostatic, bactericidal antibiotics can also cause secondary lethal ROS accumulation, leading to cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Mycobacterial persister cells are particularly resilient, as <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (<italic>Msmeg</italic>) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)</italic> persisters can endure many weeks of antibiotic exposure, and stress-induced antibiotic tolerance develops readily<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. <italic>Mabs</italic> is a species of rapidly-growing mycobacteria, with a doubling time of ∼4h in rich media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and while often environmental, it causes opportunistic infections in patients with structural lung disease such as cystic fibrosis. It is also among the most difficult of all bacterial pathogens to treat, because in addition to forming persister cells, it is also intrinsically resistant to many classes of antibiotics, leaving few treatment options<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. This leads to the use of antibiotics with greater toxicity to patients, and a need to use these agents for prolonged periods to prevent relapse. Thus, identifying the genes that <italic>Mabs</italic> persister cells rely on for survival, as well as the genes involved in the induction and maintenance of stress-induced antibiotic tolerance might highlight pathways that could be targeted therapeutically to eliminate antibiotic-tolerant cells.</p>
<p>Previous genetic screens have studied antibiotic responses in mycobacteria, with some evaluating heritable resistance, and others investigating tolerance. Several studies of resistance have successfully used either transposon mutagenesis with insertion site sequencing (Tn-Seq) or CRISPR-based transcriptional repression with high-throughput sequencing of guide RNAs (CRISPRi) to identify genes promoting growth in sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. These studies have provided insights such as highlighting the importance of cell membrane permeability as a mechanism controlling antibiotic penetration into the cytoplasm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Persister formation has proven challenging to study, likely because the low frequency of persisters leads to population bottlenecks that confound genetic analysis. Although screens in <italic>Mtb</italic> have been conducted in macrophages and mice, and genes such as <italic>glpK</italic> and <italic>cinA</italic> identified, overall the number of mutants isolated in these screens has been low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. There has been one effective in vitro Tn-Seq study examining antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Mtb</italic> exposed to starvation and rifampin that isolated over 100 mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, demonstrating the feasibility of genetic screening in this context. However, whether these phenotypes seen with rifampin in <italic>Mtb</italic> extend to other mycobacteria and other antibiotics remain to be determined.</p>
<p>Here, we study antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Mabs</italic> and describe the results of a genome-wide Tn-seq screens seeking to identify the genes required for both spontaneous persister cell survival as well as starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance following exposure to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We identified several discrete processes contributing to survival and observed a prominent role for ROS detoxifying factors such as the catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG, which contributed to both spontaneous persister survival and starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance. Consistent with the protection conferred by KatG, we found that endogenous ROS accumulated following antibiotic exposure, and that the removal of oxygen significantly impaired bacterial killing. Taken together these findings support a model in mycobacteria where the lethality of translation-inhibiting antibiotics is amplified by a secondary accumulation of toxic ROS, and that survival requires active detoxification systems.</p>

<title>Starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance in mycobacteria</title>
<p>We first sought to develop conditions suitable for genetic analysis of persister cell survival and stress-induced antibiotic tolerance mycobacteria. Genetic screens examining persister cell physiology face two inherent obstacles. First, these cells are rare in unstressed bacterial populations, and antibiotic-mediated cell death creates population bottlenecks that obscure mutant phenotypes. Second, most mycobacterial populations contain spontaneous drug-resistant mutants that can expand if the population is exposed to a single antibiotic. To overcome these obstacles, we sought to establish large-scale, high-density culture conditions to prevent genetic bottlenecks, and used multiple antibiotics to suppress spontaneous drug-resistant mutants. We began by assessing the feasibility of this approach using wild-type <italic>Msmeg.</italic> We exposed the cells to either the combination of rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol (RIF/INH/EMB) used to treat <italic>Mtb</italic>, or to the combination of tigecycline and linezolid (TIG/LZD), two translation-inhibiting antibiotics frequently used to treat <italic>Mabs</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and empirically determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) for each antibiotic under the high-density culture conditions that would be needed for genetic analysis of persister cells. Both antibiotic combinations reduced the bacterial population &gt;1000-fold within 72h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then evaluated both spontaneous persister formation and stress-induced tolerance under these conditions in <italic>Msmeg</italic>. We compared logarithmically growing (mid-log) cultures in 7H9 rich media to cultures starved for 2 days in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) prior to addition of antibiotics. Consistent with expectations, we found a marked increase in antibiotic tolerance in starved cultures, with a 100-fold increase in survival following TIG/LZD exposure and a 10,000-fold increase following RIF/INH/EMB exposure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined two species of pathogenic mycobacteria under these conditions to similarly assess starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. We again compared cells starved in PBS to logarithmically growing cells in 7H9 and found that cultures of wild-type <italic>Mabs</italic> (ATCC 19977) and <italic>Mtb</italic> (Erdman) also displayed dramatic increases antibiotic tolerance in nutrient-deprived cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Notably, for <italic>Mabs</italic> and <italic>Msmeg,</italic> the development of tolerance required an adaptation period of several days under starvation conditions, as survival was dramatically impaired if cells were shifted immediately into nutrient-deficient conditions with antibiotics, suggesting that a regulated process needed to be completed. Surprisingly, <italic>Mtb</italic> tolerance developed rapidly without pre-adaptation suggesting that this organism might have additional response pathways enabling more rapid adaptation.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Identification of pathways needed for antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Mabs</italic></title>
<p>We used these conditions to carry out Tn-Seq screens in <italic>Mabs</italic> to identify genes necessary for both the survival of spontaneous persister cells and for starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance. We conducted the screen using a <italic>Mabs Himar1</italic> Tn library comprised of ∼55,000 mutations across ∼91,000 possible TA insertion sites covering all 4,992 non-essential <italic>Mabs</italic> genes in strain ATCC 19977<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To study spontaneous persister cells, cultures were maintained in continuous log-phase in 7H9 rich media for 48h prior to antibiotic exposure and then exposed to TIG/LZD for 6 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) a point at which spontaneous persister cells comprise the majority of the population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). To study starvation-induced tolerance, cultures were starved in PBS for 48h prior to antibiotic exposure in PBS. Following antibiotic treatment, cells were then washed and resuspended in antibiotic-free liquid media to recover and passaged 1:100 three times in continuous log-phase to expand surviving cells. We then isolated genomic DNA, sequenced the Tn insertion sites, and used TRANSIT software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> to quantify the abundance of each Tn mutant across different conditions to identify genes with statistically-significant differences in distribution. We identified 277 <italic>Mabs</italic> genes required for surviving TIG/LZD exposure in rich media, 271 genes required for survival during starvation and 362 genes required to survive the combined exposure to antibiotics and starvation (Log<sub>2</sub> fold-change &gt; 0.5 and Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-value (p-adj.) ≤ 0.05; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-E</xref>). Of the genes required for survival, ∼60% were required in both nutrient-replete and starvation states, although condition-specific determinants were also seen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). As expected, we identified genes with already-established functions in antibiotic responses, including <italic>MAB_2752</italic> and <italic>MAB_2753</italic> which are both homologs of known antibiotic transporters in <italic>Mtb,</italic> as well as tetracycline-responsive transcription factors like <italic>MAB_468</italic>7 and <italic>MAB_0314c</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>), indicating an ability of these Tn-Seq conditions to identify physiologically relevant genes known to mitigate antibiotic stress.</p>

<p>To identify other cellular processes necessary for survival we performed pathway enrichment analysis on the set of genes identified by Tn-Seq. We used the DAVID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> analysis tool to perform systematic queries of the KEGG, GO, and Uniprot databases and identify over-represented processes and pathways. Interestingly, although cells were exposed to translation-inhibiting antibiotics, and no exogenous oxidative or nitrosative stress was applied, we identified a number of factors needed to combat these stresses in spontaneous persister cells. This included <italic>bfrB</italic> (bactoferritin), <italic>ahpE</italic> (peroxiredoxin) and <italic>katG</italic> (catalase/peroxidase) as well as 5 components of the bacterial proteasome pathway, known to mediate resistance to nitrosative stress in <italic>Mtb</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tbls2">Table S2</xref>). We also identified multiple members of DNA-damage response pathways including <italic>recF</italic>, <italic>recG</italic>, <italic>uvrA</italic>, <italic>uvrB</italic> and <italic>uvrC</italic>. Examining genes required for starvation-induced tolerance, a number of the same pathways were again seen, and the mutant with the greatest survival defect in this context was <italic>mntH</italic>, a redox-regulated Mn<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup> transporter implicated in peroxide resistance in other organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To independently confirm a role in antibiotic tolerance for a set of genes from diverse pathways that were identified by Tn-Seq we selected a set of genes required for survival, representing several of the functional pathways identified, and used oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering (ORBIT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup> to disrupt their open reading frames. The initial genes selected were <italic>pafA</italic> (proteasome pathway), <italic>katG</italic> (catalase-peroxidase), <italic>recR</italic> (DNA repair), <italic>blaR</italic> (β-lactam sensing), and <italic>MAB_1456c</italic> (cobalamin synthesis). To control for non-specific effects of antibiotic selection during the recombineering process, we created a control strain using ORBIT to target a non-coding intergenic region downstream of a redundant tRNA gene (<italic>MAB_t5030c</italic>). We then individually screened each of these mutants to determine if they displayed deficits in survival by exposing cells to TIG/LZD, either in rich 7H9 media or under starvation conditions, as had been done in the Tn-Seq screen. For Δ<italic>katG</italic> we detected clear defects in survival as soon as 3 days after antibiotic exposure in either rich media or under starvation conditions, corroborating the results of our Tn-Seq analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed similar, albeit smaller, defects in the Δ<italic>pafA,</italic> Δ<italic>MAB_1456c</italic>, and Δ<italic>blaR,</italic> mutants under the conditions predicted by the screen, whereas we saw no defect in the Δ<italic>recR</italic> mutant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-E</xref>). We also noted that several mutants displayed delays in growth recovery after antibiotic removal at times before survival defects were noted (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 Supplement</xref>). To further confirm the role of <italic>katG</italic> and <italic>pafA,</italic> and exclude off-target effects of recombineering, we performed genetic complementation analysis by restoring a wild-type copy of each gene into the respective Δ<italic>pafA</italic> and Δ<italic>katG</italic> mutants. In each case, we integrated a single copy of the wild-type gene, under the control of its endogenous promoter, into the genome at the L5 <italic>attB</italic> site (hereafter <italic>pafA+, katG+</italic> strains), and constructed isogenic control strains with an empty vector integrated at the same site (hereafter <italic>pafA-, katG-</italic>strains). We confirmed expression of the re-introduced copy of each gene by RT-qPCR in the <italic>pafA+</italic>, and <italic>katG+</italic> strains, and found expression within roughly 2-fold of endogenous wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A,D</xref>). We then challenged these strains with TIG/LZD as before. In rich media, where the Δ<italic>katG</italic> mutants have a moderate survival defect, the <italic>katG+</italic> strain had roughly a 50-fold increase in viable cells relative to the <italic>katG-</italic>strain. We then exposed cells to antibiotics under starvation conditions, where the Δ<italic>katG</italic> mutant phenotype is more severe. Under these conditions the <italic>katG-</italic>cells succumbed rapidly between 3d and 10d after antibiotic exposure, with a 1,000-fold decrease in viable cells relative to control cells, whereas the <italic>katG+</italic> strain showed a near-complete restoration of antibiotic tolerance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). We analogously examined complementation of Δ<italic>pafA</italic> mutants, and although the phenotype of the Δ<italic>pafA</italic> mutant is less severe overall than a Δ<italic>katG</italic> mutant, we saw a similar restoration of survival in <italic>pafA+</italic> cells relative to <italic>pafA-</italic>cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). We next evaluated whether the <italic>pafA-</italic>, and <italic>katG-</italic>strains were overall more sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of TIG/LZD, or whether they had specific defects in survival above the mean bactericidal concentration. We performed MIC determination for TIG and LZD individually for each strain, comparing the <italic>katG+</italic>/<italic>katG-</italic> and <italic>pafA+/pafA-</italic> strains. We found that that the MICs for each of these strains were unchanged, demonstrating that these mutants were not more readily inhibited by these antibiotics. Instead, they have more rapid kinetics of cell death at bactericidal concentrations, consistent with a specific defect in antibiotic tolerance, and supporting a model whereby an initial growth-arresting inhibition of the direct antibiotic target can be uncoupled mechanistically from a distinct cell-death step (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,F</xref>), as has been seen with other antibiotic classes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Reactive oxygen contributes to antibiotic lethality in <italic>Mabs</italic></title>
<p>We next investigated the role of KatG and reactive oxygen in antibiotic tolerance more broadly. We began by assessing whether KatG conferred protection from other antibiotics with diverse mechanisms of action, selecting antibiotics that are used clinically for mycobacterial infections. Because <italic>katG-</italic> mutants showed the greatest defects in starvation-induced tolerance, we analyzed survival of <italic>katG+</italic> and <italic>katG-</italic> strains in starvation-adapted cultures exposed to a panel of different antibiotics. Because both TIG and LZD both act by inhibiting translation, we began by exposing cells to either TIG or LZD alone. As expected, the degree of bacterial killing was significantly less with either agent alone than when they are added in combination. Upon exposure to either of these antibiotics the <italic>katG-</italic> cells died more rapidly than <italic>katG+</italic> cells, though we note that the final proportion of persister cells in the population was unchanged in <italic>katG-</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). When we exposed cells to rifabutin, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, we saw a similar effect, with a 100-fold loss of viability in <italic>katG-</italic> cells relative to the <italic>katG+</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, when we exposed cultures to either levofloxacin (topoisomerase inhibitor) or cefoxitin (β-lactam inhibitor of peptidoglycan cross-linking), <italic>katG</italic> had little to no effect on cell viability (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Thus, the role of KatG is context-dependent, suggesting that some antibiotics generate oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by KatG while others do not.</p>

<p>The identification of <italic>katG</italic> as essential for cells to survive exposure to TIG/LZD suggests that ROS are present and causing damage. Although TIG/LZD are translation inhibitors that do not directly generate ROS we evaluated whether they might nonetheless be triggering ROS accumulation as a secondary effect. We examined ROS levels in control <italic>Mabs</italic> using the ROS indicator dye cellROX, that is retained in cells when it becomes oxidized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. At baseline, during log-phase growth in rich media &lt; 2% of cells had ROS accumulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). We saw a moderate increase in ROS accumulation in starved cultures, with roughly 7% of the population cellROX+. However, when cells were exposed to antibiotics we saw a dramatic accumulation of ROS, with 57% of cells becoming cellROX+ when exposed to TIG/LZD in rich media and 33% of PBS-starved cells becoming cellROX+ when exposed to TIG/LZD. Taken together, these data indicate that translation inhibition does indeed have important downstream effects on cellular redox balance, with ROS accumulation that could be contributing to the lethal effects of antibiotics.</p>
<p>We next tested whether ROS were contributing to cell death by reducing ROS production and assessing the impact on cell viability. A well-established system for studying hypoxia in mycobacteria is the Wayne Model of gradual-onset hypoxia, whereby low-density cultures are inoculated in sealed vessels with minimal headspace. As the culture slowly grows, the soluble oxygen is consumed, resulting in the slow onset of hypoxia over several days, a process that can be monitored by the decolorization of Methylene Blue dye in the media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. Under aerobic conditions in rich media, we observed the expected rapid killing of <italic>Mabs</italic> over the first 5 days with the combination of TIG/LZD, with more rapid loss of viability in KatG- cells. However, under hypoxic conditions, where ROS production is suppressed, we saw much slower bacterial killing. Importantly, under hypoxic conditions <italic>katG-</italic> cells no longer had a survival defect relative to <italic>katG+</italic> cells, supporting the hypothesis that translation-inhibiting antibiotics also cause secondary accumulation of lethal ROS in antibiotic-treated cells that need to be detoxified by KatG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>We also evaluated whether other methods of alleviating ROS damage might enhance survival. The iron chelator 2,2’-dipyridyl has been shown in other contexts to reduce ROS-mediated damage by suppressing the reaction of H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> with Fe<sup>2+</sup> that generates highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals (Fenton reaction), and which has been shown to mitigate oxidative damage in other bacteria following antibiotic exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. As seen in other bacteria, we find that in <italic>Mabs</italic>, 2,2’- dipyridy does indeed improve bacterial survival following exposure to bactericidal translation inhibitors, further supporting a role in ROS in cell death following translation inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). We also assessed whether free radical scavengers like thiourea and 2,2,6,6- tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) ameliorated antibiotic toxicity, although similar antioxidants had previously been shown in <italic>Mtb</italic> to increase respiration and paradoxically to increase ROS generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. When we treated <italic>Mabs</italic> simultaneously with TIG/LZD in combination with either thiourea or TEMPO we did not observe a restoration of antibiotic tolerance, and, similar to observations in <italic>Mtb,</italic> actually observed increased bacterial cell death (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 Supplement</xref>).</p>

<title>Incomplete penetrance of <italic>katG</italic> phenotype among <italic>Mabs</italic> strains</title>
<p>To test whether ROS accumulation was an effect occurring more broadly across different <italic>Mabs</italic> strains we obtained two clinical strains, exposed them to TIG/LZD in 7H9 media, and measured ROS accumulation with cellROX as above. We found that similar to ATCC 19977, both clinical <italic>Mabs</italic> strains had elevated ROS levels following translation inhibition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that this is a conserved process in <italic>Mabs</italic>. Next, we tested the role of KatG in these <italic>Mabs</italic> clinical strains. We used ORBIT to disrupt the <italic>katG</italic> locus and evaluated the ability of these Δ<italic>katG</italic> clinical strains to survive exposure to TIG/LZD under both stressed and un-stressed conditions. Unlike ROS accumulation, where the responses across strains were consistent, we saw a variable dependency on <italic>katG</italic>. Clinical strain-1 behaved differently overall, with no appreciable starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance, and no contribution of <italic>katG</italic> to survival. In contrast, for clinical strain-2, <italic>katG</italic> contributed significantly to starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance, behaving similarly to the ATCC 19977 reference strain. However, unlike the reference strain, <italic>katG</italic> was not required for survival of clinical strain-2 when exposed to antibiotics in 7H9 media (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, although antibiotic-induced ROS accumulation was observed across all three <italic>Mabs</italic> strains, the Δ<italic>katG</italic> phenotype displays incomplete penetrance, suggesting that in some <italic>Mabs</italic> strains alternative pathways exist that are able to compensate for the loss of <italic>katG</italic>.</p>

<p>In summary, the results of these studies point to an important effect of ROS in amplifying the lethality of transcription and translation-inhibiting antibiotics in <italic>Mabs</italic>. Through genetic analysis we identified a number of ROS detoxification factors, including KatG, as necessary for survival in this context. This suggested that antibiotics induced an oxidative state in cells, and direct measurement of ROS following antibiotic exposure indicated that this was indeed the case. Further supporting the toxic effects of ROS in this context, we found that removal of oxygen both slowed bacterial killing and rendered KatG dispensable. Taken together, these results suggest that in <italic>Mabs</italic> antibiotic lethality is accelerated by ROS accumulation, and that survival requires active detoxification systems.</p>

<sec id="s3a">
<title>Pathways necessary for antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Mabs</italic></title>
<p>The phenomenon of antibiotic tolerance has been recognized for decades and has been observed in a broad array of bacterial species, but without a uniform underlying mechanism - suggesting that different pathways may play roles in different physiologic contexts. For example, the pathways identified in one bacterial species may not contribute to tolerance in another. In addition to <italic>E. coli, relA</italic> plays a role in tolerance in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup><italic>, Staphylococcus aureus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, and <italic>Mtb</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. However, its role is not universal. Deletion of <italic>relA</italic> had no effect on antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Msmeg</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and in our Tn-Seq analysis, <italic>Mabs relA</italic> Tn mutants had no survival defect. However, a prior study of the <italic>Mabs relA</italic> mutant demonstrated that this strain still synthesizes (p)ppGpp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, suggesting potential genetic redundancy. Even within a single species there can be differences in the critical survival mechanisms depending on the context. In <italic>E. coli,</italic> RelA contributes to persister viability following exposure to β-lactams, but not quinolones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, and in our study we find KatG to be essential for tolerance to transcription and translation inhibitors but not to β-lactams or quinolones.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Mechanisms of antibiotic lethality</title>
<p>Our findings strongly support the idea that ROS can be a significant contributor to antibiotic lethality in <italic>Mabs</italic> and contribute to the growing evidence that this is conserved across mycobacteria. In <italic>Mabs, Mtb</italic> and <italic>Msmeg,</italic> other groups have also observed reduced antibiotic-mediated killing in hypoxic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, in <italic>Mtb</italic>, exposure to rifampin also generates ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, and <italic>katG</italic> contributes to survival in rifampin-treated cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Exactly how transcription or translation blockade leads to increased ROS levels is also not known. In principle, any of several derangements could lead to ROS accumulation. One of the major sources of cellular ROS is oxidative phosphorylation, as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are natural byproducts. Thus, increased ROS generation by oxidative phosphorylation is an attractive hypothesis. Alternatively, particularly under starvation conditions, it is possible that antioxidants and ROS scavengers may become depleted, creating a more oxidizing environment. Our Tn-Seq analysis provides additional insight on this. We noted a small class of Tn mutants that were paradoxically protected from antibiotic lethality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Prominent among this class of mutants were several independent components of the NADH dehydrogenase complex. Also known as Complex I of the electron transport chain, it is one of the key entry points for electrons into the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. The observation that mutants lacking this complex are protected suggests that decreasing flux through oxidative phosphorylation, with a concomitant decrease in ROS generation, may enhance survival during antibiotic exposure. A mechanistic understanding of how blockade of either transcription or translation leads to deranged oxygen utilization is an unresolved question that will require further study.</p>
<p>ROS accumulation is not universal following exposure to bactericidal antibiotics. While antibiotic-induced ROS is well-documented, under some conditions, such as higher concentrations of antibiotic, multiple studies have also observed antibiotic lethality without ROS accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Similarly, prior studies have found that under certain conditions, <italic>E. coli</italic> mutants lacking catalase have defects in antibiotic tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, whereas under other conditions they do not<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. In <italic>Mabs</italic> the role of <italic>katG</italic> was also not uniform, as it had no impact on survival following exposure to levofloxacin or cefoxitin. Additional studies will be needed to determine whether levofloxacin and cefoxitin kill without generating ROS, or whether ROS is generated but effectively detoxified in the absence of <italic>katG.</italic> This latter possibility is suggested by our findings in <italic>Mabs</italic> clinical strains. While we saw ROS accumulation in both strains after TIG/LZD exposure, the role of <italic>katG</italic> was variable between the strains. This suggests that compensatory pathways likely exist and that in <italic>Mabs</italic> they can overcome the loss of <italic>katG</italic>.</p>

<title>Therapeutic implications</title>
<p><italic>Mabs</italic> infections are particularly challenging to treat, with relapse rates over 50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Our results highlight several bacterial processes, such as the bacterial proteasome and ROS detoxification, which might be targeted therapeutically to reduce the survival of antibiotic tolerant bacteria in patients with <italic>Mabs</italic> infection. Agents targeting these processes might not have any intrinsic antimicrobial activity alone, but might act to disrupt the unique physiology required to survive antibiotics. This would represent a new therapeutic class of “persistence inhibitors” that might act synergistically with traditional antibiotics to eliminate the subpopulation of cells that would otherwise remain viable despite prolonged antibiotic treatment in patients with <italic>Mabs</italic> and other chronic infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Tn-Seq has inherent drawbacks, including an inability to identify mutants in essential genes, or in cases of genetic redundancy. Thus, there are likely genes needed for antibiotic tolerance in <italic>Mabs</italic> that were not identified in this study. In addition, we studied the response to a single class of antibiotic, focusing on the translation inhibitors often used to treat <italic>Mabs</italic> infections, and we studied only spontaneous persister cells and starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance.

Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: tigecycline (Chem-Impex) at 10μg/ml (8 fold above MIC, re-administered every 3 days), linezolid (Chem-Impex) at 100μg/ml (20 fold above MIC), levofloxacin (Sigma) at 40μg/ml (8 fold above MIC), cefoxitin (Chem Impex) at 80μg/ml (8 fold above MIC, re-administered every 3 days), and rifabutin (Cayman) at 40μg/ml (4 fold above MIC). After antibiotic administration, colony forming units over time were measured by plating on 7H10 solid media. For experiments where growth recovery time in liquid media was quantified, 100μl of sample was removed at d6 after antibiotic administration and washed 2X in antibiotic-free media. The samples were resuspended in 5ml of antibiotic free media, and OD620 measurements were taken with a FilterMax F3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) until maximum cell density (OD of ∼5.0) was reached.</p>

<title>Transposon insertion sequencing</title>
<p>The construction of this <italic>Himar1</italic> transposon Tn library has been described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Screening was performed by growing a freezer stock of the library for 2.5 days in log phase before 48-hour PBS starvation or further continuous log-phase growth. Samples were then resuspended in media containing either tigecycline/linezolid or an equal volume of DMSO solvent and incubated for 6 days, with a re-administration of tigecycline or matching DMSO on day 3. Cultures were aerated by culturing in a vented cap bottle with gentle agitation at 40 revolutions per minute throughout the experiment. The samples were then washed 2X in antibiotic free liquid media, resuspended in antibiotic free liquid media (10X the original culture volume), and grown until OD0.5-1.0.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the samples underwent three more rounds of 100-fold passaging in liquid media to amplify surviving bacteria before the samples were collected in Trizol (Invitrogen). A sample taken at the time of the commencement of PBS starvation was collected in Trizol and used as the input control. Three independent trials of this experiment were submitted to the UC Davis DNA Technologies Core, where Tn insertion site flanking sequences were amplified as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> and sequenced on an Element Biosciences AVITI. Sequence reads were mapped to the ATCC 19977 genome and analyzed using TRANSIT software with the following parameters: 0% of N/C termini ignored, 10,000 samples, TTR normalization, LOESS correction, include sites with all zeros, site restricted resampling. Genes with significant changes were defined as those with adjusted p-value (p-adj.) &lt;0.05 and log<sub>2</sub> fold change &gt;0.5. P-adj. was calculated using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction.</p>

<p>Using a transposon sequencing (TN-seq) approach, the authors identified key genetic determinants of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium abscessus. Given that M. abscessus is inherently resistant to multiple antibiotics, this <bold>valuable</bold> study makes a significant contribution by uncovering how antibiotic tolerance is linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) species. The <bold>solid</bold> findings further strengthen the growing evidence that ROS play a central role in the mechanism of antibiotic action and tolerance in mycobacteria. However, the manuscript would benefit from improved clarity of presentation and corrections in the reference section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Persistence is a phenomenon by which genetically susceptible cells are able to survive exposure to high concentrations of antibiotics. This is especially a major problem when treating infections caused by slow growing mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis and M. abscessus. Studies on the mechanisms adopted by the persisting bacteria to survive and evade antibiotic killing can potentially lead to faster and more effective treatment strategies.</p>
<p>To address this, in this study, the authors have used a transposon mutagenesis based sequencing approach to identify the genetic determinants of antibiotic persistence in M. abscessus. To enrich for persisters they employed conditions, that have been reported previously to increase persister frequency - nutrient starvation, to facilitate genetic screening for this phenotype. M.abs transposon library was grown in nutrient rich or nutrient depleted conditions and exposed to TIG/LZD for 6 days, following which Tn-seq was carried out to identify genes involved in spontaneous (nutrient rich) or starvation-induced conditions. About 60% of the persistence hits were required in both the conditions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment for genes involved in detoxification of nitrosative, oxidative, DNA damage and proteostasis stress. The authors then decided to validate the findings by constructing deletions of 5 different targets (pafA, katG, recR, blaR, Mab_1456c) and tested the persistence phenotype of these strains. Rather surprisingly only 2 of the 5 hits (katG and pafA) exhibited a significant persistence defect when compared to wild type upon exposure to TIG/LZD and this was complemented using an integrative construct. The authors then investigated the specificity of delta-katG susceptibility against different antibiotic classes and demonstrated increased killing by rifabutin. The katG phenotype was shown to be mediated through the production of oxidative stress which was reverted when the bacterial cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, when testing the role of katG in other clinical strains of Mab, the phenotype was observed only in one of the clinical strains demonstrating that there might be alternative anti-oxidative stress defense mechanisms operating in some clinical strains.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>While the role of ROS in antibiotic mediated killing of mycobacterial cells have been studied to some extent, this paper presents some new findings with regards to genetic analysis of M. abscessus susceptibility, especially against clinically used antibiotics, which makes it useful. Also, the attempts to validate their observations in clinical isolates is appreciated.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Amongst the 5 shortlisted candidates from the screen, only 2 showed marginal phenotypes which limits the impact of the screening approach.</p>
<p>While the role of KatG mediated detoxification of ROS and involvement of ROS in antibiotic killing was well demonstrated, the lack of replication of this phenotype in some of the clinical isolates limits the significance of these findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The work set out to better understand the phenomenon of antibiotic persistence in mycobacteria. Three new observations are made using the pathogenic Mycobacterium abscessus as an experimental system: phenotypic tolerance involves suppression of ROS, protein synthesis inhibitors can be lethal for this bacterium, and levofloxacin lethality is unaffected by deletion of catalase, suggesting that this quinolone does not kill via ROS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The ROS experiments are supported in three ways: measurement of ROS by a fluorescent probe, deletion of catalase increases lethality of selected antibiotics, and a hypoxia model suppresses antibiotic lethality. A variety of antibiotics are examined, and transposon mutagenesis identifies several genes involved in phenotypic tolerance, including one that encodes catalase. The methods are adequate for making these statements.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The work can be improved by a more comprehensive treatment of prior work, especially comparison of E. coli work with mycobacterial studies.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the work still has some technical issues to fix regarding description of the methods, supplementary material, and reference formating.</p>
<p>Overall impact: Showing that ROS accumulation is suppressed during phenotypic tolerance, while expected, adds to the examples of the protective effects of low ROS levels. Moreover, the work, along with a few others, extends the idea of antibiotic involvement with ROS to mycobacteria. These are field-solidifying observations.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have moved this paper along nicely. I have a few general thoughts.</p>
<p>(1) It would be helpful to have more references to specific figures and panels listed in the text to make reading easier.</p>
<p>(2) I would suggest adding a statement about the importance of the work. From my perspective, the work shows the general nature of many statements derived from work with E. coli. This is important. The abstract says this overall, but a final sentence in the abstract would make it clear to all readers.</p>
<p>(3) The paper describes properties that may be peculiar to mycobacteria. If the authors agree, I would suggest some stress on the differences from E. coli. Also, I would place more stress on novel findings. This might be done in a section called Concluding Remarks. The paper by Shee 2022 AAC could be helpful in phrasing general properties.</p>
<p>(4) Several aspects still need work to be of publication quality. Examples are the materials table and the presentation of supplementary material. Reference formatting also needs attention.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript demonstrates that starvation induces persister formation in M. abscesses. They also utilized Tn-Seq for the identification of genes involved in persistence. They identified the role of catalase-peroxidase KatG in preventing death from translation inhibitors Tigecycline and Linezolid. They further demonstrated that a combination of these translation inhibitors leads to the generation of ROS in PBS-starved cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used high-throughput genomics-based methods for identification of genes playing a role in persistence.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings could not be validated in clinical strains.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions: No more comments for the authors.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Only 1 gene (katG) gave a strong and 1 (Mab_1456c) exhibited a minor defect. Two of the clones did not show any persistence phenotype (blaR and recR) and one (pafA) showed a minor phenotype,</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have now carried out more detailed validation studies on the Tn-Seq, with analysis of timedependent killing over 14 d. This more comprehensive analysis shows that 4 of 5 genes analyzed do indeed have antibiotic tolerance defects under the conditions that Tn-Seq predicted a survival defect (Revised Figure 3). In addition, we found that even before actual cell death, several mutants had delayed resumption of growth after antibiotic removal (Figure 3 Supplemental).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Fig 3 - Why is there such a huge difference in the extent of killing of the control strain in media, when exposed to TIG/LZD, when compared to Fig. 1C and Fig. 4. In Fig. 1C, M. abs grown in media decreases by &gt;1 log by Day 3 and &gt;4 log by Day 6, whereas in Fig. 3, the bacterial load decreases by &lt;1 log by Day 3 and &lt;2 log by Day 6. This needs to be clarified, if the experimental conditions were different, because if comparing to Fig. 1C data then the katG mutant strain phenotype is not very different.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that there is variability in the timing and extent of cell death from experiment to experiment. As noted by the reviewer, in Figure 1C the largest decrement in survival is between day 1 - day 3 (also seen in Figure 6A). As they noted in Figure 4 the largest decrement is between day 3 – day 6 (also seen in Figure 3A, Figure 5F). In each experiment with katG mutants we carefully compare the mutant vs. the control strain within that experiment, which is more accurate than comparing the behavior of mutant in one experiment to a control in another experiment.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>.First, word-choice decisions could better conform to the published literature. Alternatively, novel definitions could be included. In particular, the data support the concept of phenotypic tolerance, not persistence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers comments, text modified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, two of the novel observations could be explored more extensively to provide mechanistic explanations for the phenomena.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have added several additional experiments, these are detailed below in response to specific comments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The findings could not be validated in clinical strains.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern that the katG phenotype was only observed in one of the two clinical strains we studied. We feel that our findings are relevant beyond the ATCC 19977 strain for two reasons</p>
<p>(1) We have performed additional analyses of the two clinical isolates and indeed find significant accumulation of ROS following antibiotic exposure in both of these strains (revised Figure 6A).</p>
<p>(2) We do in fact see a role for katG in starvation-induced antibiotic tolerance in Mabs clinical strain-2. It is not surprising that different strains from a particular species may have some different responses to stresses – for example, there is wide strain-specific variability in susceptibility to different phages within a species based on which particular phage defense modules a given strain carries (for example PMID: 37160116). We speculate that different Mabs strains may express varying levels of other antioxidant factors and note that the genes encoding several such factors were identified by our Tn-Seq screen including the peroxidases ahpC, ahpD, and ahpE. Our analysis of the genetic interactions between katG and these other factors is ongoing.</p>

<p>Comments/Suggestions</p>
<p>(1) In Fig1E, the authors show no difference in killing Mtb with or without adaptation in PBS. These data are contrary to the data presented in Figure 1B. These also do not align with the data of M. smegmatis and M. abscesses. Please discuss these observations in light of the Duncan model of persistence (Mol Microbiol. 2002 Feb;43(3):717-31.).’</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The above referenced Duncan laboratory study found tolerance after prolonged starvation but did not actually examine tolerance at early time points. While some of the transcriptional and metabolic changes seen by Duncan and others are slow, other groups have described starvation responses in Mtb that are quite rapid. For example, the stringent response mediator ppGpp accumulates within a few hours after onset of starvation in Mtb (PMID: 30906866). We suspect that a rapid signaling response such as this underlies the phenotype we observe. Regarding the difference between Mtb and other mycobacterial species we also find it surprising that Mtb had a much more rapid starvation response. This is a clear species-specific difference that may reflect an adaptation of Mtb to the nutrient-limited physiologic niche within host macrophages.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 151, the authors state that they have used an M. abscesses Tn mutant library of ~ 55,000 mutant strains. The manuscript will benefit from the description of the coverage of total TA sites covered by the mutants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Text modified to add this detail. There are 91,559 TA sites in the abscessus genome. Thus, our Tn density is ~60%.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Line 155: Please explain how long the cells were kept in an Antibiotic medium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This technical detail was noted above on line 153 in the original text: “…and then exposed them to TIG/LZD for 6 days”. To clarify the overall conditions, we have also revised the text of the manuscript and added the detail of how long cells were passaged after removal of antibiotics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Line 201: data not shown. Delayed resumption of growth after removal of antibiotic would be helpful in indicating drug resilience. This data could enhance the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Data now provided in Figure 3 Supplemental</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figures 4C and 4F represent the kill curve. It will be good to show the date with CFU against the drug concentration in place of OD600. CFU rather than OD600 best reflects growth inhibition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figures 4C and 4F are measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to stop the overall growth of the bacterial population. While we agree that CFU could be analyzed, this would be measuring a different outcome – cell death and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). In these experiments we sought to specifically examine the MIC so as to separate growth inhibition from cell death. For this we used the standard method employed by clinical microbiology laboratories for MIC, which is optical density of the culture (PMID: 10325306).</p>

<p>(6) Figure 5C. The authors shall show the effect of TIG/LZD on M. abscesses ROS production without the PBS adaptation. It is important to conclude that TIG/LZD induces ROS in cells. Authors should utilize ROS scavengers such as Thiourea, DFO, etc., to conclude ROS's contribution to bacterial killing following inhibition of transcription and translation.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The divergent results from the clinical strains are extremely interesting. It would be helpful to determine the oxidative stress levels (similar to the cellROX data shown in 5E), to tease out if the difference in katG role is because of lack of ROS induction in these strains or due to expression of alternate anti-oxidative stress defense mechanisms.</p>

<p>We have performed additional cellROX analysis as suggested by the reviewer and found that the ROS induction is indeed present across all three Mabs strains, but that katG is only required in one of the two strains (Strain #2). These data are now included in the revised Figure 6.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>GENERAL COMMENTS</p>
<p>This is a nice piece of work that uses the pathogen Mabs as a test subject.</p>
<p>The work has findings that likely apply generally to antibiotics and mycobacteria: 1) phenotypic tolerance is associated with suppression of ROS, 2) lethal protein synthesis inhibitors act via accumulation of ROS, and 3) levofloxacin behaves in an unexpected way. Each is a new observation. However, I believe that each topic requires more work to be firmly established to be suitable for eLife.</p>
<p>Phenotypic tolerance: Association with suppression of ROS is important but expected. I would solidify the conclusion by performing several additional experiments. For example, confirm the lethal effect of ROS by reducing it with an iron chelator and a radical scavenger. There is a large literature on effects of iron uptake, levels, etc. on antibiotic lethality that could be applied to this question. In 2013 Imlay argued against the validity of fluorescent probes. Perhaps getting the same results with another probe would strengthen the conclusion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have carried out additional experiments with both an iron chelator and small molecule ROS scavengers to further test this idea but note that these experiments have several inherent limitations: 1) These compounds have highly pleiotropic effects. For example while N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant it also increases mycobacterial respiration and was shown to paradoxically decrease antibiotic tolerance in M. tuberculosis (PMID: 28396391). 2) It has been shown by the Imlay group that small-molecule antioxidants are often ineffective in quenching ROS in bacteria (PMID: 388893820), making negative results difficult to interpret. Nonetheless, we present new experimental data showing that iron chelation does indeed improve the survival of antibiotic-treated Mabs (revised Figure 5).  However,  small molecule antioxidants such as thiourea do not restore antibiotic tolerance and actually increased bacterial cell death, suggesting that they may be affecting respiration in Mabs in a manner similar to that seen for NAC in Mtb. We also note that our genetic analysis, which identified numerous other genes encoding proteins with antioxidant function (Figure 2) is a strong additional argument in support of the importance of ROS in antibiotic-mediated lethality.</p>
<p>Regarding the concern raised by Imlay about the validity of oxidation-sensitive dyes - this relates to concern bacterial autofluorescence induced by antibiotics that can confound analyses in some species. We have ruled this out in our analyses by using bacteria unstained by cellROX as controls to confirm that there is negligible autofluorescence in Mabs (&lt;0.1%, Figure 5E, Figure 6A).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Protein synthesis inhibitors: At present, this is simply an observation. More work is needed to suggest a mechanism. For example, with E. coli the aminoglycosides are protein synthesis inhibitors that also cause membrane damage. Membrane damage is known to stimulate ROS-mediated killing. Your observation needs to be extended because chloramphenicol, another protein synthesis inhibitor, blocks ROS production. The lethality may be a property of mycobacteria: does it occur with E. coli (note that rifampicin is bacteriostatic with E. coli but lethal to Mtb)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that the mechanism underlying ROS accumulation following transcription or translational inhibition in Mabs is of significant interest. It is likely to be a mechanism different from E. coli, because in E. coli tetracyclines and rifamycins are both bacteriostatic, whereas in Mabs they are both bactericidal. Determining the mechanism by which translation inhibitors cause ROS accumulation in Mabs is an ongoing effort in our laboratory using proteomics and metabolomics, but is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Levofloxacin: This is also at the observational stage but is unexpected. In other studies, ROS is involved in quinolone-mediated killing of bacteria. Why is this not the case with Mabs? The observation should be solidified by showing the contrast with moxifloxacin, since this compound has been studied with mycobacteria (Shee 2022 AAC). With E. coli, quinolone structure can affect the relative contribution of ROS to killing (Malik 2007 AAC), as is also seen with Mtb (Malik 2006 AAC). What is happening in the present work with levofloxacin, an important anti-tuberculosis drug? Is there a structure explanation (compare with ofloxacin)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While these are interesting questions, a detailed exploration of the structure-function relationships between different fluoroquinolone antibiotics and their varying activities on Mtb and Mabs is outside the scope of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The writing is generally easy to follow. However, the concept of persistence should be changed to phenotypic tolerance with text changes throughout. I base this suggestion on the definitions of tolerance and persistence as stated in the consensus review (Balaban 2019 Nat Micro Rev). Experimentally, tolerance is seen as a gradual decline in survival following antibiotic addition; the decline is slower than seen with wild-type cells. The data presented in this paper fit that definition. In contrast, persistence refers to a rapid drop in survival followed by a distinct plateau (Balaban 2019 Nat Micro Rev; for example, see Wu Lewis AAC 2012 ). Moreover, to claim persistence, it would be necessary to demonstrate subpopulation status, which is not done. The Balaban review is an attempt to bring order to the field with respect to persistence and tolerance, since the two are commonly used without regard for a consistent definition.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion; text modified in multiple places to clarify.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another issue requiring clarification is the relationship between resistance and tolerance. Killing by antibiotics is a two-step process, as most clearly seen with quinolones. First a reversible bacteriostatic event occurs. Resistance blocks that bacteriostatic damage. Then a lethal metabolic response to that damage occurs. Tolerance selectively blocks the second, killing event, a distinct process that often involves the accumulation of ROS. Direct antibiotic-mediated damage is an additional mode of killing that also stems from the reversible, bacteriostatic damage created by antibiotics. The authors recognize the distinction but could make it clearer. Take a look at Zheng (JJ Collins) 2020, 2022.</p>

<p>SPECIFIC COMMENTS</p>
<p>Line 30 unexpectedly. I would delete this word because the result is expected from the ROS work of Shee et al 2022 with mycobacteria. Moreover, Zeng et al 2022 PNAS showed that ROS participates in antimicrobial tolerance, and persistence is a form of tolerance (Balalban et al, 2019, Nat Micro Rev).</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 39 key goal: this is probably untrue in the general sense stated, since bacteriostatic antibiotics are sufficient to clear infection (Wald-Dickler 2019 Clin Infect Dis). However, it is likely to be the goal for Mtb infections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that bacteriostatic antibiotics are effective in treating most types of infections and do not claim otherwise in the manuscript. However, from a clinical standpoint, eradication of the pathogen causing the infection is indeed the goal of antibiotic therapy in virtually all circumstances (with the exception of specific scenarios such as cystic fibrosis where it is recognized that the infecting organism cannot be fully eliminated). In most cases, the combination of bacteriostatic antibiotics and the host immune response is sufficient to achieve eradication. We have modified the manuscript text to reflect this nuance noted by the reviewer.</p>

<p>The reviewer makes an interesting philosophical argument. However, we would submit that some aspects of biology, for example the regulation of glycolysis, are understood in great detail.

The present citations are fine if you want to narrow the statement to mycobacteria, but the history is that the E. coli work came first and was then generalized to mycobacteria. A mycobacterial paper for ROS is Shee 2022 AAC.</p>

In addition to many papers by Collins, see Hong 2019 PNAS and Zeng 2022 PNAS). It is fine if you want to counter the arguments against the Lewis and Imlay papers (summarized in Drlica &amp; Zhao 2021 Expert Rev Anti-infect Therapy), but making a blanket statement suggests that the authors are unfamiliar with the literature.</p>

<p>There are two issues: 1) We would argue that persister formation is not completely stochastic, but rather a probability that can be modified both genetically and by environment (for example hipA PMID: 6348026). 2) Even if persister formation were totally stochastic, the survival of these cells may depend on specific genes – as we indeed find in our Tn-Seq analysis of Mabs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 106. In this paragraph you need to define persister. The consensus definition (Balaban 2019 Nat Micro Rev) is a subpopulation of tolerant cells. Tolerance is defined as the slowing or absence of killing while an antibiotic retains its ability to block growth. See Zeng 2022 PNAS for example with rapidly growing cells. Phenotypic tolerance is the absence of killing due to environmental perturbations, most notably nutrient starvation, dormancy, and growth to stationary phase. By extension, phenotypic persistence would be subpopulation status of a phenotypically tolerant cells. If you have a different definition, it is important to state it and emphasize that you disagree with the consensus statement.</p>

<p>Line 109 unexpectedly. I would delete this word, because the literature leads the reader to expect this result unless you make a clear case for Mabs being fundamentally different from other bacteria with respect to how antibiotics kill bacteria (this is unlikely, see Shee 2022 AAC). Indeed, lines 111-113 state extensions of E. coli work, although suppression of ROS in phenotypic tolerance and genetic persistence have not been demonstrated.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in this question. All experiments in this paper were repeated multiple times. This particular experiment was repeated 3 times and in all replicates the katG mutant was sensitized to translation inhibitors but not levofloxacin. Shee et al examined Mtb treated with moxifloxacin and found ROS generation, but did not assess whether a Mtb katG mutant had impaired survival. Thus, in addition to differences in: i) the species studied and ii) the particular fluoroquinolone used, the two sets of experiments were designed to address different questions (ROS accumulation vs protection by katG) . A cell might accumulate ROS without a katG mutant having impaired survival if genetic redundancy exists – a result we indeed see in our clinical Mabs strains under some conditions (new data included in revised Figure 6A).</p>
