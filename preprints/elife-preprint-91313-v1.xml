<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (pDMG) are an aggressive type of childhood cancer with a fatal outcome. Their major epigenetic determinism has become clear, notably with the identification of K27M mutations in histone H3. However, the synergistic oncogenic mechanisms that induce and maintain tumor cell phenotype have yet to be deciphered.</p>
<p>In 20 to 30% of cases, these tumors have an altered BMP signaling pathway with an oncogenic mutation on the BMP type I receptor ALK2, encoded by <italic>ACVR1.</italic> However, the potential impact of the BMP pathway in tumors non-mutated for <italic>ACVR1</italic> is less clear. By integrating bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, we show here that the BMP signaling pathway is activated at similar levels between <italic>ACVR1</italic> wild type and mutant tumors and identify BMP2 and BMP7 as putative activators of the pathway in a specific subpopulation of cells. By using both pediatric isogenic glioma lines genetically modified to overexpress H3.3K27M and patients-derived DIPG cell lines, we demonstrate that BMP2/7 synergizes with H3.3K27M to induce a transcriptomic rewiring associated with a quiescent but invasive cell state. These data suggest a generic oncogenic role for the BMP pathway in gliomagenesis of pDMG and pave the way for specific targeting of downstream effectors mediating the BMP/K27M crosstalk.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pediatric Diffuse Midline Gliomas (pDMG), including Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) are rare and aggressive brain tumors that arise in the pons, thalamus or spinal cord of children, most commonly between the ages of 5 and 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. pDMG are almost uniformly fatal, with a median overall survival of 9 to 11 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, thereby representing the leading cause of mortality in pediatric neuro-oncology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Clinical management of pDMG and especially of DIPG is a major challenge given their location in vital nervous centers and their leptomeningeal dissemination, which prevent any prospect of surgical intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Radiotherapy, the current standard-of-care, is at best only transiently effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, pDMG are highly resistant to currently available chemotherapies although promising combinations of molecules, including ONC201, are currently in clinical trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>High-throughput sequencing demonstrated that pDMG are associated with a major disruption of the epigenetic landscape, resulting in 80% of cases from a lysine-to-methionine substitution at position 27 (K27M) in genes encoding histone variants H3.3 (<italic>H3F3A/H3-3A</italic>) or H3.1 (<italic>HIST1H3B/H3C2</italic> or <italic>HIST1H3C/H3C3</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. H3K27M variants, also known as oncohistones, are affine for EZH2, the methyltransferase subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and inhibit its activity. As a result, pDMG show abnormal methyl group deposition on H3K27 and a global loss of trimethylated H3K27 (H3K27me3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, a histone mark associated with transcriptional repression.</p>
<p>In addition to <italic>TP53</italic>, other genetic alterations have been described, notably in the <italic>PDGFR</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic> or <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, suggesting an oncogenic synergy between H3K27-based epigenetic remodeling and the activation of several transcriptional programs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Accordingly, 20 to 30% of pDMG cases are associated with mutations in the <italic>ACVR1</italic> gene, encoding for the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) type I receptor ALK2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, which leads to the overactivation of intracellular BMP signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Such increase in BMP signaling in pDMG epigenetic context has been suggested to promote tumorigenesis by maintaining cells in a proliferative, mesenchymal-like and undifferentiated state <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In 69% of cases, these <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutations are associated with the H3.1K27M mutation, whereas less than 20% are observed in H3.3K27M tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The question is then whether BMP signaling pathway could also be involved in the tumorigenesis of H3.3K27M-positive tumors. Recent data support the idea that H3.1K27M tumors mutated for <italic>ACVR1</italic> would emerge from a ventral pool of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) characterised by the expression of the transcription factor NKX6-1 and dependent on the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In contrast, H3.3K27M are thought to preferentially derive from dorsal progenitors expressing the dorsal PAX3- and BMP-dependent transcription factor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. In other words, H3.1K27M tumors would depend on the concomitant acquisition of the <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutation for transformation, whereas the BMP pathway could be activated in a tumor-independent manner in H3.3K27M tumors, due to their BMP-rich microenvironment. However, while the pro-tumorigenic activity of BMP signaling is clear in <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant pDMG, recent data have unexpectedly reported that BMP ligands may exert a tumor-suppressive activity in H3.3K27M-<italic>ACVR1</italic> wild-type (WT) pDMG cellular models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we have integrated bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data from patients with functional approaches in cellular models to characterize the impact of BMP activation in H3.3K27M-<italic>ACVR1</italic> WT pDMG. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that BMP signaling pathway activation ground state is independent of <italic>ACVR1</italic> status in pDMG, which likely results both from BMP2/7 tumor-autonomous and microenvironment-driven signals in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT tumors. Functional modeling on pediatric glioma cell lines and spatial transcriptomics unveil that H3.3K27M and BMP2/7 synergize to induce a transcriptomic switch leading to a quiescent but invasive cell state. These results shed new light on the complex phenotype resulting from the synergy between activation of the BMP pathway and epigenetic remodeling induced by the H3.3K27M mutation in pDMG, and the interest of a therapeutic approach targeting the downstream oncogenic pathways responsible for the invasive potential of tumor cells.</p>

<title>BMP pathway activation level is independent of <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutational status in pDMG, and likely supported by BMP2/BMP7 in H3.3K27M tumors</title>
<p>Oncogenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> and tumor-suppressive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> functions of the BMP pathway have both been reported in pDMG. To clarify this point, we first compared tumor clustering according to their <italic>ACVR1</italic> status, based on the transcriptional profiling of 193 BMP pathway target genes as a reliable readout of the pathway activation state, including notably the downstream transducers ID1, ID2, RUNX2 and GATA3 (see list in Supp. Table 1). Principal component analysis (PCA) performed on this BMP target genes subset demonstrates no segregation of <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant (in blue) from <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT samples (in red) in two independent publicly available transcriptomic cohorts of 31<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and 40<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement A, respectively). Consistently, the expression pattern of these genes does not segregate pDMG according to their <italic>ACVR1</italic> status in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis in both cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement B). To have a more comprehensive overview of BMP pathway activation level, we used the PROGENy method to infer downstream TGF- β/BMP response footprint from perturbation-response genes indicative of the pathway activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, we observed no significant difference in the TGF-β/BMP activation PROGENy score between <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant and WT tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>—figure supplement C). Of note, although variable, this score was even higher than the maximum observed in <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant tumors in 12.5 (cohort 2) to 18.5% (cohort 1) of <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT pDMG.</p>

Compatible with BMP signaling being active, several ligands, receptors, antagonists and intracellular transducers are expressed in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT pDMG, albeit at expression levels very similar to those observed in <italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant tumors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref>, D and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement B, D). By differential analysis, we found that only <italic>CHRDL1</italic> is significantly overexpressed in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT tumors compared to mutant ones in two independent transcriptomic cohorts, as previously reported in pDMG cell lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement D). Although its role in regulating the BMP pathway remains to be fully elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, the gain of <italic>CHRDL1</italic> expression is unlikely promoting the activation of the BMP pathway in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT tumors. Since no difference is observed in receptor expression consistently between the two cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement D), we hypothesized that activation of this pathway likely results from tumor-autonomous and/or microenvironment-driven production of ligands. Out of all BMP ligands present in pDMG tumors, BMP2 and BMP7 are the two most highly expressed ligands in H3.3K27M pDMG in both cohorts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement E). Once induced, BMP ligand production can be maintained by a positive transcriptional regulatory loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. We then reasoned that in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT pDMG, the priming signal may come from the microenvironment. Accordingly, it has been recently suggested that H3.3K27M DIPG likely occur in cells derived from dorsal PAX3+ BMP-reliant progenitors, and that the oncogenic transformation may result from a crosstalk with BMP ligands present in the microenvironment at that time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Regulation of dorsal glial cell fate during development has been shown to rely mostly on BMP4 and BMP7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. By analysing data from the ALLEN Developing Mouse Brain Atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, we observed that BMP7 is only expressed at E13.5 during embryogenesis. It is then progressively re-expressed post-natally from P14 notably in the pontine hindbrain, to reach a maximum in most territories including prosomere 2 at P28, which is compatible with the spatio-temporal window of occurrence of H3.3K27M pDMG tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). BMP2 is only expressed at the E18.5 embryonic stage and BMP4 expression peaks at P14 corresponding to infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, before decreasing during the post-natal period in these territories (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement F). Similarly, by integrating transcriptomic data from the HBT program<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, we observed that BMP7 expression but not BMP2 and BMP4 gradually increases to reach its maximum in the midline structure in the mid-childhood period (green curve, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>-figure supplement G), then coinciding with the peak incidence of pDMG tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Overall, the integration of transcriptomic data reveals that the induction of BMP signaling in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT pDMG, at a level equivalent to that observed in mutant tumors, could notably result from the production of BMP2 and/or 7, initiated by the expression of BMP7 by the microenvironment.</p>

<p>To functionally dissect the impact of H3.3K27M/BMP crosstalk and define whether it may have a rather oncogenic or tumor suppressive value, we first used the two previously described pediatric glioma Res259 and SF188 cell lines, which have been genetically modified to stably express and reproduce the epigenetic context either of WT or mutated forms of the variant H3.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.

<p>Using qRT-PCR as a first hint, we observed a significant increase in BMP targets expression following BMP7 treatment in both H3.3K27M-Res259 and -SF188 cells compared to H3.3 WT cell lines, with at least a 2-fold increase at 3 and 24 hours for both <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID2</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement C). Interestingly, both levels and kinetics of SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation in H3.3K27M versus WT overexpressing cells remain unchanged, indicating that BMP canonical pathway activation is not modified by histone mutational status (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement D). To further investigate and characterize the specificity of the response of H3.3 WT and mutant cells to BMP7, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis after 3h and 24h of treatment with recombinant BMP7. Using PROGENy analysis, we observed that the increase in TGF-β/BMP activation score induced by BMP7 is potentiated and remains significantly higher at 24 hours in H3.3K27M-Res259 compared to their wild-type counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). While differentially expressed genes at 3 hours mostly correspond to the expression of the K27M mutation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement E-F), a subset of 900 genes appears differentially expressed (DE) specifically between treated and untreated H3.3K27M-Res259 cells, but not in H3.3 WT ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Enrichment analyses revealed that DE genes are notably associated with alteration in cell cycle regulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>), and that the downregulated ones in H3.3K27M BMP7-treated cells correspond to E2F targets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement G). Consistently, BMP7 treatment leads to a significant 12.2% and 16.7% increase of cells in the G0/G1 phase respectively in H3.3K27M-SF188 and -Res259 cells, while its effect is limited to a 3% and 10.3% increase in their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Similarly, the number of H3.3K27M-Res259 cells is significantly reduced by 1.7-fold compared to non-treated cells upon BMP7 treatment, while the decrease is limited to 1.2- fold in WT ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement H). Of note, this K27M-dependent BMP7 effect is associated with a significant 1.8-fold increase in cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (<italic>CDKN1A</italic>, encoding P21; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) expression and a reciprocal decrease in RB1 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). This cell cycle blockade is unlikely to result from the entry of cells in senescence since there is no difference in beta-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal) between wild-type and mutant cells upon BMP7 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement I).</p>
<p>To further dissect the crosstalk between BMP7 and the H3.3K27M mutation, we established a decision tree algorithm to specifically isolate which of the 900 DE genes post-treatment BMP7 in H3.3K27M cells correspond to a potentiation of the effect of the K27M mutation by BMP7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement J, left panel), or to a specific effect of BMP7 in the K27M context (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>-figure supplement J, right panel). We then pinpointed DE genes that specifically correspond to cooperative effects of K27M epigenetic alterations and BMP7-mediated transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, enrichment analyses revealed that these genes are involved in processes related to invasion/migration, including extracellular matrix organization, regulation of cell/neuron projection and adhesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). Some of these genes such as <italic>ITGA2</italic>, <italic>ROBO2</italic>, and <italic>MMP28</italic> are already induced following H3.3K27M expression, and their expression is further amplified by the BMP7 treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). Conversely, others, such as <italic>COL28A1,</italic> are specifically induced or repressed by the K27M+BMP7 context (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>), consistently with our decision tree algorithm. We then assessed the combined impact of H3.3K27M expression and exposure to BMP7 on the invasive properties of glioma cells using a Matrigel™-coated transwell assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref>). Expression of the H3.3K27M mutation is sufficient to drive a moderate increase in invasion compared to the WT context. However, this phenomenon is largely amplified by BMP7, with a global 5.6-fold in the H3.3 mutant context, compared to 2-fold in the H3.3 WT one.</p>
<p>Altogether, these data support the fact that BMP7 is sufficient to induce a transcriptomic reprogramming specific to the H3.3K27M epigenetic context, which leads to the emergence of a quiescent but invasive cell state.</p>

<title>Combined BMP2/BMP7 expression drives a quiescent-invasive tumor cell state in pDMG</title>
<p>Considering the data obtained in the Res259/SF188 mechanistic models, we then sought to define whether this crosstalk between BMP and H3.3K27M was preserved with similar effects in H3.3K27M pDMG models. First, we observed that BMP7 is the most expressed ligand in two <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT/H3.3K27M DIPG cell lines, but that few if any other BMP ligands, including BMP4, are. Unlike in tumors, BMP2 expression is notably low in these cell lines (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement A). BMP2 has been shown to be induced by hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> or reactive oxygen species (ROS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Accordingly, exposure of <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT H3.3K27M DIPG cells to hypoxia or ONC201, which is known to significantly increase ROS production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, are both sufficient to induce a significant increase in BMP2 expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, BMP2 can be produced autonomously by tumor cells in response to specific stresses. To model the concomitant impact of BMP7 and stress-induced BMP2 in the H3.3K27M mutant background, we analysed the impact of addition of BMP2 on DIPG 3D-spheroids. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>- figures supplement B-C, treatment of DIPG spheroids with increasing doses of recombinant human BMP2 triggers SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and leads to a strong dose-dependent decrease in growth rate. Consistently, Ki67 staining, a marker of proliferation, is significantly decreased upon BMP2 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Reciprocally, treatment of DIPG-spheroids with the BMP inhibitor LDN-193189 (LDN) leads to a slight increase in KI67-positive cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In parallel, we explored the impact of BMP activation/inhibition on DIPG cells migration/invasion propensity. BMP2 significantly increases the migration of tumor cells from Matrigel™-embedded 3D-DIPG spheroids, while an antagonistic effect was observed upon LDN treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement D).</p>

</fig>
<p>To define whether such a BMP-induced quiescent-invasive cell state exists in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT H3.3K27M pDMG tumors, we first used publicly available scRNA-seq data from 10 patients’ biopsies published by Jessa and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Integration of all these data unveiled that the BMP-responsive (<italic>i.e.</italic> High PROGENy TGF-β/BMP score) pool of tumor cells correlate significantly with BMP receptors expression, in particular to <italic>BMPR2</italic>, <italic>BMPR1B</italic>, <italic>BMPR1A</italic>, and <italic>ACVR1</italic> levels, respectively in 8, 5, 5 and 4 out of 10 samples (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement E). Interestingly, this BMP-responsive pool of cells is significantly enriched in genes involved in positive regulation of cell migration and in cell-matrix adhesion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>), while showing a specific quiescent-compatible decrease in genes involved in transcription/translation processes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement F). To further define the extent and organization of this pool of cells, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis of 3 H3.3K27M pDMG tumors. Data integration was performed using pDMG-derived Visium and scRNA-seq signatures recently published by Ren et al. and Filbin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement G). Consistently with observations in bulk and single-cell analyses of patients/models, the highest BMP ligands expressed are BMP2 and BMP7 along with BMP8B (Suppl. Table 2 and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement G), whose expression is not spatially delimited or associated with a specific gene signature. In line with single-cell analyses, we observed on the contrary that BMP receptors expression correlate significantly with the invasive niche score defined by Ren et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>), which can be spatially restricted to histologically delineated areas (samples 1-3, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement G) or more dispersed within the tumor (sample 2, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement G). Moreover, the invasive niche score strongly correlates to the PROGENy TGF-β/BMP score (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>-figure supplement H). Coherently, this BMP-responsive invasive niche is characterised by a high expression of key markers of BMP activity (ID1), as well as markers of stemness (CD44, HEY1) and migration/invasion (TNC, IGFBP7, ITGAV) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these data indicate that tumor-autonomous production of BMP2 and BMP7 synergize to maintain a quiescent-invasive niche in H3.3K27M DIPG.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Major advances have been made in understanding the molecular bases of pDMG, among which DIPG, with the identification of the major epigenetic remodeling processes induced by histone H3 mutations. However, the oncogenic mechanisms cooperating with these mutations to induce transformation and tumor escape remain largely undefined.</p>
<p>Along this line, a key challenge is to define the precise role of the transcriptomic reprogramming induced by the BMP pathway, which remains controversial in these pediatric brain tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Herein, we performed a comprehensive integration of transcriptomic data, which first supports the view of BMP signaling being also clearly activated in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT/H3.3K27M pDMG. Effect of BMP activation is potentiated by the epigenetic context of these tumors, then leading to a global transcriptional reprogramming. Although it has been previously described that <italic>ACVR1</italic>-mutant tumors exhibit a higher expression of <italic>ID1</italic> and <italic>ID2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, the extrapolation of BMP activity from a larger signature of BMP targets and on a score calculated from the inference of gene expression perturbations in response to the TGF-β/BMP pathway indicates the existence of a compensatory mechanism driving BMP activation in non-<italic>ACVR1</italic> mutant tumors. By analysing the expression of BMP effectors in pDMG tumors and patient-derived DIPG models, we propose that activation of this pathway in <italic>ACVR1</italic> WT H3.3K27M tumors could be at least partially mediated by two complementary tumor-autonomous and microenvironment-dependent mechanisms. Upon initiation, the expression of BMP, and notably BMP7, could synergize with or even trigger the autocrine production of BMP ligands by the tumors, among which BMP2 and 7. Indeed, such positive feedback loops maintaining the expression of BMP ligands have already been described notably during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, BMP secretion by the microenvironment may prime the BMP activation in tumor cells and be required for oncogenic transformation. Once established, the dynamic modulation of BMP2 expression in response to stresses, such as hypoxia or treatments, could synergize with constitutive production of BMP7 to drive the emergence of an aggressive cell state.</p>
<p>Second, our data are in favor of a rather global oncogenic role of BMP pathway in pDMG gliomagenesis. The tumor suppressor activity of the BMP pathway had been largely extrapolated because of its positive impact on tumor cell quiescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Indeed, using a genetically engineered glioma model, we confirmed that BMP7 is sufficient to potentiate the entry of cells in a quiescent state in a H3.3K27M-dependent manner, via a transcriptomic switch largely relying on the downregulation of E2F-targets cell-cycle regulating genes. Nevertheless, this quiescent cellular phenotype could paradoxically constitute an aggressive treatment-resistant state, as previously observed in adult glioblastoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> and thus explaining its increase in response to treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Along the same line, the impact of CHRDL1 increase in H3.3K27M tumors on BMP pathway inhibition may probably need to be qualified<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Indeed, if CHRDL1 was first classified as a member of the chordin family of secreted BMP antagonists due to sequence homology, it has been shown that it exerts BMP-independent functions in synapses plasticity and maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, this protein has also been described as an activator of the BMP pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, suggesting that its high level of expression may not be a robust marker of BMP activation state.</p>
<p>However, it cannot be ruled out also that different ligands of the BMP pathway may have different impacts on the cellular phenotype induced by the H3.3K27M mutation. Accordingly, it was shown that BMP4 treatment promotes differentiation of DIPG tumor cells, in line with its putative tumor suppressor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. However, beyond quiescence, we observed that BMP activation by BMP2/7 in a H3.3K27M epigenetic context induces a transcriptomic switch rather conferring enhanced invasion potential to pDMG tumor cells. Because the level of BMP2/7 is particularly important i) in bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic tumors, ii) in patient-derived cell models, and because the dynamics of BMP7 induction in the post-natal period coincide with the spatio-temporal window of pDMG onset, we believe that the role of the BMP2/7 couple is non-negligible in the pathogenesis of pDMG. Interestingly, this pair has already been shown to trigger BMP signaling as a heterodimer notably during embryogenesis, with a higher efficiency than the homodimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Keeping in mind that BMP2 appears to be dynamically regulated by tumor cells upon stress, these data suggest that activation of the BMP pathway may be finely regulated in pDMG to be maintained at a moderate, oncogenic level, without triggering the tumor-suppressive effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> or negative regulatory loops associated with its over-activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The next question is whether a therapeutic perspective can be defined by targeting the crosstalk between epigenetic modifications induced by the H3.3K27M mutation and transcriptomic reprogramming induced by BMP2/7. The BMP2/7-driven cell state that we described here fits with previous results obtained in other glioma models, in which a subpopulation of quiescent cells was identified as partially responsible of tumor invasiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, a hallmark of pDMG aggressiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. Given the complexity of the phenotype induced by BMP/H3.3K27M crosstalk and the pleiotropic role of BMP proteins in central nervous system, the therapeutic strategy to be developed should be based on the targeting of the downstream effectors, such as ID1 as recently described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>, or TNC, which may be responsible for the invasive phenotype. Upcoming challenges will be to precisely define the identity of these pro-invasive BMP effectors, to set up a combinatorial therapeutic approach, simultaneously targeting the proliferative compartment and the BMP-responsive H3.3K27M invasive cell state.</p>

<p>For pDMG cell lines grown as spheroids, HSJD-DIPG-012 were plated in 10% Matrigel (Corning, 354277) in Nunc<sup>™</sup> Lab-Tek™ Chamber Slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 177402). Media and matrigel were supplemented with either 10 ng/mL human recombinant BMP2 or 1 µM LDN-193189 (Selleckchem, S2618). Invasiveness was measured at 48 hr after seeding. Images were captured using an EVOS-7000 (Invitrogen) and analyzed using the ‘ROI’ feature in the Fiji software.</p>

<title>Spheroids growth monitoring</title>
<p>To assess the effects of BMP2 on pDMG spheroids, 1×10<sup>4</sup> cells of HSJD-DIPG-012 or HSJD-DIPG-014 were seeded in 96-well plates (Corning, 7007). Cells were treated at seeding with concentrations of 1, 5, 20, 50 or 200 ng/mL of human recombinant BMP2 (Peprotech, 120-02C). Media were renewed twice a week, with or without recombinant BMP2. Cell growth was monitored using an EVOS-7000 (Invitrogen) and pictures of control and treated 6-days or 9-days spheres were used to calculate sphere area of HSJD-DIPG-014 and HSJD-DIPG-012, respectively.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>HSJD-DIPG-012 spheroids were treated when reaching a diameter of 600 µm either with 200 ng/mL of human recombinant BMP2 or with 1 µM of LDN-193189. Spheroids were then fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h at room temperature, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. 8 µm-sections were then deparaffinized, rehydrated, and heated in a citrate buffer (0.01 M; pH 6.0) for 15 min. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate dilution of anti-Ki67 (1:100, Dako, M7240) in TBS containing Horse Serum (2%). After several washes in TBS-Tween 0.05 %, sections were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 hr, and then washed again in TBS-Tween 0.05 %. Color was developed with 3,3’-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector Laboratories, SK-4100) incubation for 1 to 3 min and with Hematoxylin (Vector Laboratories, H-3401) incubation for 3 min. Images were captured using an EVOS-7000 (Invitrogen) and quantification of Ki67-positive cells was assessed using the “Cell Positive Detection” QuPath function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>, with parameters: &quot;Optical density sum&quot;, &quot;thresholdCompartment&quot;: &quot;Cell: DAB OD mean&quot;, &quot;thresholdPositive2&quot;: 0.25.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study examined whether the BMP signaling pathway has a role in H3.3K27M DMG tumors, regardless of the presence of ACRVR1 activating mutations. The authors show <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that BMP2/7 synergizes with H3.3K27M to induce a transcriptomic rewiring associated with a quiescent but invasive cell state. Although this work could be further enhanced by the inclusion of additional models as well as further consideration of elements, such as the location of the tumor, in the datasets used, overall this work suggests that BMP2/7 could be considered as a target for future therapies in this deadly cancer.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Mutational analysis of diffuse midline glioma (DMG) found that ACVR1 mutations, which up-regulate the BMP signaling pathway are found in most H3.1K27M, but not H3.3K27M DMG cases. In this manuscript, Huchede et al attempted to determine whether the BMP signaling pathway has any role in H3.3K27M DMG tumors. They found that the BMP signaling is activated to a similar level in H3.3K27M DMG cells with wild-type ACVR1 compared to ACVR1 DMG cells, likely due to the expression of BMP7 or BMP2. They went on to test whether cells treated with BMP7 or BMP2 treatments affected the gene expression and cell fitness of tumor cells with H3.3K27M mutation. They concluded that BMP2/7 synergizes with H3.3K27M to induce a transcriptomic rewiring associated with a quiescent but invasive cell state. The major issue for this conclusion is that the authors did not use the right models/controls to obtain results to support this conclusion as detailed below. Therefore, in order to strengthen the conclusion, the authors need to address the major concerns below.</p>
<p>Strength:</p>
<p>
This paper addresses an important question in the DMG field.</p>
<p>Major concerns/weakness:</p>
<p>1. All the results in Fig. 2 utilized two glioma lines SF188 and Res259. The authors should repeat all these experiments in a couple of H3.3K27M DMG lines by deleting the H3.3K27M mutation first.</p>
<p>2. Fig. 3. The experiments of BMP2 treatment should be repeated in other H3.3K27M DMG lines using H3.1K27M ACVR1 mutant tumor lines as controls.</p>
<p>Minor concerns</p>
<p>
Fig.2A. BMP2 expression increased in H3.3K27M SF188 cells. Therefore, the statement &quot;whereas BMP2 and BMP4 expressions are not significantly modified (Figure 2A and Figure 2-figure supplement A-B)&quot; is not accurate.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Huchede et al investigates the BMP pathway in H3K27M-mutant gliomas carrying or not activating mutations in ALK2 (ACVR1). Their results in cell lines and in datasets acquired from the literature on patient tumors indicate that the BMP signaling pathway is activated at similar levels between ACVR1 wild-type and mutant tumors. The group further identifies BMP2 and BMP7 as possibly the main activators of the pathway in cells. They then show that BMP2 and 7 crosstalk with the H3 mutation and synergize to induce transcriptomic rewiring leading to an invasive cell state.</p>
<p>The paper is well-written and easy to follow with a robust experimental plan and datasets supporting the claims. While previous work (acknowledged by the authors) indicated activation of BMP in H3K27M tumors, wild type for the ACVR1 mutation this paper is a nice addition and provides further mechanistic cues as to the importance of the BMP pathway and specific members in these deadly brain cancers. The effect of these BMPs in quiescence and invasion is of particular interest.</p>
<p>A few suggestions to clarify the message are provided below</p>
<p>
1- In thalamic diffuse midline gliomas, the BMP pathway should not be activated as it is in the pons. The authors should identify thalamic tumors in the datasets they explored and patients-derived cell lines from thalamic tumors available to investigate whether this pathway is active across all H3.3K27M mutants in the brain midline or specifically in tumors from the pons.</p>
<p>2- There are ~20% H3.3K27M tumors that carry an ACVR1 mutation and similar numbers of H3.1K27M that are wild type for this gene. Can the authors identify these outliers in their datasets and assess the activation of BMP2 and 7 or other BMP pathway members in this context?</p>
<p>In all this is an interesting paper that provides meaningful data to pursue clinical targeting of the BMP pathway, which would be a nice addition to the field.</p>

<p>We thank the referee for his/her comments that will help us to strengthen our conclusions.</p>
<p>The reviewer's proposal is interesting, but this approach to deletion of the K27M mutation rather answers the question of the role of the BMP pathway in maintaining the phenotype of DMG cells. Our aim in the first part of this article (with Res and SF188) is rather to study how the BMP pathway can participate in installing a particular cellular state at the time of expression of the K27M mutation. In other words, the underlying idea is to define the phenotypic changes specifically associated with activation of the BMP pathway when epigenetic modifications are induced by expression of the K27M mutation. We have chosen the SF188 and Res259 models to remain in a glial context, but it would indeed be interesting to test the effect of this synergy in other models, closer to the cells of origin of DMG. In any case, these models should make it possible to answer the question of the cellular state transition at the moment of K27M expression, even if the reciprocal question of the reversibility of this state proposed by the reviewer is also of interest for understanding the oncogenic synergy between BMP/K27M.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We will provide the results of these experiments in a revised version. The use of mutant ACVR1 lines is interesting, but their control status seems questionable, as the addition of BMPs could have a cumulative effect on the effect of the mutation, notably by activating other receptors in the pathway.</p>

<p>The referee's question is an interesting one, and we will try to see if we can determine tumor’s location from the public data we've used. We will nevertheless try to determine whether the inter-patient variability observed in the level of activation of the BMP pathway may be due, in particular, to different tumor locations.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, defining the level of activation of the pathway in this type of H3.3K27M ACVR1 mutant or H3.1K27M ACVR1 wt tumors would be extremely interesting, but no samples of this type are a priori included in the datasets analyzed. Instead, we will try to define the phenotype of cell lines of this type in response to BMP.</p>
