<title>Abstract</title>
<p>CD8<sup>+</sup> tissue resident memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) develop from effectors that seed peripheral tissues where they persist providing defense against subsequent challenges. T<sub>RM</sub> persistence requires autocrine TGFβ transactivated by integrins expressed on keratinocytes. T<sub>RM</sub> precursors that encounter antigen in the epidermis during development outcompete bystander T<sub>RM</sub> for TGFβ resulting in enhanced persistence. ScRNA-seq analysis of epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> revealed that local antigen experience in the skin resulted in an enhanced differentiation signature in comparison with bystanders. Upon recall, T<sub>RM</sub> displayed greater proliferation dictated by affinity of antigen experienced during epidermal development. Finally, local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> differentially expressed TGFβRIII, which increases avidity of the TGFβRI/II receptor complex for TGFβ. Selective ablation of <italic>Tgfbr3</italic> reduced local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> capacity to persist, rendering them phenotypically like bystander T<sub>RM</sub>. Thus, antigen driven TCR signaling in the epidermis during T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation results in a lower TGFβ requirement for persistence and increased proliferative capacity that together enhance epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> fitness.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tissue resident CD8 memory T cells (T<sub>RM</sub>) are a highly abundant, non-circulating, long-lived subset of memory T cells that play an important role in protecting against re-infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. T<sub>RM</sub> also provide immunosurveillance against neoplasia and are thought to be pathogenic in some autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In the skin, following infection with vaccinia virus (VV) or herpes simplex virus, T<sub>RM</sub> develop from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effectors (T<sub>EFF</sub>) that expand following priming in the lymph node and are recruited into the skin by inflammatory signals where they preferentially reside in the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Unlike T<sub>RM</sub> in some tissues, re-encounter with cognate antigen in the skin is not required for T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> that encounter cognate antigen in the skin or bystander T<sub>RM</sub> that do not encounter antigen both develop with equal efficiency and both express similar levels of the canonical T<sub>RM</sub> markers CD103 and CD69[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>
<p>The cytokine transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is required for cutaneous T<sub>RM</sub> development at multiple stages. TGFβ signaling in the lymph node during steady state epigenetically preconditions naïve CD8 T cells allowing for later T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. T<sub>EFF</sub> recruited into skin require TGFβ signaling for entry into the epidermis and differentiation into T<sub>RM</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Once epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> have differentiated, these cells continue to require TGFβ signaling to retain epidermal residence. TGFβ is produced bound to the latency associate peptide that prevents bioactivity until the complex is activated which in the epidermis is mediated exclusively by activation via the integrins α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>6</sub> and α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>8</sub> expressed by keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Epidermal persistence of T<sub>RM</sub> depends on autocrine TGFβ which is transactivated by the integrins ⍺vβ6 and ⍺vβ8[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Inducible ablation in T<sub>RM</sub> of a required component of the TGFβ receptor (TGFβRII) or TGFβ1 as well as ablation of ⍺vβ6 and ⍺vβ8 in keratinocytes all result in loss of epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We previously reported that local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> that have encountered cognate antigen in the skin are better able to persist in the epidermis than bystander T<sub>RM</sub> that have not encountered antigen in the skin when active TGFβ is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. This is evident when TGFβ activation is experimentally reduced by small molecule inhibition of ⍺vβ6 and ⍺vβ8 and when established T<sub>RM</sub> compete with newly recruited T<sub>EFF</sub> cells for limiting amounts of TGFβ activation. In both instances, bystander T<sub>RM</sub> are preferentially lost from the epidermis while local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> persist. Thus, encounter with antigen in the skin results in more fit T<sub>RM</sub> and represents a potential opportunity to preferentially enrich antigen-specific over bystander T<sub>RM</sub> cells during repeated challenges.</p>
<p>Herein, we delineate mechanisms of T<sub>RM</sub> homeostasis by demonstrating that within a population of endogenous T<sub>RM</sub>, antigen encounter in the skin is required for their full differentiation whereas bystander T<sub>RM</sub> are maintained at an earlier developmental stage. We also find that local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> have increased proliferative capacity during a recall response compared to bystander T<sub>RM</sub> that is dependent on affinity of antigen experienced in skin thus providing an additional functional attribute defining T<sub>RM</sub> fitness. Finally, we show that expression of TGFβRIII by local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> which can be induced following TCR ligation is required for epidermal persistence when active TGFβ is limiting.</p>

<title>Epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> are transcriptionally heterogeneous</title>
<p>The recruitment of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into mouse flank skin via a viral infection (e.g. Vaccinia Virus) or through an inflammatory stimulus (e.g. “DNFB-pull”) results in equal numbers of long-lived CD103<sup>+</sup> epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> and is independent of the presence or absence of cognate antigen in the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. This, however, has only been demonstrated using HSV-specific (gBT-I) or OVA-specific (OT-I) TCR transgenic T cells. To determine if endogenous polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells share this phenotype, we employed a dual VV infection “DNFB-pull” model. Cohorts of wildtype C57BL/6 mice were infected on the left flank with VV by skin scarification (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The infection expanded CD8<sup>+</sup> effectors specific for VV antigens which were then recruited into the left flank in response to the ongoing infection-induced inflammation. DNFB is applied to the right flank 5 days post infection to recruit into the skin circulating CD8 effectors expanded by infection. Mice were then rested for 50+ days to allow for the formation of T<sub>RM</sub>. We have previously found that evaluation of T<sub>RM</sub> numbers in the epidermis by flow cytometry is much less accurate than direct immunofluorescent visualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>].</p>

<p>Evaluation of whole mounted epidermal sheets stained with anti-CD8 revealed equal numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells at the VV infected (left flank) and DNFB treated (right flank) sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Expression of CD103 on T<sub>RM</sub> as evaluated by flow cytometry was also similar at both sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref><bold> and S1A</bold>). To evaluate the frequency of antigen-specific T cells at each site, skin from a separate cohort was examined by flow cytometry using the B8R tetramer which recognizes an immunodominant epitope of VV in H2-K<sup>b</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. We observed equivalent numbers of B8R<sup>+</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> at the VV-infected and DNFB treated sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref><bold> and </bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). From these data we conclude that polyclonal CD8 T cells form epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> with equal efficiency when recruited into the skin by viral infection or sterile inflammation and that the presence or absence of cognate antigen in the skin has no effect on the number or frequency of antigen-specific T<sub>RM</sub>.</p>
<p>Although T<sub>RM</sub> efficiently populate the epidermis independently of cutaneous cognate antigen, we have previously demonstrated that T<sub>RM</sub> that form at skin sites containing cognate antigen are functionally distinct from bystander T<sub>RM</sub> that form in its absence[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. To analyze potential transcriptional differences between local antigen experienced and bystander T<sub>RM</sub>, we performed single-cell RNAseq in collaboration with the ImmgenT consortium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The consortium consists of multiple groups that isolated populations of murine T cells from multiple tissues and contexts and then subjected them to single-cell RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>](see Methods). 627,692 mature T cells from 80 different experiments and 703 samples were integrated and batch-corrected using totalVI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>] (see Methods).</p>
<p>Cells were projected in two dimensions using Minimal-Distorted Embedding (see Methods) revealing the expected transcriptional clustering of distinct types of T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). As part of the consortium, we isolated cells from the flanks of rested (&gt;65 days) VV-infected or DNFB treated flank skin by enzymatic digestion. Cells were pooled from 10 mice and purified based on expression of CD90 and CD8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2118">FigureS1B</xref>). As expected, most cells expressed CD69 and CD103 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2118">Figure S1C</xref>). Skin cells from each group and naïve spleen cells were hash tagged and analyzed by single-cell RNA-seq.</p>
<p>Analysis of transcripts revealed a total of 6 clusters (0-5) which are shown overlayed on the complete ImmgenT cell embedding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref><bold>, S1D</bold>). As expected, most cells clustered with CD8⍺β T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref><bold>, black</bold>). There was, however, a high degree of heterogeneity and some, possibly contaminating cells fell outside of this region. A comparison of the relative frequency of cells in each of the clusters (0-5) isolated from the VV or DNFB sites revealed a strong enrichment of cluster 3 in the VV group and of clusters 0 and 2 in the DNFB group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref><bold>, magenta</bold>). This suggested that cluster 3 cells were manifesting a distinct transcriptional state likely induced by antigen encounter in the skin.</p>

<title>Cutaneous antigen is required for complete T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that cells in cluster 3 could be T<sub>RM</sub> that have encountered antigen in the skin during development, we performed signature score enrichment analysis comparing the transcriptional profile of our cells to published core genes of well-defined CD8 T cell states. Signature scores were calculated based on normalized differential gene expression compared to core genes from T<sub>RM</sub> (GSE47045), activated T cells (T<sub>ACT</sub>, GSE10239), circulating memory T cells (T<sub>MEM</sub>, GSE41867), and exhausted T cells (T<sub>EX</sub>, GS41867) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Notably, cells in cluster 3 showed enriched expression of T<sub>RM</sub> core genes compared to all other clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We performed a similar analysis using pseudo-bulk analysis of all cells isolated from the VV or DNFB sites. Consistent with the enrichment of cluster 3 in cells from the VV site, we found a strong enrichment of T<sub>RM</sub> core genes in the VV group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest that cells in cluster 3 isolated from the VV site represent fully differentiated T<sub>RM</sub>.</p>

<p>To further test the hypothesis that cluster 3 represents fully differentiated T<sub>RM</sub>, we performed signature score enrichment analysis of clusters 0-5 against a dataset of skin T cells isolated at different times following skin VV infection (GSE79805) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Cells from clusters 0, 2 and 3 showed similar signature scores in comparison with skin T cells up to day 5 post infection, however clusters 0 and 2 then plateaued suggesting a lack of continued differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, cluster 3 transcripts scored higher at later time points in T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation. Signature scores for cells isolated from the DNFB and VV sites were similar at early time points but diverged at later time points with increased scores observed in cells from the VV site (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that T<sub>RM</sub> isolated from skin sites where they can encounter cognate antigen are transcriptionally more fully differentiated T<sub>RM</sub> while bystander T<sub>RM</sub> isolated from a site lacking cognate antigen remain in a less differentiated state.</p>

<title>Local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> have improved expansion in a recall response</title>
<p>Analysis of the 10 highest differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in cluster 3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2118">Figure S1D</xref>) showed increased expression of genes associated with T cell activation including <italic>Dusp1</italic> and <italic>Nr4a1</italic> as well as the AP-1 family members J<italic>unb</italic> and <italic>Fos</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Given the importance of AP-1 family members in T cell proliferation and differentiation, we next tested whether this corresponded to functional differences in T<sub>RM</sub> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>].</p>
<p>An important functional property of T<sub>RM</sub> is their capacity to rapidly expand following re-encounter with cognate antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. To determine whether local antigen experienced and bystander T<sub>RM</sub> have different recall responses, we repeated our dual VV infection and DNFB “pull” model in combination with an OT-I adoptive transfer model to allow for antigen recall using the SIINFEKL peptide. CD90.1<sup>+</sup> OT-I cells were adoptively transferred into naïve C57BL/6 mice followed by infection with a vaccinia virus expressing SIINFEKL peptide, OVA<sub>257-264</sub> (VV-OVA) on the left flank. On day 5 post infection, the right flank was treated with DNFB to recruit expanded OT-I effectors to the site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). On day 50+ after infection, topical SIINFEKL peptide or control PBS was painted on both flanks in a single application (1° recall). The total number of OT-I cells in the epidermis 6 days later was determined by immunofluorescent microscopic evaluation of the CD90.1 congenic marker in epidermal whole mounts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Restimulation with peptide led to an expansion of T<sub>RM</sub> at both sites compared to PBS treated controls. Notably, local antigen experienced OT-I T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the VV-OVA treated flanks expanded to a larger extent compared to bystander T<sub>RM</sub> in DNFB treated flanks. To inhibit potential recruitment of circulating effector OT-I cells, we repeated these experiments administering FTY720 to block migration of T cells from lymph node or titrated anti-Thy1.1 antibody to ablate circulating OT-I but not T<sub>RM</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Both methods successfully depleted OT-I from the blood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2118">Figure S2A-D</xref>), without affecting T<sub>RM</sub> in the skin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="d1e2118">Figure S2E</xref>). Administration of FTY720 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>) or anti-Thy1.1 treatment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) had no effect on the number of OT-I T<sub>RM</sub> in the epidermis after a 1° recall response and local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> from the VV-OVA treated flank still expanded to a greater degree than bystander T<sub>RM</sub> from the DNFB treated flank. Thus, the increased number of epidermal OT-I at the local antigen experienced VV site during a 1° recall does not appear to result from recruitment of circulating cells.</p>

<p>Finally, to determine whether increased expansion by local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> persists with multiple rounds of stimulation, we repeated this experiment but allowed mice to rest for 120 days after the 1° recall response. The number of T<sub>RM</sub> at both the VV-OVA and DNFB sites contracted down to equivalent numbers that were increased compared to PBS treated, control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Mice were then given a 2° recall by a second application of peptide at day +176. The number of T<sub>RM</sub> expanded but T<sub>RM</sub> at the VV-OVA site increased by a larger amount than T<sub>RM</sub> at the DNFB site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Based on these data, we conclude that T<sub>RM</sub> encountering antigen in the skin during development expand more efficiently in response to antigen re-encounter and this phenotype persists long-term with subsequent antigen encounters.</p>

<title>Local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> exhibit increased proliferation during a recall response</title>
<p>We next hypothesized that the increased expansion of local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> during a recall response resulted from increased proliferation. To test this, as above, WT mice adoptively transferred with OT-I cells were infected with VV-OVA on the left flank and DNFB on the right flank 5 days later. After at least 50 days of rest, both sides were painted with topical SIINFEKL peptide and mice were administered 2 mg of BrdU i.p. daily (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Epidermal sheets for immunofluorescent visualization were harvested 2 days later. We noted a clear increase in the percent and total number of doublets as well as the total number of OT-I T cells in the epidermis at the VV-OVA site compared with the DNFB site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref>). Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry, with an increase in the percentage of BrdU<sup>+</sup> in T<sub>RM</sub> isolated from the VV-OVA site (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-G</xref>). Staining for Annexin V was equivalent in both groups suggesting that an altered rate of apoptosis does not contribute to the observed changes in expansion (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-I</xref>). In sum, local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> show augmented proliferation during an antigen recall response compared with bystander T<sub>RM</sub>. Moreover, an enhanced proliferative capacity following antigen restimulation can now be added to other parameters of T<sub>RM</sub> fitness including enhanced epidermal persistence when active TGFβ is limited.</p>

<title>T<sub>RM</sub> fitness depends on TCR signal-strength</title>
<p>We next hypothesized that the strength of TCR signal provided in the skin during T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation should correlate with T<sub>RM</sub> phenotype at late time points. To test this hypothesis, WT mice were adoptively transferred with OT-I cells then infected with VV-OVA on the left flank and 5 days later were challenged with DNFB on the right flank (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). One day later, the DNFB site was painted with PBS, SII<bold>N</bold>FEKL (N4), or an altered peptide ligand SI<bold>Y</bold>NFEKL (Y3) which has ¼ the avidity for the OT-I TCR receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. After 50+ days of rest, all mice were challenged in a 1° recall response with topical N4 or control PBS at the DNFB sides (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Epidermal sheets for immunofluorescence were harvested 6 days later. As expected, mice restimulated with PBS showed equivalent numbers of T<sub>RM</sub> regardless of which peptide was provided during development (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>). Following a 1° recall response, T<sub>RM</sub> exposed to N4 (DNFB + N4) expanded to a level equivalent to T<sub>RM</sub> from the VV-OVA site. In contrast, T<sub>RM</sub> exposed to Y3 (DNFB + Y3) showed a degree of expansion that was intermediate compared to T<sub>RM</sub> that did not experience antigen in the skin (DNFB+PBS) and those that experienced SIINFEKL (DNFB + N4). Thus, the strength of TCR engagement determines the fitness of T<sub>RM</sub> based on their capacity to expand during a 1° recall response.</p>

<title>Local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> have improved persistence mediated by TGFßRIII</title>
<p>A feature of local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> is that they are better able to persist in the epidermis than bystanders when levels of activated TGFβ are limited, either artificially or during competition with newly recruited T<sub>EFF</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We have previously found that expression of the canonical TGFβ receptors, <italic>Tgfbr1</italic> and <italic>Tgfbr2</italic> have equivalent expression in local antigen experienced and bystander T<sub>RM</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. However, there is a third TGFβ receptor, TGFβRIII, that lacks a signaling component but functions as a reservoir of ligand for TGFβ, increasing avidity of the TGFβ receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Notably, expression of TGFβRIII has been reported to increase in T cells following TCR ligation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. This was confirmed in vitro with anti-CD3 anti-CD28 stimulated OT-I splenocytes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We also observed increased expression of TGFβRIII in vivo comparing local antigen experienced OT-I T<sub>RM</sub> with bystanders (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-C</xref>). Based on this data, we hypothesized that increased expression of TGFβRIII on antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> could explain their capacity to maintain epidermal residence when available TGFβ is limiting.</p>

<p>To test this, we generated OT-I Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> E8i-cre<sup>ERT2</sup> huNGFR Tgfbr3<sup>fl/fl</sup> (Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup>) mice which allow for inducible ablation of <italic>Tgfbr3</italic> from T<sub>RM</sub> as well control OT-I Thy1.1<sup>+</sup> E8i-cre<sup>ERT2</sup> huNGFR <italic>Tgfbr3</italic><sup>WT/WT</sup> (Tgfbr3<sup>WT</sup>) mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). To validate these mice, Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup> mice were treated with 0.05mg/g tamoxifen i.p. for 5 days. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tamoxifen treated Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup> mice were then isolated from spleen and lymph nodes and cultured for 2 days with anti-CD3 anti-CD28. Cells were evaluated by flow cytometry for expression TGFβRIII and huNGFR, an indicator of successful induction of cre-mediated excision by tamoxifen. In the huNGFR-negative population where cre was not activated, approximately 50% of the cells expressed TGFβRIII (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>). In contrast, TGFβRIII was largely absent from cells co-expressing huNGFR indicative of efficient ablation of <italic>Tgfbr3</italic>.</p>
<p>To ablate TGFβRIII from T<sub>RM</sub> once they have fully differentiated in the epidermis, we next adoptively transferred CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from either Tgfbr3<sup>WT</sup> or Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup> mice into naïve WT mice followed by skin VV-OVA infection on the left flank. On day 5 post infection, the right flank was treated with DNFB. After at least 50 days of rest to allow for T<sub>RM</sub> formation, both cohorts were treated daily with 0.05mg/g tamoxifen i.p. to transform approximately 50% of adoptively transferred cells, generating populations of both control huNGFR negative and huNGFR positive OT-I cells. To test the effects of TGFβRIII ablation, TGFβ activation was inhibited for 10 days by i.p. administration of CWHM12, a small molecule inhibitor of integrins ⍺vβ6 and ⍺vβ8 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G-H</xref>).</p>
<p>Analysis of epidermal whole mounts by immunofluorescence revealed that blockade of TGFβ activation reduced the number of bystander Tgfbr3<sup>WT</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> at the DNFB site, but not local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> at the VV-OVA site, consistent with our earlier results (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-J</xref>). In contrast, local antigen experienced huNGFR<sup>+</sup> Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> from the VV-OVA site that lack TGFβRIII were efficiently depleted from the epidermis by CWHM12 treatment. The depletion of bystander huNGFR<sup>+</sup> Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> at the DNFB site was augmented. Notably, numbers of Tgfbr3<sup>ΔCD8</sup> T<sub>RM</sub> in cohorts treated with vehicle remained at normal levels indicating that loss of TGFβRIII does not affect T<sub>RM</sub> epidermal residence in the steady state. Thus, expression of TGFβRIII by local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> which is downstream of TCR ligation is required for their capacity to remain in the epidermis when activated TGFβ is limiting.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein we have demonstrated that the increased capacity of local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> to persist in the epidermis when levels of TGFβ are limited is mediated by increased expression of TGFβRIII. We also show that local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> have increased proliferative capacity during repeated antigen recalls. In addition, the increased proliferative capacity was directly correlated with the strength of TCR stimulation during T<sub>RM</sub> development. Finally, we found that local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> appear more transcriptionally related to fully differentiated T<sub>RM</sub>. Taken together, these data support a model in which TCR engagement by cognate antigen in the skin is a required final step in T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation resulting in their increased fitness exemplified by increased proliferative capacity and the ability to persist in the epidermis when active TGFβ is limited.</p>
<p>We propose that the augmented fitness of local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> represents a mechanism to enrich for high avidity TCR-clones in the epidermis. Skin inflammation recruits T<sub>EFF</sub> into the skin, some of which develop into T<sub>RM</sub>. In the absence of competition with pre-existing T<sub>RM</sub>, T<sub>RM</sub> form equally efficiently in the presence or absence of cognate antigen. Thus, we found equivalent numbers of bystander T<sub>RM</sub> at the DNFB and local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> at the VV sites with both TCR transgenic and endogenous T cells. In contrast, when new T<sub>EFF</sub> are recruited into sites with pre-existing T<sub>RM</sub>, there is clonal competition for limited amounts of active TGFβ resulting in enrichment of fitter, local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. We now find that this enrichment likely results from 2 different competitive advantages. First, antigen encounter in the skin results in increased expression of TGFβRIII which increases TGFβ avidity for the signaling by the TGFβ receptor. Since TGFβ signaling is required for epidermal persistence, this would provide an advantage for local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> over bystanders. Second, local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> have increased proliferation when re-encountering antigen in the epidermis. Following repeated challenges which would be expected outside of SPF conditions, the combination of improved expansion and persistence would work together to enrich for high avidity clones thereby shaping the epidermal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory pool. Recently, it has been observed that T<sub>RM</sub> can contribute significantly to the pool of circulating memory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Thus, mechanisms augmenting epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> fitness that shape the pool of epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> may also affect the pool of systemic memory cells and represent an example of extra-thymic clonal section.</p>
<p>When T<sub>RM</sub> were challenged in a primary antigen recall response, we noted that local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub> expanded to a greater extent than bystanders. This expansion resulted from increased in-situ proliferation with minimal contribution from newly recruited T<sub>EFF</sub>, consistent with prior reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Interestingly, a similar phenomenon occurred following a second encounter with antigen. This indicates that encounter with peptide at a late time point after T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation (&gt;50 days) is insufficient to convert bystander T<sub>RM</sub> into local antigen experienced T<sub>RM</sub>. Thus, there appears to be a window during T<sub>RM</sub> development when TCR engagement can allow for full differentiation. We also observed after a single recall response that T<sub>RM</sub> contracted to an elevated baseline suggesting an increase in the epidermal niche. We speculate this may result from a reduced T cell intrinsic requirement for survival and/or homeostatic proliferation factors such as IL-7 or IL-15 or increased expression of these factors by keratinocytes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Altered sensitivity or availability of TGFβ is unlikely to explain the increased niche size as this would be predicted to vary between local antigen experienced and bystander.</p>
<p>Transcriptional analysis of T<sub>RM</sub> isolated from the small intestine have revealed intra-organ heterogeneity, with unique transcriptional populations arising early during T<sub>RM</sub> development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. This aligns well with our identification of 6 distinct transcriptional clusters of epidermal T<sub>RM</sub>. Cluster 3 appears to represent fully differentiated T<sub>RM</sub> based on comparison with other T<sub>RM</sub> datasets. In addition, cluster 3 cells more highly expressed the activation and proliferation associated genes <italic>Junb, Fos</italic> and <italic>Dusp1</italic> as well as <italic>Nr4a1</italic>. Increased basal expression of the AP-1 family members <italic>Junb and Fos</italic> could contribute to the enhanced proliferation of antigen-experienced epidermal T<sub>RM</sub> during a recall response. Intriguingly, memory CD8 T cells lacking the transcription factor Zbtb20 manifest elevated expression of AP-1 family members and mount more robust antitumor responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. The <italic>Nr4a1</italic> gene encodes for Nur77, which is induced by TCR signaling and its expression correlates with peptide avidity. Notably Nur77 is required for T<sub>RM</sub> formation in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Interestingly, cells in cluster 3 only accounted for 27% of T<sub>RM</sub> that had the opportunity to encounter their cognate antigen in the VV treated flank. We speculate that not all clones at the VV site fully develop into fitter T<sub>RM</sub> due to lower TCR avidity or specificity to viral antigens only expressed early during infection which would be absent once the clones arrived into skin.</p>
<p>In sum, TCR signaling during T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation represents a previously unappreciated final step in T<sub>RM</sub> differentiation. This results in fitter T<sub>RM</sub> with a lower requirement for TGFβ transactivation due to increased expression of TGFβRIII and enhanced proliferation in response to peptide stimulation. Moreover, the differing responses to altered peptide ligands indicate that the degree of fitness depends on TCR signal-strength. Thus, polyclonal T<sub>RM</sub> likely develop into a spectrum of bystander to local antigen experienced cells based on TCR avidity. Though we have focused entirely on epidermal T cells, we suspect that these mechanisms may play a role in other epithelial tissues where residency is also dependent upon TGFβ. Additionally, we have solely investigated memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells after acute inflammation, the role of ongoing TCR-engagement during chronic antigen encounter remains unexplored.</p>

<title>Signature score analysis</title>
<p>Signature score was calculated by first generating differentially expressed genes of each cluster or condition compared to naïve T cells from the spleen control, and then calculating an average z-score for every up and down gene in a core gene signature datasets. The core gene datasets were generated by Jaiswal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] by calculating the exclusive expression of genes from T-cells in the datasets GSE47045 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], GSE10239 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] and GSE41867 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Comparative programs for T<sub>RM</sub> development over time were analyzed against the transcripts taken from the top 100 differentially expressed genes of each T<sub>RM</sub> timepoint/ naïve from GSE79805 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>] by adapting published scoring methods with this data set Jaiswal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. The overall signature score was scored based on expression data that was quantified using RSEM in transcripts per million (TPM), then log-transformed as log2(TPM+1). It was then centered for each gene across all cells. The centered data was averaged across sets of genes to define signature scores. We subtracted a control score from the signature score, which is defined using the same process on randomly selected gene-sets. A randomized control was generated by the average enrichment of each group compared to a randomly generated gene set of an equal number of probes, as iterated Jaiswal et al.

<p>Weiss et al. provide <bold>important</bold> new insights and <bold>convincing</bold> evidence to further our mechanistic understanding of how antigen presentation shapes skin persistence of CD8+ TRM. Using a mouse model for inducible genetic ablation of transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (TGFBR3) in CD8+ T cells, they demonstrate TGFBR3's role in regulating CD8+ TRM persistence in skin. Furthermore, they show that the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement upon initial CD8+ TRM skin seeding has a positive influence on subsequent TRM expansion following a secondary antigen-reencounter. Together, these mechanisms add to our understanding of how the skin CD8+ T cell repertoire is dynamically responsive to topical antigen.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Weiss et. al. seek to delineate the mechanisms by which antigen-specific CD8+ T cells outcompete bystanders in the epidermis when active TGF-b is limiting, resulting in selective retention of these cells and more complete differentiation into the TRM phenotype.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>They begin by demonstrating that at tissue sites where cognate antigen was expressed, CD8+ T cells adopt a more mature TRM transcriptome than cells at tissue sites where cognate antigen was never expressed. By integrating their scRNA-Seq data on TRM with the much more comprehensive ImmGenT atlas, the authors provide a very useful resource for future studies in the field. Furthermore, they conclusively show that these &quot;local antigen-experienced&quot; TRM have increased proliferative capacity and that TCR avidity during TRM formation positively correlates with their future fitness. Finally, using an elegant experimental strategy, they establish that TCR signaling in CD8+ T cells in epidermis induces TGFBRIII expression, which likely contributes to endowing them with a competitive advantage over antigen-inexperienced TRM.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main weakness in this paper lies in the authors' reliance on a single model to derive conclusions on the role of local antigen during the acute phase of the response by comparing T cells in model antigen-vaccinia virus (VV-OVA) exposed skin to T cells in contralateral skin exposed to DNFB 5 days after the VV-OVA exposure. In this setting, antigen-independent factors may contribute to the difference in CD8+ T cell number and phenotype at the two sites. For example, it was recently shown that very early memory precursors (formed 2 days after exposure) are more efficient at seeding the epithelial TRM compartment than those recruited to skin at later times (Silva et al, Sci Immunol, 2023). DNFB-treated skin may therefore recruit precursors with reduced TRM potential. In addition, TRM-skewed circulating memory precursors have been identified (Kok et al, JEM, 2020), and perhaps VV-OVA exposed skin more readily recruits this subset compared to DNFB-exposed skin. Therefore, when the DNFB challenge is performed 5 days after vaccinia virus, the DNFB site may already be at a disadvantage in the recruitment of CD8+ T cells that can efficiently form TRM. In addition, CD8+ T cell-extrinsic mechanisms may be at play, such as differences in myeloid cell recruitment and differentiation or local cytokine and chemokine levels in VV-infected and DNFB-treated skin that could account for differences seen in TRM phenotype and function between these two sites. Although the authors do show that providing exogenous peptide antigen at the DNFB-site rescues their phenotype in relation to the VV-OVA site, the potential antigen-independent factors distinguishing these two sites remain unaddressed. In addition, there is a possibility that peptide treatment of DNFB-treated initiates a second phase of priming of new circulatory effectors in the local-draining lymph nodes that are then recruited to form TRM at the DFNB-site, and that the effect does not solely rely on TRM precursors at the DNFB-treated skin site at the time of peptide treatment.</p>
<p>Secondly, although the authors conclusively demonstrate that TGFBRIII is induced by TCR signals and required for conferring increased fitness to local-antigen-experienced CD8+ TRM compared to local antigen-inexperienced cells, this is done in only one experiment, albeit repeated 3 times. The data suggest that antigen encounter during TRM formation induces sustained TGFBRIII expression that persists during the antigen-independent memory phase. It remains unclear why only the antigen encounter in skin, but not already in the draining lymph nodes, induces sustained TGFBRIII expression. Further characterizing the dynamics of TGFBRIII expression on CD8+ T cells during priming in draining lymph nodes and over the course of TRM formation and persistence may shed more light on this question. Probing the role of this mechanism at other sites of TRM formation would also further strengthen their conclusions and enhance the significance of this finding.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set out to dissect the mechanistic basis of their previously published finding that encountering cutaneous antigen augments the persistence of CD8+ memory T cells that enter skin (TRM) (Hirai et al., 2021, Immunity). Here they use the same murine model to study the fate of CD8+ T cells after antigen-priming in the lymph nodes, (1) those that re-encounter antigen in the skin via vaccinia virus (VV) versus (2) those that do not encounter antigen in skin but rather are recruited via topical dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) (so-called &quot;bystander TRM&quot;). The authors' previous publication establishes that this first group of CD8+ TRM has a persistence advantage over bystander TRM under TGFb-limiting conditions. The current paper advances this finding by elucidating the role of TGFBR3 in regulating CD8+ TRM skin persistence upon topical antigen exposure. Key novelty of the work lies in the generation and use of the CD8+ T cell-specific TGFBR3 knockout model, which allows them to demonstrate the role of TGFBR3 in fine-tuning the degree of CD8+ T cell skin persistence and that TGFBR3 expression is promoted by CD8+ TRM encountering their cognate antigen upon initial skin entry. Future work directly measuring active TGFb in the skin under different conditions would help identify physiologic scenarios that yield active TGFb-limiting conditions, thus establishing physiologic relevance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Technical strengths of the paper include (1) complementary imaging and flow cytometry analyses, (2) integration of their scRNA-seq data with the existing CD8+ TRM literature via pathway analysis, and (3) use of orthogonal models where possible. Using a vaccina virus (VV) model, with and without ovalbumin (OVA), the authors investigate how topical antigen exposure and TCR strength regulate CD8+ TRM skin recruitment and retention. The authors use both FTY720 and a Thy1.1 depleting antibody to demonstrate that skin CD8+ TRM expand locally following both a primary and secondary recall response to topical OVA application.</p>
<p>A conceptual strength of the paper is the authors' observation that TCR signal strength upon initial TRM tissue entry helps regulate the extent of their local re-expansion on subsequent antigen re-exposure. They achieved this by applying peptides of varying affinity for the OT-I TCR on the DNFB-exposed flank in tandem with initial VV-OVA + DNFB treatment. They then measured TRM expansion after OVA peptide rechallenge, revealing that encountering a higher-affinity peptide upon skin entry leads to greater subsequent re-expansion. Additionally, by generating an OT-I Thy1.1+ E8i-creERT2 huNGFR Tgfbr3fl/fl (Tgfbr3∆CD8) mouse, the authors were able to elucidate a unique role for TGFBR3 in CD8+TRM persistence when active TGFb in skin is limited.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Overall, the authors' conclusions are well supported, although there are some instances where additional controls, experiments, or clarifications would add rigor. The conclusions regarding skin-localized TCR signaling leading to increased skin CD8+ TRM proliferation in-situ and increased TGFBR3 expression would be strengthened by assessing skin CD8+ TRM proliferation and TGFBR3 expression in models of high versus low avidity topical OVA-peptide exposure. The authors could further increase the novelty of the paper by exploring whether TGFBR3 is regulated at the RNA or protein level. To this end, they could perform analysis of their single-cell RNA sequencing data (Figure 1), comparing Tgfbr3 mRNA in DNFB versus VV-treated skin.</p>
<p>For clarity, when discussing antigen exposure throughout the paper, it would be helpful for the authors to be more precise that they are referring to the antigen in the skin rather than in the draining lymph node. A more explicit summary of some of the lab's previous work focused on CD8+ TRM and the role of TGFb would also help readers better contextualize this work within the existing literature on which it builds.</p>
<p>For rigor, it would be helpful where possible to pair flow cytometry quantification with the existing imaging data. Additional controls, namely enumerating TRM in the opposite, untreated flank skin of VV-only-treated mice and the treated flank skin of DNFB-only treated mice, would help contextualize the results seen in dually-treated mice in Figure 1. In figure legends, we suggest clearly reporting unpaired T tests comparing relevant metrics within VV or DNFB-treated groups (for example, VV-OVA PBS vs VV-OVA FTY720 in Figure 3F). Finally, quantifying right and left skin draining lymph node CD8+ T cell numbers would clarify the skin specificity and cell trafficking dynamics of the authors' model.</p>
