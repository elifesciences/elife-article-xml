<title>Abstract</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, could potentially be mitigated through early detection and interventions. However, it remains challenging to assess subtle cognitive changes in the early AD continuum. Computational modeling is a promising approach to explain a generative process underlying subtle behavioral changes with a number of putative variables. Nonetheless, internal models of the patient’s reasoning process remain underexplored in AD. Determining the states of an internal model between measurable pathological states and behavioral phenotypes would advance explanations about the generative process in earlier disease stages beyond assessing behavior alone. In this study, we assumed the latent cause model as an internal model and estimated internal states defined by the model parameters being in conjunction with measurable behavioral phenotypes. The 6- and 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> knock-in AD model mice and the age-matched control mice underwent memory modification learning, which consisted of classical fear conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement. The results showed that <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice exhibited a lower extent of reinstatement of fear memory. Computational modeling revealed that the deficit in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice would be due to their internal states being biased toward overgeneralization or overdifferentiation of their observations, and consequently the competing memories were not retained. This deficit was replicated in another type of memory modification learning in the reversal Barnes maze task. Following reversal learning, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, given spatial cues, failed to infer coexisting memories for two goal locations during the trial. We concluded that the altered internal states of <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice illustrated their misclassification in the memory modification process. This novel approach highlights the potential of investigating internal states to precisely assess cognitive changes in early AD and multidimensionally evaluate how early interventions may work.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, which severely disturbs daily lives in the aging population and causes a tremendous social burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Nandi et al., 2022</xref>). Neuropathological hallmarks, including amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), define AD biologically, and the advance in biomarkers have enabled early diagnosis (Jack Jr. et al., 2018, 2024). Abnormal biomarkers can appear years before symptoms arise, a stage referred to as preclinical AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Sperling et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">2014</xref>). As the disease progresses, the cognitive symptom gets severe, and its degree defines mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and the onset of AD dementia. Cognitive decline has been reported in a wide range of domains, including memory, language, visuospatial function, and executive function, leading to behavioral change as early as a decade before dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Amieva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Knopman et al., 2021</xref>). The early stage of AD provides a time window to intervene in disease progression, yet there is an explanatory gap and inconclusive consensus on what particular behavioral phenotype can be directly linked to neuropathology in early AD. Given the present circumstance, the subtle and heterogeneous cognitive change before the onset of dementia poses a challenge to assess clinical outcomes with traditional measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jutten et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>To precisely assess clinical symptoms and effects of early intervention for AD pathology, determining universal behavioral phenotypes as well as understanding how such behaviors change from asymptomatic to symptomatic is needed. Memory impairment is the predominant first symptom of AD (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>). The symptoms are commonly identified as a deficit in recalling previously learned or recognized items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Grober et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies suggested that the performance of prioritized recall, in which memories are recalled in order of assigned value, is a sensitive measure in the early stages of AD (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Knowlton &amp; Castel, 2022</xref>). It remains elusive how memory impairments may arise from biased information processing that could affect the encoding, maintaining, or retrieval process of memory function. Using genetic mouse models is a common approach to dissecting the effects of pathological changes on cognitive symptoms measured in behavioral tasks while controlling for potential confounding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Zhong et al., 2024</xref>). However, the symptoms at the early stage of AD are relatively mild in traditional measurements, and phenotypes may be inconsistent among studies even when using the same AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Jankowsky &amp; Zheng, 2017</xref>). As behavioral phenotypes in conjunction with brain pathology state may not be captured by current assessments robustly, it is crucial to seek more sensitive and comprehensive approaches.</p>
<p>Recently proposed computational models provide generative processes underlying observed behavior, potentially bridging the gap between behavioral phenotype and AD pathology. Indeed, such models not only replicated the memory task performance of AD patients in different disease stages (M. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; M. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee &amp; Stark, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Pooley et al., 2011</xref>) but also were valuable in detecting cognitive decline in preclinical AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bock et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Vanderlip et al., 2024</xref>). However, previous approaches did not suppose an internal model formulating the patient’s reasoning process for current observation given prior knowledge. Internal models with sufficient explanatory power can replicate various behavioral phenotypes in specific tasks through a common generative process. Estimating an internal model in the early stages of AD patients would elucidate how AD alters their internal states and thereby their behaviors along with disease progression, which is informative for precise diagnosis and assessment of early intervention effects. To our knowledge, only a few studies tried to estimate internal states in amnestic MCI and AD patients and reported that a certain retention rate underlying motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Sutter et al., 2024</xref>) but not learning rate in associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Wessa et al., 2016</xref>) differed from healthy control. This circumstance demands us to investigate internal models illustrating not only learning but also its interaction with memory with higher explanatory power.</p>
<p>In this study, we assumed the latent cause model as an internal model explaining the memory modification process to solve a problem such that a novel observation should be classified into previously acquired memory or novel memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized that the internal state of the latent cause model is altered along with disease progression from the preclinical stage of AD. To test this, we used the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> knock-in AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Saito et al., 2014</xref>). This model mice carry the Swedish KM670/671NL, Iberian I716F, and Arctic E693G mutations on the gene of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and display Aβ plaque accumulation and neuroinflammation across age, reproducing neuropathological change in preclinical AD without artifacts caused by APP overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Saito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Sasaguri et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, the 6- and 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> knock-in mice and the age-matched control mice were engaged in a memory modification task consisting of Pavlovian fear conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement. Internal states across trials were estimated for each mouse, simultaneously with determining a set of model parameters such that the simulated behavior under the latent cause model given the parameters fits enough to the observed behavior. Because we found a deficit in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice as overgeneralization or overdifferentiation of their observations into certain memories indicated by parameters in the latent cause model, we further confirmed whether this deficit could be replicated in another kind of memory modification task, the reversal Barnes maze paradigm. In the latent cause framework, we discussed how the internal states in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice diverged from those in the control mice during the memory modification process.</p>

<title>The latent cause model, an internal model, explains memory modification processes in the classical fear conditioning paradigm</title>
<p>The latent cause model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gershman et al. (2010)</xref> is an internal model such that an agent infers a latent cause as a source of the co-occurrence of events in the environment. It was later adapted to model the memory modification process, a problem to infer previously acquired latent causes or a novel latent cause for every observation in the Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>). In the latent cause model, an agent learning an association between a conditioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) has an internal model such that stimuli <bold>x</bold> (i.e., <italic>d</italic>-dimensional vector involving the CS or context) and outcome <italic>r</italic> (i.e., US) at time <italic>t</italic> are generated at an associative strength <bold>w</bold> (i.e., <italic>d</italic>-dimensional vector) from <italic>k</italic>-th latent cause <italic>z<sub>tk</sub></italic> of total <italic>K</italic> latent causes by a likelihood <italic>p</italic>(<bold>x</bold>|<italic>z<sub>tk</sub></italic>) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>|<italic>z<sub>tk</sub></italic>), respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). <italic>p</italic>(<bold>x</bold>|<italic>z<sub>tk</sub></italic>) and <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r</italic>|<italic>z<sub>tk</sub></italic>) follow Gaussian distributions in which each mean is calculated from previous observations, while each variance (<italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic> <sup>2</sup> and <italic>σ<sub>r</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>) was <italic>a priori</italic> defined as a hyperparameter. Since latent causes are unobservable, the agent given an observation infers which latent cause is likely to generate current observation by Bayes’ rule. The prior of <italic>z</italic> follows the Chinese restaurant process, that is
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="634705v2_ueqn1.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
</p>
<p>Prior of <italic>z<sub>tk</sub></italic> refers to the frequency that <italic>z<sub>k</sub></italic> was inferred so far, where 𝕀 [・] = 1 if its argument is true; otherwise, 0. This prior is biased by a temporal kernel 𝒦, as an analogy of the power law of the forgetting curve,
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="634705v2_ueqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
to exponentially decay the probability that <italic>z<sub>k</sub></italic> inferred at previous trial <italic>t’</italic> is inferred again at current trial <italic>t</italic> by a temporal scaling factor <italic>g</italic> if the time interval between trial <italic>t’</italic> and <italic>t</italic> increases. A new latent cause is inferred at a probability governed by concentration parameter <italic>α</italic>. Higher <italic>α</italic> or lower likelihood of the current observation biases the agent to infer a new latent cause given an observation (i.e., differentiation) rather than to infer an old one (i.e., generalization) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Although the latent cause model allows for having an infinite number of latent causes, agents with appropriate <italic>α</italic> and <italic>g</italic> favor to infer a smaller number of latent causes for observations instead of inferring a unique latent cause for every observation.</p>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic diagram of latent cause framework in a simple Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm. An experimental mouse observes a tone, a context, and an electrical shock, which are set down in a parallelogram. Among the stimuli, the tone is designed as the conditioned stimulus (CS), and the electrical shock is designed as the unconditioned stimulus (US) with additional consideration of context effect. The mouse has an internal model such that a latent cause <italic>z</italic> generates the observation where the tone and the context induce the shock at an associative weight <italic>w<sub>cs</sub></italic> and <italic>w<sub>context</sub>,</italic> respectively. The latent cause is a latent variable represented by a white square. The posterior probability of <italic>z</italic> is represented by a black arrow from <italic>z</italic> to the observation. The stimuli (i.e., tone, context, and shock) are observed variables represented in shaded circles, and the associative weight <italic>w</italic> is represented by a black arrow between the two. Since latent causes are unobservable, the mouse infers which latent cause is more likely from posterior distribution over latent causes given the observation following Bayes’ rule. <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic diagram of internal state posited in the latent cause model demonstrating the memory modification process in the fear conditioning paradigm. The mouse has acquired <italic>z</italic><sub>A</sub> through two observations of the CS accompanied by the US in the same context. Now, the mouse observes the tone alone, then infers a new latent cause <italic>z</italic><sub>B</sub> generating the CS and context without US as <italic>w</italic><sub>cs</sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub>context</sub> equal to 0. The internal state at the time consists of <italic>z</italic><sub>A</sub> with largely decreased posterior probability and thereby slightly decreased <italic>w</italic><sub>cs</sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub>context</sub>, in addition to <italic>z</italic><sub>B</sub>. The mouse in this panel is likely to differentiate the current observation from <italic>z</italic><sub>A</sub>, as it assigns a higher probability for <italic>z</italic><sub>B</sub>. The posterior probability of <italic>z</italic><sub>A</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>B</sub> is represented by the relative size of their diagram. If the mouse generalizes <italic>z</italic><sub>A</sub> to the current observation without inferring <italic>z</italic><sub>B</sub>, it would largely decrease <italic>w</italic><sub>cs</sub> and <italic>w</italic><sub>context</sub> of <italic>z</italic><sub>A</sub> to minimize prediction error. <bold>(C)</bold> Observed and simulated conditioned response (CR) during reinstatement in fear conditioning. In the acquisition phase, a CS was accompanied by a US, inducing associative fear memory in the animal, as it exhibits a higher CR to the CS. In the extinction phase, the CS was presented without the US, inducing extinction memory with decreased CR. After an unsignaled shock without the preceding CS, the CR increases again, and this is called reinstatement. The observed CR was sampled from a 2-month-old male wild-type C57BL/6J mouse (magenta line plot with square markers), where the vertical and horizontal axis indicate CR and cumulative trial, respectively. The latent cause model parameters were estimated so as to minimize the prediction error between the observed and the simulated CR given the parameter (gray line with square markers). The estimated parameter value: <italic>α</italic> = 2.4, <italic>g</italic> = 0.316, <italic>η</italic> = 0.64, max. no. of iteration = 9, <italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic> = -0.006, <italic>σ<sub>r</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = 4.50, <italic>σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = 4.39, <italic>θ</italic> = 0.03, <italic>λ</italic> = 0.02, <italic>K</italic> = 6. Trials with red, blue, and yellow backgrounds correspond to the acquisition, extinction, and unsignaled shock, where the first and second extinction consists of 19 and 10 trials, respectively (see Material and Methods). Three trials with white backgrounds are tests 1, 2, and 3 to evaluate if conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement are established. The vertical dashed lines separate the phases. <bold>(D)</bold> The evolution of the posterior probability and <bold>(E)</bold> the associative weight of each latent cause across the reinstatement experiment, where <italic>w<sub>cs</sub></italic> (top panel) and <italic>w<sub>context</sub></italic> (bottom panel) were computed. <bold>(D and E)</bold> Each latent cause is indicated by a unique subscript number and color, <italic>w<sub>cs</sub></italic> and <italic>w<sub>context</sub>.</italic> The latent causes acquired during the acquisition phase and their associative weight are termed <bold>z<sub>A</sub></bold> and <bold>w<sub>A</sub></bold>, respectively.

<p>According to the latent cause model, the agent solves two computational problems during Pavlovian fear conditioning learning. One is to compute the posterior probability of each latent cause given its associative weight between stimuli <bold>x</bold> and shock <italic>r</italic> with a history of observations, and the other is to compute the associative weight of each latent cause given its posterior. Both computations are achieved through the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, as the former and the latter computation correspond to E-step and M-step, respectively. In the E-step, the posterior of each latent cause is computed from its prior and the likelihood of current observation given the latent cause following Bayes’ rule, consequently determining the most likely latent cause at the current trial as the one with the maximal posterior, then moves to the M-step. In the M-step, the agent predicts shock by a linear combination of stimuli and associative weight in each latent cause. The weight is updated based on the Rescorla-Wagner rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972</xref>) to minimize the prediction error between observed and predicted shock. The amount of the weight change depends on learning rate <italic>η</italic> and prediction error, which is biased by the posterior probability of the latent causes. The amount of weight change will be smaller even in larger prediction errors if the latent cause is unlikely. The agent estimates weights for all latent causes and then returns to E-step. This procedure is iterated a preset number of times, and thereby, the posterior probability over latent causes and their associative weights are determined. Finally, the agent concludes the expected shock in the current trial by a linear combination of observed stimuli and an expectation of weight, which is weighted by the posterior distribution over latent causes. The conditioned response (CR) for the expected shock is determined as an integral of Gaussian distribution (mean is the expected shock, variance is <italic>λ</italic>) above threshold θ, where <italic>λ</italic> and <italic>θ</italic> are hyperparameters. Thus, these parameters of the latent cause model determine an internal state of the agent leading to particular behavioral outcomes given an observation.</p>
<p>Reinstatement exemplifies the memory modification process and indeed is well explained by the latent cause model. Reinstatement occurs when agents who have learned and then extinguished an association between a CS and a US exhibit CR again after being exposed to the US alone following the extinction. The latent cause model explains the reinstatement of fear memory with the changes of agent’s internal state as follows. First, an agent repeatedly observed a CS accompanied with a US in a Pavlovian fear conditioning procedure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, “Acquisition”). Because these observations are novel for the agent, it inferred a set of latent causes <bold>z</bold><sub>A</sub> (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>, and <italic>z</italic><sub>3</sub> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) where the CS is associated with the US by associative weight <bold>w</bold><sub>A</sub> (<italic>w</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>w<sub>2</sub></italic>, and <italic>w<sub>3</sub></italic> in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) during the acquisition. Considering the effect of the context, <bold>w</bold> contains both <italic>w<sub>cs</sub></italic> and <italic>w<sub>context</sub></italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). After the acquisition, the agent inferred <bold>z</bold><sub>A</sub> and then predicted the upcoming US, leading to increased CR when it observed the CS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, “Test 1” after “Acquisition”). Second, the agent repeatedly observed the CS alone in an extinction procedure. Early in the extinction, the agent would infer <bold>z</bold><sub>A</sub> and then exhibit higher CR to the CS, while the US was absent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, left “Extinction”). This state increases prediction error, then prompts the agent either to decrease <bold>w</bold><sub>A</sub> toward 0 or to infer a novel set of latent causes <bold>z</bold><sub>B</sub> where the CS is not accompanied with the US, that is, associative strength <bold>w</bold><sub>B</sub> = 0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>); both processes are run in the mouse in Fig. 1CDE. Later in the extinction, <bold>z</bold><sub>B</sub> rather than <bold>z</bold><sub>A</sub> is inferred, leading to the decreased CR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, right “Extinction” or “Test 2”). Third, when the agent observes the US alone after the extinction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, “Unsignaled shock”), the probability of <bold>z</bold><sub>A</sub> or associative weight of some latent causes increases, hence it predicts the US and thereby the CR increases again, that is reinstatement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, “Reinstatement” at “Test 3”); in the mouse in Fig. 1CDE, the unsignaled shock increases not only the posterior probability of <bold>z<sub>A</sub></bold> that has maintained higher <italic>w<sub>cs</sub></italic> but also <italic>w<sub>context</sub></italic> in <bold>w</bold><sub>6</sub> interpreted as a modification in the association between context and US in <italic>z</italic><sub>6</sub>. Thus, it is rational to expect that certain parameters of the latent cause model are in conjunction with particular behaviors in the reinstatement paradigm. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gershman &amp; Hartley (2015)</xref>, the likelihood that <italic>α</italic> &gt; 0 in human participants correlates with the degree of their spontaneous recovery, that is a return of the CR after a long hiatus following an extinction procedure. Furthermore, a recent study has shown that the latent cause model explains maladaptive decision-making in post-traumatic stress disorder patients as a perseverated inference of previously acquired latent causes even under situations where they should infer novel latent causes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Norbury et al., 2022</xref>). By estimating such parameters from the behaviors of each experimental mouse, how the internal state of the AD group diverges from that of the control group could be determined.</p>

<p>In the acquisition phase of fear conditioning, the freezing rate gradually increased with the number of CS-US pairings (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, leftmost red panel). In the test 1 phase, 24 h after the acquisition, a significant genotype effect was observed in freezing rates during CS presentation [<italic>F</italic>(1,95) = 9.679, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002], where the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice showed a higher freezing rate than in the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> and Table S2), indicating the associative fear memory was established in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. As the increasing trials of CS alone presented, both groups showed a gradually decreased freezing rate in the extinction phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, blue panel). In the test 2 phase, 24 h after the last trial of the extinction, there was a significant age effect in freezing rates during CS presentation [<italic>F</italic>(1,95) = 4.698, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033], where 12-month-old mice showed a higher freezing rate than in the 6-month-old mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref> and Table S2). In the test 3 phase, 24 h after given an unsignaled shock, mice showed an elevated freezing rate, and no significant genotype or age effect was detected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, 2E and Table S2).</p>
<p>To examine the phase differences, we calculated the discrimination index (DI) using freezing rates during the CS presentation. If the mouse shows the same freezing rate at the two test phases, the value of DI will be 0.5, while if the mouse shows a higher freezing rate in one phase compared to the other, DI will be far from 0.5. The results showed that the DIs between test 2 and test 1 were significantly lower than 0.5 in all groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and Table S3), indicating the successful establishment of extinction memory. The genotype effect was detected [<italic>F</italic>(1,95) = 5.013, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref> and Table S4), where <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice showed lower values due to higher freezing in the test 1 phase. These results suggested that there was no markable fear and extinction learning deficit in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice at the behavioral level. The DIs between the test 3 and 2 phases in four groups were significantly higher than 0.5, indicating that the reinstatement was successfully induced after the unsignaled shock (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and Table S3). Six-month-old mice showed higher DIs, as a significant age effect was detected [<italic>F</italic>(1,95) = 7.480, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref> and Table S4). The DIs between the test 3 and 1 phases did not deviate from 0.5 for both 6- and 12-month-old control mice, suggesting that they displayed comparable freezing rates in tests 1 and 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and Table S3). In contrast, the DIs between test 3 and 1 phases were significantly lower than 0.5 in 6-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice [<italic>t</italic>(24) = - 3.245, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003] and 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice [<italic>t</italic>(24) = -6.165, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and Table S3). Moreover, a significant genotype effect was detected [<italic>F</italic>(1,95) = 15.393, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001] (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref> and Table S4), indicating <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice exhibited a lower extent of reinstatement. Thus, these results suggest that mice retrieved fear memory in the test 1 phase and retrieved extinction memory in the test 2 phase, respectively. The fear memory and the extinction memory compete with each other: the US is present in the former, while it is absent in the latter. In the test 3 phase, after they observed the unsignaled shock, mice had to decide which memory was more relevant given the CS. The same level of freezing rate in tests 1 and 3 observed in control mice suggests that they could retain both fear and extinction memory and thereby infer the fear memory more preferentially. In contrast, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice displayed a lower freezing rate in test 3 compared to test 1, suggesting that they might still infer extinction memory even after the unsignaled shock or a completely new memory, while the initial fear memory might be suppressed or eliminated.</p>

<title>The internal state underlying reinstatement simulated with the latent cause model differs between the ages and <italic>APP</italic> genotype</title>
<p>To seek the internal state of each mouse generating the behaviors in the reinstatement paradigm, we estimated the parameters of the latent cause model, minimizing prediction errors between the observed CR and simulated CR in the latent cause model given a set of parameters (see also Material and Methods). <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> demonstrates the traces of observed CR, simulated CR, and the changes in the internal state in each group. We initially confirmed that the DIs in the simulated CRs in each group well replicated those in the observed CRs, except that the DI between test 3 and test 1 in the 6-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice did not significantly deviate from 0.5 in simulated results (c.f. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2G</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref> and Fig. 3 – Supplement 1). In the 6-month-old group, two latent causes (<italic>z</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>z</italic><sub>2</sub>) were generated in the acquisition phase with increasing associative weight (rows 2 to 4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, 3B). During the extinction phase, the same latent causes were inferred, and the corresponding associative weights declined, indicating the devaluation of previously acquired fear memory (rows 2 to 4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Notably, the <italic>w<sub>cs</sub></italic> in <bold>w</bold><sub>2</sub> in control mice remained at a higher value compared to that in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. At trial 35 given an unsignaled shock, <italic>w<sub>context</sub></italic> in <bold>w</bold><sub>1</sub> was elevated in control mice (row 4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), while both <italic>w<sub>context</sub></italic> in <bold>w</bold><sub>1</sub> and <bold>w</bold><sub>2</sub> were elevated in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (row 4 in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>).

<p>The transition of internal state in the 12-month-old group was similar to that in the 6-month-old group until the test 1 phase.

<p>Due to the different evolution of latent causes between ages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), we separately discuss the contribution of differences in estimated parameters within the same age and their correlations with DI between test 3 (after unsignaled shock) and test 1 (after acquisition) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). We first investigated the individual internal state differences in the 12-month-old group where the impairment was apparent at the behavioral level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice had significantly lower <italic>α</italic> (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> = 100, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) and lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> = 88.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) than control mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In addition, these two parameters were significantly correlated with the DI (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Statistical results for remaining parameters are shown in Table S7 and S8. While the maximal number of inferable latent causes (<italic>K</italic>) was significantly higher in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice than in control mice (Table S7), the total number of acquired latent causes was comparable between the groups (K<sub>total</sub> in Table S9). Although the number of never inferred latent causes was higher in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, they have virtually no effects on internal states, as the priors and posteriors of them were 0 except those of the next candidate of new latent cause. The higher <italic>K</italic> in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice could be because their sample chains converged without the need to explore the parameter space, as those stayed at the same level as the initial guess (see Material &amp; Methods).

<p>We further characterized how the latent causes acquired in different phases contribute to the distinct internal states between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. Lower <italic>α</italic> would bias <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice toward overgeneralization as they favor inferring a small number of latent causes even for novel observations. Indeed, the number of latent causes initially inferred at the acquisition phase was significantly lower in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, where most of them inferred two latent causes, and more than half of the control mice inferred three latent causes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and Table S9). Furthermore, when they initially observed the CS in the absence of the US in test 1, the posterior probabilities of acquisition latent causes in test 1 were significantly higher in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice than in the control mice, leading to the higher CRs in test 1 in the simulation (Fig. 4 – Supplement 1A), consistent with the observed CR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the latent cause model, lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> would bias <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice toward overdifferentiation. In other words, they prefer to infer new potential causes when similar observations are presented instead of interpreting them generated from the same distribution. The likelihood of current stimuli given latent causes was calculated from a Gaussian distribution with the mean of stimulus values under the latent cause so far and fixed variance <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>. Repeated observation of the CS alone during the extinction would sufficiently increase the likelihood of stimuli given the latent causes inferred during the extinction in both <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> and control mice. This attenuates the need to infer new latent causes even if <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice had lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>, as the number of latent causes acquired at the extinction phase was comparable between groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref> and Table S9). However, the CS was absent in the unsignaled shock and then presented again in test 3. These observations would decrease the likelihood of stimuli given past latent causes, and consequently increase the probability to infer the new latent causes. This volatility would be more obvious in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice with lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>. As a result, the number of latent causes acquired after the extinction (i.e., the unsignaled shock and test 3) as well as the sum of posterior probabilities of them were greater in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice than those in the control mice, despite that the mice received either the US or the CS alone that were the same with those they observed so far (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref> and Table S9).</p>
<p>Such internal states in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice would diverge the update of associative weight from those in the control mice in test 3, which was observed in the latent cause acquired during the extinction phase, not the acquisition phase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>, 4G and Table S9). Both <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> and control mice would still infer the extinction latent causes at the unsignaled shock with higher posterior probabilities. Since the update of the associative weight of each latent cause is modulated by both prediction error and posterior probability of the latent cause, the associative weights in the extinction latent causes were increased by the unsignaled shock in the control mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, 4G and Table S9). In <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, however, they inferred new latent causes with low associative weight after the extinction (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, 4H and Table S9), which decreased the posterior probabilities of other latent causes and impeded update of their weight (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>, 4G). This distinct internal state therefore led to the lower CR and DI in test 3 in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, 2H). These results suggest that the <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> would differentiate the internal state and thereby behavioral phenotypes between <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> and control mice. In the Chinese restaurant process, the probability that a new latent cause is inferred decreases with trials, preventing that too many latent causes are inferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gershman &amp; Blei, 2011</xref>). This could be the reason why the overgeneralization by lower <italic>α</italic> was less effective than the overdifferentiation by lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> in test 3 in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p>As shown previously in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and Fig. 2– Supplement 1, Aβ aggregation has already widely spread in the brain of 6-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, but no clear behavioral impairments were detected by the conventional analysis. Similarly to the 12-month-old group, we investigated the individual internal state differences in the 6-month-old group and tested whether the discrepancy in <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> emerged earlier without behavioral impairment. We found that <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice had significantly lower <italic>α</italic> (Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> = 38, <italic>p</italic> = 0.012), and it was significantly correlated with DI (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, 5B and Table S10, S11). The <italic>σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> was comparable between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, but its significant correlation with DI was found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, 5B and Table S10, S11). The hyperparameter <italic>θ</italic>, a threshold to emit CR for stimulus inputs, was significantly higher in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice than in control mice. Since the <italic>λ</italic> was comparable between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (Table S10), the CR in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice could rapidly decrease with expected US during the extinction phase, even if their CR at the test 1 was higher than those in the control. The effect of higher <italic>θ</italic> was subtle when the expected US was far from its value, and therefore had little contribution to the DI between test 3 and test 1, which is in line with the correlation result in Table S11. Statistical results for the remaining parameters are shown in Tables S10 and S11.</p>

</fig>
<p>Similar to the 12-month-old group, the influence of <italic>α</italic> was observed in the acquisition phase, where most <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice inferred two latent causes, while more than half of control mice inferred three latent causes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). In addition, lower <italic>α</italic> in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice affect the posterior probabilities of acquisition latent cause and CR in test 1 phase (Fig. 4 – Supplement 1B). No significant difference in the internal states was found between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref> to <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref> and Table S12).</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> are the main contributors to differential internal states and memory modification processes between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. Regardless of age, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice have a defect in forming a new memory even if the observation is novel, suggesting overgeneralization due to significantly lower <italic>α</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, 5A). With a more severe phenotype, 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice were biased to classify similar observations into different causes due to lower variance of the stimulus, <italic>σ<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). This overdifferentiation would eventuate the lower reinstatement of fear memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). Thus, these results suggest that <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice failed to retain competing memories because of the misclassification of observation into memories, even though each memory accounts for past and present observations.</p>

<title><italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice failed to infer coexisting memories in the reversal Barnes maze task</title>
<p>To confirm whether the deficit in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice is replicated in another experimental paradigm, cohorts 4, 5, 6, and 7 were subjected to a reversal Barnes maze task (C. A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Barnes, 1979</xref>) two weeks after the reinstatement experiment (Table. S1). Barnes maze is a commonly used behavioral task to examine spatial learning and memory in Alzheimer’s disease model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). Unlike fear conditioning, it requires goal-directed learning to compute an optimal path from the current position to a destination while modifying the spatial memory of an environment through trial and error. The first stage contains a 6-day training and 1-day probe test to establish the first spatial memory of the target hole (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). During the training phase, the mice explored a circular field and were reinforced to find an escape box under a target hole as any one of 12 holes equally spaced around the perimeter of the field (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). In the 12-month-old group, the number of errors, latency, and travel distance from start to goal decreased across days in the training phase, suggesting successful initial learning (Fig. 6 – Supplement 1A, and Table S13). A significant interaction between day and genotype [<italic>F</italic>(5, 170) = 2.447, <italic>p</italic> = 0.036] was observed in the latency where control mice took a longer time to reach the target hole on training days 4, 5, and 6 (Fig. 6 – Supplement 1A, and Table S13). In order to estimate what kind of strategies mice used to solve the task relying on their memory, we performed algorithm-based strategy analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Suzuki &amp; Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tachiki et al., 2023</xref>). A moving trajectory in each trial was categorized into one of five spatial strategies following the definition (Fig. 6 – Supplement 2). As in the conventional analysis above, the usages of the strategies were virtually comparable between <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> and control mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and Table S14).</p>

</fig>
<p>In the probe test phase, the mice explored the field for 5 min without the escape box, which generated a certain prediction error (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). While the mice retrieved the spatial memory of the target hole in spite of the novel observation, they would stay around the target hole. Consequently, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-</sup> <sup>F</sup></italic> mice spent significantly less time around the target hole than control mice did in the probe test 1, as a significant interaction between genotype and holes [<italic>F</italic>(11, 374) = 4.22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001] was detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref> and Table S15). These results suggest that <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice could successfully form a spatial memory of the target hole, while the memory was less likely to be retrieved by a novel observation such as the absence of the escape box under the target hole at the probe test 1.</p>
<p>In the first reversal learning phase, the position of the target hole with the escape box was moved to the opposite from day 9 to 11, then returned to the original position from day 12 to day 14 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Through the first reversal learning, we expected that the second spatial memory of the target hole is formed that competes with the spatial memory of the first target hole. In other words, this reversal training phase allowed the mice to acknowledge that both two holes were possible to be the target hole. The improved performance across reversal training days in the conventional analysis was similar to that of the initial training phase, suggesting intact behavioral flexibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Brown &amp; Tait, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gawel et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> – Supplement 1B and Table S13). Unexpectedly, 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice reached the goal significantly faster than the control mice [Genotype effect from day 9 to 11, <italic>F</italic>(1,68) = 10.53, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003; Genotype effect from day 12 to 14, <italic>F</italic>(1,68) = 10.27, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003] (Fig. 6 – Supplement 1B, and Table S13). This would be due to the difference in the strategies primarily taken in each group of mice. During the first reversal training (days 9 to 11), more than half of <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice used the perimeter strategy, which is significantly higher than control mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and Table S14). The mice taking this strategy could reach the novel target hole by exploring holes sequentially without spending time around the previous target hole (Fig. 6 – Supplement 2). On the other hand, the use of perimeter strategy decreased, and spatial strategy increased in control mice from days 9 to 11 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Moreover, the use of the confirmatory strategy was around 30% in control mice, which is significantly higher than <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and Table S14). This strategy is the one such that the mice visit the first and second target holes as if they relied on the two memories of the target holes where the escape box should exist (Fig. 6 – Supplement 2). During the second reversal training (days 12 to 14), <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice constantly used the perimeter strategy more than the control mice. Meanwhile, the control mice used the confirmatory strategy more than <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, as in the first reversal learning phase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and Table S14). These results suggest that the search strategy diverged between <italic>App<sup>NL-</sup> <sup>G-F</sup></italic> mice and control mice since the reversal learning. The control mice could retrieve two competing spatial memories of the target hole during each trial. In contrast, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice were less likely to retrieve these two memories within a trial even though the use of spatial strategy was comparable with control mice on the same day.</p>
<p>As expected, the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice explored significantly shorter time for the second target hole as well as the first target hole, compared to the control mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> and Table S15). A significant interaction between genotype and hole was detected [Genotype × Hole, <italic>F</italic>(11, 374) = 3.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001]. The exploration time was uniform over holes in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, while control mice showed hole preferences around two target holes as if the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice and the control mice took the perimeter and the confirmatory strategy, respectively. At last, we calculated the discrimination index (DI) from the exploration time for the first and second target holes in probe test 2 and test 1. As in the reinstatement experiment, we expected that if the mice did not retrieve a spatial memory of the second target hole during probe test 2, the exploration time of this hole would be the same between probe tests 1 and 2, resulting in DI around 0.5. The DI for the second target hole was significantly higher than 0.5 in control mice, indicating that the mice successfully modified the spatial memories from probe tests 1 to 2 at a discriminable level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and Table S16). On the contrary, the DI in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice was comparable to 0.5 and significantly lower than that of control mice, indicating that their spatial memory for the second target hole was not modified after the reversal learning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref> and Table S16). We confirmed that the DIs for the first target hole were close to 0.5 and comparable between groups, suggesting that the exploration time for the first target hole remained similarly long in both probe tests (Fig. 6 – Supplement 1C, and Table S16).</p>
<p>The distinct learning process observed in the 12-month-old group was also present in the 6-month-old group. The performance shown in the conventional analysis was comparable between the 6-month-old control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 6 – Supplement 2A, 2B, and Table S17). The use of perimeter strategy was over 30% throughout two reversal training phases in 6-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-</sup> <sup>F</sup></italic> mice, while control mice used significantly higher confirmatory strategy in the second reversal training (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>, and Table S18). During the probe tests, the difference in exploration time around the target hole was less prominent in the 6-month-old group, while <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice uniformly explored the holes as in the 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, especially in the probe test 2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>, <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6H</xref>, and Table S19). Unlike 12-month-old control mice, the 6-month-old control mice did not show a strong preference for the second target hole in probe test 2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>). However, their DIs for the first and second target holes were significantly higher than 0.5, suggesting an increased confidence of spatial memory for each target hole (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>, Fig. 6 – Supplement 3C, and Table S20). In <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, the DIs for the first and second target hole were comparable to 0.5, as those in 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, suggesting few modifications of the spatial memories (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>, Fig. 6 – Supplement 3C, and Table S20).</p>
<p>In summary, these results suggest that the control mice retained competing spatial memories for the first and the second target holes following reversal learning. In contrast, the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice retained at most one spatial memory during a trial. In other words, the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, given the spatial cues, struggled to infer the spatial memory of either the first or second target hole, leading to the rare usage of the confirmatory strategy. Thus, we confirmed the misclassification in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice in the reversal Barnes maze paradigm. Although both DIs in the reinstatement (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>) and the Barnes maze experiment (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>, 6I) suggest that inferred memories in each time point would diverge between the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice and the control mice, no significant correlations were detected (12-month-old group: Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.062, <italic>p</italic> = 0.738, <italic>N</italic> = 32; 6-month-old group: Spearman’s correlation coefficient = -0.029, <italic>p</italic> = 0.862, <italic>N</italic> = 39), potentially due to differential effects of Aβ accumulation on associative and instrumental learning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Recent advances in disease-modifying intervention have shed light on AD treatment and prevention. Identifying the earliest manifestation of cognitive decline is critical for intervention. However, the behavioral phenotypes and altering trajectories are heterogeneous in predementia AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duara &amp; Barker, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jutten et al., 2023</xref>), yet standard neuropsychological tests have been optimized for detecting stereotypical symptoms near or after the onset of dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Snyder et al., 2014</xref>). Recently proposed generative models successfully contributed to predicting nature-nurture factors conjugate with Aβ and behavioral outcomes from the preclinical to severe stage of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hwang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Petrella et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Yada &amp; Honda, 2023</xref>), while only a few studies explicitly assume an internal model of the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Sutter et al., 2024</xref>). Assuming an internal model would broaden and deepen interpretations of various cognitive deficits in terms of common computational account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kocagoncu et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with this, our perspective is that states of an internal model would be one candidate of factors to generate a wide variety of behavioral phenotypes in AD, and hence probing the internal state would contribute not only to detecting early signs of AD but also to multidimensionally evaluating how the disease gets worse and how early intervention works. In this study, we assumed the latent cause model proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershman et al. (2017)</xref> as an internal model and unveiled the internal state in 6- and 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, a preclinical mouse model of AD, from their behavioral data by estimating the parameters of the latent cause model well replicating the behaviors.</p>

<title>The misclassification in the memory modification process underlies the impairment of <italic>App<sup>NL-G-</sup> <sup>F</sup></italic> mice in the reinstatement of conditioned fear memory</title>
<p>Initially, we confirmed a significant accumulation of Aβ increased along aging in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (Fig. 1 – Supplement 1). We then tested whether the memory modification process was behaviorally impaired in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice across the auditory-cued fear conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement. First, the mice learned an association between a tone as a CS and an electrical shock as a US, as they exhibited increased CR in test 1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, 2C). Next, they observed the CS alone repeatedly through the extinction, and then they exhibited decreased CR in test 2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, 2D). After they observed the US alone, the mice exhibited increased CR again in test 3, suggesting that the reinstatement was established (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, 2E). However, the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice exhibited a lower extent of reinstatement compared to the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>). The DI between test 1 and 3 in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice was significantly lower than 0.5, while that in the control was comparable with 0.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), suggesting that the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice would have lower expectations of upcoming shock in the reinstatement than immediately after the acquisition. These results were the first to report the deficits in the reinstatement in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that Aβ accumulation induces the defect in the memory modification process after the extinction.</p>
<p>Although our results support that the Aβ accumulation in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice would have little effect on associative fear learning and extinction, the results have been mixed in studies using fear conditioning tasks. Two studies found normal contextual or auditory-cued fear conditioning responses up to 18 months old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kundu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sakakibara et al., 2018</xref>), which aligns with our results. On the contrary, another two studies reported that <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice have defects in both contextual and cued fear conditioning from the age of five months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Emre et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Mehla et al., 2019</xref>). The inconsistency suggests the impact of Aβ may be complicated and cannot be simply detected by common behavioral tasks, highlighting the need for novel approaches to probe in-depth behavioral changes.</p>
<p>Recent advances in computational psychiatry offer a wealth of internal models to interpret a patient’s internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hauser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Huys et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Montague et al., 2012</xref>). For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Norbury et al. (2022)</xref> simulated a memory modification process in severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients by the latent cause model and found that they were biased to infer old memories rather than to acquire new memories for novel observations, as they have lower concentration parameter <italic>α</italic>. In this study, we found that <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice exhibited lower <italic>α</italic> both at 6 months and 12 months of age (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>, 5A). As the Aβ accumulation increased with age (Fig. 1 – Supplement 1), lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> was observed in 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). As <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> significantly correlated with DI between test 3 and 1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, 5B), we considered both as critical parameters that shaped the diverged internal states underlying reinstatement between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice.</p>
<p><italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice with lower <italic>α</italic> favored to generalize the observation as if it arose from the old cause instead of differentiating it as a new memory. Indeed, their posterior probabilities of acquisition latent causes were higher than those of the control mice when a novel observation was given in test 1 (Fig. 4 – Supplement 1), contributing to the higher CR in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>, Fig. 4 – supplement 1). Such overgeneralization due to lower <italic>α</italic> may, in part, explain the deficits in discriminating highly similar visual stimuli reported in AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ding et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Saifullah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), preclinical AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Leal et al., 2019</xref>; H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), and MCI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Ally et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Belliart-Guérin &amp; Planche, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Laczó et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Parizkova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Wesnes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Yassa et al., 2010</xref>), as they classify the lure as previous learned object.</p>
<p>Following the Chinese restaurant process, the impact of <italic>α</italic> on internal states decreases with trials, and meanwhile that of <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> relatively increases in our reinstatement paradigm. <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice in 12-month-old with lower <italic>σ<sub>x</sub></italic><sup>2</sup> favored to differentiate similar observations into unique memories, especially in later phases, due to the decreased posterior probabilities of existing latent causes. Indeed, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice had a larger number of latent causes acquired after the extinction with posterior probabilities (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), resulting in a limited update of the associative weight of the existing latent causes by unsignaled shock (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), and thereby lower CR in test 3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, 2H). These results may explain the impaired ability to transfer previously learned association rules could be due to misclassified them as separated knowledge in preclinical autosomal dominant AD mutation carriers and mild AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Bódi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Petok et al., 2018</xref>). Such overdifferentiation due to lower <italic>σ</italic><sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> might underlie delusions, a common neuropsychiatric symptom reported in AD dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Kumfor et al., 2022</xref>), as an extended latent cause model could simulate the emergence of delusional thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Erdmann &amp; Mathys, 2022</xref>). Thus, the deficit in reinstatement of conditioned fear memory in the 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice could be due to their overgeneralization or overdifferentiation of observations into memories, and consequently the competing memories were not retained through the memory modification process (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study demonstrated that estimating internal states with the parameters of the latent cause model provided additional explanations for the cognitive differences between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. It is undoubted that conventional behavioral tests for AD patients or AD mouse models have provided evidence of cognitive decline and are useful for stratification in clinical trials. Nonetheless, it is also possible that certain deficits have antecedently emerged in internal states, even if behavioral deficits are not obvious as in 6-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. The computational phenotype was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Montague et al. (2012)</xref> and defined as parameters of a computational model being in conjunction with measurable behavioral or biological phenotypes. In this sense, <italic>α</italic> and <italic>σ</italic><sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> in the latent cause model might satisfy this definition in this study. Computational phenotype was established to fill explanatory gaps between biological and psychological evidence in psychiatry, which would be informative likewise in AD studies.</p>

<title>The misclassification prevents <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice from retaining competing memories</title>
<p>We further tested whether the deficit in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice observed in the reinstatement experiments can be replicated in the reversal Barnes maze paradigm. The <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> and control mice exhibited similar learning curves in the initial training phase regardless of age (Fig. 6 – Supplement 1A and 3A). These data align with previous studies that did not find a significant spatial learning deficit in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice up to 10 months old by using the Morris water maze, a common spatial learning task relevant to the Barnes maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Latif-Hernandez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Saifullah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Whyte et al., 2018</xref>). Although <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice were previously reported to have longer latency and make more errors during training in the Barnes maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Broadbelt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sakakibara et al., 2018</xref>), these studies haven’t described the mice’s navigation strategies to explain such deficits.</p>
<p>During the reversal training, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice displayed behavioral flexibility as control mice did based on the conventional analysis (Fig. 6 – Supplement 2B and 3B), similar to findings in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sakakibara et al. (2018)</xref>. However, our strategy analysis revealed that this comparable performance was achieved in a sub-optimal way. The usage of confirmatory strategy such that mice selectively explored the first and the second target hole was significantly higher in the control mice during the reversal training phase, especially in the 12-month-old (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, 6F). After the reversal learning, the confirmatory strategy would become the optimal strategy at the first trial in each day to know today’s goal location. In contrast, the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice primarily took the perimeter search strategy such that mice explored the target hole in a “brute-force” manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, 6F), consistent with deficits in navigation ability found in preclinical AD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Allison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Coughlan et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that the control mice solved the task by inferring the two competing spatial memories representing the two possible target holes, whereas the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice solved the task not relying on selective spatial memories but the perimeter strategy, while both mice were given the same spatial cues. Thus, our hypothesis that the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice have a deficit in classifying observed cues into two or more competing memories in the same context would be supported by the results of the reversal Barnes maze experiment.</p>
<p>As the latent cause model was built on the fear conditioning paradigm and does not explicitly assume the contribution of other cognitive functions such as attention or working memory, this study provides no direct evidence as to which model parameters are in conjunction with the behavioral outcomes in the reversal Barnes maze and which parameters involve other the cognitive functions that are presumably affected by AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Finke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Kirova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Malhotra, 2019</xref>). To evaluate them, further studies would be required to integrate computational models encompassing different cognitive functions, such as multiple successor representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Madarasz &amp; Behrens, 2019</xref>) or hidden state inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanders et al., 2020</xref>) for spatial learning, upon more fundamental principles, such as the predictive coding in a hierarchical neural network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Kocagoncu et al., 2021</xref>). We believe that such models would not only explain a wide variety of symptoms in dementia and AD in a common framework but also predict disease progression or effects of interventions for various cognitive functions.</p>

<title>Putative brain regions involving the altered internal states in the <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice</title>
<p>This study did not explicitly provide evidence about neural mechanisms underlying the defect in memory classification in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice. Nonetheless, we speculated that possible neural circuits are presumably involved in the results reported here according to the findings of the previous studies.</p>
<p>It is well known that the amygdala, the hippocampus, and the medial prefrontal cortex are critical in regulating fear memory and its extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Maren et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) plays a modulatory role with its wide projection to these brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Beier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cai &amp; Tong, 2022</xref>). The dysfunction in the abovementioned brain regions may cause the defect of reinstatement. Indeed, previous studies have shown that the inhibition of dopaminergic signal from VTA to the infralimbic cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hitora-Imamura et al., 2015</xref>) or inhibition of glutamatergic signal from VTA to the dorsal hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Han et al., 2020</xref>) during unsignaled shock reduced the reinstatement of fear memory in mice.</p>
<p>Although the neural implementation of the latent cause model has not been demonstrated yet, contributions of certain neuronal populations are expected. It is well established that prediction error in classical or operant conditioning learning is computed in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Lerner et al., 2021</xref>). The prediction error is signaled from the VTA to the hippocampal CA1 via the dopaminergic projections, while the VTA receives a feedback signal from the CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lisman &amp; Grace, 2005</xref>). The pattern separation and completion were implemented in the dentate gyrus (DG) and the CA3 in the hippocampus, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Neunuebel &amp; Knierim, 2014</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Sanders et al. (2020)</xref> pointed out, one might find an analogy between the process of pattern completion/separation and the inference of old/new latent cause, in the sense that both consist of a generalization/differentiation process to assign a current observation to either the same class with the previous observations or a novel class. The dysfunction in this circuit has long been implicated in memory problems in aging and AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Palmer &amp; Good, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Wilson et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershman et al. (2017)</xref> predicted that activities of newborn neurons in the DG and neurons in the CA3 correlate with the prior probability over latent causes, while the dopaminergic projection from the VTA to the hippocampal CA1 represents the posterior probability over latent causes. In other words, prediction error signals from the VTA to the CA1 might serve to compute the likelihood of the observation given the latent causes. The feedback from the CA1 to the VTA might signal posterior probability over latent causes and then modulate the extent of associative weight update.</p>
<p>Different lines of evidence suggest that hippocampus functions were affected in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, including lower neuronal firing rates in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Inayat et al., 2023</xref>), degradation of gamma oscillation power in the CA3 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arroyo-García et al., 2021</xref>), and disrupted place cell remapping in CA1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Jun et al., 2020</xref>). While VTA dysfunction was not reported in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, studies using Tg2576 mice, which overexpress mutated APP, have shown that neurodegeneration in the VTA occurred at an early age and consequent dysfunction was correlated with impairments in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Nobili et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Spoleti et al., 2024</xref>). Given the evidence above, dysfunctions caused by pathological Aβ in the hippocampus and VTA are potential candidates underlying unsuccessful latent cause inference in <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, leading to a lower extent of reinstatement. Although this study considered limited disease factors, cognitive impairments in AD patients result from a combination of neuropathological factors and cannot be ascribed solely to Aβ deposition in clinical practice. Examining whether the interaction of neuropathology can be seen in the internal state with a mouse model including tau pathology, e.g., <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup>/MAPT</italic> double knock-in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hashimoto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Saito et al., 2019</xref>), would improve the translational interpretation in this study.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Uncovering the underdeveloped symptoms in the AD continuum is critical to early detection and intervention by filling the explanatory gap between the pathological states and the cognitive decline in AD. We expect that seeking internal state as well as parameters in an internal model in conjunction with behavioral or biological phenotypes could provide in-depth explanations about behavioral outcomes in AD beyond assessing behavior alone.

<p>Male <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> homozygous knock-in mice (abbreviated as <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice in this study) and age-matched control mice were subjected to behavioral tests at 6 and 12 months old.

We decided to assign at least 20 mice for each group (6-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, 6-month-old control mice, 12-month-old <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice, and 12-month-old control mice) on average when designing the reinstatement experiment (see below). Animals were housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle in a temperature-controlled environment (23–24°C temperature and 40%–50% relative humidity) with food pellets (Japan SLC) and water provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Behavioral experiments were performed during the dark cycle (8 am–8 pm). After the behavioral experiments, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation unless their brains were sampled. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Kyoto University animal care committee’s regulations (approval number: Lif-K24014).</p>

<title>Reinstatement paradigm in fear conditioning</title>
<p>The reinstatement of conditioned fear response after a reminder of unconditioned stimulus is observed in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hermans et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hitora-Imamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Monfils et al., 2009</xref>). In the present study, the four-chamber fear conditioning testing system (O’HARA &amp; CO., LTD, Tokyo, Japan) was used to deliver tone and electrical foot shock, and the top view camera in the chamber recorded mouse behavior at 2 Hz, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tachiki et al., 2023</xref>). The procedure contained the following phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>): acquisition (day 1), test 1 (day 2), extinction (day 3 and day 4), test 2 (day 5), unsignaled shock (day 8), and test 3 (day 9). The context (acrylic box) was the same throughout the test. Mice were transferred to the experimental room from the breeding room and then habituated for 30 min in their homecage in a rack until the phase started. In each phase, mice were moved between their homecage and the chamber via a transporting cage filled with woodchips. In the acquisition phase, a 60-s tone (65 dB, 10 kHz) as the conditioned stimulus (CS) was presented 300 s later since the mice were released in the chamber. The last 2 seconds of the CS were accompanied by an electrical foot shock (0.3 mA) as the unconditioned stimulus (US). This CS-US association was repeated 3 times with a 90-s interval. After the last US, the mice were left in the chamber for 140 s and then returned to the homecage. In the test phases, a 60-s tone was given 120 s after the mice entry. In the extinction phase, only a 60-s tone was given 19 times on day 3 and 10 times on day 4 with a 200-s interval. In the unsignaled shock phase, an electrical foot shock (0.7 mA) was given 10 min after the mice were placed into the chamber. After the electrical shock, the mice were left in the chamber for 5 min and then transferred back to the homecage. The chamber and grid were cleaned with 70% propanol before trials started. The freezing behavior was measured as a conditioned response (CR), and the criterion for freezing is defined as the change of detected mouse area being less than 10 pixels within 1 second. The freezing rate was calculated as the percentage of time spent freezing during the tone presentation (CS). To evaluate how belief in the mice changed in each test phase, the discrimination index (DI) is calculated as CR(<italic>t</italic>) / [CR(<italic>t</italic>) + CR(<italic>t</italic>’)], where CR indicates freezing rate during CS presentation; <italic>t</italic> and <italic>t</italic>’ indicate any two test phases.</p>

<title>Barnes maze</title>
<p>Barnes maze is a commonly used behavioral task to examine spatial learning and reference memory in Alzheimer’s disease model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). The apparatus and setting were the same as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Suzuki &amp; Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tachiki et al., 2023</xref>)(Bio-Medica, Osaka, Japan). The maze consisted of a circular open arena (98 cm in diameter) with 12 holes equally spaced around the perimeter. A black iron escape box was placed under one of the holes as a goal during the training phase. The location of the goal stayed constant for a given mouse but was randomized across mice. Four unique visual cues were located at the outside of the arena. Behavior during the trials was recorded using a GigE Vision camera (UI-5240SE-NIR; IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH, Obersulm, Germany) mounted on the top of the maze to estimate the mouse’s position in each frame. All programs used for data acquisition, processing, saving, and synchronized device controls were written in LabVIEW 2013 (National Instruments, TX, USA). The procedure contained the following phases (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>): habituation (day 0), initial training (day 1 to day 6), probe test 1 (day 7), retraining (day 8), reversal training 1 (day 9 to day 11), reversal training 2 (day 12 to day 14) and probe test 2 (day15). Mice were transferred to the experimental room from the breeding room and then waited for 30 min in their homecage in a rack by the phase started. In the habituation phase, mice were released to the center of the field and could freely explore the field for 5 min. After the trial, the mice were moved into the escape box for another 5 min, then back to the homecage. In the training phase, the mice had to explore the field until they successfully got into the escape box within 10 min. Then, they were returned to the homecage and on standby for the next trial. In the probe test, the procedure was the same as the habituation phase except that the mouse was returned to the homecage directly after the field exploration. The field was cleaned with 70% ethanol thoroughly, and the paper bedding in the escape box was changed per trial to reduce the effect of possible olfactory cues in the maze.</p>
<p>The analysis of the Barnes maze was performed on the custom code based on our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Suzuki &amp; Imayoshi, 2017</xref>) with some modifications in strategy analysis. The code for strategy analysis is freely available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/suzuki-yusuke/BM_analysis.git/">https://github.com/suzuki-yusuke/BM_analysis.git/</ext-link>. In brief, the conventional analysis included the number of errors (count to visit holes other than the goal), latency, and travel distance from start to goal in each trial in the training phase, and time spent around each hole in the probe test. The strategy analysis was performed to qualitatively evaluate what kind of exploratory strategies were used by mice based on their belief in each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Suzuki &amp; Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Tachiki et al., 2023</xref>). For each mouse, the trajectory from start to goal in each trial was automatically assigned to any one of the exploration strategies following the definition described in Figure 6 – Supplement 2. In this study, confirmatory and perimeter strategies were assumed in addition to the strategies previously reported. The former is the one such that the mice visit two holes, the current or past goal located opposite in the field, as if they have two memories such that the goal exists in each of the two holes. The latter is the one such that the mice find the goal simply running along with the holes, as if they do not have memories that the goal exists in a specific hole. To evaluate how the belief in the mice changed after the reversal training, the discrimination index (DI) is calculated as ER(<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>) / [ER(<italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub>) + ER(<italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub>)], where ER indicates the exploration rate; <italic>t</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>2</sub> indicate probe test 1 and probe test 2. The ER was calculated as time spent around the hole divided by the maximum exploration time across all holes in each mouse. The DI is calculated for the first target hole (hole 1) and the second target hole (hole 7).</p>

<title>Simulating reinstatement and estimating parameters in the latent cause model</title>
<p>As the latent cause model serves as a generative model, it allows us to simulate the reinstatement experiment while exploring a set of model parameters, minimizing the prediction error between traces of simulated and observed CR for each mouse. The observed trace of CR across all trials in each mouse was initially normalized. In the simulation, the reinstatement experiment was replicated as follows. The number of trials was the same with our experiment: trials 1 to 3 was the acquisition phase, trial 4 was the test 1 phase, trials 5 to 23 was the first extinction phase, trials 24 to 33 was the second extinction phase, trial 34 was the test 2 phase, trial 35 was the unsignaled shock phase, and trial 36 was the test 3 phase. All trials contained stimuli, while the acquisition and the unsignaled shock trials contained the US. The stimulus given a trial was represented as a two-dimensional vector, where the first and the second dimensions indicated the CS and the context, respectively. If the CS was presented at the phases except for the unsignaled shock, the value got 1; otherwise, 0. Because the context was always presented, the value of context was given 0.2 for all trials. The US was represented as a binary value, either 1 at the acquisition and the unsignaled shock or 0 otherwise. The temporal distance of 24 h between each phase was set to be 20, the same as in the original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Ten model parameters to be estimated were concentration parameter (<italic>α</italic>), temporal scaling parameter (<italic>g</italic>), learning rate (<italic>η</italic>), maximum number of iterations in the EM algorithm (max. no. of iteration), initial associative weight (<italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic>), variance of the US (σ<italic><sub>r</sub><sup>2</sup></italic>) and the stimulus (σ<sub>x</sub><italic><sup>2</sup></italic>), response threshold (<italic>θ</italic>), response gain (<italic>λ</italic>), and maximum number of latent causes (<italic>K</italic>), where <italic>g</italic> is not explicitly described in the original model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gershman et al., 2017</xref>) while this is implemented in their source code (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sjgershm/memory-modification.git">https://github.com/sjgershm/memory-modification.git</ext-link>). They were estimated through the slice sampling algorithm in the Markov chain Monte Carlo method (Neal, 2003). In implementation, we used the MATLAB function, <italic>slicesample</italic>. The initial guess and upper and lower bounds of each parameter were listed in Table S21. The initial size of the sampling window for each parameter was the difference between the upper and lower bounds of the parameter divided by 50. In each sampling step, a set of parameters was proposed, and then a CR trace was simulated in the virtual reinstatement experiment. For each parameter, one sample was drawn for every 100 steps in 200000 times sampling, then the first 1000 samples were discarded as burn-in, and eventually 1000 samples were left. The convergence of the sample chain was determined if the Gelman-Rubin statistic was smaller than 1.1. The expected value of each parameter was considered to be the maximum bin in the sample histogram, for which the bin width was statistically optimized by the method proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Shimazaki &amp; Shinomoto (2007)</xref>. As max. no. of iteration and <italic>K</italic> are integers, each expected value was rounded toward infinity. Given the expected parameters, the likelihood of squared errors between the simulated and the observed CR trace was evaluated on a half-normal distribution (<italic>μ</italic> = 0, <italic>σ</italic> = 0.3) so that increasing error decreased the likelihood. If the likelihoods of errors were smaller than the thresholds (1 for acquisition trials; 0.25 for tests 1, 2, and 3 trials; 0.5 for remaining trials) in all trials and the Gelman-Rubin statistic &lt; 1.1, the sampling procedure above was terminated. Otherwise, it was continued while keeping the sample chain and setting the initial guess as the last value of the sampling chain. If the procedure was not terminated within 20 iterations, the observed CR trace was classified as an anomaly.

<p>Given the estimated parameters for each mouse, their internal state and CR were simulated for every trial. The internal states consisted of latent causes, their posterior probabilities, and associative weight. The latent causes were categorized based on which phase they were initially inferred: acquisition trials, extinction trials (i.e., test 1, extinction, test 2), and trials after extinction (i.e., the unsignaled shock and test 3).</p>

<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>After the designated behavioral test, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a cocktail of 0.3 mg/kg medetomidine (Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo, Koriyama, Japan), 4.0 mg/kg midazolam (Sandoz, Minato, Japan), and 5.0 mg/kg butorphanol (Meiji Seika Pharma, Chuo, Japan) and transcardially perfused phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Brain samples were preserved in 4% PFA overnight, and the solution was replaced with 30% sucrose in PBS. Then, the sample was embedded in the OCT compound (Tissue TEK, Sakura finetek Japan, Chuo, Japan) and sectioned at 30 μm (CM1950, Leica Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Every six sections were collected. Ten coronal brain sections from the anterior part (AP = +2.2 ∼ +1 mm from Bregma) and the posterior part (AP = -1.5∼-2.5 mm from Bregma) were subjected to staining in a 12-well plate. Sections were washed in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBST) to remove excessive OCT compound, then blocked in 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) in PBST for an hour at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies on a shaker at 4°C overnight. The following day, sections were washed in PBST and reacted with second antibodies and DAPI for 2 hours at room temperature. Finally, the sections were washed in PBST, mounted on slides, and coverslipped with antifade reagent (FluoroMount-G®, SoutherBiotech, Cat#0100-01). Primary antibodies, including mouse anti-β-Amyloid (1:1000, Biolegend, Cat#803001, RRID:AB_2564653), rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:1000, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, Cat#019-19741, RRID:AB_839504), and rat anti-GFAP (1:1000, Invitrogen, Cat#13-0300, RRID:AB_2532994), were prepared in PBST with 1% NDS. Second antibodies against mouse Alexa Fluor-568nm (Invitrogen, Cat#A10037, RRID:AB_11180865), rabbit Alexa Fluor-647nm (Invitrogen, Cat#A31573, RRID:AB_2536183), and rat Alexa Fluor-488nm (Invitrogen, Cat#A21208, RRID:AB_2535794) were used in a dilution of 1:500 in PBST with 1% NDS. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry slides were imaged on a fluorescence microscope (BZ-X800, Keyence, Japan) with a 10x objective, and the stitching function was used to cover the entire section. Images were stitched in built-in analysis software (Keyence, Japan). The Aβ plaque area of each brain was quantified under QUINT workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Yates et al., 2019</xref>). First, a series of brain section images were registered to Allen Brain Atlas CCFv3 on QuickNII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Puchades et al., 2019</xref>) and fine-adjusted on VisuAlign (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/visualign">https://www.nitrc.org/projects/visualign</ext-link>). Next, the Aβ staining channel images were segmented in Ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Berg et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the integration of registration and segmented results was performed in Nutil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Groeneboom et al., 2020</xref>) to quantify Aβ plaque in selected brain regions. The Aβ plaque area (%) is calculated as the percentage of positive Aβ staining area covering the whole coronal brain section.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>For the fear conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement results, samples with freezing rates in test phases exceeding the 1.5 times interquartile range of the group were treated as outliers and excluded for further statistical analysis. The one-way ANCOVA was performed to analyze genotype effects on the freezing rate and DI, with age as a covariate. The Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was performed to compare the freezing rate and the DI between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice within the same age. To test whether the DI differs from 0.5, the one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test was performed within the group. To compare the estimated parameters and properties of latent causes between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice within the same age, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was performed, as the Shapiro-Wilk normality test reported a violation of normality assumption in the data. The Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient between the estimated model parameters and the DIs between test 3 and test 1 phase were calculated.</p>
<p>For the reversal Barnes maze results, a mixed-designed two-way [Genotype (control, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic>) × Day (1-6, 9-11, or 12-14)] ANOVA was performed for the number of errors, the latency, and the travel distance in the initial and reversal training. A mixed-designed two-way [Genotype (control, <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic>) × Hole (1-12)] ANOVA was performed for the time spent around each hole in the probe test 1 and 2. If a significant interaction between genotype and hole was detected, Tukey’s HSD test at a specific hole between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> was performed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed to compare the use of each strategy on each training day between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> within the same age. To test whether the DI between probe tests 1 and 2 differs from 0.5, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed within the group, as the Shapiro-Wilk normality test reported a violation of the normality assumption in the data. The Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was performed to compare the DI between control and <italic>App<sup>NL-G-F</sup></italic> mice within the same age.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were done in JASP 0.18.3.0 (JASP team, 2024) and MATLAB R2022b (MathWorks Inc., MA, USA). The significance level for all statistical tests was set at 0.05.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study proposes using a rigorous computational model to assess memory deficits in Alzheimer's Disease with the goal of developing an early diagnosis tool for the disease. Using an established mouse model of the disease, the authors studied multiple behavioral tasks and ages with the goal of showing similarities in behavioral deficits across tasks. Using the model, the authors indicate specific deficits in memory (overgeneralization and overdifferentiation) in mice with the transgene for the disease. However, the evidence presented is <bold>incomplete</bold> as certain concerns remain regarding the interpretation of the behavioral results and the validation of the model fit.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show certain memory deficits in a mouse knock-in model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). They show that the observed memory deficits can be explained by a computational model, the latent cause model of associative memory. The memory tasks used include the fear memory task (CFC) and the 'reverse' Barnes maze. Research on AD is important given its known huge societal burden. Likewise, better characterization of the behavioral phenotypes of genetic mouse models of AD is also imperative to advance our understanding of the disease using these models. In this light, I applaud the authors' efforts.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Combining computational modelling with animal behavior in genetic knock-in mouse lines is a promising approach, which will be beneficial to the field and potentially explain any discrepancies in results across studies as well as provide new predictions for future work.</p>
<p>(2) The authors' usage of multiple tasks and multiple ages is also important to ensure generalization across memory tasks and 'modelling' of the progression of the disease.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I have some concerns regarding the interpretation of the behavioral results. Since the computational model then rests on the authors' interpretation of the behavioral results, it, in turn, makes judging the model's explanatory power difficult as well. For the CFC data, why do knock-in mice have stronger memory in test 1 (Figure 2C)? Does this mean the knock-in mice have better memory at this time point? Is this explained by the latent cause model? Are there some compensatory changes in these mice leading to better memory? The authors use a discrimination index across tests to infer a deficit in re-instatement, but this indicates a relative deficit in re-instatement from memory strength in test 1. The interpretation of these differential DIs is not straightforward. This is evident when test 1 is compared with test 2, i.e., the time point after extinction, which also shows a significant difference across groups, Figure 2F, in the same direction as the re-instatement. A clarification of all these points will help strengthen the authors' case</p>
<p>(2) I have some concerns regarding the interpretation of the Barnes maze data as well, where there already seems to be a deficit in the memory at probe test 1 (Figure 6C). Given that there is already a deficit in memory, would not a more parsimonious explanation of the data be that general memory function in this task is impacted in these mice, rather than the authors' preferred interpretation? How does this memory weakening fit with the CFC data showing stronger memories at test 1? While I applaud the authors for using multiple memory tasks, I am left wondering if the authors tried fitting the latent cause model to the Barnes maze data as well.</p>
<p>(3) Since the authors use the behavioral data for each animal to fit the model, it is important to validate that the fits for the control vs. experimental groups are similar to the model (i.e., no significant differences in residuals). If that is the case, one can compare the differences in model results across groups (Figures 4 and 5). Some further estimates of the performance of the model across groups would help.</p>
<p>(4) Is there an alternative model the authors considered, which was outweighed in terms of prediction by this model? One concern here is also parameter overfitting. Did the authors try leaving out some data (trials/mice) and predicting their responses based on the fit derived from the training data?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript proposes that the use of a latent cause model for the assessment of memory-based tasks may provide improved early detection of Alzheimer's Disease as well as more differentiated mapping of behavior to underlying causes. To test the validity of this model, the authors use a previously described knock-in mouse model of AD and subject the mice to several behaviors to determine whether the latent cause model may provide informative predictions regarding changes in the observed behaviors. They include a well-established fear learning paradigm in which distinct memories are believed to compete for control of behavior. More specifically, it's been observed that animals undergoing fear learning and subsequent fear extinction develop two separate memories for the acquisition phase and the extinction phase, such that the extinction does not simply 'erase' the previously acquired memory. Many models of learning require the addition of a separate context or state to be added during the extinction phase and are typically modeled by assuming the existence of a new state at the time of extinction. The Niv research group, Gershman et al. 2017, have shown that the use of a latent cause model applied to this behavior can elegantly predict the formation of latent states based on a Bayesian approach, and that these latent states can facilitate the persistence of the acquisition and extinction memory independently. The authors of this manuscript leverage this approach to test whether deficits in the production of the internal states, or the inference and learning of those states, may be disrupted in knock-in mice that show both a build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and a deterioration in memory as the mice age.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>I think the authors' proposal to leverage the latent cause model and test whether it can lead to improved assessments in an animal model of AD is a promising approach for bridging the gap between clinical and basic research. The authors use a promising mouse model and apply this to a paradigm in which the behavior and neurobiology are relatively well understood - an ideal situation for assessing how a disease state may impact both the neurobiology and behavior. The latent cause model has the potential to better connect observed behavior to underlying causes and may pave a road for improved mapping of changes in behavior to neurobiological mechanisms in diseases such as AD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have several substantial concerns which I've detailed below. These include important details on how the behavior was analyzed, how the model was used to assess the behavior, and the interpretations that have been made based on the model.</p>
<p>(1) There is substantial data to suggest that during fear learning in mice separate memories develop for the acquisition and extinction phases, with the acquisition memory becoming more strongly retrieved during spontaneous recovery and reinstatement. The Gershman paper, cited by the authors, shows how the latent causal model can predict this shift in latent states by allowing for the priors to decay over time, thereby increasing the posterior of the acquisition memory at the time of spontaneous recovery. In this manuscript, the authors suggest a similar mechanism of action for reinstatement, yet the model does not appear to return to the acquisition memory state after reinstatement, at least based on the examples shown in Figures 1 and 3. Rather, the model appears to mainly modify the weights in the most recent state, putatively the 'extinction state', during reinstatement. Of course, the authors must rely on how the model fits the data, but this seems problematic based on prior research indicating that reinstatement is most likely due to the reactivation of the acquisition memory. This may call into question whether the model is successfully modeling the underlying processes or states that lead to behavior and whether this is a valid approach for AD.</p>
<p>(2) As stated by the authors in the introduction, the advantage of the fear learning approach is that the memory is modified across the acquisition-extinction-reinstatement phases. Although perhaps not explicitly stated by the authors, the post-reinstatement test (test 3) is the crucial test for whether there is reactivation of a previously stored memory, with the general argument being that the reinvigorated response to the CS can't simply be explained by relearning the CS-US pairing, because re-exposure the US alone leads to increase response to the CS at test. Of course there are several explanations for why this may occur, particularly when also considering the context as a stimulus. This is what I understood to be the justification for the use of a model, such as the latent cause model, that may better capture and compare these possibilities within a single framework. As such, it is critical to look at the level of responding to both the context alone and to the CS. It appears that the authors only look at the percent freezing during the CS, and it is not clear whether this is due to the contextual US learning during the US re-exposure or to increased response to the CS - presumably caused by reactivation of the acquisition memory. For example, the instance of the model shown in Figure 1 indicates that the 'extinction state', or state z6, develops a strong weight for the context during the reinstatement phase of presenting the shock alone. This state then leads to increased freezing during the final CS probe test as shown in the figure. By not comparing the difference in the evoked freezing CR at the test (ITI vs CS period), the purpose of the reinstatement test is lost in the sense of whether a previous memory was reactivated - was the response to the CS restored above and beyond the freezing to the context? I think the authors must somehow incorporate these different phases (CS vs ITI) into their model, particularly since this type of memory retrieval that depends on assessing latent states is specifically why the authors justified using the latent causal model.</p>
<p>(3) This is related to the second point above. If the question is about the memory processes underlying memory retrieval at the test following reinstatement, then I would argue that the model parameters that are not involved in testing this hypothesis be fixed prior to the test. Unlike the Gershman paper that the authors cited, the authors fit all parameters for each animal. Perhaps the authors should fit certain parameters on the acquisition and extinction phase, and then leave those parameters fixed for the reinstatement phase. To give a more concrete example, if the hypothesis is that AD mice have deficits in differentiating or retrieving latent states during reinstatement which results in the low response to the CS following reinstatement, then perhaps parameters such as the learning rate should be fixed at this point. The authors state that the 12-month-old AD mice have substantially lower learning rate measures (almost a 20-fold reduction!), which can be clearly seen in the very low weights attributed to the AD mouse in Figure 3D. Based on the example in Figure 3D, it seems that the reduced learning rate in these mice is most likely caused by the failure to respond at test. This is based on comparing the behavior in Figures 3C to 3D. The acquisition and extinction curves appear extremely similar across the two groups. It seems that this lower learning rate may indirectly be causing most of the other effects that the authors highlight, such as the low σx, and the changes to the parameters for the CR. It may even explain the extremely high K. Because the weights are so low, this would presumably lead to extremely low likelihoods in the posterior estimation, which I guess would lead to more latent states being considered as the posterior would be more influenced by the prior.</p>
<p>(4) Why didn't the authors use the latent causal model on the Barnes maze task? The authors mention in the discussion that different cognitive processes may be at play across the two tasks, yet reversal tasks have been suggested to be solved using latent states to be able to flip between the two different task states. In this way, it seems very fitting to use the latent cause model. Indeed, it may even be a better way to assess changes in σx as there are presumably 12 observable stimuli/locations.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper seeks to identify underlying mechanisms contributing to memory deficits observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. By understanding these mechanisms, they hope to uncover insights into subtle cognitive changes early in AD to inform interventions for early-stage decline.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper provides a comprehensive exploration of memory deficits in an AD mouse model, covering the early and late stages of the disease. The experimental design was robust, confirming age-dependent increases in Aβ plaque accumulation in the AD model mice and using multiple behavior tasks that collectively highlighted difficulties in maintaining multiple competing memory cues, with deficits most pronounced in older mice.</p>
<p>In the fear acquisition, extinction, and reinstatement task, AD model mice exhibited a significantly higher fear response after acquisition compared to controls, as well as a greater drop in fear response during reinstatement. These findings suggest that AD mice struggle to retain the fear memory associated with the conditioned stimulus, with the group differences being more pronounced in the older mice.</p>
<p>In the reversal Barnes maze task, the AD model mice displayed a tendency to explore the maze perimeter rather than the two potential target holes, indicating a failure to integrate multiple memory cues into their strategy. This contrasted with the control mice, which used the more confirmatory strategy of focusing on the two target holes. Despite this, the AD mice were quicker to reach the target hole, suggesting that their impairments were specific to memory retrieval rather than basic task performance.</p>
<p>The authors strengthened their findings by analyzing their data with a leading computational model, which describes how animals balance competing memories. They found that AD mice showed somewhat of a contradiction: a tendency to both treat trials as more alike than they are (lower α) and similar stimuli as more distinct than they are (lower σx) compared to controls.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While conceptually solid, the model struggles to fit the data and to support the key hypothesis about AD mice's ability to retain competing memories. These issues are evident in Figure 3:</p>
<p>(1) The model misses key trends in the data, including the gradual learning of fear in all groups during acquisition, the absence of a fear response at the start of the experiment, the increase in fear at the start of day 2 of extinction (especially in controls), and the more rapid reinstatement of fear observed in older controls compared to acquisition.</p>
<p>(2) The model attributes the higher fear response in controls during reinstatement to a stronger association with the context from the unsignaled shock phase, rather than to any memory of the conditioned stimulus from acquisition.</p>
<p>These issues lead to potential overinterpretation of the model parameters. The differences in α and σx are being used to make claims about cognitive processes (e.g., overgeneralization vs. overdifferentiation), but the model itself does not appear to capture these processes accurately.</p>
<p>The authors could benefit from a model that better matches the data and that can capture the retention and recollection of a fear memory across phases.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Overall, the data support the authors' hypothesis that AD model mice struggle to retain competing memories, with the effect becoming more pronounced with age. While I believe the right computational model could highlight these differences, the current model falls short in doing so.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ constructive comments and suggestions. We plan the following revisions to address the public reviews.</p>
<p>Regarding model selection (from Reviewers 1 and 3)</p>
<p>We will test whether the latent cause model has a better explanatory power for the observed reinstatement data compared with at least two other models, including the Rescorla-Wagner model. For each model, the prediction errors across all trials and those in the test 3 trial (reinstatement) will be calculated for individual animals. The explanatory power of the models will be discussed based on these results.</p>
<p>Regarding model validation (from Reviewers 1, 2, and 3)</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewers’ concerns about potential parameter overfitting and misinterpretation. First, the simulation in the latent cause model will be run under other possible conditions to test whether our original condition can be justified, then clarify how certain parameters affect the predicted CR. Second, we will confirm if the prediction errors are comparable between experimental groups, present the correlation between parameters, and discuss this result in the revision.</p>
<p>To evaluate the effect of context in explaining reinstatement in the latent cause model, simulations of CR in test 3 when only context or tone is presented will also be performed and discussed with the behavioral data.</p>
<p>Regarding the interpretation of the behavioral data (from Reviewers 1, 2, and 3) We will clarify our interpretation of the behavioral data by incorporating the additional analyses mentioned above; for example, to clarify the contribution of context in test 3, we will provide data on the CR before the tone presentation in our revision. In addition, how we expected and interpreted the reversal Barnes maze results from the memory modification characteristics estimated in the reinstatement test will be further discussed.</p>
<p>Regarding the application of the latent cause model to the reversal Barnes maze task (from Reviewers 1, 2)</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewers’ suggestions to apply the latent cause model to our Barnes maze results to strengthen the link and consistency. To further clarify the reason for including Barnes maze results, we will explicitly discuss how associative learning is involved in spatial learning in the revision. However, we will not be able to directly apply the latent cause model for the Barnes maze data for the following reasons. As we noted in the Results and Discussion, the latent cause model was built on associative learning and cannot be directly applied to the Barnes maze data. The cognitive processes in the Barnes maze task involve maintaining spatial representation of the environment, integrating own position and expected goal, and evaluating potential actions. Importantly, the chosen actions in this task directly affect subsequent observations, while an animal’s response based on an expected outcome typically does not alter future observation in a simple associative learning paradigm.</p>
<p>Thus, although associative learning (e.g., associations between the spatial cue and the location of the escape box) is certainly a critical building block and contributes to performance in the Barnes maze task, this mechanism alone cannot fully explain the animal’s navigation in the maze. We agree that having solid modeling results in the reversal Barnes maze task is an important direction, but extending the latent cause model for this purpose is beyond the scope of this study. We have suggested some possible approaches in the Discussion and will elaborate further on these conceptual distinctions and how latent cause framework assists in the interpretation of results.</p>
