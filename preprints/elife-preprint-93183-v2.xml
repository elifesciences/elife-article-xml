<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>The regulation of cell physiology depends largely upon interactions of functionally distinct proteins and cellular components. These interactions may be transient or long-lived, but often affect protein motion. Measurement of protein dynamics within a cellular environment, particularly while perturbing protein function with small molecules, may enable dissection of key interactions and facilitate drug discovery; however, current approaches are limited by throughput with respect to data acquisition and analysis. As a result, studies using super-resolution imaging are typically drawing conclusions from tens of cells and a few experimental conditions tested. We addressed these limitations by developing a high-throughput single-molecule tracking (htSMT) platform for pharmacologic dissection of protein dynamics in living cells at an unprecedented scale (capable of imaging &gt; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/day and screening &gt; 10<sup>4</sup> compounds). We applied htSMT to measure the cellular dynamics of fluorescently tagged estrogen receptor (ER) and screened a diverse library to identify small molecules that perturbed ER function in real time. With this one experimental modality, we determined the potency, pathway selectivity, target engagement, and mechanism of action for identified hits. Kinetic htSMT experiments were capable of distinguishing between on-target and on-pathway modulators of ER signaling. Integrated pathway analysis recapitulated the network of known ER interaction partners and suggested potentially novel, kinase-mediated regulatory mechanisms. The sensitivity of htSMT revealed a new correlation between ER dynamics and the ability of ER antagonists to suppress cancer cell growth. Therefore, measuring protein motion at scale is a powerful method to investigate dynamic interactions among proteins and may facilitate the identification and characterization of novel therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Both the activity and mobility of proteins within the crowded cellular environment are profoundly influenced by interactions with their surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Under these conditions, where diffusion is no longer well described by the Stokes radius of the protein monomer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, changes in protein motion might be expected to correlate closely with changes in the activity of these proteins. The development of increasingly sophisticated live-cell microscopy techniques, including early ensemble methods like fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and fluctuation correlation spectroscopy (FCS), have informed our understanding of protein dynamics in cellular biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. A myriad of technical improvements, such as enhanced labeling methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, better live-cell compatible fluorophores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, new forms of light microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, dramatic increases in computational power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, and the addition of machine learning approaches to data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup> have together enabled a new era of imaging-based studies across biological contexts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Applying any microscopy technique at scale presents challenges, but recent advances have shown the power of high content imaging techniques to address both mechanistic biological questions as well as to generate leads for new chemical matter in drug discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Even these conceptually simple experiments involving fixed cells stained with well-characterized commercial reagents take careful experiment design and sophisticated computational approaches to execute<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. It is no wonder, then, that attempts to combine high content imaging workflows with more advanced super-resolution microscopy methods have thus far been limited. Such advances have enabled the development of systems for fixed-cell STORM imaging at an impressive 10,000 cells per day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, though the appropriate application of this increase in scale remains an open question.</p>
<p>In single molecule tracking (SMT), a fluorescently labeled protein of interest is imaged at high spatiotemporal resolution to track its motion in a live cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. The information embedded in these trajectories has been used to investigate diverse cellular phenomena including protein oligomerization state and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, inter-organelle communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, nuclear organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and transcription regulation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Of particular utility are ‚Äúfast-SMT‚Äù approaches which use high frame rates and stroboscopic illumination to minimize motion-induced blurring, and hence can measure diffusive states over a large dynamic range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Specifically, proteins that diffuse rapidly throughout the cell are often missed in alternative tracking approaches, biasing the resulting data. In spite of the potential biological discoveries that depend on the application of SMT on a large scale, SMT in general (and fast-SMT in particular) has not been adapted to a high-throughput setting that would enable the analysis of complex, multi-component systems, or the identification of compounds that affect protein motion.</p>
<p>Steroid hormone receptors (SHRs) are a class of transcription factors that play crucial roles in normal human development and in disease pathogenesis. SHRs like the estrogen receptor (genes ESR1 and ESR2), androgen receptor (AR), and progesterone receptor (PR), as examples, contribute decisively to the acquisition of secondary sex characteristics, while the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) helps to orchestrate both metabolism and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In their ligand-free state, SHRs are kept sequestered in multiprotein complexes by the chaperone HSP90<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Canonically, in the presence of hormone they dimerize and bind their cognate genomic response elements, recruiting epigenetic modifiers and transcription machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. At the same time, steroid hormone receptor-derived signals impose a large disease burden by promoting the growth of breast cancers (ER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> or prostate cancers (AR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>; or by imposing immune and metabolic dysfunction (GR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. SHRs therefore provide an excellent proof-of-concept system to study the relationship between protein dynamics and protein function due to the wealth of information and reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> already available for these systems as well as previous reports characterizing some aspects of their cellular dynamics <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here, we present the first industrial-scale, high-throughput, fast-SMT (htSMT) platform capable of measuring protein motion from more than 13,000 individual assay wells (&gt;1,000,000 individual cells) per day. Using ER as a test system, we demonstrate that chemical screening using htSMT is specific, robust, and reproducible. The increase in throughput enables classical drug discovery activities, including compound library screening and the elucidation of structure-activity relationships (SAR), yielding accurate and reproducible results that are inaccessible or unmeasurable with other techniques or using SMT on a smaller scale. Importantly, we demonstrate that htSMT can be used to characterize both known and novel pathway contributions to the ER protein interaction network. More than a proof-of-concept for the htSMT platform, these data confirm that analysis of protein motion itself on a large scale reveals detailed information about pathway interactions and signaling.</p>

<title>Creation and validation of a high throughput SMT platform</title>
<p>We developed a robotic system capable of handling reagents, collecting high-quality fast SMT image series, processing time-ordered raw images to yield molecular trajectories, and extracting features of biological interest within defined cellular compartments (<xref rid="fig1-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Samples start as cells seeded into 384-well plates in a hotel incubator. A central robotic arm retrieves the plates, and delivers them to an Echo 650 acoustic dispenser to add dye. After incubating, excess dye is washed away and Echo 650 is again used to administer compound treatment. Stained and compound-treated plates are then delivered to any of up to four identical SMT microscopes for imaging. Both SMT and accompanying Hoechst images are collected and automatically processed to identify individual molecule positions, reconnect the spot coordinates into trajectories, and then associate each trajectory with a nuclear mask. Finally the processed SMT data are subjected to quality control to omit aberrant fields of view using a convolutional neural network trained to identify technical errors in the images (<xref rid="fig1-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 1C</xref>), and finally stored for downstream analysis.</p>
<p>To examine htSMT system performance across a broad spectrum of diffusion coefficients, we generated three U2OS cell lines ectopically expressing HaloTag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> fused proteins with well-established behaviors in the cell. These HaloTag fusions allow the subsequent addition of bright and photostable organic fluorophores like JF<sub>549</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> which produce high signal spots to detect and track. Histone H2B-Halo, which is predominantly incorporated into chromatin and therefore effectively immobile over short timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, was employed to estimate localization error. A prenylation motif (Halo-CaaX) embedded in the plasma membrane exhibits moderate diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Unfused HaloTag was chosen to represent the upper limit of cellular ‚Äúfree‚Äù diffusion. Single-molecule trajectories measured in these cell lines yielded diffusion coefficients for CaaX similar to published results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and the diffusion for H2B-HaloTag was consistent with the theoretical lower bounds that can be approximated from the localization error and 10 msec frame interval <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="522916v4_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Localization error can be measured directly from the single molecule trajectories using the jump covariance of slow or immobile particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Using the immobile H2B-Halo trajectories, we found the localization error of the htSMT system to be 39 nm (<xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 2A</xref>), comparable to other benchmark stroboscopic illumination datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. The diffusion coefficient for free HaloTag is consistent with previous SMT reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but is also within the theoretical upper bounds of an MSD estimator of diffusion coefficient for a 10 msec frame interval and 1.25 ¬µm search radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="522916v4_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>, thus we consider the distribution recovered from the free HaloTag to represent the upper limit of trackable particles with this assay configuration.</p>

<p>We then tested whether our htSMT platform can extract accurate molecular trajectories at scale. We employed 384-well plates where free Halo, Halo-CaaX, and H2B-Halo cell lines were mixed in equal proportions in each well. Imaging with a 94 ¬µm by 94 ¬µm field-of-view (FOV), we achieved an average of 10 nuclei simultaneously (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 2B</xref>, Supplemental video 1), enough that most FOVs contained cells from each cell line. To limit ambiguity in cell assignment, we considered only the trajectories that fell within nuclear segmented regions. The probability distribution of diffusion states cleanly distinguishes between the three cell types (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). More importantly, by looking at the single-cell state distribution profiles of 103,757 cells from five separate 384-well plates, grouped by their distribution profile, we recovered highly consistent estimates of protein dynamics at the single cell level, comparable to the pure populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>While single-cell measurements are powerful, the number of trajectories in one cell is limited, and so estimates of diffusive states can be broad. Combining trajectories from multiple cells, however, provides the expected distribution of diffusive states (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, combining trajectories derived from many cells makes model-based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> or model-agnostic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> state analysis possible, where as few as 10<sup>3</sup> trajectories permit satisfactory inference of the underlying diffusion states. We determined that imaging six fields of view (FOV), for 1.5 seconds each, yielded enough trajectories (&gt; 10,000) to accurately estimate protein dynamics, bringing the overall throughput of the platform to more than 13,000 individual wells (&gt;90,000 FOVs; &gt; 1,000,000 cells/day), a rate of data acquisition that enables compound screening on a feasible timescale (<xref rid="fig1-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 ‚Äì figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Using htSMT to measure protein dynamics of SHRs</title>
<p>Equipped with an htSMT system capable of measuring protein dynamics broadly, we sought to understand how measuring protein motion can be used to characterize protein activity. SHRs transition between inactive and active states via ligand binding (Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2A), a phenomenon that has been previously observed at the single molecule level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and we hypothesized that the large dynamic range and orders-of-magnitude increase in throughput of our platform could capture these differences in the context of compound screening. We generated HaloTag fusions to ER, AR, and PR through ectopic expression, and GR through endogenous knock-in. Similar to previous approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, we used clonal cell lines in a U2OS cell background to minimize effects of comparing dynamics in different cell types. Clones were carefully selected such that the HaloTag fusion SHRs were comparable to each other in transcript abundance, and not higher than transcript levels in tissue-specific cell lines like MCF7 and T47d, which are both ER and PR positive (Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2B).</p>
<p>In the absence of hormone, all four SHR proteins exhibit similar dynamic profiles: a small immobile fraction and a large freely diffusing fraction with a 3.4 ‚Äì 4.3 ¬µm<sup>2</sup>/sec average diffusion coefficient (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2C). No correlation between diffusion and protein molecular weight (138 kDa for Halo-AR, 102 kDa for ER-Halo, 122 kDa for Halo-GR, and 135 kDa for Halo-PR) was observed, highlighting the differences between cellular protein dynamics versus purified systems. Upon addition of agonist, a dramatic increase in immobile trajectories is observed, which we attribute to chromatin binding. Using a conservative upper-bound of chromatin mobility in the nucleus and chromatin-associated transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, we define the bound fraction (<italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>) for each SHR as the fraction of trajectories diffusing less than 0.1 ¬µm<sup>2</sup>/sec (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Using this threshold, <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> of histone H2B is 0.92 on average, consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. D<sub>free</sub> we defined as the occupation-weighted average diffusion coefficient of the non-bound states (Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2C). Some SHRs had a higher proportion of bound molecules than others; The ligand-induced effect is most pronounced for ER, with 34% bound in basal conditions and 87% bound after estradiol treatment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Supplemental video 2 and 3).</p>

<p>SHRs are highly selective for their cognate agonists in biochemical binding assays, which we confirmed by measuring the dose-dependent change in dynamics as a function of agonist concentration. The maximal change in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) and decrease in D<sub>free</sub> (Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2D) differed between SHRs. The dose titration curves also showed variable potencies (EC<sub>50</sub>) for each SHR/hormone pair, with ER-estradiol being both the most potent and most selective pair. RNA-seq after estradiol stimulation showed a marked induction of hallmark ER-dependent gene sets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, confirming that the increase in chromatin binding we observed by SMT has a functional effect in promoting ER-responsive gene programs, even in the ectopic expression setting (Figure 2 ‚Äì figure supplement 2E, F). Thus, SMT can detect functionally-relevant changes in transcription factor dynamics and accurately differentiate the ligand/target specificity directly within the cellular environment.</p>

<title>Screening a diverse bioactive chemical set identifies known and novel modulators of ER dynamics</title>
<p>Our characterization efforts of ligand selectivity for AR, ER, GR, and PR collectively suggested that we could use SMT to interrogate the effects of compounds on protein dynamics at a throughput conducive to high throughput screening. We first identified a structurally diverse set of 5,067 molecules with heterogeneous biological activities as a useful screening set. Having determined that the same data acquisition parameters (6 FOVs imaged for 1.5 sec each) were sufficient to recover more than 10,000 trajectories per well, we could achieve a throughput of 15,000 wells per day which would permit us to interrogate the whole library in a single day (<xref rid="fig3-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 1A</xref>). For cells at steady state, such a brief acquisition time also means that the dynamical state of the cell remains largely constant within an FOV (<xref rid="fig3-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 1B</xref>), allowing all of the trajectories from an FOV to be considered largely representative of the same cellular state. We chose to screen this bioactive compound set against ER, assessing change in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> at 1 ¬µM compound versus the vehicle DMSO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig3-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 1C, D</xref>, Figure 3 ‚Äì supplemental table 1). The screen was run twice to assess reproducibility, showing a high degree of agreement between replicates for ER-active molecules (<xref rid="fig3-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 2A</xref>). This screen illustrates some important advantages of our htSMT platform over more manual lower-throughput approaches.</p>

<p>From plate to plate, the assay window for the screen was robust<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> (average Z‚Äô-factor = 0.79 over 72 plates), the measured potency of the control estradiol in each instance remained within three-fold of the mean (<xref rid="fig3-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 2B-D</xref>), and the distribution of negative control wells centered tightly on zero (<xref rid="fig3-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 2E, F</xref>). Each compound measurement was averaged from SMT trajectories of between 94 and 161 cells (25<sup>th</sup> to 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles; <xref rid="fig3-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 2G</xref>). Of the 30 compounds we identified from the bioactive set that we expected to modulate ER, either as agonists or antagonists<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, all significantly increased <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> measured by SMT. This includes agonistic molecules like estradiol, but also notable examples such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen, fulvestrant, and bazedoxifene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, Extended Data 3B, H).</p>
<p>With a large dataset to work from, collected across multiple assay plates on multiple independent microscopes, we examined the sources of variability within the screening assay. Using random sampling of individual jumps within the screening dataset while holding constant the source of the jumps (for example, sampling jumps within a specific assay well), we could estimate the relative contributions of microscope-to-microscope, plate-to-plate, well-to-well, FOV-to-FOV and cell-to-cell variability. Cell-to-cell variability was the single largest contributor to overall assay variability, especially when considering only vehicle treated controls (<xref rid="fig3-s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 3B</xref>), and stabilized after ‚àº1000 jumps (<xref rid="fig3-s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 3C</xref>). These results support the use of a short acquisition time per FOV and multiple FOVs to stabilize the dynamical state estimate.</p>
<p>The somewhat counter-intuitive finding that either strong agonism or antagonism can lead to an increase in chromatin binding has been reported for ER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, but this appears not to a general feature of SHRs. While the PR antagonist mifepristone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> behaves similarly to ER (<xref rid="fig3-s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 4A</xref>), antagonists of AR like Enzalutamide and Darolutamide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, and antagonists of GR like AL082D06<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup> cause a decrease in chromatin binding. This decrease occurs when administered singly or when co-administered in competition with the cognate agonist (<xref rid="fig3-s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 4B, C</xref>). These results show how the cellular context and interaction partners are critical to understand the effect of a compound on its intended target. To underscore this point, in addition to binders of the ER ligand-binding domain, we also identified a number of active compounds targeting diverse nodes in the ER interaction network, including modulators of the proteasome, chaperones, kinases, and others (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Cellular ER dynamics elucidate structure-activity relationships (SAR) of ER modulators</title>
<p>Our screen revealed that, surprisingly, all the known ER modulators‚Äîboth agonists like estradiol and potent antagonists like fulvestrant‚Äîcaused an increase in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). We therefore characterized a subset of selective ER modulators (SERMs) and selective ER degraders (SERDs) in more detail. These molecules all bind competitively to the ER ligand binding domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. As in the bioactive screen, both SERDs and SERMS increased <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) and slightly decreased measured D<sub>free</sub> (<xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 ‚Äì figure supplement 1A</xref>), with potencies ranging from 9 pM for GDC-0927 to 4.8 nM for GDC-0810 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). To understand how quickly these compound effects take place, we measured the change in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> as a function of time, collecting timepoints roughly every 2 minutes beginning immediately after compound addition.

Importantly, selective antagonists of AR and GR did not induce significant modulation of ER dynamics, further highlighting the utility of htSMT in characterizing the specificity of interactions between small molecule modulators of protein function and their cognate targets (<xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 ‚Äì figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Interestingly, SERMs 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) and GDC-0810 show lower maximal increases in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> compared with the SERDs fulvestrant and GDC-0927 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar effects have been described previously using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> (FRAP), which we confirmed using our Halo-ER cell line (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). The delay in ER signal recovery after two minutes in FRAP was consistent with the changes in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> measured by SMT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Although FRAP was used to measure these <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> differences, the technique suffers from challenges in scalability and depends heavily on prior assumption of the underlying dynamical model in the sample. SMT, alternatively, enables detailed characterization of the potency of 4OHT and GDC-0810 relative to other ER ligands in their ability to increase ER chromatin binding on a tractable timescale.</p>
<p>Neither FRAP nor htSMT can discriminate between recovery driven by an increase in residence time (decreasing k*<sub>off</sub>) or increasing the rate of chromatin binding (increasing k*<sub>on</sub>), either of which would result in increasing <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>. By changing SMT acquisition conditions to reduce the illumination intensity and collect long, 250 msec continuous frame exposures, only immobile proteins form spots. Under these imaging conditions, the distribution of track lengths provides a measure of relative residence times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Both agonist and antagonist treatment led to longer binding times compared to DMSO, suggesting that ligand binding decreases k*<sub>off</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 ‚Äì figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with FRAP, estradiol, GDC-0927, and fulvestrant show longer binding times compared with other ER modulators. Using <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> and k*<sub>off</sub> measurements, one can infer the k*<sub>on</sub>. In all cases the changes in dissociation rate are not proportional to the increase in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>, and so ligand-imposed increases in k*<sub>on</sub> likely contribute to the observed change in the chromatin associated ER fraction (<xref rid="fig4-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 ‚Äì figure supplement 1F</xref>). These data are consistent with a model wherein ER rapidly binds to chromatin irrespective of which molecule occupies the ligand binding domain, but some ligands induce a conformation that can be further stabilized on chromatin by cofactors. Consequently, these data support the hypothesis that ER may engage chromatin in mechanistically different ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. An efficacious ER inhibitor may promote rapid and transient chromatin binding that fails to effectively recruit necessary cofactors to drive transcription<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We compared the potencies of GDC-0927 and analogues determined either via ER degradation or SMT, with the ability of each of these compounds to block estrogen-induced breast cancer cell proliferation. Potency assessed by ER degradation was not a good predictor of potency in the cell proliferation assay (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>Most active molecules from the screen were not structurally related to steroids (<xref rid="fig6-s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). On the other hand, many compounds could be grouped based on their reported biological targets or pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig6-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). For example, heat shock protein (HSP) and proteasome inhibitors consistently increased <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>, whereas cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and mTOR inhibitors decreased <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>. Though many CDK inhibitors lack within-family specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 2A</xref>, pan-CDK), we found that CDK9-specific inhibitors more strongly affected ER dynamics than did CDK4/6-specific inhibitors. Furthermore, as with selective AR and GR antagonists, inhibitors targeting ALK, BTK, and FLT3 kinases that have not been shown to interact with ER have no impact on ER dynamics when assessed using SMT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>For the inhibitors of cellular pathways we identified, we used a dose titration to better characterize the effect of each on ER dynamics. Potencies ranged from the sub-nanomolar to low micromolar (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>), similar to the reported potencies of these compounds against their cellular targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Additionally, we tested these molecules against AR (<xref rid="fig6-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 2C</xref>) and PR (<xref rid="fig6-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 2D</xref>). Each SHR differed meaningfully from the others in terms of the response to compounds identified through an ER-focused screening effort. Again, the magnitude of ER SMT effect was largely consistent within a target class (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref rid="fig6-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). The finding that structurally distinct compounds exhibited similar effects based on their biological targets favors the view that these biological targets must themselves interact with ER, and that the compounds therefore affect ER dynamics indirectly. HSP90 is a chaperone for many proteins, including SHRs. In the canonical model, hormone binding releases the SHR-HSP90 complex. Indeed, HSP90 inhibitors increased <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> for ER, AR, and PR, consistent with the hypothesis that one function of the chaperone may be to adjust the equilibrium of SHR binding to chromatin (<xref rid="fig6-s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 2B-D</xref>). Proteasome inhibition also leads to ER immobilization on chromatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>, which aligns with the results that we obtained in our htSMT screen of bioactive compounds. ER has been shown to be phosphorylated by CDK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, Src<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, or GSK-3 through MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, and therefore inhibition of these pathways could reasonably be expected to affect ER dynamics measured using SMT. While CDK inhibition led to an increase in ER mobility, inhibition of PI3K, AKT, or other upstream kinases showed no effect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, SMT dynamics of an ER triple point mutant engineered to lack previously defined phosphorylation sites important for transactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup> (S104A/S106A/S118A) were affected by CDK and mTOR pathway inhibitors (<xref rid="fig6-s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 ‚Äì figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that additional phosphorylation sites can mediate the effects of CDK9 and PI3K/AKT signaling, or that other molecular targets of CDK and PI3K/AKT can act indirectly to alter the motion of ER. The change in ER protein dynamics for characterized pathway inhibitors such as those targeting CDK and mTOR is subtle but consistent across compounds, suggesting biological meaning in these observations and highlight the need for accurate and precise SMT measurements. Hence htSMT screening offers the promise of providing comprehensive pathway interaction information or revealing novel interaction mechanisms.</p>

<title>Kinetic htSMT Facilitates Evaluation of Small Molecule Mechanism of Action</title>
<p>Since SMT can identify compounds that act either directly on a fluorescent target, or through some intermediary process, we sought to distinguish between these alternative modes of action. We hypothesized that by investigating the rate at which changes in protein motion emerge, SMT could be used to distinguish direct versus indirect effects on ER activity. Given the live-cell setting of SMT, we configured a data collection mode that allows for measurement of protein dynamics in set intervals after compound addition (kinetic SMT or kSMT). Both ER agonists and antagonists rapidly induce ER immobilization on chromatin when measured in kSMT (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 1.6 minutes for estradiol; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). On the other hand, HSP90 inhibitors like ganetespib and HSP990 exhibit a delay of 5 to 7 minutes before alterations in ER dynamics appear, after which we observed an increase in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> with a t<sub>1/2</sub> of 19.3 and 17.5 minutes, respectively. The overall effect of these compounds reached a plateau after an hour (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Proteasome inhibitors, e.g. bortezomib and carfilzomib, acted even more slowly, with changes in ER dynamics emerging only after 40 minutes, and slowly increasing over the four-hour measurement window (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Hence this exploration of SMT kinetics represents an important tool that can facilitate differentiation between on-target and on-pathway modulators. We believe that this approach will permit, for example, rapid mechanistic characterization of active compounds in a drug discovery setting.</p>
<p>To further differentiate the effect of pathway inhibitors on ER protein dynamics, we sought to characterize relative ER residence times for each such molecule. In contrast to the SERDs and SERNs, although HSP90 inhibition by HSP990 and ganetespib resulted in an increase in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>, we observed a decrease in the total number long binding events by two- and four-fold, respectively, while the binding times were similar to that observed with DMSO alone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>). These results suggest HSP90 inhibition primarily increases k*<sub>on</sub> while leaving k*<sub>off</sub> largely unaffected. On the other hand, inhibition of the proteasome led to an increase in both the number and duration of long binding events. These results demonstrate that ER-chromatin binding can be modulated by changing the rate of association or disassociation, and that the inhibition of specific cellular partners can affect these rates differentially. Taken together with the different kinetics for direct ER, HSP90, and proteasome modulators, our data suggest that each class of molecule alters ER dynamics through distinct mechanisms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Many pathways that regulate the fundamental biochemistry of cells depend upon the interaction of protein ‚Äúsensors‚Äù with distinct protein ‚Äúeffectors‚Äù that engage transiently to trigger a change in cell physiology. Although the fundamentals of this process have long been appreciated, biochemical investigation of these protein interactions has typically required <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution or has been interrogated through pull-down assays after cell permeabilization. Here we report the combination of SMT, a type of super-resolution microscopy, with high content microscopy as a means of visualizing individual protein motion in millions of live cells, and under circumstances where the effect of small molecule inhibitors can be assessed quantitatively. We demonstrate the capabilities of the htSMT platform by analyzing the behavior of SHRs, a class of sensors that mediate hormone-induced modulation of gene expression, and in particular the dynamics of the ER.</p>
<p>To validate our htSMT platform, our analysis initially focused on the very rapid immobilization of SHRs on chromatin observed in cells exposed to their established, cognate steroid ligands. The technique proved to be highly quantitative, effectively evaluating ligands whose potency differ by more than four orders of magnitude, and readily characterizing differences in both the sensitivity and the selectivity of the steroid receptor family. These observations prompted us to apply htSMT to screen thousands of bioactive compounds, which we hypothesized would reveal new chemical matter as well as enable comprehensive pharmacologic dissection of ER pathway interactions. As further validation of the technique, automated screening of ER dynamics using htSMT identified all 30 known steroid ligands from a library of 5,067 bioactive compounds. The potency of these steroid ligands with respect to alterations in ER dynamics varied across a thousand-fold range, demonstrating the dynamic range of this single experimental setup. Among molecules known to behave as ER signaling inhibitors, the change in ER dynamics correlated closely with the ability of these compounds to block estrogen-induced proliferation of estrogen dependent breast cancer cells, demonstrating the ability of htSMT to document structure-activity relationships in a chemical series across disparate and biologically relevant readouts. Since our analysis relies only on detection of changes in protein dynamics, this unbiased readout will prove broadly useful in screening libraries of compounds to identify starting points for the development of new therapeutics. In fact, our analysis identified 209 non-steroidal molecules that affect ER dynamics, which are likely to act elsewhere in the network of ER-interacting proteins.</p>
<p>Our characterization of the htSMT platform and subsequent screen highlighted some important considerations for future screening efforts using single molecule tracking. Notably, the observation that cell-to-cell variability is the dominant driver of assay variance, when compared to other sources like the microscope or the assay plate, suggests that an even larger field of view would sample cells more effectively and result in a more stable dynamical estimate (<xref rid="fig3-s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 ‚Äì figure supplement 3</xref>). This could be particularly important for detecting subtle dynamical changes such as those seen with the mTOR inhibitors where the maximal change in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> was only around 5% (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, for our screening assay we chose a frame interval of 10 msec, which proved very sensitive to detecting a wide range of compound effects but is necessarily limited in the types of perturbations it can detect. The diffusion of the most mobile ER population was well below the upper limit of detection for 10 msec, suggesting that faster frame rates were not necessary, but this may not be the case for other protein targets. On the other hand, ER has been reported to have multiple low-mobility chromatin binding states (Wagh 2023), but these low mobility states are below the assay lower bound set by our localization error <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="522916v4_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula> and would require a slower frame interval to differentiate.</p>
<p>The observation that by screening large libraries of bioactive compounds for an effect on protein motion, htSMT can define networks of biochemical signaling pathways is a critical outcome of this high-throughput platform. Protein dynamics in the cell are not governed by singular interactions between any two proteins but by biochemical networks within the cell that intersect with the protein under observation. Our work enables construction of a putative interaction network connecting nodes involving different proteins, the identities of which were deduced based on the impact of known inhibitors on the dynamics of steroid receptors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). The interaction map derived from unbiased htSMT screening recapitulates many known biological interaction partners of the ER, in a single experimental setup using protein motion as a sole readout. More experiments are necessary to determine which nodes represent direct physical interactions and which occur through intermediaries. To our knowledge, the impact of HSP inhibition in increasing ER-chromatin association has never been described, neither has the link between inhibition post-translation modifying enzymes like the CDKs or mTOR and ER dynamics ever been described. We believe that identifying additional cellular interaction networks through htSMT will provide an important foundation for the broader understanding of biochemical regulatory mechanisms. For example, CDK4/6 inhibitors are co-administered with SERDs and SERMs to improve therapeutic outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. CDK4/6 inhibition only minimally affects ER dynamics in SMT (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), supporting the view that the combination of CDK4/6 inhibition with ER antagonists functions through a non-redundant ER-independent mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Most cell-based assays cannot easily be configured for kinetic analysis of treatment effects, as these typically involve fixed-endpoint, aggregate readouts. With such endpoint assays, biochemical feedback and compensatory mechanisms often confound interpretation of the direct effect of a change in treatment conditions. SMT, however, when implemented in a high-throughput system that exhibits consistency over long time intervals, permits kinetic analysis of treatment effects on protein dynamics in real time with high reliability. Such kinetic analyses help to define pathway cascades; in a first instance, they can be used to rapidly identify compounds that likely engage directly with a therapeutic target.</p>
<p>Mechanistically, an increase in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> provoked by a change in cell conditions suggests that molecular interactions with the protein being analyzed have been stabilized (either made more probable or longer-lasting), while a decrease in <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub> suggests the opposite: molecular interactions that have been made less robust. Unexpectedly, we observed both SERDs and SERMs, which antagonize ER, cause an <underline>increase</underline> in nuclear bound fraction, likely via chromatin binding, in a way that mimics what is seen with traditional ER agonists. We showed that this mechanism is not a commonality among all SHRs, and indeed inhibitors of AR and GR behaved more like the prototypical competitive antagonist. Inhibition of HSP90 also produces a marked increase in ER <italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>, though these binding events are more transient (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). Transcription factors are thought to find binding sites through free 3D diffusion, 1D sliding, and transient, non-specific DNA binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. ER antagonists may function by promoting ER binding to non-specific decoy chromatin sites, thus reducing the amount of ER able to activate transcription at ER-responsive genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Previous work has also shown that SERDs, and to a lesser extent SERMs, induce an alternate conformation of ER, thereby inhibiting co-factor recruitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. If co-factors like CBP and p300 stabilize ER-chromatin binding, then efficacious inhibitors might exhibit shorter binding times compared with agonist stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. The SERMs 4OHT and GDC-0810 dramatically increase ER-chromatin binding frequency and only modestly increase binding times; fulvestrant and GDC-0927 strongly increase both ER-chromatin binding frequency and residence time. Therefore, htSMT suggests that agonists and antagonists of SHR signaling operate through a previously unappreciated, unified mechanism of chromatin immobilization, meriting further investigation.</p>
<p>Lastly, we note that fast-SMT, as implemented here, can define relationships between the structures of chemical inhibitors and their effects on a fundamental property of protein regulatory elements: their dynamics in living cells. In our hands, these measurements proved far more reliable in predicting the ability of an ER antagonist to block cell proliferation than an ER degradation assay, a conclusion that was only able to be drawn due to the scale of htSMT screening capabilities. Notably, saturable dose responses were observed for ER antagonists at much lower concentrations using htSMT than with ER degradation assays, suggesting that this method will be more sensitive for identifying novel therapeutic agents than with corresponding traditional assay formats. Thus, SMT can identify promising compounds the activity of which might not otherwise be measurable, provide insight into their mechanism(s) of action, and in the native environment of the cell.While ER is a transcription factor, the same principles may apply broadly to regulatory mechanisms of proteins with diverse function. In this context, we conclude that the application of technologies for measuring protein dynamics at scale will prove broadly applicable to the elucidation of biological mechanisms.</p>

Angle of inclination and beam direction were adjusted by micrometer on the TIRF illuminator and empirically set to maximize and flatten the signal across the camera field of view. Fluorescence emission was passed through a high-speed filter wheel (Finger Lakes Instruments) and collected with a backlit CMOS camera (Prime 95b, Teledyne). Images were acquired with a 60X 1.27 NA water immersion objective (Nikon). Environmental chamber was set to 37¬∞ Celsius, 95% humidity, and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For each field of view, 200 SMT frames were collected at a frame rate of 100 Hz, with a 2 msec stroboscopic laser pulse. 10 frames of the Hoechst channel were collected at the same frame rate for downstream registration of trajectories to nuclei. Sample focus was maintained using the reflection-based Perfect Focus System to determine the position of the coverglass and apply an empirically-determined offset to focus into the sample.</p>

<title>htSMT Image Analysis</title>
<p>Image acquisition produced one JF<sub>549</sub> movie and one Hoechst per field of view. The JF<sub>549</sub> movie was used to track the motion of individual JF<sub>549</sub> molecules, while the Hoechst movie was used for nuclear segmentation. Tracking was accomplished in three sequential steps ‚Äì detection, subpixel localization, and linking ‚Äì using a combination of existing methods. Briefly, spots were detected using a generalized log likelihood ratio detector to test every 11√ó11 pixel window using a gaussian kernel with a radius of 1.25 pixels and with a log likelihood detection threshold 14<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. After detection, the estimated position of each emitter was refined to subpixel resolution using Levenberg-Marquardt fitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup> with an integrated 2D Gaussian spot model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> starting from an initial guess afforded by the radial symmetry method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Detected spots were linked into trajectories using a custom modification of a hill-climbing algorithm with a maximum linking radius of 1.25 ¬µm and allowing a maximum of 2 gap frames where a spot may go undetected but still be linked within the same trajectory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. The same detection, subpixel localization, and linking settings were used for all movies used in this manuscript.</p>
<p>For nuclear segmentation, all frames of the Hoechst movie were averaged to generate a mean projection. This mean projection was then segmented with a neural network trained on human-labeled nuclei, the output of which is a mask assigning a semantic category to each pixel in the image<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref></sup>. Each spot was assigned to at most one nucleus using its subpixel coordinates.</p>
<p>To recover dynamical information from trajectories, we used state arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, a Bayesian inference approach, with the ‚ÄúRBME‚Äù likelihood function and a grid of 100 diffusion coefficients from 0.01 to 100.0 ¬µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> and 31 localization error magnitudes from 0.02 to 0.08 ¬µm. For each assay well, 10,000 trajectories were randomly sampled from the aggregated pool of nuclear trajectories, and this set of trajectories was used for state inference. After inference, localization error was marginalized out to yield a one-dimensional distribution over the diffusion coefficient for each field of view. For single-cell analysis, we performed SMT and nuclear segmentation on a mixture of U2OS cells bearing H2B-HaloTag, HaloTag-CaaX, or free HaloTag. We then evaluated the marginal likelihood of each of a set of 100 diffusion coefficients on the set of trajectories within each segmented nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. These marginal likelihood functions were clustered with k-means (3 clusters), and the marginal likelihood functions for each cell were ordered by their cluster index to produce the heat map. To estimate the fraction bound (<italic>f</italic><sub>bound</sub>), we integrated the state array posterior distribution below 0.1 ¬µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. To estimate the free diffusion coefficient (<italic>D</italic><sub>free</sub>), we computed the mean of the posterior distribution above 0.1 ¬µm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> using the following equation:

<p>High content imaging approaches require image quanity control to systematically remove aberrant measurements from the set. Primarily these are fields of view that are empty, that are out of focus, or contain large piece of debris in the well or occlusion of the objective. To detect and remove these fields of view, we trained a convolutional neural network classifier to score Hoechst image quality on a scale of ‚àí1 to 1 (low quality to high quality). Annotations from five independent annotators on a training set of ‚àº1000 Hoechst images were used as input for the model.

<title>Sources of variability analysis</title>
<p>The contribution of microscope-to-microscope, plate-to-plate, well-to-well, FOV-to-FOV and cell-to-cell variability on the 2D jump distribution was estimated using a subsampling approach. We consider a simplified model where the observed jump length distribution (Y) is a function of the intrinsic stochasticity in jump length due to diffusion (X) with additional biases introduced at the cell, FOV, well, plate or microscope level:

<p>For simplicity the biases are assumed independent, although these biases may indeed have some dependence.</p>
<p>To estimate the variance of each bias term, we computed the variance in sample means for different resampling schemes. Firstly we sample N jumps from all data from one replicate of the bioactive screen and compute the average. The resulting sample mean is the average over all sources of variability (B<sub>microscope</sub>, etc.). In a second step, we sample a microscope and randomly sample all jumps from all plates on that microscope. This averages over all other sources of variability except B<sub>microscope</sub> can be expected to approach Var(B<sub>microscope</sub>) for large N. We continune this same sampling scheme at the Plate-, Well-, FOV- and cell-level, such that for large N results in estimated Var(B<sub>plate</sub>), Var(B<sub>well</sub>), Var(B<sub>FOV</sub>), and Var(B<sub>cell</sub>) respectively. 1000 rounds of sampling were performed for each resampling scheme, either including all wells or only those containing the vehicle DMSO.</p>

Image processing, including spot detection, localization, and track reconnection were performed using the same methods described above.

<p>The k<sub>slow</sub> term comprises both the rate of molecule unbinding (k<sub>off</sub>) as well as photobleaching (k<sub>bleach</sub>) and diffusion of chromatin out of the focal volume. Often approaches attempt to derive the unbinding rate by applying a correction such as subtracting a bleaching rate measured either directly in the sample or by using a separate control sample<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, where T<sub>corrected</sub> = (k<sub>off</sub>-k<sub>bleach</sub>)<sup>-1</sup>. The inverse relationship between T<sub>corrected</sub> and k<sub>bleach</sub> makes it highly sensitive and nonlinear to noise in k<sub>bleach</sub>. Because the 1-CDF distributions of compound-treated ER samples are so close in decay rate to the control Histone H2B, background subtraction yields unfeasible k<sub>off</sub> values after correction. Instead we report only the uncorrected k<sub>slow</sub> values with the understanding that these represent a lower-bound of the actual k<sub>off</sub>, but that within-experiment comparisons can be made between conditions.</p>

Immunofluorescent staining of ER was carried out using l1ER antibody (1:500, RM-9101) diluted in the same blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Extensive washing with PBS was performed prior to secondary antibody staining. Secondary antibody staining was carried out using Alexa fluor 488 conjugate anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000, Cat. No. A32731, thermos Fisher) for an hour. Nuclear staining was carried out using Hoechst 33342 solution at 1mg/ml. Imaging of immunofluorescence was done using the ImageXpress Micro (Molecular Devices) at 10x magnification and 4 field-of-view per well. Fluorescence intensity within the nucleus were quantified using CellProfiler<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. All analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Prism with DMSO as a baseline. ER degradation experiments were performed in three biological replicates with the same source compounds.</p>

<p>Cells were grown and seeded in conditions as described above. Cells were seeded in 384well plates (Cat. No. 353963, Corning) at 1000 cells per well for Halo-ER U2OS, 1200 cells for SKBR3 and 1800 cells for MCF7 and T47d. Cells were grown overnight, then treated with compounds the following day. Compound concentration and administration are the same as described previously for the immunofluorescence assay. Plates are scanned in the IncuCyte live cell analysis system (Sartorius) at 24-hour intervals for a total of 5 days using phase contrast. Cell proliferation quantification was carried out by the built-in analysis function using whole well confluency mask. All analysis and curve fitting were carried out using Prism with DMSO as a baseline. MCF7 and T47d cell proliferation experiments were performed in four biological replicates with the same source compounds.</p>

<p>This work presents an <bold>important</bold> technological advance, in the form of a high throughput platform for Single Particle Tracking allowing us to measure millions of cells and thousands of compounds per day. Analysis of the diffusional behaviour of fluorescently-tagged targets permits the identification of, and differentiation between, small molecules that bind directly or affect the target indirectly. The methodology and metrics employed are <bold>compelling</bold>, leading to the identification of multiple compounds that effectively change the diffusive state of the estrogen receptor, the POC target of the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set up a pipeline for automated high-through single-molecule fluorescence imaging (htSMT) in living cells and analysis of molecular dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>htSMT reveals information on the diffusion and bound fraction of molecules, dose-response curves, relative estimates on binding rates, and temporal changes of parameters. It enables the screening of thousands of compounds in a reasonable time and proves to be more sensitive and faster than classical cell-growth assays. If the function of a compound is coupled to the mobility of the protein of interest or affects an interaction partner, which modulates the mobility of the protein of interest, htSMT allows identifying the modulator and getting the first indication on the mechanism of action or interaction networks, which can be a starting point for more in-depth analysis. The authors describe their automated imaging and analysis procedures as well as the measures taken to assure data and analysis quality.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While elegantly showcasing the power of high-throughput measurements, htSMT relies on a sophisticated robot-based workflow and several microscopes for parallel imaging, thus limiting wide-spread application of htSMT by other scientists.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of their developed methodology, which utilizes super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule tracking in live cells on a high-throughput scale. Their study focuses on measuring the diffusion state of a molecule target, the estrogen receptor, in both ligand-bound and unbound forms in live cells. By showcasing the ability to screen 5067 compounds and measure the diffusive state of the estrogen receptor for each compound in live cells, they illustrate the capability and power of their methodology.</p>
<p>Readers are well introduced to the principles in the initial stages of the manuscript with highly convincing video examples. The methods and metrics used (fbound) are robust. The authors demonstrate high reproducibility of their screening method (R2=0.92). They also showcase the great sensitivity of their method in predicting the proliferation/viability state of cells (R2=0.84). The outcome of the screen is sound, with multiple compounds clustering identified in line with known estrogen receptor biology.</p>

<p>The following is the authors‚Äô response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors set up a pipeline for automated high-throughput single-molecule fluorescence imaging (htSMT) in living cells and analysis of molecular dynamics</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>htSMT reveals information on the diffusion and bound fraction of molecules, dose-response curves, relative estimates of binding rates, and temporal changes of parameters. It enables the screening of thousands of compounds in a reasonable time and proves to be more sensitive and faster than classical cell-growth assays. If the function of a compound is coupled to the mobility of the protein of interest, or affects an interaction partner, which modulates the mobility of the protein of interest, htSMT allows identifying the modulator and getting the first indication of the mechanism of action or interaction networks, which can be a starting point for more in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While elegantly showcasing the power of high-throughput measurements, the authors disclose little information on their microscope setup and analysis procedures. Thus, reproduction by other scientists is limited. Moreover, a critical discussion about the limits of the approach in determining dynamic parameters, the mechanism of action of compounds, and network reconstruction for the protein of interest is missing. In addition, automated imaging and analysis procedures require implementing sensitive measures to assure data and analysis quality, but a description of such measures is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer rightly highlights both the power and complexity in high throughput assay systems, and as such the authors have spent significant effort in first developing quality control checks to support screening. We discuss some of these as part of the description and characterization of the platform.  We added additional details into the manuscript to help clarify. The implementation of our workflow for image acquisition, processing and analysis relies heavily on the specifics of our lab hardware and software infrastructure. We have added additional details to the text, particularly in the Methods section, and believe we have added enough information that our results can be reproduced using the suite of tools that already exist for single molecule tracking.</p>
<p>The reviewer also points out that all assays have limitations, and these have not been clearly identified as part of our discussion of the htSMT platform. We have also added some comments on the limitations of the current system and our approach.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>McSwiggen et al present a high throughput platform for SPT that allows them to identify pharmaceutics interactions with the diffusional behavior of receptors and in turn to identify potent new ligands and cellular mechanisms. The manuscript is well written, it provides a solid new mentor and a proper experimental foundation</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The method capitalizes and extends to existing high throughput toolboxes and is directly applied to multiple receptors and ligands. The outcomes are important and relevant for society. 10^6 cells and &gt;400 ligands per is a significant achievement.</p>
<p>The method can detect functionally relevant changes in transcription factor dynamics and accurately differentiate the ligand/target specificity directly within the cellular environment. This will be instrumental in screening libraries of compounds to identify starting points for the development of new therapeutics. Identifying hitherto unknown networks of biochemical signaling pathways will propel the field of single-particle live cell and quantitative microscopy in the area of diagnostics. The manuscript is well-written and clearly conveys its message.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few elements, that if rectified would improve the claims of the manuscript.</p>
<p>The authors claim that they measure receptor dynamics. In essence, their readout is a variation in diffusional behavior that correlates to ligand binding. While ligand binding can result in altered dynamics or /and shift in conformational equilibrium, SPT is not recording directly protein structural dynamics, but their effect on diffusion. They should correct and elaborate on this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent clarifying question, and we have tried to make it more explicit in the text. The reviewer is absolutely correct; we‚Äôre not using SPT to directly measure protein structural dynamics, but rather the interactions a given protein makes with other macromolecules within the cell. So when an SHR binds to ligand it adopts conformations that promote association with DNA and other protein-protein interactions relevant to transcription. This is distinct from assays that directly measure conformational changes of the protein.</p>

<p>L 148 What do the authors mean 'No correlation between diffusion and monomeric protein size was observed, highlighting the differences between cellular protein dynamics versus purified systems'. This is not justified by data here or literature reference. How do the authors know these are individual molecules? Intensity distributions or single bleaching steps should be presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The point we were trying to make is that the relative molecular weights for the monomer protein (138 kDa for Halo-AR, 102 kDa for ER-Halo, 122 kDa for Halo-GR, and 135 kDa for Halo-PR) is uncorrelated with its apparent free diffusion coefficient. Were we to make this measurement on purified protein in buffer, where diffusion is well described by the Stokes Einstein equation, one would expect to see monomer size and diffusion related. We‚Äôve clarified this point in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Along the same lines, the data in Figs 2 and 4 show that not only the immobile fraction is increased but also that the diffusion coefficient of the fast-moving (attributed to free) is reduced. The authors mention this and show an extended Fig 5 but do not provide an explanation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an area where there is still more work to do in understanding the estrogen receptor and other SHRs. As the reviewer says, we see not only an increase in chromatin binding but also a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of the ‚Äúfree‚Äù population. A potential explanation is that this is a greater prevalence of freely-diffusing homodimers of the receptor, or other protein-protein interactions (14-3-3, P300, CBP, etc) that can occur after ligand binding. Nothing in our bioactive compound screen shed light on this in particular, and so we can only speculate and have refrained from drawing further conclusions in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How do potential transient ligand binding and the time-dependent heterogeneity in motion (see comment above) contribute to this? Also, in line 216 the authors write &quot;with no evidence&quot; of transient diffusive states. How do they define transient diffusive states? While there are toolboxes to directly extract the existence and abundance of these either by HMM analysis or temporal segmentation, the authors do not discuss or use them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Throughout the analysis in this work, we consider all of tracks with a 2-second FOV as representative of a single underlying population and have not looked at changes in dynamics within a single movie. As we show in the supplemental figures we added (see Figure 3, figure supplement 1), this appears to be a reasonable assumption, at least in the cases we‚Äôve encountered in this manuscript. For experiments involving changes in dynamics over time, these are experiments where we‚Äôve added compound simultaneous with imaging and collect many 2-second FOVs in sequence to monitor changes in ER dynamics. In this case when we refer to ‚Äútransient states,‚Äù we are pointing out that we don‚Äôt observe any new states in the State Array diagram that exist in early time points but disappear at later time point.</p>
<p>The reviewer suggests track-level analysis methods like hidden Markov models or variational Bayesian approaches which have been used previously in the single molecule community. These are very powerful techniques, provided the trajectories are long (typically 100s of frames). In the case of molecules that diffuse quickly and can diffuse out of the focal plane, we don‚Äôt have the luxury of such long trajectories. This was demonstrated previously (Hansen et al 2017, Heckert el al 2022) and so we‚Äôve adopted the State Array approach to inferring state occupations from short trajectories. As the reviewer rightly points out, this approach potentially loses information about state transitions or changes over time, but as of now we are not aware of any robust methods that work on short trajectories.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors discuss the methods for extracting kinetic information of ligand binding by diffusion. They should consider the temporal segmentation of heterogenous diffusion. There are numerous methods published in journals or BioRxiv based on analytical or deep learning tools to perform temporal segmentation. This could elevate their analysis of Kon and Koff.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We‚Äôre aware of a number of approaches for analyzing both high framerate SMT as well as long exposure residence time imaging. As we say above, we‚Äôre not aware of any methods that have been demonstrated to work robustly on short trajectories aside from the approaches we‚Äôve taken. Similarly, for residence time imaging there are published approaches, but we‚Äôre not aware of any that would offer new insight into the experiments in this study. If the reviewer has specific suggestions for analytical approaches that we‚Äôre not aware of we would happily consider them.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of their developed methodology, which utilizes super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule tracking in live cells on a high-throughput scale. Their study focuses on measuring the diffusion state of a molecule target, the estrogen receptor, in both ligand-bound and unbound forms in live cells. By showcasing the ability to screen 5067 compounds and measure the diffusive state of the estrogen receptor for each compound in live cells, they illustrate the capability and power of their methodology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Readers are well introduced to the principles in the initial stages of the manuscript with highly convincing video examples. The methods and metrics used (fbound) are robust. The authors demonstrate high reproducibility of their screening method (R2=0.92). They also showcase the great sensitivity of their method in predicting the proliferation/viability state of cells (R2=0.84). The outcome of the screen is sound, with multiple compounds clustering identified in line with known estrogen receptor biology.</p>

<list-item><p>Potential overstatement on the relationship of low diffusion state of ER bound to compound and chromatin state without any work on chromatin level.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers caution in over-interpreting the relationship between an increase in the slowest diffusing states that we observe by SMT and bona fide engagement with chromatin. In the case of the estrogen receptor there is strong precedent in the literature showing increases in chromatin binding and chromatin accessibility (as measured by ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq) upon treatment with either estradiol or SERM/Ds. Taken together with the RNA-seq, we felt it reasonable to assume all the trajectories with a diffusion coefficient less that 0.1 ¬µm2/sec were chromatin bound.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Most of the compounds we characterize in the manuscript have not previously been tested in an SMT assay, but many are known to functionally impact the ER or other SHRs based on other biochemical and functional assays. We have not described here any completely novel ER-interacting compounds, but to our knowledge this is the first systematic investigation of a protein showing that both direct and indirect perturbation can be inferred by observing the protein‚Äôs motion. Especially for the HSP90 inhibitors, the observation that inhibiting this complex would so dramatically increase ER chromatin-binding as opposed to increasing the speed of the free population is counterintuitive and novel.</p>

<p>The L30 promoter tends to produce fairly low expression levels. The same approach was used for all ectopic expression plasmids, and for the SHRs the expression levels were all comparable to endogenous levels. We have not checked this for H2B, Caax and free Halo but given that the necessary dye concentration to achieve similar spot densities is within a 10-fold range for all constructs, its reasonable to say that those clonal cell lines will also have modest Halotag expression.</p>

<p>The writing and presentation are coherent, concise, and easy to follow.</p>
<p>The authors should consider justifying the following:</p>
<p>Why is 1.5s imaging time selected? Topological and ligand variations may last significantly longer than this. The authors should present at least for one condition the same effect images for longer.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Related to the similar comment above, we added a figure examining the jump length distribution as a function of frame. Over the 6 seconds of data collection the jump length distribution is unchanged, suggesting it is reasonable to consider all the trajectories within an FOV as representative of the same underlying dynamical states.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors miss the k test or T test in their graphs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We chose to apply the Kurskal-Wallis test in the context of the bioactive screen to assess whether a grouping of compounds based on their presumed cellular target was significantly different from the control even when individual compounds might not by themselves raise to significance. In this case many of the pathway inhibitors are subtle and not necessarily obvious in their difference. In the other cases throughout the manuscript, whether two conditions are statistically distinguishable is rarely in question and of far less importance to the conclusions in the manuscript than the magnitude of the difference. We‚Äôve added statistical tests where appropriate.</p>

<p>Among minor issues:</p>
<p>In Figure 1B, if the authors could specify how they discriminate the specific cell lines from the mixed context, it would enhance clarity. Could they perform additional immunofluorescence to understand how the assignment is determined? Alternatively, could they also show the case with isolated cell lines in an unmixed context?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Immunofluorescence would be a challenge given that there is not a good epitope to distinguish the three ectopically-expressed genes from each other or from endogenous proteins in the case of H2B and CaaX. We are really reliant on the single cell dynamics to determine the likely cell identity. That said, we‚Äôve added graphs of a number of individual cell State Arrays from the same data graphed in 1A which support the notion that it‚Äôs reasonable to assume a cells identity given the observed dynamics.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Extended Figure 2F: possibly a CHip-Seq experiment would be more directly qualified to state the effect of ER ligand on ER ability to bind chromatin.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is true. Presumably ER that is competent at activating transcription of ER-responsive genes is also capable of binding DNA. ChIP would be the more direct measure, but would not address whether the protein was functional. We chose to balance these measuring these two aspects of ER biology by pairing dynamics with the end-point transcription readout.</p>
