<title>Summary</title><p>Small Ubiquitin-related modifiers of the SUMO family regulate thousands of proteins in eukaryotic cells. Many SUMO substrates, effectors and enzymes carry short motifs (SIMs) that mediate low affinity interactions with SUMO proteins. This raises the question how specificity is achieved in target selection, SUMO paralogue choice and SUMO-dependent interactions. A unique but poorly understood feature of SUMO proteins is their intrinsically disordered N-terminus. We reveal a function for N-termini of human, <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and yeast SUMO proteins as intramolecular inhibitors of SUMO-SIM interactions. Mutational analyses, NMR spectroscopy, and Molecular Dynamics simulations indicate that SUMO’s N-terminus can inhibit SIM binding by fast and fuzzy interactions with SUMO‘s core. Deletion of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> SUMO1 N-terminus leads to p53-dependent apoptosis during germline development, indicating an important role of SUMO’s N-termini in DNA damage repair. Our findings reveal a mechanism of disorder-based autoinhibition that contributes to the specificity of SUMOylation and SUMO-dependent interactions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>SUMOylation, the reversible attachment of small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO to target proteins, serves as a molecular switch that regulates protein functions. It is particularly important in pathways that contribute to chromatin organization and function including transcription, replication, DNA damage repair, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and chromosome segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. At least a thousand proteins are subject to this essential protein modification under physiological conditions, and many more in severe stress (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>). The mechanism of SUMOylation resembles that of Ubiquitylation: Isopeptide bond formation between the C-terminal di-glycine motif of SUMO and the ε-amino group of a lysine sidechain in target proteins is catalyzed by an enzymatic trio of the SUMO-specific E1 activating heterodimer Aos1/Uba2 (SAE1/SAE2), the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme Ubc9, and usually one of several SUMO E3 ligases. SUMO-specific isopeptidases reverse the modification. One striking difference to the Ubiquitin system is the small number of enzymes involved. Over 600 E3 ligases are known for Ubiquitylation but fewer than ten have been identified for SUMOylation, amongst them the Siz/PIAS RING E3 ligases, ZNF451, and the nucleoporin RanBP2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Similarly, nearly one hundred isopeptidases with specificity for Ubiquitin are known, yet only eight enzymes appear to act on mammalian SUMO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. On the other hand, many organisms have more than one SUMO protein: Whereas <italic>S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans</italic> harbor only one SUMO gene, the weed <italic>A. thaliana</italic> expresses 8 SUMO genes (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>) and the human genome encodes five SUMO paralogues, three of which are ubiquitously expressed, SUMO1 and the twins SUMO2 and SUMO3 (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>). SUMO2 and 3 are virtually identical but share only about 50% identity with SUMO1. The two classes of SUMO proteins differ in expression levels, response to cellular stress, and their ability to form SUMO chains (see below). Although many proteins can be modified <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells with all mature SUMO paralogues, a significant number of proteins is preferentially or exclusively modified with one or the other SUMO protein at endogenous expression levels in cells (e.g. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>How paralogue-specific modification and effector binding are brought about is only partially understood. Both events require SUMO-binding motifs (reviewed, e.g. in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. A SUMO-binding motif in the target may help to recruit the Ubc9 - SUMO thioester. If this motif prefers a specific SUMO paralogue, the target is also preferentially modified with this paralogue as in USP25 and BLM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. SUMO-binding motifs in downstream effectors help to recruit specific SUMOylated proteins. Examples are the recruitment of Srs2 to SUMOylated PCNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and the recruitment of the ubiquitin ligase RNF4 to polySUMOylated PML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To date, three different classes of SUMO-binding motifs have been identified, of which <underline>S</underline>UMO Interaction <underline>M</underline>otifs (SIMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> are the best studied. SIMs typically consist of a four amino acid patch with three hydrophobic residues, most commonly valine or isoleucine, and a variable at position 3 ([P/I/L/V/M]-[I/L/V/M]-x-[I/L/V/M]), followed by a stretch of negatively-charged amino acids and/or serine residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In some cases, the orientation of the SIM can be reversed. A distinct subclass of SIMs is characterized by a [V/I/L/F/Y]-[I/V]-D-L-T consensus motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. The hydrophobic amino acids in the core of SIMs insert as a β-strand into the hydrophobic groove formed by the β2-strand and the α1-helix of SUMO (SIM-binding groove)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. As is common for binding modules that recognize Ubiquitin or Ubls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, SUMO - SIM interactions are usually of low affinity (K<sub>D</sub> between 1 - 100 μM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Biological relevance comes about by combining multiple SIMs (as in RNF4), combining a SIM with a second interaction module specific for a given substrate (as is true for Srs2, which recognizes both SUMO and PCNA), or through posttranslational modifications in proximity to the SIM that increase the affinity for SUMO (e.g., phosphorylation in proximity to a SIM in PIAS1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>). How paralogue-specific interactions are established in SUMO - SIM interactions remains enigmatic. Most of the amino acids in the SIM-binding groove that contribute to SUMO - SIM interactions by NMR are conserved between SUMO1 and SUMO2/3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Initially it was proposed that a patch of negative amino acids adjacent to the SIM is required for SUMO1 - but dispensable for SUMO2/3 - interaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. However, USP25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and ATF7IP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> exhibit a high preference for SUMO2/3 despite a patch of negative amino acids adjacent to their SIM. Attempts to convert SUMO2/3 into a SUMO1 interacting protein by mutagenesis have thus far been unsuccessful (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>). A defining feature of SUMO proteins is the intrinsically disordered N-terminus, whose function is only partly understood. While N-termini of the SUMO2/3 family contain a SUMOylation consensus motif (ΨKxE, where Ψ is a bulky hydrophobic amino acid) used for SUMO chain formation, this motif is lacking in SUMO1 proteins. Here, we reveal an unexpected function for the intrinsically disordered N-termini as intramolecular inhibitors of SUMO - SIM interactions.</p>

<title>Intrinsically disordered N-termini of SUMO1 proteins inhibit protein interactions</title>
<p>All SUMO orthologs from yeast to human carry an intrinsically disordered N-terminal extension, typically in the range of 13 - 23 amino acids, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> for SUMO1 (adapted from <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>) and as indicated by boxed residues in the primary structures of the four SUMO proteins used in this study, human SUMO1, human SUMO2, <italic>C. elegans</italic> SMO-1, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Smt3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Previously, we had performed pull-down screens that allowed us to identify paralogue - specific SUMO- binding partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In these experiments, we also included a SUMO1 variant lacking the first 19 amino acids as we hypothesized that the N-terminus contributes to interactions. To our surprise, the contrary was the case - the pulldown with SUMO1ΔN19 yielded more proteins than the pull-down with SUMO1 (Fig. S1A + S1B). To test whether SUMO’s disordered N-terminus indeed prevents protein interactions, we conducted pull-down assays with validated binding partners and wild-type SUMO1, the N-terminally truncated variants SUMO1ΔN19 and SUMO1ΔN10, wild-type SUMO2, and SUMO2ΔN13 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> - F). All SUMO variants were untagged and immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose in random orientation. Binding partners included two proteins with preference for SUMO2/3, the canonical SIM-containing protein USP25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and TDP2, which has an unusual “split SIM”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, the SUMO1-specific SIM-containing RanBP2 fragment RanBP2ΔFG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> and Ubc9, which binds SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 via a region distinct from the SIM binding groove<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Indeed, deletion of the complete SUMO1 N-terminus dramatically increased interaction with USP25 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> + D). Similarly, interaction with TDP2 was enhanced when SUMO1‘s N-terminus was removed, while the interaction with Ubc9 was unaffected. Some increase was observed when half the SUMO1 N-terminus was deleted. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, deletion of SUMO1‘s N-terminus allowed USP25 to bind SUMO1 as efficiently as wt SUMO2. Importantly, deletion of SUMO2‘s N-terminus (ΔN13) did not increase binding any further, even for the SUMO1-specific RanBP2, suggesting that SUMO1’s - but not SUMO2‘s - N-terminus inhibits the interaction. To exclude artefacts due to the SUMO immobilization, we repeated pulldown experiments with C-terminally GST-tagged SUMO variants immobilized on Glutathione beads (Fig. S1C + S1D). Again, USP25 bound to ΔN19 SUMO1 as efficiently as to SUMO2, and much better than to SUMO1.</p>

<p>To address whether the inhibitory role of the unstructured N-terminus is a unique feature of mammalian SUMO1 or whether it may be conserved in evolution, we turned to yeast and <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The single yeast SUMO protein Smt3 shares about 45% sequence identity with both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3. Like SUMO2/3, it has SUMOylation consensus sites in its unstructured N-terminal region that are utilized for chain formation (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>). The single <italic>C. elegans</italic> SUMO protein SMO-1 shares about 67% sequence identity with SUMO1 and 48% identity with SUMO2/3. Intriguingly, its N-terminus contains no lysine residues and can thus not contribute to canonical SUMO chain formation. Deleting the N-terminus in Smt3 and SMO-1 enhanced the interaction with the SIM-containing SUMO E3 ligases <italic>S.c.</italic> Siz1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, and <italic>C.e.</italic> GEI-17<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref> + J), respectively. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of SUMO1’s N-terminus is indeed an evolutionarily conserved trait.</p>

<title>SUMO1’s disordered N-terminus interferes with SIM-dependent functions</title>
<p>One explanation for increased interaction upon deletion of SUMO1’s N-terminus is that the N-terminus occludes the SUMO1 SIM-binding groove. If so, its removal should lead both to enhanced non-covalent interaction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, C</xref>-F), and to enhanced SUMOylation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, G</xref>-L).</p>

<p>Indeed, a SIM-deficient USP25 (USP25 VI91,92AA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>) lost binding not only to SUMO2 but also to SUMO1 ΔN19 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref> + D), indicating that the interaction with truncated SUMO1 also depends on a bona fide SIM. Moreover, mutating two residues in SUMO1’s SIM-binding groove, Val38 and Lys39 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref> + F) led to a significant loss of interaction with USP25 and with RanBP2.</p>
<p>We next turned to SUMOylation. As reported previously, USP25 was SUMOylated more efficiently with SUMO2 compared to SUMO1. However, SUMO1ΔN19 can SUMOylate USP25 as efficiently as SUMO2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Consistent with binding assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>), N-terminal truncation of SUMO2 did not further enhance SUMOylation efficiency. As a control, we used the SIM-independent SUMO target RanGAP1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref>), which was equally modified with all SUMO1 and SUMO2 variants. Similar results were obtained when we compared <italic>C. elegans</italic> wild-type SMO-1 and SMO-1ΔN12 for their ability to modify our model human substrates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref> + J). In SUMOylation assays with USP25 SIM mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>) and with SUMO1ΔN19 variants that carried mutations in the SIM-binding groove (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L</xref>), SUMOylation of USP25 was abolished, indicating that the increase in SUMOylation upon deletion of SUMO1’s N-terminus depends on a SIM-dependent interaction.</p>
<p>Taken together, our findings indicate that SUMO1’s intrinsically disordered N-terminus inhibits both SIM-dependent interactions and SIM-mediated SUMOylation. This offers an unanticipated explanation for the apparent SUMO2 preference of SIM-dependent SUMO binding partners such as USP25.</p>

<title>NMR experiments indicate physical interaction between the N-terminus and the SIM-binding groove of SUMO1</title>
<p>To gain structural insights into the mechanism by which SUMO1’s N-terminus prevents SUMO - SIM interactions, we turned to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). To assess motions in the nanosecond/sub-nanosecond time regime, <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N-heteronuclear Nuclear Overhauser effect (hNOE) measurements were made on SUMO1. Residues 21-93 exhibit uniform positive hNOEs, characteristic of stable, globular domains and thus consistent with the known folded structure of the core (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). The C-terminal residues of SUMO1 have hNOEs near or below 0, a hallmark of highly flexible regions and consistent with the high degree of flexibility commonly observed in Ubl proteins near their C-terminal Gly-Gly motif<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Residues 4-20 in the N-terminus of SUMO1 displayed lower hNOE values than those of the folded core consistent with their being more flexible. However, while residues 5-9 showed large negative hNOEs consistent with high flexibility, residues 10-20 have hNOE values close to 0. This is suggestive of a split in the SUMO1 N-terminus into a highly flexible region (residues 5-9) and a region of intermediate flexibility (residues 10-20) whose dynamics are slower but not as slow as the folded core. Residue 4 has a hNOE value close to 0 hinting at slower dynamics in the very N-terminal part of the protein. Unfortunately, residues 1-3 were not available for hNOE analysis, so no conclusions can be drawn about this sub-region of the N-terminus. The slower-than-expected dynamics of residues 10-20 indicate that this region spends time associated with the structured core. We speculate that the interactions could occlude the SIM-binding groove of SUMO1.</p>

<p>To investigate this further, we compared HSQC-TROSY spectra of full-length SUMO1 and the ΔN19 variant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) to assess how the presence and absence of the N- terminus affects the structured core domain. Substantial chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were observed for peaks in the core domain (CSPs above the 80<sup>th</sup> percentile ranging from 0.032 to 0.119 ppm). If the N-terminus were flexible and structurally independent from the core domain, the spectra would be expected to be virtually identical. The CSPs appear as three clusters rather than randomly throughout the sequence: (1) residues 21-24 are directly adjacent to the flexible N-terminus and are thus expected to be affected when the latter is deleted, (2) residues 32-54 are in the SIM-binding groove, and (3) residues from the 70s to the 80s (dubbed here the “70/80 region”). Together with the hNOE results, the observations strongly suggest that the N-terminus interacts transiently with (at least) two specific regions of the core.</p>

<title>MD simulations provide insight into SUMO1 N-terminus - core interactions</title>
<p>Given the timescale of the motions of the SUMO1 N-terminus as determined by hNOE, we turned to all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to gain further insights into the molecular mechanism by which SUMO1’s N-terminus prevents SUMO - SIM interactions. For extensive sampling of the conformational space accessible to the disordered N-terminal region, we initiated the MD simulation with different orientations of the N-terminus from the NMR structure for SUMO1 (see methods, Table S1). We used an IDP-adequate force field, and the simulations were validated by monitoring the Cα root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of the SUMO core against the initial structures (&lt; 3 Å) (Fig. S2). In addition, chemical shifts back-calculated from MD simulations were in good accordance with the experimentally derived ones (Fig. S3).</p>
<p>In MD simulations, we observed the disordered N-terminus to interact reversibly with the SUMO core on the microsecond MD time scale, as measured by changes of the binding area between the N-terminus and the core (Fig. S4A + S4B and Table S1). The N-terminus of SUMO1 engaged with the core for about 65% of the simulation time resulting in an average minor shielding of the total core area of only 1.4% (Fig. S5A + S5B). Thus, the MD simulation, like the NMR experiments, points to a highly dynamic interaction of the SUMO1 N-terminus with the core. Moreover, MD simulations recapitulated findings by NMR by indicating that the SIM binding groove (residues His35, Lys37 and Lys39 primarily affected) and the 70/80 region are temporarily occupied by the SUMO1 N-terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that MD simulations are a suitable predictive <italic>in silico</italic> tool to study the N-terminus/core interaction further.</p>

<title>MD simulations reveal significant differences of N-termini - core interactions across SUMO proteins</title>
<p>We next performed similar simulations for SUMO2, SMO-1 and Smt3. Again, we observed transient interactions of disordered N-termini of these paralogues with their respective cores on the microsecond MD time scale (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D</xref> - G and S4C – S4E). However, comparison of all four SUMO proteins also revealed clear differences in average binding times and binding areas, with SMO-1 showing the longest binding time and largest binding area, followed by SUMO1, Smt3, and SUMO2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>, Fig. S5A – S5D and Table S1). The most striking differences exist for the interaction with the SIM-binding groove, while interactions with the 70/80 region are rather comparable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> - F, compare Fig. S5B and 3G). These observations are consistent with a role of SUMO1 N-termini as intramolecular inhibitors of SUMO - SIM interactions, and show that this inhibitory effect is evolutionarily conserved in animals. The N-terminus of yeast Smt3, which is evolutionarily neither a SUMO1 nor SUMO2 protein, shows an intermediate effect, while SUMO2’s N-terminus does not seem to inhibit SUMO - SIM interactions, all in congruence with our biochemical data (see Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p>

<title>Interaction between SUMO’s disordered N-termini and the SIM binding groove is highly dynamic</title>

Moreover, conformational adaption of the N-termini upon binding was very minor (Fig. S6B). We thus wanted to test if the lack of structure also entails fast binding and unbinding of the intrinsically disordered N-terminus to the SIM-binding groove. For this, we assumed a simple two-state model of bound and unbound states and determined the dwell times of all binding and unbinding events as measured by changes in binding area between the N-terminus of SUMO and the SIM binding groove (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref> and Fig. S5E). The off-rates k<sub>off</sub> for SUMO1, SUMO2, SMO-1, and yeast Smt3 range between 0.25 and 0.50 ns<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, thus are extremely high and hardly differ among the SUMOs. The on-rates vary by more than an order of magnitude, with the lowest on-rate for SUMO2 of 0.02 ns<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and the highest on-rate for SMO-1 at 0.3 ns<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.

<title>The SUMO1 N-terminus shields the SIM-binding groove via ionic interactions</title>
<p>To substantiate interpretations from the biochemical assays described above, we compared the HSQC-TROSY NMR spectrum of a <sup>15</sup>N-labeled SUMO1 ED11,12KK variant with that of wild-type SUMO1. Strikingly, there are large CSPs in the entire N-terminus and in the region of the core directly adjacent to the N-terminus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The N-terminal CSPs are more widespread than would be predicted for amino acid changes in an IDR, suggesting that the mutant N-terminus experiences a different chemical environment to the wild-type. There are small, yet notable CSPs in the SIM-binding groove. This finding confirms that the ED11,12KK mutations disrupt the interaction between the N-terminus and the SIM-binding groove and stem but appear to leave interactions with the 70/80 region largely untouched. Consistent with this notion, MD simulations of SUMO1 ED11,12KK reveal that the mutations significantly decrease interaction with the SIM-binding groove (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B - D</xref>).

<title>The inhibitory function of SUMO1’s N-terminus can be partially transplanted to SUMO2</title>

SIM-binding grooves are flanked by basic residues in all SUMO paralogues, raising the question of whether its effect could be transplanted onto SUMO2.

Intriguingly, a SUMO2 chimera with SUMO1’s N-terminus (S1<sub>N</sub>-S2<sub>C</sub>) showed reduced interaction. Moreover, a SUMO1 core that carries the SUMO2 N-terminus (S2<sub>N</sub>-S1<sub>C</sub>) bound USP25 more efficiently than wt SUMO1, albeit not as efficiently as SUMO2.

<title>Phosphorylation may regulate the inhibitory effect of SUMO’s intrinsically disordered N-termini</title>
<p>Based on the ionic nature of the interaction, it is conceivable that posttranslational modifications that add or remove charges may influence inhibition.

<p>For SUMO2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref> - F and S7F – S7J), MD simulations indicate a significant increase in the overall residence time on the SIM-binding groove upon phosphorylation of Thr12. Could the increased interaction of the N-terminus with the SIM-binding groove predicted by MD simulation lead to a reduction of SIM-dependent interactions? In the absence of quantitatively phosphorylated SUMO2, we turned to phospho-mimetic variants. Indeed, mutating Thr12 in SUMO2‘s N-terminus either to Asp or Glu significantly decreased the interaction of SUMO2 with USP25 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref> + H).

Its N-terminus is not only a strong inhibitor of SIM interactions (our findings described above), it is also devoid of lysines and can thus not contribute to canonical SUMO chain formation.</p>
<p>We created an in-frame deletion allele by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in <italic>C. elegans smo-1</italic> (<italic>smo-1(zh156)</italic>, referred to as SMO-1ΔN12), removing 11 amino acids at the N-terminus but leaving the start methionine. SMO-1ΔN12 animals were viable and displayed no obvious anatomical defects or embryonic lethality. However, SMO-1ΔN12 mutant hermaphrodites had a smaller brood size (i.e. the average number of progeny per animal) than wild-type controls suggesting a defect in germline development or oocyte fertilization (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> sumoylation pathway is important for germ cell development and specifically, for chromosome congression in germ cells at the pachytene stage of meiosis I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Whole-mount DAPI staining revealed that the gonads of SMO-1ΔN12 mutants contained a smaller pachytene region with fewer germ cell nuclei but a similar density of nuclei (i.e. number of nuclei per area) as wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A, C</xref> - E). This phenotype could be due to decreased germ cell proliferation or to increased germ cell apoptosis. Under physiological conditions, around half of the germ cells at the pachytene stage undergo apoptosis, and the rate of apoptosis can be further increased by introducing environmental stress such as DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. We therefore monitored germ cell apoptosis in SMO-1ΔN12 mutants. First, we examined the CED-1::GFP reporter, which outlines apoptotic corpses that are engulfed by the somatic sheath cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, and observed an increased number of CED-1::GFP corpses in adult SMO-1ΔN12 animals 24 and 48 hours post L4 stage despite the overall reduced number of pachytene cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref> + 7G). As a second assay, we performed live-staining with SYTO12, a dye that accumulates in germ cells undergoing apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Also SYTO12 staining revealed an elevated number of apoptotic germ cells in adult SMO-1ΔN12 mutants 29 hours post L4 stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). To determine whether the increased levels of apoptosis in the SMO-1ΔN12 mutant are due to elevated DNA damage, we used the <italic>cep-1(gk138)</italic> p53 loss-of-function allele, which causes resistance to DNA-damage-induced germ cell apoptosis.

<title>SUMO N-termini are Intrinsically <underline>D</underline>isordered <underline>R</underline>egions</title>
<p>Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDP/IDR) have been largely overlooked until the 1990s even though they constitute 40% of the proteome of eukaryotes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> and fulfill many important biological functions including signal transduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Both their mechanism of action and biological functions vary greatly. For example, IDP/IDRs may function as (auto)inhibitors of enzymes or act as assembly platforms for multi-subunit complexes (reviewed in <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>Unstructured N-terminal regions of 13 - 23 amino acids are a hallmark of all SUMO proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, Table S1). These feature the expected amino acid composition of IDRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, namely a relatively low content of hydrophobic amino acids along with a higher ratio of polar or charged amino acids (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> + 4B, and S6). The disordered and flexible nature of SUMO N-termini function has remained rather enigmatic. Some SUMO N-termini engage in chain formation (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>). Additionally, SUMO N-termini have been suggested to act as entropic bristles that may prevent aggregation, but SUMO aggregation has only been observed upon extended incubation at very high temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Here, we discovered a rapid nanosecond equilibrium between “open” SUMO conformations available for interactions with SIMs and “closed” ones that are cis-inhibited by the N-terminal region. The N-terminal region remains fully disordered in the bound state and is thus a classic example of intrinsic disorder irrespective of the binding state.</p>

<title>SUMO N-termini form fuzzy complexes with SUMOs’ SIM binding grooves</title>
<p>How specificity is achieved by an IDR at the molecular level is an important question. Upon binding to their biological partners, IDRs often undergo a conformational transition to a folded state, also referred to as coupled binding and folding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. A well-known example is the cell cycle inhibitor p27, which folds around cyclin / Cdk complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, increasing evidence demonstrates that at least some IDRs remain unstructured upon interaction with partners, which is referred to as formation of a “fuzzy complex”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Interactions in such a complex are mediated by transient hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions in the fuzzy region, which can provide non-specific contacts or specific interactions with multiple motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Examples include the fuzzy complex of transcriptional activator Gcn4 and its partner Gal11/Med15<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>, ultrafast interaction between FG-repeat containing nucleoporins and nuclear transport receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, or the fuzzy intramolecular binding between the IDR and folded domain of Src kinase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> or galectin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.The interaction mode of SUMOs’ N-termini with the SUMO core is in line with the fuzzy complex model. First, we observed a very fast (ns) rate of the binding / unbinding process, and secondly, the bound state of the SUMO N-terminus and the SUMO core is transient and dynamic. Although the N-terminus hovers specifically over the SIM binding groove, it does not assume a specific stable configuration but rather forms a “ligand cloud” (Fig. S6B)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Despite this fuzzy nature, the N-terminus can compete efficiently with SIM-containing proteins for the SIM binding groove.</p>

<title>SUMO N-termini are cis-inhibitors of SIM-dependent interactions</title>
<p>The N-termini of recombinant SUMO1, SMO-1 and Smt3 act as inhibitors of SIM dependent interactions (this study, <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>), and potentially also of interactions with other SUMO surfaces, namely the 70/80 region. Inhibition via a module within the same protein (cis-inhibition) plays an important role in regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. IDRs are frequently involved in cis-inhibition, possibly as a way to economize genome/protein resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. A consequential benefit of this mechanism is the ease of regulation via posttranslational modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. This is likely the case for SUMOs‘ N-termini because the interaction of SUMOs‘ IDRs with the SIM-binding grooves is largely mediated by electrostatics, which may be strengthened or weakened by a host of posttranslational modifications that are emerging for SUMO proteins both in the IDR (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> or flanking the SIM binding groove<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Here we provide the first evidence for this idea from MD simulations and pulldown assays (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> and Fig. S7). An important implication from our analyses is that the SUMO2 N-terminus may become a cis-inhibitor upon phosphorylation of Thr12.</p>

<title>SUMO N-termini add control to SIM-dependent interactions</title>
<p>SIM-dependent interactions contribute to all aspects of the SUMO pathway yet how specificity can be ensured with a single SUMO binding module is still unclear. Increasing evidence suggests regulation of SUMO - SIM interactions at multiple levels. For example, acetylation of lysine residues surrounding the SIM binding groove can alter the affinity for specific binding partners (see, e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>), while phosphorylation of residues in a given SIM may increase the affinity for SUMO and change SUMO paralogue preferences (e.g., <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>). Our findings add yet another layer of regulation: whether SUMO on a given target is available for interaction with a downstream effector can be controlled via SUMO‘s intrinsically disordered N-terminus (model in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). Our analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) suggests that this N-terminal function is particularly important in DNA damage response, a pathway that is strongly dependent on the SUMO system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. Taken together, our findings offer an intriguing explanation for the presence and strict evolutionary conservation of SUMOs’ intrinsically disordered N-termini: they seem to equip SUMO with an environment-sensing and regulatory capacity of SIM-dependent processes including SIM-dependent modification and downstream effector binding.</p>

<title>Limitations of the study</title>
<p>Here we assigned an important function to SUMO1 and Smo-1 N-termini as inhibitors of SUMO-dependent interactions, and provide an explanation for paralogue preferences of SUMO targets such as USP25. An exciting question that we discuss is whether the inhibitory potential of different SUMO - N-termini can be tuned by posttranslational modifications of the N-termini or the SUMO core (model in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6I</xref>). While our MD simulations and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with selected mutants point in this direction, we have not been able to generate quantitatively acetylated and/or phosphorylated SUMO variants to test this hypothesis. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> allows to conclude that the SUMO1 N-terminus has indeed an important role beyond canonical chain formation. To provide further evidence that this <italic>in vivo</italic> function is indeed linked to its inhibition of the SIM - binding groove, the next important step will be to identify the relevant SUMO-dependent binding partner(s).</p>

After the minimization, the system was equilibrated in the NVT ensemble for 200 ps with all heavy atom position-restrained with a force constant of 239 kcal/mol. The temperature was maintained at 310 K using a V-rescale thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. Further equilibration was conducted in the NPT ensemble with all heavy atoms position-restrained for 200 ps and Cα atoms position-restrained for 1 ns, where the pressure was maintained at 1 atmosphere using a Parrinello-Rahamn barostat with the coupling constant set to 2.0 ps.</p>

<title>Analyses of molecular dynamics simulation</title>
<p>The change of solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was used to quantify the binding and unbinding process between the N-terminus and the SUMO SIM binding groove or the complete SUMO core (Fig. S3 and S9). In case of the SIM binding groove, the ‘unbound’ state includes all conformations with the N-termini not interacting with the SUMO core and interacting with the core outside of the SIM-binding motif. Kinetic rate constants were obtained by fitting the integrated dwell binding/unbinding times. Six residues in the N-terminus adjacent to the SUMO core were not included for calculating the contact area between the N-terminus and the SUMO core or the SIM binding groove, respectively, to leave enough space (about 2 nm) for the SASA calculation probe (radius of the probe is 0.14 nm) (Fig. S3A). A threshold (0.3 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>) was used in binding event determinations with the SUMO core or the SIM binding groove. The percentage of binding time of the N-terminus with the SIM binding groove or the SUMO core was calculated as the ratio of MD snapshots with binding areas (ΔSASA) larger than 0.3 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> along MD simulations.

<p>This work demonstrates an <bold>important</bold> regulatory role of the N-terminal disordered tail of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins, which modulates the function of a variety of proteins in eukaryotic cells. The authors present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the N-terminal region of SUMO inhibits its own interaction with downstream effector proteins and SUMOylation targets.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>SUMO proteins are processed and then conjugated to other proteins via a C-terminal di-glycine motif. In contrast, the N-terminus of some SUMO proteins (SUMO2/3) contains lysine residues that are important for the formation of SUMO chains. Using NMR studies, the N-terminus of SUMO was previously reported to be flexible (Bayer et al., 1998). The authors are investigating the role of the flexible (referred to as intrinsically disordered) N-terminus of several SUMO proteins. They report their findings and modeling data that this intrinsically disordered N-terminus of SUMO1 (and the C. elegans Smo1) regulates the interaction of SUMO with SUMO interacting motifs (SIMs).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Among the strongest experimental data suggesting that the N-terminus plays an inhibitory function are their observations that</p>
<p>
(1) SUMO1∆N19 binds more efficiently to SIM-containing Usp25, Tdp2, and RanBp2,</p>
<p>
(2) SUMO1∆N19 shows improved sumoylation of Usp25,</p>
<p>
(3) changing negatively-charged residues, ED11,12KK in the SUMO1 N-terminus increased the interaction and sumoylation with/of USP25.</p>
<p>The paper is very well-organized, clearly written, and the experimental data are of high quality. There is good evidence that the N-terminus of SUMO1 plays a role in regulating its binding and conjugation to SIM-containing proteins. Therefore, the authors are presenting a new twist in the ever-evolving saga of SUMO, SIMs, and sumoylation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Much has been learned about SUMO through structure-function analyses and this study is another excellent example. I would like to suggest that the authors take some extra time to place their findings into the context of previous SUMO structure-function analyses. Furthermore, it would be fitting to place their finding of a potential role of N-terminally truncated Smo1 into the context of the many prior findings that have been made with regard to the C. elegans SUMO field. Finally, regarding their data modeling/simulation, there are questions regarding the data comparisons and whether manipulations of the N-terminus also have an effect on the 70/80 region of the core.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This very interesting study originated from a serendipitous observation that the deletion of the disordered N-terminal tail of human SUMO1 enhances its binding to its interaction partners. This suggested that the N terminus of SUMO1 might be an intrinsic competitive inhibitor of SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) binding to SUMO1. Subsequent experiments support this mechanism, showing that in humans it is specific to SUMO1 and does not extend to SUMO2 or SUMO3 (except, perhaps, when the N terminus of SUMO2 becomes phosphorylated, as the authors intriguingly suggest - and partially demonstrate). The auto-inhibition of SUMO1 via its N-terminal tail apparently explains the lower binding of SUMO1 compared to SUMO2 to some SIMs and lower SIM-dependent SUMOylation of some substrates with SUMO1 compared to SUMO2, thus adding an important element to the puzzle of SUMO paralogue preference. In line with this explanation, N-terminally truncated SUMO1 was equally efficient to SUMO2 in the studied cases. The inhibitory role of SUMO1's N terminus appears conserved in other species including S. cerevisiae and C. elegans, both of which contain only one SUMO. The study also elucidates the molecular mechanism by which the disordered N-terminal region of SUMO1 can exert this auto-inhibitory effect. This appears to depend on the transient, very highly dynamic physical interaction between the N terminus and the surroundings of the SIM-binding groove based mostly on electrostatic interactions between acidic residues in the N terminus and basic residues around the groove.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key strength of this study is the interplay of different techniques, including biochemical experiments, NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and, at the end, in vivo experiments. The experiments performed with these different techniques inform each other in a productive way and strengthen each others' conclusions. A further strength is the detailed and clear text, which patiently introduces, describes, and discusses the study. Finally, in terms of the message, the study has a clear, mechanistic message of fundamental importance for various aspects of the SUMO field, and also more generally for protein biochemists interested in the functional importance of intrinsically disordered regions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the authors' conclusions are similar to those from a recent study by Lussier-Price et al. (NAR, 2022), the two studies likely representing independent inquiries into a similar topic. I don't see it as a weakness by itself (on the contrary), but it seems like a lost opportunity not to discuss at more length the congruence between these two studies in the discussion (Lussier-Price is only very briefly cited). Another point that can be raised concerns the wording of conclusions from molecular dynamics. The use of molecular dynamics simulations in this study has been rigorous and fruitful - indeed, it can be a model for such studies. Nonetheless, parameters derived from molecular dynamics simulations, including kon and koff values, could be more clearly described as coming from simulations and not experiments. Lastly, some of the conclusions - such as enhanced binding to SIM-containing proteins upon N-terminal deletion - could be additionally addressed with a biophysical technique (e.g. ITC) that is more quantitative than gel-based pull-down assays - but I don't think it is a must.</p>
