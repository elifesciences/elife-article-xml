<title>Abstract</title>
<p>T cells are crucial for efficient antigen-specific immune responses and thus their migration within the body, to inflamed tissues from circulating blood or to secondary lymphoid organs, play a very critical role. T cell extravasation in inflamed tissues depends on chemotactic cues and interaction between endothelial adhesion molecules and cellular integrins. A migrating T cell is expected to sense diverse external and membrane-intrinsic mechano-physical cues, but molecular mechanisms of such mechanosensing in cell migration are not established. We explored if the professional mechanosensor Piezo1 play any role during integrin-dependent chemotaxis of human T cells. We found that deficiency of Piezo1 in human T cells interfered with integrin-dependent cellular motility on ICAM-1-coated surface. Piezo1 recruitment at the leading edge of moving T cells is dependent on and follows focal adhesion formation at the leading edge and local increase in membrane tension on chemokine receptor activation. Piezo1 recruitment and activation, followed by calcium influx and calpain activation, in turn are crucial for the integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) recruitment at the leading edge of the chemotactic human T cells. Thus, we find that Piezo1 activation in response to local mechanical cues constitutes a membrane-intrinsic component of the ‘outside-in’ signaling in human T cells, migrating in response to chemokines, that mediates integrin recruitment to the leading edge.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Efficient T cell migration from blood circulation to secondary lymphoid organs and inflamed tissue is paramount for optimal tissue antigen sampling and effector functions during adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). The process is dependent on chemotactic cues, interaction between endothelial adhesion molecules and T cell integrins, and an intricate acto-myosin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Generation of mechanical force is critical to propel migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Mechanosensing of the substrate and increase in cellular membrane tension is also intuitively apparent in a migrating T cell, although mechanistic details are not explored to a great extent.</p>
<p>Piezo1 and Piezo2 ion channels are evolutionarily conserved professional mechanosensors that can sense increase in membrane tension mostly independent of other protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Mechanosensing by Piezo1 has been demonstrated to play critical role in diverse patho-physiologic contexts given its wide tissue expression including the immunocellular compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). We previously identified crucial role of this specialized mechanotransducer in optimal TCR triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). The immunocellular expression of Piezo1 thus makes it a strong candidate for mechanosensing at the plasma membrane to regulate motility of immune cells. Piezo1 shows differential involvement in cellular migration depending on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Previous studies point to the possibility of a role of Piezo1 in confinement sensing and integrin activation in moving cells, while it deters integrin-independent cell motility, usually referred to as amoeboid movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we aimed at exploring if Piezo1 mechanosensing plays any role during integrin-dependent chemotactic migration of human T cell migration, a patho-physiologically critical event in an ongoing immune response as well as in the steady-state. We found that deficiency of Piezo1 expression in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as Jurkat T cells interfered with efficient integrin-dependent cellular motility in response to a chemotactic cue. We also found that Piezo1 activation constitutes a hitherto unknown membrane-intrinsic component of the ‘outside-in’ signaling in human T cells in response to chemokine receptor activation, that follows activation of focal adhesion kinase leading to local increase in membrane tension and mediates local recruitment of integrin molecules at the leading edge of the moving human T cells.</p>

<title>Piezo1 deficiency abrogates integrin-dependent chemotactic motility in human T cells</title>
<p>We first assessed the role of Piezo1 on integrin-dependent, non-directional motility of primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We used GFP plasmid and Piezo1 siRNA co-transfected cells to facilitate distinction between potentially transfected and untransfected cells during cell tracking. We compared the motility of GFP<sup>+</sup> T cells (presuming they had a good transfection efficiency and thus will also have the siRNA) with the GFP<sup>-</sup> T cells in the same culture. This was confirmed by flow cytometric assessment of Piezo1 protein content on the T cell surface as well as the whole T cells (Supplemental figures 1B, C). Piezo1 deficiency in T cells (potentially GFP<sup>+</sup>) significantly hindered their migration in response to CCL19 in terms of its mean-squared displacement (MSD, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). Representative cell tracks of Piezo1 deficient (GFP<sup>+</sup>) and control (GFP<sup>-</sup>) are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, supplementary figure 1D and supplemental video 1. These results were further confirmed in a separate experiment where Piezo1 KD cells showed significant reduction in motility compared to control siRNA-transfected cells (Supplementary figure 1E).</p>

Piezo1 inhibition with GsMTx4 also led to significant impairment of transwell chemotaxis (Supplementary figure 1F).</p>

<title>Redistribution of Piezo1 toward the leading edge of migrating T cells in response to chemotactic cue</title>
<p>Cell polarity is a crucial aspect of directional cell motility in response to chemokines. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells seeded on ICAM-1 bed showed striking polarity in Piezo1 distribution, upon stimulation with CCL19 for 15 minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F, G</xref>; Supplemental video 2). Piezo1 m-Cherry expressing Jurkat T cells also showed striking leading edge polarity in the presence of SDF1α under ICAM1 adhesion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). In <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>, particle image velocimetry (PIV) analysis of a single representative Jurkat cell has been shown to display the dynamically polarized Piezo1 fluorescence upon SDF1α treatment with time, as opposed to rather uniformly distributed Piezo1 signals in a representative untreated cell. The continuous redistribution of Piezo1 within the motile T cells towards the leading edge can also be appreciated in the representative moving image provided (Supplemental video 3).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Piezo1 redistribution in migrating T cells follow increased membrane tension in the leading edge</title>
<p>Piezo1 is a professional mechanosensor ion channel, which senses increase in plasma membrane tension and responds by driving calcium influx into the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). As T cells migrate on substrate by extending membrane processes, it is intuitive to hypothesize that a component of mechanosensing is incorporated in the mechanism of cellular movement. The data above, on a critical role of Piezo1 in migrating human T cells, also led us to hypothesize that Piezo1 mechanosensors may play a role in sensing mechanical cues in a moving T cell. So, first we aimed at confirming that there is polarized increase in tension in the leading edge plasma membrane of human T cells, moving in response to a chemotactic cue.</p>
<p>Cellular membrane tension can be measured by various techniques. However, most of the usual techniques, viz. atomic force microscopy or tension measurement using optical tweezers, are invasive and interfere with the membrane dynamics, as well as are difficult to employ on moving cells. We utilized the non-invasive technique of interference reflection microscopy or IRM for studying potential redistribution of membrane tension following chemokine stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). In IRM technique, steady-state local fluctuations in the plasma membrane is imaged in cells adhered to a glass coverslip. The interference patterns generated due to continuously changing local distance between the coverslip and the plasma membrane are computed to derive the magnitude of local tension in the membrane – lower temporal fluctuations represent an increase in membrane tension (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure. 2A</xref>). After baseline imaging, Piezo1-GFP expressing Jurkat cells were subjected to sequential fluorescence and IRM imaging post SDF1α addition which was followed over time. Chemokine administration to Jurkat T cells led to a decrease in temporal fluctuations and an increase in membrane tension when computed for the whole cellular contour (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The increase in membrane tension was registered within few minutes after chemokine addition and gradually declined over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Distribution of tension and fluctuation-amplitude in cells was also affected by the action of chemokine (Supplemental figure 2A) which was accompanied by increase in the membrane’s degree of confinement and the effective viscosity experienced (Supplemental figure 2C &amp; D). Moreover, the tension maps showed that the lamellipodial structures towards the leading edges of the cells had higher tension magnitudes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, Supplemental figure 2B). These high-tension edges are usually further emphasized at later time-points.</p>

</fig>
<p>Finally, we explored if local membrane tension increase was linked to Piezo1 redistribution in the chemokine-experienced T cells. Of note here, during acquisition, there is typically a time delay of 1 minute between measurement of tension and Piezo1-GFP fluorescence. As expected, average tension peaked within the first few minutes of chemokine addition, followed by partial decline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) as seen for the whole cell. Pixel count of Piezo1-GFP intensity showed a similar pattern, albeit, at a delayed time, following the tension kinetics. In order to account for the delayed kinetics of tension magnitude and Piezo1-GFP pixel count, we performed a correlation between normalised Piezo1 pixel intensity at a particular time-frame, with normalised tension magnitude at the preceding time frame. We observed significant positive correlation between the two parameters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Thus, IRM-coupled fluorescence microscopy revealed an increase in local membrane tension in the leading edge of the moving T cells in response to chemokine receptor activation that was associated with Piezo1 redistribution to the leading edges of the cells.</p>

<title>Focal adhesion following chemokine receptor activation does not depend on Piezo1</title>
<p>Focal adhesion formation is a critical step in cellular migration and activated phosphorylated focal adhesion kinases link extracellular physical cues to the cytoskeletal actomyosin scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Chemokine signaling induces phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and membrane recruitment of the FAK complex forming focal adhesions with the extracellular substrate. FAK recruits adapter proteins like paxillin to anchor with the local sub-membrane cytoskeleton made by de novo F-actin polymerization. Membrane-recruited FAK complexes anchored to cytoskeleton increases local membrane tension as well as recruit integrins to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). This so-called ‘outside-in’ signaling, whereby membrane recruitment of integrins (e.g.; LFA1 in T cells) is initiated, is followed by integrin signaling (‘inside-out’ signaling) driven primarily by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-driven phosphorylation of Akt and downstream activation of Rho GTPases which in turn drive extensive F-actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Retrograde flow of the F-actin to the rear end of the moving cells, through myosin-based contractions, generates the propelling force for cells to move forward following the chemokine gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Finding a critical role of Piezo1 in human T cell migration and a membrane tension-dependent redistribution of Piezo1 to the leading edge of the moving cells led us explore if FAK recruitment to the leading edge in response to chemokine stimulation was dependent on Piezo1. While phosphorylated FAK (pFAK) showed striking polarity upon CCL19 stimulation on ICAM-1 beds (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, B</xref>, Supplementary video 4), Piezo1 knockdown did not have any effect on pFAK polarity under the same conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref>). We observed similar results upon examining distribution of paxillin which is another critical component of focal adhesions. Paxillin showed increased polarity upon CCL19 stimulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E, F</xref>) and its polarity remained unaffected upon Piezo1 KD (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G, H</xref>). We also did not observe any changes in pFAK and paxillin signal intensity upon Piezo1 knockdown in CCL19-stimulated cells (Supplementary figure 3A, B, respectively). However, pFAK showed striking co-localization with Piezo1 upon CCL19 stimulation (Supplementary figure 3C). Thus, focal adhesion formation following chemokine receptor activation was not dependent on Piezo1. FAK activation recruits adapters like paxillin and vinculin connecting the cortical cytoskeleton to the membrane and the extracellular matrix, thereby increasing local membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Inhibition of FAK activation completely abrogated Piezo1 redistribution to the leading edge, hence the polarity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I, J</xref>). This indicated that mechanistically, FAK activation event precedes Piezo1 redistribution to the leading edge of the migrating human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

<title>Membrane recruitment of LFA1 on chemokine receptor activation disrupts with Piezo1 deficiency</title>
<p>Integrin recruitment to the leading edge occurs downstream of FAK activation and local F-actin polymerization. As expected, CCL19 stimulation led to LFA1 recruitment to the leading edge upon CCL19 stimulation on ICAM1 bed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>; Supplemental video 5). Moreover, Piezo1 and LFA1 (CD11a) exhibited significant colocalization upon chemokine stimulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Piezo1 downregulation abrogated LFA-1 polarity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D, E</xref>; Supplemental videos 6, 7). Thus, role of Piezo1 in chemotactic migration of T cells was downstream of FAK assembly in response to chemokine receptor signaling, but preceded integrins recruitment. These data together point to a mechanism whereby local increase in membrane tension leading from FAK activation and assembly drives Piezo1 activation, which in turn is linked to LFA1 recruitment to the focal adhesions.</p>

<p>To further confirm this critical role of Piezo1 on LFA1 recruitment, we looked at the major signaling event downstream of LFA1 recruitment to the leading edge, i.e., phosphorylation of Akt downstream of PI3K activation, which in turn is triggered upon integrin activation. On treatment with CCL19, human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells moving on ICAM-1-coated plates did show a prominent leading-edge polarity of non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, control panel). But in Piezo1-deficient cells the polarity of pAkt is abrogated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>), not affecting the polarity of non-phosphorylated AKT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; Supplemental videos 8, 9), substantiating the cellular signaling defect due to non-recruitment of LFA1 to the leading edge membrane.</p>

<title>Piezo1 deficiency disrupts F-actin retrograde flow in T cells despite chemokine receptor activation</title>
<p>Piezo1-mediated sensing of membrane tension drives calcium ion influx, which in turn has been shown to activate calpain and F-actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). LFA1 recruitment is driven by local actin scaffold formation following FAK assembly, which as our data indicates is perhaps contributed by consolidation local actin scaffold downstream of Piezo1 activation. To confirm this, we performed Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in Piezo1-mCherry transfected Jurkat Cells using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope in response to chemokine. We found significant colocalization of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal with the Piezo1 signal on the chemokine treated Jurkat cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A, B</xref>; Supplemental figure 4A, B). Next to confirm that activation of calpain mediates the Piezo1 function, we observed that prior inhibition with calpain inhibitor PD150606 abrogated CCL19-induced LFA1 recruitment to the leading edge of the T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, D</xref>).

<p>While F-actin polymerization downstream of FAK is required for LFA1 recruitment, LFA1 in turn drives a more robust F-actin polymerization at the leading edge, through Akt/Rho GTPase activation. Leading edge F-actin undergoes retrograde flow due to myosin contractions, thereby enabling cells to move forward. Thus, both at the leading edge lamellipodia and the rear edge F-actin redistribution can be documented in a motile cell. We observed focal co-localization of LFA1 with F-actin at the leading edge, along with a denser actin-rich protrusion in the rear edge or the uropod (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), which was abolished upon calpain inhibition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C, E</xref>). Hence, LFA1 recruitment may depend on local F-actin polarization downstream of Piezo1 activation. On the other hand, failure of LFA1 recruitment and activation halts further F-actin polarization feeding the retrograde flow of actin during migration.</p>
<p>Dichotomy of Piezo1 (dense leading edge distribution) and F-actin (more dense at the rear end) distribution was clearly demonstrated in cells stimulated with chemokine (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and Supplemental video 10). But, no F-actin polarity was seen on downregulating Piezo1 in the T cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B, C</xref>; Supplemental videos 11, 12). Live cell imaging of Jurkat T cells expressing Piezo1-mCherry and actin-GFP on ICAM-1 coated dishes was performed in the presence or absence of SDF1α (Supplemental figure 5A). Chemokine addition showed significant increase in Piezo1 polarity to the front end, as shown in the earlier experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>, Supplemental figure 5B, left) upon chemokine stimulation when compared to untreated cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, Supplemental figure 5B, left).

<p>Proposed model suggests chemokine receptor activation in human T cells lead to focal adhesion kinase activation and focal adhesion formation. Focal adhesions lead to localized increase in membrane tension at the leading edge plasma membrane which leads to Piezo1 recruitment and activation. Piezo1 activation leads to calpain activation which potentially drives further cytoskeletal consolidation to recruit integrin LFA1.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study explored the role of membrane-intrinsic tension generation and the crucial role of sensing this physical cue in the context of human T cell migration in response to chemokine receptor activation. Deficiency of Piezo1 inhibited integrin-dependent migration, demonstrating crucial role of these mechanosensors in this mode of T cell migration. As the integrin-dependent chemotactic migration of T cells is a critically implicated in most patho-physiologic contexts, in the present study we focused on the potential role of Piezo1 mechanosensors in this specific context.</p>
<p>Notably, a previous study in vivo in mice, using genetic deletion of Piezo1 in T cells, reported no significant effect on tissue recruitment of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Although a functional redundancy in the role of Piezo1-mediated mechanosensing in mouse T cells warrants exclusion, especially in case of gene deletion in developing T cells, given the considerable expression of Piezo2 as well in mouse T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). On the other hand, a role of Piezo1 activation in fibroblastic reticular cells in Peyer’s patches has been shown to regulate lymphocyte migration through tissue conduits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). The different tissue distribution of Piezo1 and Piezo2 expression in humans warranted exploring the role of Piezo1 in migrating human T cells, as in humans Piezo2 is hardly expressed in the hematopoietic cells.</p>
<p>Non-invasive interference reflection microscopy allowed us to demonstrate dynamic change in membrane tension at the leading edge of T cells stimulated with chemokine on ICAM1-bed which was closely followed by dynamic recruitment Piezo1 locally. Chemokine receptor activation leads to focal adhesion formation at the leading edge of the migrating T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). Our experiments revealed that Piezo1 recruitment at the leading edge of the cells followed focal adhesion kinase activation. Focal adhesions do increase local membrane tension as they connect the extracellular environment with the cortical cytoskeleton of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Piezo1 recruitment locally seems to be a response to this membrane tension increase at focal adhesions. Piezo1 recruitment to focal adhesions was also shown to play a role in enhancing glioblastoma aggression by activating integrin-FAK signalling upstream of ECM remodelling and tissue stiffening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). Interestingly, recent study by Yao et. al., showed that Piezo1 is required for formation of mature focal adhesions. Piezo1 binds to matrix adhesion regions in a force-dependent manner via a linker domain and this binding is abrogated in cancer cells causing transformation to malignant phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>).</p>
<p>‘Outside-in’ signaling downstream of focal adhesion formation recruits integrins to the leading edge of the moving T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) which was abrogated by Piezo1 downregulation. Piezo1 has been shown to drive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the T cells leading to calpain activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). As expected, calpain inhibition also interfered with leading edge recruitment of the integrin LFA-1. Plausibly calpain activation drives local F-actin polymerization at the leading edge facilitating LFA-1 recruitment. This was also supported by loss of polarity of AKT phosphorylation with Piezo1 deficiency, which is known to be the major downstream signaling module that succeeds LFA-1 recruitment and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). These dysregulations in turn abrogates the retrograde flow of actin in the moving cell that is essential for forward propulsion of the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). Of note here, a role of ER-resident Piezo1, in driving R-RAS-driven activation of integrins, which was again dependent on calpain activation, was reported even before the mechanosensing function of Piezo1 was established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the present study reports a hitherto unexplored role of the professional mechanosensor Piezo1 in integrin dependent chemotactic movement of human T cells. In the cascade of leading edge events in a moving human T cell, following chemokine receptor activation and eventually leading to the retrograde flow of actin, focal adhesion formation precedes Piezo1 activation, while LFA-1 recruitment is dependent on Piezo1 function.</p>

<p>An inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) with 60x 1.2 NA water-immersion objective, Hg arc lamp and necessary interference filter (546 ± 12 nm) were used for the interference reflection microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) and images were captured at 19.91 frames per second using a EMCCD camera (Evolve 512 Delta; Photometrics, Trenton, NJ). Cells that were significantly adhered to the glass bottom were used for imaging. Regions used for analysis were stringently chosen to avoid parts farther than ∼ 100 nm from the coverslip – also called the first branch region (FBR) and the size chosen was 4x4 pixels corresponding to ∼ (720 nm)<sup>2</sup>. First, cells were imaged by IRM to take baseline reading following which chemokine (SDF1α) was added. Cells were followed till 30 min with ∼ 2-3 min interval post-chemokine addition.</p>

Membrane fluctuation-tension closely follows membrane frame tension for a large range of tension values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). For brevity, membrane fluctuation-tension has been referred to as “tension” in the rest of the manuscript. Tension maps were created from PSDs calculated for every pixel which were subsequently fitted and parameters extracted for every pixel. For analysing correlation between fluorescence and tension, first the fluorescence distribution of cells was plotted. Regions of intermediate intensity (around the first peak of the distribution) of a fixed intensity range was filtered and the pixel count of the filtered area was plotted against the average tension in those pixels. Normalization was done by diving by the maximum value in the time series. Normalized pixel count, thus, reflects how area with high Piezo1-GFP at the membrane changes while avoiding a small area fraction with very high Piezo1-GFP which might arise from internal structures. To ensure significance of the observed differences, the statistical test undertaken was the Mann-Whitney U test.</p>

<p>A custom code was written in Fiji (ImageJ) to analyze the cell image time-lapse for the calculation Front/Back (F/B) ratio of actin and Piezo1 expression relative to the direction of cell migration. Briefly, intensity-based thresholding was performed on the actin images to create binary masks of the cells. Individual cell boundaries were identified in the time-lapse, which were stored in the form of polygon ROIs. The cell ROIs enabled the computation of each cell’s trajectory and displacement vectors from the geometrical centroid at every frame of the time-lapse video. The computation of cell polarity involved fitting each cell’s ROI to an ellipse and bisecting the ellipse perpendicular to the migration direction. The ratio of total intensities in the leading half and the trailing half of the ellipse was calculated for actin and piezo1 images to get the F/B ratio.</p>
<p>For polarity measurement of fixed confocal images, cell boundaries were similarly identified. Stored ROIs were then split into two halves perpendicular to the long axis of the cell. The polarity index was measured by calculating the difference of total intensities of two halves of the cell divided by the sum of their total intensities. A measurement of 1 shows complete skewing of fluorescent signals to one half of the cell, while a value of 0 shows uniform distribution of fluorescent signals in both cell halves Representative polarity analysis Piezo1 (fixed), Piezo1 mCherry (live), pFAK (fixed), CD11a/LFA-1 (fixed) and actin (fixed) of untreated and CCL19-stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (Supplemental figure 6A-F).</p>

<title>Generation of Piezo1 mCherry and Actin-GFP polar plots</title>
<p>For analysis of angular/spatial distribution of Piezo1 mCherry and actin-GFP with respect to direction of cell movement, cell ROIs were applied to the actin and piezo1 channels individually, to find the intensity-weighted centre of mass (through all the time-points). Depending on the fluorescence intensity distribution, the intensity-weighted centre of mass is shifted away from the geometric centroid and towards the direction of a higher protein distribution. Thus, a vector connecting the centroid (geometric centre) to the centre of mass gives the direction of polarization of the protein of interest. The relative angle of the polarization vector against the cell displacement vector was calculated for each frame, and a polar histogram of the angles was plotted for actin-GFP and piezo1-mCherry.</p>

<title>Fixed immunostaining for confocal imaging</title>
<p>Untransfected human CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes were seeded on 12-mm, ICAM-1-coated glass coverslips at a density of about 0.2 million cells per coverslip. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 1.5 hours. 0.5µg/ml of recombinant human CCL19 was added to each coverslip and incubated for 20-30 minutes at 37°C. Post-treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. Blocking was performed in 3% bovine serum albumin in 1X PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 50 minutes at room temperature. Primary rabbit anti-human Piezo1 (Proteintech) was added at a dilution of 1:100 (5µg/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 1 to 1.5 hours. Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was added at a dilution of 1:350 (5.7µg/ml), and incubated for further 45-50 minutes. Nuclear staining was performed for 1 minute with Hoechst 33342 dye at a concentration of 1µg/ml in 1X PBS. All washes between steps were carried out in 1X PBS. Stained cells were then mounted on Vectashield® mounting media and sealed before confocal imaging. For Piezo1 and CD44 co-staining, rabbit anti-Piezo1 and mouse anti-human CD44 were used at a concentration of 5µg/ml, each. Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and alexa 633-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were used at a concentration of 5.7µg/ml, each.</p>
<p>For actin imaging, LifeAct-TagGFP2 protein was added at a concentration of 0.5µg/ml, and incubated for 45 minutes at room temperature before washing. For LFA-1 (α<sub>L</sub>β2) staining, mouse anti-human CD11a (α<sub>L</sub> subunit) was added at a concentration of 5µg/ml, followed by addition of anti-mouse Alexa 594-conjugated IgG. For LFA-1 and Piezo1 co-staining, primary antibodies were added at above concentrations, with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (for Piezo1) and Alexa 488-conjuagted anti-mouse IgG (for CD11a/LFA-1). Rabbit/mouse anti-phosphorylated FAK (Tyr-397) and mouse Paxillin was used to stain pFAK and paxillin, respectively to detect focal adhesions. These cells were treated with chemokine CCL19 for 10 minutes prior to fixation. While doing confocal microscopy, Z-stacks were captured at 0.5μm intervals. Confocal images are represented are maximum intensity projections of the Z-slices. 3Dprojectionfunction of Fiji was used to create a 3D rendering of the Z-slices, using the brightest point method of projection.</p>

<title>TIRF Imaging and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Piezo1 colocalization</title>
<p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Piezo1 imaging involved incubating cells with Fluo-3 AM (2.5 μM) in HBSS buffer for 30 minutes at 37°C, followed by washing and imaging in RPMI containing 10% FBS, and 25 mM HEPES media. Jurkat cell were transfected with Piezo1 mCherry plasmid and only those expressing Piezo1 mCherry were selected for the study. Dual-colour sequential TIRF imaging was employed, with Piezo1 mCherry being imaged at 300 ms (100 frames) and Ca2+ imaging performed using a 10 ms exposure time (2000 frames). The short exposure for Ca2+ was used to capture transient local peaks of fluorescence which would otherwise average out at longer exposure times. The maximum projection of the time series was used to detect local peaks using adaptive local thresholding (MATLAB), and a size filter was used to exclude large objects identified with a relatively low Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient. For each specific set of settings, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal objects detected were used to calculate the average cluster size and total area of objects. Uniform random numbers were used to simulate clusters with appropriate probability to ensure that the final area of the simulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> clusters closely matched the real data. The overlap between the real Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and Piezo1 objects was compared with the simulated data to test for deviation from a random placement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spots. To assess the robustness of the results, different combinations of size filters of Piezo1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> objects were used, ranging from 50 to 350 pixels.</p>

<p>This study provides <bold>useful</bold> insights into the subcellular localization, interaction with integrins, and functional importance of the cell surface receptor Piezo1 in migrating human T-cells. Whether Piezo1 is critically sensing mechano-physical cues during T-cell migration is however not well supported by direct experimental evidence. The data collected is <bold>solid</bold> otherwise.</p>

<p>This work by Liu CSC et al. is an extension of the author's previous work on the role of Piezo1 mechano-sensor in human T cell activation. In this study, the authors address whether Piezo1 plays a role in T-cell chemotactic migration.</p>
<p>The authors used CD4+ T cells or Jurkat T cells to test the effects of siRNA-mediated depletion of Piezo1 on chemotactic migration. They establish that Piezo1 is implicated in chemotactic migration, although the effects of depletion are relatively moderate.</p>
<p>They show that Piezo1 is redistributed to the leading edge of T-cells.</p>
<p>They identify that relocation of Piezo1 to the leading edge follows an increase in membrane tension.</p>
<p>In Piezo-1 depleted cells, they observe a moderate reduction of LFA-1 polarity. With the use of specific inhibitors, they propose Piezo1 activation to be downstream of focal adhesion formation and upstream of calpain-mediated LFA-1, integrin alpha L beta 2, or CD11a/CD18 recruitment at the leading edge.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Together with their 2018 paper, this study presents Pieszo1 as a regulator of T-cell activation, implicating it as a player in the coordination of the chemotactic immune response.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Most of the effects observed are relatively modest. The authors did not challenge the cells with various physico-mechanical conditions to see when Piezo-1 might become really important. For instance, there are no experiments that expose T cells to varying counter-acting forces to see how piezo1 might affect migration.</p>
<p>Technical weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors state that &quot;these high tension edges are usually further emphasized at later time points&quot;, but after ten minutes the median tension and tension (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 2C respectively) reduce down to the pretreatment time point. It would be clearer if the author stated within which timeframe the tension edges are &quot;further emphasized&quot;.</p>
<p>Figures 3 and 4 - The author states the number of cells quantified from the images, but it is not clear whether the data is actually from 3 biological replicates.</p>
<p>Some of the data has no representative images or videos included. There is no video in the supplementary for Figures 1 A and B. There are no representative images of transwell migration assay in Figures 1 D and E.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>Response to comments of editor/s:</p>
<p>•   With regard to the comments on nonavailability of representative images/videos for Figures 1 A and B, in the revised manuscript we have added a representative video of GFP (-) and GFP (+) tracks in Supplemental video 1.</p>
<p>Response to comments of reviewer 2:</p>
<p>•   With respect to the concern on figure 1, we have changed ‘% CD4+ T cell Migration’ to ‘% Proportion CD4+ T cell migration’ in Figures 1D &amp; 1E in the revised manuscript. We also labelled the upper and lower panels of Figure 1I as ‘Untreated’ and ‘SDF1α’ respectively.</p>
<p>Response to comments of reviewer 1:</p>
<p>•   With regard to the concern that ‘The transfection alone with siRNA may cause the lack of polarity’, we have added comparison of 2D migration MSD between control EGFP siRNA and Piezo1 siRNA-transfected CD4+ T cells as Supplementary Figure 1E.</p>
<p>•   We have added new references as ref 42 and 43, with respect to PIEZO1 association with focal adhesions.</p>
<p>•   With regard to the concerns around co-localization of Piezo1 and focal adhesions, we have added a representative image of Piezo1 and pFAK co-localization upon treatment of chemokine in revised Supplementary Fig. 3C. We have also used an additional focal adhesion marker, paxillin, to show that focal adhesion formation is not affected by Piezo1 KD (Revised Fig. 3E-3H). Upon comparing the mean pFAK and paxillin intensities, we observed no difference in Control and Piezo1 KD CD4+ T cells (Supplementary Figs. 3A, B).</p>
<p>•   All the minor concerns and suggestions have been taken care of in the revised manuscript.</p>
