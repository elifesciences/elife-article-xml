<title>Summary</title><p>While it is recognized that excess expression of non-essential proteins burdens cell growth, the physiological state of cells under such stress is largely unknown. This is because it is challenging to distinguish between adverse effects arising from the properties of the expressed excess protein (cytotoxicity) and those caused solely by protein overexpression. In this study, we attempted to identify the model protein with the lowest cytotoxicity in yeast cells by introducing a new neutrality index. We found that a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein (mox-YG) and an inactive glycolytic enzyme (Gpm1- CCmut) showed the lowest cytotoxicity. These proteins can be expressed at levels exceeding 40% of total protein while maintaining yeast growth. The transcriptome of cells expressing mox-YG to the limit indicated that the cells were in a nitrogen source requirement state. Proteome analysis revealed increased mitochondrial protein and decreased ribosome abundance, similar to the inactivated state of the TORC1 pathway. The decrease in ribosome abundance was presumably due to defective nucleolus formation, partially rescued by a mutation in the nuclear exosome. These findings suggest that massive overexpression of excess protein, termed protein burden, causes nitrogen source starvation, a metabolic shift toward more energy-efficient respiration, and a ribosomal biosynthesis defect due to an imbalance between ribosomal protein and rRNA synthesis in the nucleolus.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Expression levels of proteins are optimized to maximize the fitness of organisms, and the evolutionary principle that determines those levels is considered to be demand and constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruggeman et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Demand is the evolutionary pressure that works to increase the expression of a protein to meet the requirements of its function, and constraint is the evolutionary pressure that works to decrease the expression of a protein to avoid the negative effects produced by excess protein. Constraints appear as disturbances in cellular function when the protein is overexpressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, the red arrow). The mechanisms of constraining expression levels, or defects due to overexpression, can be roughly classified into four major categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moriya, 2015</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). “Resource overload” (also called “burden”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kastberg et al., 2022</xref>) is a disorder in which intracellular resources used for protein processing, such as synthesis, localization, degradation, and modification of proteins, are depleted or monopolized by the processing of that protein, resulting in a disruption of processing of other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dong et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stoebel et al., 2008</xref>). This phenomenon occurs in proteins with high expression levels. “Stoichiometry imbalance” is a disorder triggered by an imbalance of amounts between constituents within complexes, leading to untimely activation or inactivation (pathway modulation), degradation (resource overload), aggregation (promiscuous interaction), etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kaizu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Papp et al., 2003</xref>). This occurs due to the overexpression of proteins that form complexes. “Pathway modulation” is a disorder in which pathways are untimely activated or inactivated. This occurs especially with overexpression of proteins involved in pathway regulation, such as metabolic enzymes, kinases and phosphatases, and transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Prelich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Youn et al., 2017</xref>). “Promiscuous interaction” is a disorder in which weak interactions are enhanced by mass action to form complexes or aggregates that are not normally formed. This damages cellular function by inactivating essential proteins or overloading degradation resources, and is caused by overexpression of intrinsically disordered proteins or liquid-liquid phase-separating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bolognesi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vavouri et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Schematic diagrams illustrating the constraints on protein expression levels.</title>
<p>A) Protein expression levels are determined by demand and constraints (created by the authors, inspired by the work by Keren et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Keren et al., 2016</xref>). The existence of this evolutionary principle is revealed by the relationship between fitness (growth rate) and expression level when the expression level is altered, and in general, the native expression level provides the highest level of fitness for the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruggeman et al., 2020</xref>). The existence of constraints is revealed by a decrease in fitness upon overexpression (red arrow). Constraints determine the expression limit of the protein, i.e., the expression level at which growth inhibition occurs (dotted lines), but there can be multiple constraints for a single protein. The constraint that exists at the highest expression limit is protein burden. B) Four major mechanisms that constrain protein expression levels. The figure outlines the fate of proteins and shows what adverse effects occur upon overexpression (red arrows). The resource overload that occurs within the synthesis process (transcription and translation) is specifically referred to as protein burden. This diagram is a more concise redrawing of the author’s earlier one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Moriya, 2015</xref>). That asterisk means differentially localized proteins. C) A barrel model for resource overload (modified from the author’s earlier one) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>). The size of the barrels represents the capacity of each process, and the arrows represent the fate of the proteins processed there. The expression limit of a protein is defined by the lowest-capacity process that processes the protein. Among these processes, synthesis, which processes all proteins, is considered to have the largest capacity. Thus, proteins processed only by synthesis would have the highest expression limits, and their overexpression would overload synthesis (i.e., cause protein burden). Previous studies by the authors, conducted in this context, estimated that protein burden occurs at more than 15% of total protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>). D) Difference in burden due to gene structure (codon optimization). The amount of transcription required to achieve the same protein expression limit depends on the degree of codon optimization. This may change whether transcription or translation results in a higher burden. An ideal framework for protein burden studies. See text for details.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>As the expression level of a protein increases, it eventually encounters one of the barriers created by either these specified constraints or others that are unknown, all of which are related to the function and physicochemical properties of the protein, and damage cellular function. The expression level at which this occurs is referred to as the “expression limit” in this paper (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). If the constraints could be removed from the protein, the expression limit would increase. For example, if components of a complex are simultaneously expressed to resolve a stoichiometry imbalance, the expression limits of those proteins will be increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kaizu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>). In this manner, when (one) constraint is removed from a protein, the expression limit would increase until the next constraint barrier is hit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, dotted lines). The amount of expression limit created by a constraint barrier depends on the type of constraint. Stoichiometry imbalances, pathway modulations, and promiscuous interactions would create different expression limits for each protein. This is because they are determined by the activity, regulatory mechanism, and physicochemical properties of each protein. On the other hand, resource overload is presumed to be determined to some extent by the capacities of the processes in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Essentially, the synthesis, in which all proteins are processed, should have the largest capacity, while processes such as transport, folding, and degradation, in which only a fraction of proteins are processed, should have smaller capacities. In fact, adding transport or degradation signals to a cytosolic protein lowers the expression limit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kintaka et al., 2016</xref>). In that light, the final constraint barrier that emerges when all possible constraints are removed is the overloading of the synthesis process.</p>
<p>Overloading of the synthesis process is specifically referred to as “protein burden” or “protein cost” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>). It has long been the subject of study, mainly as an effect on growth produced by excess (gratuitous) proteins that are not necessary for cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruggeman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Scott et al., 2010</xref>). This idea was first proposed in studies of the cost of unnecessary induction of the <italic>lac</italic> operon in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koch, 1983</xref>). In recent years, much attention has been paid to the actual mechanisms by which massive expression of excess protein inhibits growth and the response of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farkas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Metzl-Raz et al., 2020</xref>). During protein burden, it is presumed that depletion of the materials, machinery, and factors necessary for transcription and translation occurs, along with competition from these monopolies. In particular, amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNAs are major candidates for depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kastberg et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, ribosomes, which are crucial for protein synthesis, themselves require significant resources for their synthesis and have therefore been considered major candidates for depletion during protein burden, as they compete for these limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Metzl-Raz et al., 2017</xref>). Mechanistic analysis of protein burden in budding yeast, a model eukaryotic cell, has been intensively conducted by Barkai and colleagues, who reported that transcription is rate-limiting in phosphate starvation and translation in nitrogen source starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>), and that basic transcription factors are limiting resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Metzl-Raz et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, a cellular response in the form of increased cell size and enhanced protein synthesis capacity has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the previously expected decrease in ribosomes has not been detected.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, to investigate protein burden, we need to overexpress proteins with minimal constraints. This is because overexpressing proteins with additional constraints cannot overload the synthetic process, as the additional constraints reduce the expression limits (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Also, the cellular damage and cellular response generated by the constraint mask the protein burden response. However, it remains unclear which proteins are not subject to constraints other than protein burden. Proteins that would induce protein burden have been determined by assuming that they would be minimally constrained based on their properties, and this assumption has been confirmed experimentally. Model proteins selected in this manner in yeast include fluorescent proteins (FPs) and certain glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Farkas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2016</xref>). FPs do not have a specific function or interaction partner in yeast cells and are not actively sorted into cellular compartments other than the cytosol. On the other hand, glycolytic enzymes are naturally expressed at very high levels and are thus considered to be less constrained. Notably, these proteins exhibit an expression limit of approximately 15% of total protein in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is not clear whether these proteins are free from constraints other than protein burden. This is because there may be unknown constraints, and there is no evidence that the measured expression limit is the &quot;true limit&quot; at which protein burden occurs.</p>
<p>In addition to the protein (amino acid sequence) itself, there is another aspect to be considered when selecting a model for protein burden. That is the nucleotide sequence of the gene used for expression, i.e., transcriptional, and translational regulatory sequences, codon usage, and so on (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). For example, if a protein is to be expressed to the limit by a less codon-optimized and thus less translationally efficient mRNA, a large amount of mRNA would be required, which would induce a greater burden on transcription. Conversely, a similar attempt by an mRNA with high translation efficiency would induce a greater burden on translation. These are the constraints inherent in protein synthesis itself. Although there is some evidence that protein synthesis in nature is economically designed to optimally load transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Frumkin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hausser et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mahima and Sharma, 2023</xref>), it still needs to be determined what the genetic design should be to minimize the burden.</p>
<p>Considering the above circumstance, a realistic approach to protein burden requires more than just drawing straightforward conclusions from the overexpression of a single model protein (or gene). Rather, it requires experimentally identifying proteins with the highest possible expression limits, investigating the negative impacts of their overexpression, and, if any constraints are revealed, examining whether their removal can increase expression limits. Through successive iterations, this process gradually deepens our understanding of protein burden (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In each iteration, the least constrained protein (and its gene) will be generated and utilized as a benchmark for further investigation into proteins with high (or low) expression limits and the adverse effects of their overexpression. This will (unintentionally) elucidate a new mechanism of constraint. Indeed, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), which we have used as a model for protein burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Makanae et al., 2013</xref>), was found to form a chaperone-entrapped aggregate upon overexpression and trigger the heat shock response due to its low folding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Namba et al., 2022</xref>). Its overexpression also causes abnormal yeast cell morphology through proteasomal stress as it contains cysteines. The moxGFP (mox), which improved folding properties and lacks cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Costantini et al., 2015</xref>), showed a higher expression limit and no longer induced abnormal morphologies. However, even when overexpressing mox, the anticipated depletion and competition for factors, or cellular responses to them have not been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Namba et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we found that a mutation causing loss of fluorescence in mox, and other fluorescent proteins increased the expression limit up to 3-fold, to more than 40% of total protein. Introducing a neutrality index (NI) to assess protein constraint, we found that non-fluorescent mox (mox-YG) and enzymatically inactive Gpm1 (Gpm1-CCmut) are currently the least constrained. Upon overexpression of mox-YG, depletion of amino acid or nitrogen sources, decreased ribosomal expression, and a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxygen respiration were observed. Thus, physiological states, as anticipated with such protein burdens, are only generated by massive overexpression of proteins with significantly lower constraints. Some of the responses found appear to be due to inactivation of the TORC1 pathway, suggesting that eukaryotic cells use this regulatory pathway to buffer protein burden. In the burdened cells, the nucleolus was dysplastic, and mutations in the nuclear exosome partially restored this. Thus, the abnormal formation of liquid-liquid phase-separated organelles due to dilution may be one of the defects caused by the strong protein burden.</p>

<p>To evaluate the expression limits of FPs, we overexpressed FPs to levels that induced growth inhibition. Gene constructs, in which the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter controls the target protein genes, were incorporated into plasmids designed for the genetic-tug-of-war (gTOW) method (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Moriya et al., 2006</xref>). Subsequently, yeast cells were transformed and cultured in a medium depleted of leucine. The maximum growth rate (MGR) of cells was calculated from serial measurements of optical density at 660 nm (OD660). Protein levels were determined through the analysis of proteins from cells in the logarithmic growth phase (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For each protein, we also analyzed a mutant in which the Tyr residue forming the fluorophore was replaced with Gly (YG mutation), resulting in a loss of fluorescence. This is because we unexpectedly found that this mutation substantially increased the expression limits of FPs (see below).</p>

</fig>
<p>Overexpression of the FPs and mutants all caused growth inhibition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C). EGFP and mox were expressed at about 15% of the total protein as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kintaka et al., 2016</xref>), but mCherry (mChe) and YG mutants were expressed at higher levels. Mox-YG expressed 44% of the total protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref>, E). Our previous work had evaluated only expression limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>), but we realized that we could not properly assess the constraints on each protein if the growth rates at the expression limit were different. For example, the mChe’s expression limit (20%) is higher than that of sfGFP (17%), but the relative MGRs are 20% and 80%, respectively, which is much lower for mChe. The relationship between %MGR and %protein level when the control is set at 100% is shown in the scatter plot in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>. The lower left indicates more constraint as lower expression levels lead to growth inhibition, and the upper right indicates less constraint as higher expression levels do not cause growth inhibition. Here, we describe “unconstrained” as “neutral” and calculate the neutrality index (NI) as the product of %MGR and %protein level.</p>
<p>The bars and error bars in <bold>C</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, and <bold>G</bold> show the means and SDs calculated from three biological replicates. The raw data is shown with dot plots. Note that the regime of NI in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref> shows a theoretical neutrality distribution but does not show the relationship between growth rate and the expression level when the expression level of a protein with a particular neutrality is increased or decreased. For example, 20% of the growth rate would be maintained when the expression of mox-YG (NI = 2,400) is increased to 100%, but this is not realistic. We also note that in this study, we calculated NI using the percentage of the target protein among total cellular proteins separated by SDS-PAGE. Therefore, to calculate NI, the expression limit of the target protein must be sufficiently high to be detectable by this method. On the other hand, if detection sensitivity is improved, for example by using Western blotting, it becomes possible to estimate the NI even for proteins under strong constraints—i.e., those that exhibit cytotoxicity. In fact, when we recalculated the NI for EGFPs fused with various localization signals from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kintaka et al. 2016</xref>), all values were found to be below 100 (<xref rid="fig2s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p>
<p>The NI of each protein indicates that introducing a non-fluorescent mutation in FPs uniformly increases neutrality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that “having fluorescence” is a constraint on the expression of FPs. The most neutral proteins were sfGFP-YG and mox-YG, with NIs of about 2,400. Notably, despite significant differences in the degree of growth inhibition and expression limits between the two proteins, their NIs are nearly identical (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2F</xref>, G). They differ only in two amino acid residues (Cys - Ser) (<xref rid="fig2s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), which seem to generate differences in expression efficiency. However, this does not appear to affect their NIs.</p>
<p>We also investigated the impact of expression efficiency on NI with another FP, mChe. The mChe used in this study is codon optimized (the codon adaptation index (CAI) = 0.584) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Keppler-Ross et al., 2008</xref>), while the mChe used by Kafri <italic>et al</italic>. for protein cost analysis (here referred to as mChe-Kafri) is not codon optimized (CAI = 0.236) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>). When overexpressed, mChe-Kafri (and mChe- Kafri-YG) had lower expression and growth inhibition than mChe (and mChe-YG) (<xref rid="fig2s5" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 5A-D</xref>). This may be due to the lower translation rate of mChe-Kafri mRNA. However, their NIs were not significantly different, especially for the YG mutation (<xref rid="fig2s5" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 5E, F</xref>). Thus, the constraints indicated by NI are apparently not affected by translation efficiency. In the study using this mCherry-Kafri, it was also reported that the more mChe-Kafri was expressed, the more the cells enlarged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>). However, no cell enlargement was observed with mox-YG, which can be expressed more than mCherry. Interestingly, the mChe-YG cells did not show enlargement (<xref rid="fig2s6" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 6A, B</xref>), indicating that cell enlargement is a phenomenon that occurs specifically when fluorescent mChe is overexpressed.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the growth inhibition caused by the overexpression of mox-YG in this study is a burden on translation rather than on transcription. This is because overexpression of a frameshift mutant (moxFS), in which four nucleotides were inserted directly after the ATG of the mox-YG gene, abolished the notable growth delay (<xref rid="fig2s6" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 6C, D</xref>).</p>

<title>Constraint on fluorescent protein expression arises from fluorophore properties</title>
<p>Next, we further analyzed the possibility that fluorescence constrains the expression of FPs. When yeast was grown in the dark, the degree of growth inhibition of mox was the same (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>) and the expression limit of mox was rather increased (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B</xref>). Phototoxicity does indeed exist when expressing mox with fluorescence. This is because, when exposed to strong light, cells overexpressing mox show a reduced growth rate (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7C-E</xref>) and abnormalities in their internal structures (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7F</xref>). However, the expression limits of mox and mox-YG were almost unchanged by the light (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 7G, H</xref>). Thus, the constraint was not due to phototoxicity itself.</p>
<p>The number of Tyr residues was also irrelevant because NI was like that of mox-YG when a single Tyr was added to the C-terminus of mox-YG (<xref rid="fig2s8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 8A-E</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (H2O2) are generated during fluorophore formation. When H2O2 was added to the medium, stronger growth inhibition occurred only in mox (<xref rid="fig2s8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 8F-H</xref>). This suggests that the reactive oxygen species generated during fluorophore formation are responsible for the constraint. However, this possibility is not supported by the omics analysis described later (see Discussion). Mox- YG, like mox, was present throughout the cytoplasm and did not cause any characteristic localization or aggregation (<xref rid="fig2s9" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>).</p>
<p>During this study, we examined a moxGFP (mox-T203I) in which Thr203 was accidentally replaced by Ile (<xref rid="fig2s10" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 10</xref>). The fluorescence of this mutant is reduced to 78% of mox (<xref rid="fig2s10" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 10A-C</xref>). The growth rate of the cells expressing this mox-T203I was like that of mox and mox-YG (<xref rid="fig2s10" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 10E</xref>). Still, the expression limit was intermediate between mox and mox-YG (<xref rid="fig2s10" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 10F</xref>), resulting in the NI intermediate between mox and mox-YG (<xref rid="fig2s10" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 10G</xref>). This result further supports that fluorescence is related to constraints. However, as mentioned above, fluorescence emission itself should not be toxic (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). We next focused on the formation process of the fluorophore: the tyrosine of the GFP fluorophore undergoes phenol and phenolate state changes, with Thr203 stabilizing the phenol form and substitution to Ile reducing the phenolate form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kummer et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, in enhanced GFPs such as mox, substitution of Ser65 before Tyr66 for Thr anchors the phenolate form. To investigate the possibility that this is a factor determining the limit of mox, we produced mox with Thr65 replaced with Ser and examined its expression limit. The mox-T65S mutant was expressed 12% more than mox (<xref rid="fig2s10" ref-type="fig">Figures 2—figure supplement 10H, I</xref>), suggesting that the phenol-type fluorophore can be a limiting factor for the expression level of the fluorescent protein, while the concrete mechanism is still unclear.</p>

<title>Overexpression of mox-YG causes an amino acid starvation response</title>
<p>To understand the cell physiology under protein burden, we next performed transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis of the cells overexpressing mox-YG, the least constrained protein. Although the expression limit of mox-YG is about 3-fold higher than that of mox (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>), the growth rates at the expression limits of both are not largely different (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, by comparing transcriptomes upon their overexpression, we may be able to distinguish and extract the general transcriptional response due to reduced growth rates from the (protein burden) response associated with the massive expression of a less constrained protein.</p>
<p>The expression changes under mox and mox-YG overexpression were calculated as fold change (FC) over the vector control (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The overall trend of expression changes was similar (<italic>r</italic> = 0.64, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). This similar variation may include responses associated with the expression system and reduced growth rate. On the other hand, there were also different transcriptional responses between the two. Gene categories that showed significant expression changes in either mox or mox-YG overexpression are shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>. In addition to the enhanced ribosome synthesis and decreased glycolysis observed in previous mox overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Namba et al., 2022</xref>), enhanced oxidative phosphorylation was detected. Interestingly, “Ribosome biogenesis”, which was elevated in mox overexpression, showed a rather decreasing trend in mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Indeed, <italic>IFH1</italic>, which is involved in ribosomal gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Martin et al., 2004</xref>), was upregulated in mox, but downregulated in mox-YG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Different trends were also observed for “amino acid metabolism” (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The amino acid transporter genes <italic>AGP1</italic> and <italic>GAP1</italic> were upregulated only in mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, C). Expressions of specific amino acid and nitrogen source transporter genes were strongly induced in mox-YG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The expression of glucose transporter genes was also very different (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggest that mox and mox-YG induce similar but distinct transcriptional responses, particularly that mox-YG overexpression may result in depletion of amino acid and nitrogen sources and decreased ribosome synthesis.</p>

<p>The transcriptional responses in mox-YG overexpression obtained by RNA-seq were confirmed by transcriptional reporter analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In this reporter analysis, we also tested overexpression of a frameshift mutant (moxFS) that imposes a burden on transcription but not on translation (<xref rid="fig2s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C, D</xref>). As a result, most of the responses observed under mox-YG overexpression were not observed under moxFS overexpression, suggesting that these transcriptional responses are likely caused by a burden on translation. The only exception was <italic>TDH3pro</italic>, whose activity decreased even under moxFS overexpression. Since <italic>TDH3pro</italic> is used for driving overexpression in this system, this result suggests that transcriptional competition may occur as a result of overexpression.

<title>Overexpression of mox-YG causes a proteomic response that partially overlaps with TORC1 inactivation</title>
<p>Protein burden is an overload on synthetic resources, and thus, when this overload occurs strongly, it is expected that there would be a reduction in the amount of proteins other than those being overexpressed due to competition for synthetic resources. Indeed, in cells overexpressing mox-YG, the amounts of proteins other than mox-YG were reduced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, the total amount of protein per cell remained almost constant, with the amount of other proteins decreasing as mox-YG was overexpressed. This trend was generally true for the overexpression of other FP (<xref rid="fig4s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

<p>The maintenance of total cellular protein levels under overexpression conditions may be due to constraints such as intracellular space limitations or limitations in the availability of nutrients in the medium. To investigate whether nutrient limitation contributes to this phenomenon, we attempted overexpression of mox and mox-YG in YPD medium, which is considered to be more nutrient-rich than the SC medium. Since leucine depletion could not be used to drive overexpression in this context, we employed an alternative strategy using the aureobasidin A resistance marker (<italic>AUR1d</italic>) to increase plasmid copy number (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In this experiment, mox-YG was expressed at approximately 20% of the total cellular protein, with a corresponding increase in total protein content per cell (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). This result suggests that in nutrient-rich YPD medium, cells may possess the capacity to buffer excess protein expression by increasing the total proteome. However, under these expression conditions, no growth inhibition was observed (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), and thus the induction of mox-YG was not sufficiently strong. We therefore consider it necessary to investigate the regime under conditions of stronger overexpression in future studies.</p>
<p>To examine changes in protein expression, proteomic analysis of mox-YG overexpressing cells (in the SC medium) was performed. The distribution of intensities obtained from the analysis is shown in the Proteomaps in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>. In mox-YG overexpressing cells, mox-YG accounted for 40% of the total protein expression. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> suggests that in mox-YG overexpressing cells, proteins other than mox- YG are overall reduced to about 60% compared to the vector. Therefore, we considered it necessary to normalize the data overall to accurately represent changes in the per-cell proteome. However, in this study, we used data without such correction to focus on how the composition of the proteome, other than mox-YG, changed (see Materials and Methods and <xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figures 4—figure supplement 3A-C</xref> for more details).</p>
<p><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates the categories that showed significant changes upon mox-YG overexpression (all categories are shown in <xref rid="fig4s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Elevated mitochondrial proteins, such as oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle, and decreased ribosomal protein and ribosomal synthesis were observed. Interestingly, the proteomic changes observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells showed little correlation with the corresponding transcriptomic changes (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). The only notable exception was oxidative phosphorylation, which was upregulated at both the transcript and protein levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). In contrast, for example, ribosomal proteins were upregulated at the transcript level but markedly downregulated at the protein level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). This discrepancy may indicate a cellular state in which transcriptional responses are uncoupled from protein expression as a result of protein burden.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, RNA-seq results suggested nitrogen source starvation in mox-YG overexpression. Therefore, we investigated whether this response is influenced by the regulation through the TORC1 pathway, a primary mechanism responsive to nitrogen sources. By comparing expression changes due to rapamycin (a TORC1 inhibitor) treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gowans et al., 2018</xref>) and mox-YG overexpression, we found that about 40% of the proteins with altered expression were congruent with the group of proteins regulated by TORC1 (<xref rid="fig4s5" ref-type="fig">Figures 4—figure supplement 5A, B</xref>). Thus, the proteome expression changes due to mox-YG overexpression may include responses due to inactivation of the TORC1 pathway as well as other responses. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> shows which categories had significant expression changes when separated into rapamycin-responsive (Rap) and rapamycin-non-responsive (Non-Rap) gene populations. Carbohydrate metabolism, elevated TCA cycle, and decreased ribosome synthesis were suggested to be responses due to TORC1 inactivation, while endocytosis, cytoskeleton, protein transport and lipid synthesis, and glycolysis were suggested to be due to responses other than TORC1 inactivation (<xref rid="fig4s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Oxidative phosphorylation included both Rap responses (12/32) and non- responses (20/32) (<xref rid="fig4s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 6C</xref>). Indeed, mox-YG overexpression reduced the sensitivity to rapamycin compared to the vector control (<xref rid="fig4s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 7A-E</xref>), supporting the notion that TORC1 activity was diminished. However, we were unable to obtain direct evidence demonstrating TORC1 inactivation. We examined the phosphorylation status of Atg13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kamada et al. 2000</xref>), a known TORC1 target, by Western blotting. In mox-YG overexpressing cells, however, the total expression level of Atg13 was markedly reduced (<xref rid="fig4s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 7F</xref>). Therefore, it remains inconclusive how the decreased expression of TORC1 targets affects downstream signaling under these conditions.</p>
<p>Above transcriptome and proteome analyses suggested that mox-YG overexpression induces mitochondrial development and a metabolic shift from fermentation to oxidative respiration. To verify mitochondrial development, we performed fluorescence microscopy. Indeed, mitochondria labeled with Rip1-mScarlet-I, a component of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, were significantly more developed in mox-YG overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, 4—figure supplement 8). Furthermore, oxygen consumption was increased in these cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, 4—figure supplement 9), supporting the notion that they had undergone a metabolic shift toward oxidative respiration.</p>

<title>Overexpression of mox-YG causes a dysplastic nucleolus, which is alleviated by mutations in the nuclear exosome</title>
<p>Ribosomes are a crucial factor for protein burden because they are themselves protein synthesizers while being synthesized in the highest amounts in the cell. Therefore, we further focused on the behavior of ribosomes in mox-YG cells and expression changes were investigated in detail for each ribosomal protein (<xref rid="fig5s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the majority of the 84 ribosomal proteins detected (45 of them significantly) decreased, six (Rps12, Rps31, Ppp0, Rpp2a, Rpl5, and Rpl12) showed significant increases. Interestingly, all decreased ribosomal proteins are assembled into ribosomes in the nucleolus, while all increased ribosomal proteins are assembled into ribosomes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lafontaine, 2015</xref>). They constitute the “beak” of the 40S subunit and the “P-stalk” and the “central protuberance (pc)” of the 60S subunit (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Electron micrographs showed an abnormal nucleolar formation of mox-YG overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), in addition to reduced ribosome density in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

In WT cells, enough ribosomal proteins (RPs) are produced, resulting in RP- assembled rRNAs and the formation of nucleolus with normal morphology. On the other hand, in mox- YG overexpressing cells, the amount of RP is reduced due to translation competition, increasing misassembled rRNA. As a result, degradation of rRNA by exosomes may be accelerated, resulting in abnormal nucleolus morphology.

<p>Based on these results, we hypothesized that overexpression of mox-YG creates an imbalance between the amount of ribosomal protein synthesized in the cytoplasm and the amount of rRNA synthesized in the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, D). The imbalance may lead to the creation of misassembled ribosomes, which are eventually degraded. We speculated that the primary enzyme degrading the misassembled ribosome should be the nuclear exosome. This is because our previous genome-wide mutation analysis identified exosome mutants (<italic>dis3-1, mtr3-ts, mtr4-1, rpn42-ph, rpn45-ph, and ski6-ph</italic>) as primary mitigators of protein burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kintaka et al., 2020</xref>). We confirmed that the <italic>mtr4-1</italic> mutant does not show growth retardation upon mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). In fact, in <italic>mtr4-1</italic> cells, there was no difference in growth rate between the vector control and mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig5s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>), but rather a shorter lag time for the mox-YG overexpression than the vector control (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). We next quantified protein upon mox-YG overexpression in <italic>mtr4-1</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Compared to the wild-type (Vector), the total protein content in <italic>mtr4-1</italic> (Vector) cells was reduced to 78%, which was likely related to the decreased growth. In the <italic>mtr4-1</italic> mox-YG overexpressing cells, the amount of other proteins decreased (to 54%), overwhelmed by the 40% expression of mox-YG.</p>
<p>However, the overall protein content increased compared to the <italic>mtr4-1</italic> vector control, with a composition like the wild-type mox-YG overexpressing cells. Therefore, in <italic>mtr4-1</italic> cells, even though mox-YG overexpression reduced the amount of other proteins (to 54%) compared to the vector control (78%), the growth rate was not reduced (<xref rid="fig5s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>). This suggests that mox-YG overexpression restores the effect of growth inhibition caused by <italic>mtr4-1</italic>. Next, we observed the composition of the nucleolus in <italic>mtr4-1</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 5D, E</xref>). The failure of nucleolus formation observed upon mox-YG overexpression was partially, but significantly, rescued in the <italic>mtr4-1</italic> strain. This supports our hypothesis that misassembled ribosomes are degraded by the exosome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), and with low exosome activity, nucleolus formation (and efficient ribosome assembly) would be possible even with overexpression of mox-YG (<xref rid="fig5s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>While experimenting with mox-YG overexpressing cells, we found that these cells stop growth earlier (lower final density) at higher temperatures (38°C) than the vector controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Cells at this time did not show cell death such as cell bursting (<xref rid="fig5s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Recently, it was reported that intracellular osmotic pressure increases at high temperatures, resulting in less formation of liquid-liquid phase-separated structures such as nucleoli, which are recovered when cells are placed in hyperosmotic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). We hypothesized that the growth inhibition of mox-YG overexpressing cells at high temperatures may be due to the enhanced failure of nucleolus formation, and thus cultured mox-YG overexpressing cells under hyperosmotic pressure. At 30°C, hyperosmolarity caused the same decrease in growth for the vector control and mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 6C</xref>). On the other hand, at 38°C, hyperosmolarity caused a decrease in growth only in the vector control and no further decrease in mox-YG overexpression cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5J</xref> and <xref rid="fig5s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 5—figure supplement 6D</xref>). The same trend was observed regarding the size of the nucleolus (<xref rid="fig5s6" ref-type="fig">Figures 5—figure supplement 6E, F</xref>). Under the conditions with added sorbitol and under mox-YG overexpression, the size of the nucleoli was smaller than the control at 30°C, whereas, at 38°C, it was rather larger than the control. This suggests that mox-YG overexpression and hyperosmolarity may mitigate each other’s growth-inhibitory effects, and one explanation may be that hyperosmolarity suppresses the abnormal organization of the nucleolus caused by mox-YG overexpression.</p>

<title>The Gpm1 mutant shows a similar NI to mox-YG, yet yields distinct phenotypes upon overexpression</title>
<p>Thus far, our investigation has focused on heterologous fluorescent proteins. Finally, we turned to endogenous yeast proteins to identify those with the lowest cytotoxicity and to examine the phenotypic consequences of their overexpression. We previously investigated the expression limits of a group of glycolytic enzymes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, with Gpm1 and its catalytic center mutant (CCmut) having the highest expression limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we evaluated the neutrality of the wild types and their CC-mutants of Tdh3 and Gpm1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The growth rates at the expression limits were higher in the CCmut for both Tdh3 and Gpm1, and in Gpm1, the CCmut grew two-fold faster (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 6—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). The protein levels of wild types and mutants of both proteins were not significantly different (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 6—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). The calculated NIs were highest for Gpm1-CCmut, which was equivalent to that of mox-YG (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref>). We previously concluded that the activities of glycolytic enzymes generally do not affect their expression limits (Eguchi 2018), but their neutralities suggest that their activities can become constraints in some way. This may be due to a disturbance in metabolism or a property of the active enzyme, such as an effect of reactive amino acids (His or Cys, <xref rid="fig6s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Although Gpm1 and Gpm1-CCmut exhibited NIs comparable to that of mox-YG, suggesting that they are similarly unconstrained, notable differences in cell morphology were observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, 6— figure supplement 3). Cells overexpressing Gpm1 appeared enlarged and spherical, while those overexpressing Gpm1-CCmut did not show such hypertrophy but were still rounder than vector controls or mox-YG overexpressing cells. The transcriptional responses observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells, including the induction of <italic>GAP1</italic>, a marker of the amino acid starvation response, were not detected in Gpm1-CCmut overexpression (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s4" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). In Gpm1- CCmut overexpressing cells, similar to mox-YG overexpression, the levels of proteins other than Gpm1-CCmut were reduced, despite a slight, statistically non-significant increase in total protein amount (<xref rid="fig6s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). While mitochondrial development was observed in Gpm1- CCmut cells using Rip1–mScarlet-I labeling (<xref rid="fig6s5" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), no increase in oxygen consumption was detected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). The nucleolus, visualized with Nsr1–mScarlet-I, appeared similarly shrunken in Gpm1-CCmut overexpressing cells as in mox- YG overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). These results suggest that the phenotypes observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells include both mox-YG–specific effects and responses commonly associated with protein burden. Alternatively, as indicated by the abnormal cell morphology, Gpm1-CCmut may possess unknown constraints or cytotoxic properties not captured by the neutrality index, which could obscure the detection of phenotypes typically associated with protein burden.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we found that the fluorescent properties of FPs constrain their expression limits. This fluorescence-induced cytotoxicity appears as different phenotypes depending on the FPs; an excess of fluorescent mCherry causes cell enlargement, but such a phenotype was not seen with green fluorescent proteins. On the other hand, the cause of the cytotoxicity is not clear currently. Fluorescence itself does not seem to constrain the expression limit, because the mox expression limit remained the same when cultured in the dark or under strong light (<xref rid="fig2s7" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). We also believe that H2O2 generated during fluorophore maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Craggs, 2009</xref>) is unlikely. In the presence of H2O2, mox overexpressing cells grew slightly slower than mox-YG overexpressing cells (<xref rid="fig2s8" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 8H</xref>). However, no transcriptional response to oxidative stress, including the catalase gene (<italic>CTT1</italic>), was seen with mox overexpression (FDR &lt; 0.187, over the vector control, Data S1). Because <italic>CTT1</italic> expression was elevated in mox-YG overexpression (FDR &lt; 0.006, over the vector control, Data S1), presumably due to enhanced respiration, mox-YG overexpression might rather increase oxidative stress tolerance. Conversely, &quot;inactive&quot; proteins might accumulate more without interfering with intracellular functions because both inactive fluorescent proteins and inactive glycolytic enzymes showed higher neutrality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, our current data did not clarify the mechanism, and investigating more proteins and their variants would be required.</p>
<p>The currently least cytotoxic proteins, non-fluorescent mox-YG and inactive Gpm1 express more than 40% of the total protein, whereas yeast cells can maintain growth under these conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). This is higher than the prediction in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which stops growing when 37% of the excess protein is expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruggeman et al., 2020</xref>). This may be due to the very low cytotoxicity of the proteins expressed in this study, or it may be because eukaryotic cells have greater capacity than prokaryotic cells. In the mox-YG overexpressing cells, we observed a previously expected but unobserved cellular physiology of the protein burden: depletion of protein synthesis resources (i.e., nitrogen source; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) and a decrease in other proteins (glycolytic enzymes and ribosomes; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), possibly due to competition for synthesis. In addition, metabolic conversion to mitochondria and failure of nucleolus formation were observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). As a matter of fact, the nitrogen source depletion response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>) itself is not self-evident. Because the total protein content in the mox-YG overexpressing cells is the same as that in the vector control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), the intracellular nitrogen source used for protein synthesis should not be depleted. Then, why does the nitrogen source depletion response occur? Excess mox-YG may promote wasteful consumption of amino acids and nitrogen, or there may be pathways that sense the amount of “useful proteins” and their ability to be synthesized, or there may be depletion of specific amino acids in mox-YG excess. Another possibility is that there may be some mechanism that maintains the amount of total protein in the cell even when the nitrogen source is depleted. Depletion of nitrogen sources probably results in the inactivation of the TORC1 pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), metabolic conversion from fermentation to respiration, and ribosome depression to an economic mode. In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the ppGpp pathway plays this role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Shachrai et al., 2010</xref>). While the above is thought to be a physiological response to protein burden, a defect in ribosome synthesis in the nucleolus was also suggested (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). This could be due to a conflict between nuclear rRNA synthesis and cytoplasmic protein synthesis or to the negative effects of the inability to create a liquid- liquid phase-separated structure due to dilution effects (see below). The partial restoration of nucleolus formation by a mutation of the exosome (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>) supports this possibility.</p>
<p>When one type of protein is expressed as much as 40% of the total, as in the present study, the cytoplasmic crowding, viscosity, pH, etc. may change due to the nature of the protein and the effect of the reduced protein by competition. These may alter the movement of substances. It is known that when ribosomes are reduced, the fluidity of large proteins changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>). Water activity- osmotic pressure may change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Watson et al., 2023</xref>), and pH may also be affected. These may affect the formation of liquid-liquid phase-separated structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Delarue et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). The failure of nucleolus formation observed in mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) may be due to such a condition change. In fact, the growth of mox-YG overexpressing cells is significantly impaired at high temperatures (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>), where liquid-liquid phase separation is less likely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, the effect appears to be reduced at high osmolarity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>), where it is more likely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Watson et al., 2023</xref>). A mutation of the nuclear exosome restored nucleolus formation</p>
<p>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>), which might be due to the reformation of the liquid-liquid phase-separated structure (i.e., nucleolus) by increasing the concentration of rRNA. These have not been considered phenomena that occur with protein overexpression. The engineering of physicochemical properties of the cytoplasm thus may be possible by mass expression of proteins with specific properties.</p>
<p>In this study, in addition to mox-YG, inactive Gpm1 was also expressed in large amounts as well (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Both are globular proteins with relatively small molecular weight, but it is not yet clear what characteristics are necessary for them not to be cytotoxic. Further investigation of the neutrality of various proteins will clarify these features. In addition, while the overexpression of Gpm1-CCmut also caused nucleolar shrinkage similar to that observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells, it did not induce other phenotypes such as nitrogen starvation or enhanced respiration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). Therefore, it remains unclear which of the phenotypes observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells are general consequences of “protein burden” and which are specific to mox-YG. As noted in the Introduction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), it is essential to continue investigating multiple proteins that appear to be “unconstrained” in order to address this issue. In this study, expression limits were investigated, but no experiments were performed to gradually increase expression levels. For example, it would be meaningful to investigate at what expression level of mox-YG a shift to the economy mode or failure of nucleolus formation occurs. Also, due to the limitations of the experimental system, it may not be possible to express mox-YG to its true limit. The expression of one specific protein cannot be 100% of the total protein, and there is always a limit. As the number of ribosomes continues to decrease due to competition for synthesis, the excess proteins cannot be synthesized either. Thus, there must be a final equilibrium point. A more powerful and controllable expression system would be needed to investigate this. Although the translation system appears to be the primary target of burden in mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig2s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C, D</xref>), the bottleneck in the expression system may also differ depending on gene design (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Hausser et al., 2019</xref>).</p>

<title>Genetic tug-of-war</title>
<p>To overexpress a target protein to a level that causes growth inhibition (in this study this is referred to as “expression limit”), we used gTOW (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moriya et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">2006</xref>). The gene of the target protein is incorporated into the gTOW plasmid (here, pTOW40836) and introduced into yeast cells lacking <italic>ura3</italic> and <italic>leu2</italic> genes. The selection marker in this case is uracil (– Ura conditions). Since this plasmid has the replication origin of 2 µm plasmid (<italic>2 µ ORI</italic>), this plasmid becomes multicopy in the cell (about 30 in the case of the vector). When yeast cells carrying the plasmid are transferred to a medium without leucine and uracil (–Leu/Ura conditions), the copy number of the plasmid in the cells increases (to about 120 in the case of the vector). This is because <italic>leu2-89</italic> on the plasmid is a <italic>LEU2</italic> allele with a large deletion in its promoter, so cells with higher plasmid copy numbers will grow faster in –Leu/Ura conditions. In other words, <italic>leu2-89</italic> acts as a bias to raise the plasmid copy number in –Leu/Ura conditions. If overexpression of the target protein inhibits growth, the plasmid copy number will be lower than the copy number that gives rise to the critical expression of that protein.</p>
<p>In other words, the target gene acts as a bias to lower the plasmid copy number. The resulting tug-of- war between the selection biases created by the two genes leads to a target protein being expressed at close to the critical expression level in –Leu/Ura conditions (the green-colored area in <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By using a version of the aureobasidin A resistance gene (<italic>AUR1</italic>) with a deletion in its promoter (<italic>AUR1d</italic>) as a bias to increase plasmid copy number, experiments based on the same concept as gTOW can also be conducted in rich medium (YPD + 500 ng/mL aureobasidin A). In this case, the plasmid pTOW-AUR1d is used (<xref rid="fig4s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p>

The processed data (Data_S1) included the average expression levels (log10CPM) of 6685 genes in the vector control, the changes in expression (log2FC) upon overexpression of mox or mox-YG compared to the vector control, and the significance values of expression change (mox_FDR, mox-YG_FDR). <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figures 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref> is the visualization of this data using volcano plots.

<title>Proteome analysis</title>
<p>The vector control and mox-YG overexpressing cells (three biological replicates) were cultured in 5 mL of SC–LeuUra medium with shaking and cells were collected at OD660 = 1. Cells were washed twice with PBS, frozen on dry ice, and transported to Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The samples were prepared as described in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kawashima et al., 2022</xref>). The cells were dissolved in 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 4% SDS and 20 mM NaCl using BIORUPTOR BR-II (SONIC BIO Co., Kanagawa, Japan). The 20 μg of extracted proteins were quantified using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, WA, USA) at 500 ng/μL. The protein extracts were reduced with 20 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine for 10 min at 80°C followed by alkylation with 30 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Protein purification and digestion were performed using the sample preparation (SP3) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kawashima et al., 2022</xref>). The tryptic digestion was performed using 500 ng/μL Trypsin/Lys-C Mix (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for overnight at 37°C. The digests were purified using GL-Tip SDB (GL Sciences, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The peptides were dissolved again in 2% ACN containing 0.1% TFA and quantified using BCA assay at 150 ng/μL. The digested peptides were loaded directly using a 75 μm × 12 cm nanoLC nano-capillary column (Nikkyo Technos Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at 40°C and then separated with a 30-minute gradient (mobile phase A = 0.1% FA in water, B = 0.1% FA in 80% ACN) consisting of 0 min 8% B, 30 min 70% B at a flow rate of 200 nL/min using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano LC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The eluted peptides were detected using a quadrupole Orbitrap Exploris 480 hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with normal window DIA. The MS1 scan range was set as a full scan with m/z 490-745 at a mass resolution of 15,000 to set an Auto Gain Control (AGC) target for MS1 as 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> and a maximum injection time of 23 msec. The MS2 were collected at more than m/z 200 at 30,000 resolutions to set an AGC target of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup>, maximum injection time of “auto”, and fixed normalized collision energy of 28%. The isolation width for MS2 was set to 4 m/z, and for the 500-740 m/z window pattern, an optimized window arrangement was used in Scaffold DIA (Proteome Software, Inc., Portland, OR, USA). The raw data were searched against an <italic>in silico</italic> predicted spectral library using DIA-NN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Demichev et al., 2020</xref>). (version:1.8.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN">https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN</ext-link>) First, an <italic>in-silico</italic> predicted spectral library was generated from the human protein sequence database (UniProt id UP000005640, reviewed, canonical, 20381 entries) using DIA-NN. The DIA-NN search parameters were as follows: protease, trypsin; missed cleavages, 1; peptide length range, 7-45; precursor charge range, 2-4; precursor mass range, 495-745; fragment ion m/z range, 200-1800; mass accuracy, 10 ppm; static modification, cysteine carbamidomethylation; enabled “Heuristic protein interferences,” “Use isotopologues,” “MBR,” and “No shared spectra.” Additional commands were set as follows: “mass acc cal 10,” “peak translation,” and “matrix spec q”. The protein identification threshold was set at &lt; 1% for both peptide and protein false discovery rates (FDRs).</p>

<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The analysis and visualization of RNA-seq data and proteome data were conducted using custom Python code, and coding and execution were carried out in the Collaboratory. In the RNAseq data, 6,685 protein-coding genes were detected (Data_S1). Among these, 4,291 genes assigned to various categories of KEGG Orthology level 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kanehisa et al., 2023</xref>) were placed into 77 categories. Analysis was performed on 47 categories that contained more than 10 gene elements. We investigated whether the expression of genes in each category, as a group, was significantly higher or lower upon overexpression of mox and mox-YG compared to the vector control. Specifically, mox/Vector (log2FC) and mox-YG/Vector (log2FC) were calculated along with their FDR values, and each gene was assigned to a KEGG orthology level 3 category. Next, whether the gene groups within each category showed significantly higher or lower expression changes compared to gene groups outside of their category was tested using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Significant differences were indicated in the graphs with a red border and red stripes. The graphs showed the overall distribution of genes within each category using violin plots, and only genes showing significant differences in mox/Vector (log2FC) and mox- YG/Vector (log2FC) were highlighted in swarm plots. An asterisk indicated significant differences on the graphs when the expression changes (log2FC) between mox/Vector and mox-YG/Vector were significant by the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. The significance threshold was set at FDR &lt; 0.05 for all. Only categories where either mox or mox-YG overexpression showed significant expression changes were extracted and presented as <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, and all 47 categories were shown in <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>.</p>
<p>The proteome analysis was conducted using the signal intensity data (Data_S2). This data includes proteins that were detected only in some samples under certain conditions or replicates, especially those with low signals or large expression variations. Additionally, the total protein signal sum excluding mox-YG was almost the same between the vector control and mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4— figure supplement 3A</xref>). This result contradicts the SDS−PAGE findings, which indicate that the total protein mass per cell, including mox-YG, is the same between the vector control and mox-YG overexpression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Therefore, it is considered necessary to adjust the total protein signal sum, including mox-YG, to match that of the vector control to understand the proteome change per cell. In this study, however, we used the most conservative approach by removing proteins with zero values and not applying any overall corrections (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), which allowed the analysis of 3,588 proteins. Although this may not correctly analyze &quot;per cell&quot; proteome change, it enables us to capture the change in proteome composition (excluding mox-YG), thus providing information about cellular responses. If the total correction is applied, only 138 proteins were increased (<xref rid="fig4s3" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>), most of which are mitochondrial proteins.</p>
<p>For the detected 3,588 proteins above, we compared the increase or decrease of protein groups within each category of KEGG Orthology Level 3 with those outside the category. Analysis was performed on 45 categories, each containing more than 10 proteins, to investigate whether the expression of protein groups in each category was significantly higher or lower under mox-YG overexpression compared to the vector control. Specifically, the average log2FC and its FDR values were calculated using data from three replicates for mox-YG/Vector, and each protein was assigned to a KEGG orthology level 3 category. Next, whether the protein groups within each category showed significantly higher or lower expression changes compared to protein groups outside of their category was tested using the Mann- Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Significant differences were indicated in the graphs with a red border and red stripes. The graphs showed the overall distribution of proteins within each category using violin plots, and only proteins showing significant differences in mox-YG/Vector (log2FC) were highlighted in swarm plots. The significance threshold was set at FDR &lt; 0.05 for all. Only categories where mox-YG overexpression showed significant expression changes were extracted and presented in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> and all 47 categories were shown in <xref rid="fig4s6" ref-type="fig">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>.

<p>A) The genetic tug-of-war (gTOW) method. See Materials and Methods for details. B) Protein quantification method. All proteins present in the cells were labeled with a fluorescent dye (Ezlabel FluoroNeo) and separated by SDS-PAGE. The protein level of the target protein (Protein level) was calculated by subtracting the band at the same position of the vector control (Orange) from the band of the target protein on the gel (Purple), which was estimated from the molecular weight, and dividing the result by the total protein (Green). Other protein (Other protein level) was calculated by subtracting Protein level (%) from the value obtained by normalizing the total protein (Green) of the overexpression strain by the total protein (Red) of the vector control.</p></caption>

The p–values were calculated by performing Welch’s t–test. In the vector control, the addition of 100 ng/mL rapamycin caused significant growth inhibition, whereas in mox-YG overexpressing cells, the inhibitory effect was limited. This highlights a decreased sensitivity to rapamycin in mox-YG overexpressing cells.

<caption><title>Model diagrams showing the hypothetical situation of the cells.</title>
<p>A) In the wild type cells, enough ribosomal proteins (RPs) are produced, resulting in RP-assembled rRNAs and the formation of nucleolus with normal morphology. B) In mox-YG overexpressing cells, the amount of RP is reduced due to translation competition, increasing misassembled rRNA. As a result, degradation of rRNA by exosomes may be accelerated, resulting in abnormal nucleolus morphology and reduction of ribosomes. C) In exosome-deficient cells like the mtr4-1 cells, errors in rRNA processing occur due to the reduction of degradation by exosomes, resulting in the reduction of ribosomes and growth defects. D) In mox-YG overexpressing, exosome-deficient cells, degradation of misassembled rRNA is reduced, and nucleolus formation and ribosome biosynthesis are partially recovered.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>convincing</bold> study advances our understanding of the physiological consequences of the strong overexpression of non-toxic proteins in baker's yeast. The findings suggest that a massive protein burden results in nitrogen starvation and a shift in metabolism likely regulated via the TORC1 pathway, as well as defects in ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus. The study presents findings and tools that are <bold>important</bold> for the cell biology and protein homeostasis fields.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study &quot;Impact of Maximal Overexpression of a Non-toxic Protein on Yeast Cell Physiology&quot; by Fujita et al. aims to elucidate the physiological impacts of overexpressing non-toxic proteins in yeast cells. By identifying model proteins with minimal cytotoxicity, the authors claim to provide insights into cellular stress responses and metabolic shifts induced by protein overexpression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study introduces a neutrality index to quantify cytotoxicity and investigates the effects of protein burden on yeast cell physiology. The study identifies mox-YG (a non-fluorescent fluorescent protein) and Gpm1-CCmut (an inactive glycolytic enzyme) as proteins with the lowest cytotoxicity, capable of being overexpressed to more than 40% of total cellular protein while maintaining yeast growth. Overexpression of mox-YG leads to a state resembling nitrogen starvation probably due to TORC1 inactivation, increased mitochondrial function, and decreased ribosomal abundance, indicating a metabolic shift towards more energy-efficient respiration and defects in nucleolar formation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the introduction of the neutrality index seems useful to differentiate between cytotoxicity and protein burden, the biological relevance of the effects of overexpression of the model proteins is unclear.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Fujita et al. characterized the neutrality indexes of several protein mutants in S. cerevisiae and uncovered that mox-YG and Gpm1-CCmut can be expressed as abundant as 40% of total proteins without causing severe growth defects. The authors then looked at the transcriptome and proteome of cells expressing excess mox-YG to investigate how protein burden affects yeast cells. Based on RNA-seq and mass-spectrometry results, the authors uncover that cells with excess mox-YG exhibit nitrogen starvation, respiration increase, inactivated TORC1 response, and decreased ribosomal abundance. The authors further showed that the decreased ribosomal amount is likely due to nucleoli defects, which can be partially rescued by nuclear exosome mutations.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Overall, this is a well-written manuscript that provides many valuable resources for the field, including the neutrality analysis on various fluorescent proteins and glycolytic enzymes, as well as the RNA-seq and proteomics results of cells overexpressing mox-YG. Their model on how mox-YG overexpression impairs the nucleolus and thus leads to ribosomal abundance decline will also raise many interesting questions for the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors concluded from their RNA-seq and proteomics results that cells with excess mox-YG expression showed increased respiration and TORC1 inactivation. I think it will be more convincing if the authors can show some characterization of mitochondrial respiration/membrane potential and the TOR responses to further verify their -omic results.</p>
<p>In addition, the authors only investigated how overexpression of mox-YG affects cells. It would be interesting to see whether overexpressing other non-toxic proteins causes similar effects, or if there are protein-specific effects. It would be good if the authors could at least discuss this point considering the workload of doing another RNA-seq or mass-spectrum analysis might be too heavy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Protein overexpression is widely used in experimental systems to study the function of the protein, assess its (beneficial or detrimental) effects in disease models, or challenge cellular systems involved in synthesis, folding, transport, or degradation of proteins in general. Especially at very high expression levels, protein-specific effects and general effects of a high protein load can be hard to distinguish. To overcome this issue, Fujita et al. use the previously established genetic tug-of-war system to identify proteins that can be expressed at extremely high levels in yeast cells with minimal protein-specific cytotoxicity (high 'neutrality'). They focus on two versions of the protein mox-GFP, the fluorescent version and a point mutation that is non-fluorescent (mox-YG) and is the most 'neutral' protein on their screen. They find that massive protein expression (up to 40% of the total proteome) results in a nitrogen starvation phenotype, likely inactivation of the TORC1 pathway, and defects in ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work uses an elegant approach and succeeds in identifying proteins that can be expressed at surprisingly high levels with little cytotoxicity. Many of the changes they see have been observed before under protein burden conditions, but some are new and interesting. This work solidifies previous hypotheses about the general effects of protein overexpression and provides a set of interesting observations about the toxicity of fluorescent proteins (that is alleviated by mutations that render them non-fluorescent) and metabolic enzymes (that are less toxic when mutated into inactive versions).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data are generally convincing, however in order to back up the major claim of this work - that the observed changes are due to general protein burden and not to the specific protein or condition - a broader analysis of different conditions would be highly beneficial.</p>
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors identify several proteins with high neutrality scores but only analyze the effects of mox/mox-YG overexpression in depth. Hence, it remains unclear which molecular phenotypes they observe are general effects of protein burden or more specific effects of these specific proteins. To address this point, a proteome (and/or transcriptome) of at least a Gpm1-CCmut expressing strain should be obtained and compared to the mox-YG proteome. Ideally, this analysis should be done simultaneously on all strains to achieve a good comparability of samples, e.g. using TMT multiplexing (for a proteome) or multiplexed sequencing (for a transcriptome). If feasible, the more strains that can be included in this comparison, the more powerful this analysis will be and can be prioritized over depth of sequencing/proteome coverage.</p>
<p>(2) The genetic tug-of-war system is elegant but comes at the cost of requiring specific media conditions (synthetic minimal media lacking uracil and leucine), which could be a potential confound, given that metabolic rewiring, and especially nitrogen starvation are among the observed phenotypes. I wonder if some of the changes might be specific to these conditions. The authors should corroborate their findings under different conditions. Ideally, this would be done using an orthogonal expression system that does not rely on auxotrophy (e.g. using antibiotic resistance instead) and can be used in rich, complex mediums like YPD. Minimally, using different conditions (media with excess or more limited nitrogen source, amino acids, different carbon source, etc.) would be useful to test the robustness of the findings towards changes in media composition.</p>
<p>(3) The authors suggest that the TORC1 pathway is involved in regulating some of the changes they observed. This is likely true, but it would be great if the hypothesis could be directly tested using an established TORC1 assay.</p>
<p>(4) The finding that the nucleolus appears to be virtually missing in mox-YG-expressing cells (Figure 6B) is surprising and interesting. The authors suggest possible mechanisms to explain this and partially rescue the phenotype by a reduction-of-function mutation in an exosome subunit. I wonder if this is specific to the mox-YG protein or a general protein burden effect, which the experiments suggested in point 1 should address. Additionally, could a mox-YG variant with a nuclear export signal be expressed that stays exclusively in the cytosol to rule out that mox-YG itself interferes with phase separation in the nucleus?</p>
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(5) It would be great if the authors could directly compare the changes they observed at the transcriptome and proteome levels. This can help distinguish between changes that are transcriptionally regulated versus more downstream processes (like protein degradation, as proposed for ribosome components).</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>General response</p>
<p>(1) Evaluation of mitochondrial activity in mox-YG overexpression cells</p>
<p>To determine whether the observed “mitochondrial development” seen in transcriptomic, proteomic, and microscopic analyses corresponds to an actual phenotypic shift toward respiration, we measured oxygen consumption in mox-YG overexpression cells. The results showed that oxygen consumption rates were indeed elevated in these cells, suggesting a metabolic shift from fermentation toward respiration. These findings have been incorporated into the revised manuscript as new Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 9, along with the corresponding descriptions in the Results section.</p>
<p>(2) Evaluation of TORC1 Pathway Inactivation in mox-YG Overexpression Cells</p>
<p>While the proteomic response in mox-YG overexpression cells overlapped with known responses to TORC1 pathway inactivation, we had not obtained direct evidence that TORC1 activity was indeed reduced. To address this, we assessed TORC1 activity by testing the effect of rapamycin, a TORC1 inhibitor, and by attempting to detect the phosphorylation state of known TORC1 targets. Our results showed that mox-YG overexpressing cells exhibited reduced sensitivity to rapamycin compared to vector control cells, supporting the idea that TORC1 is already inactivated in the mox-YG overexpression condition.</p>
<p>In parallel, we attempted to detect phosphorylation of TORC1 targets Sch9 and Atg13 by Western blotting. Specifically, we tested several approaches: detecting phospho-Sch9 using a phospho-specific antibody, assessing the band shift of HA-tagged Sch9, and monitoring Atg13 band shift using an anti-Atg13 antibody. While we were unable to detect Sch9 phosphorylation, likely due to technical limitations, we finally succeeded in detecting Atg13 with the help of our new co-author, Dr. Kamada. However, we observed a marked reduction in Atg13 protein levels in mox-YG overexpression cells, making it difficult to interpret the biological significance of any apparent decrease in phosphorylation. Therefore, we decided not to pursue further experiments on TORC1 phosphorylation within the current revision period.</p>
<p>These findings have been summarized in new Figure 4—figure supplement 7, and the relevant description has been added to the Results section.</p>
<p>(3) Phenotypes of Gpm1-CCmut</p>
<p>We focused our initial analysis on the phenotypes of cells overexpressing mox-YG, the protein with the lowest Neutrality Index (NI) in our dataset, as a model of protein burden. However, it remained unclear to what extent the phenotypes observed in mox-YG overexpression cells are generalizable to protein burden as a whole. We agree with the reviewers’ suggestion that it is important to examine whether similar phenotypes are also observed in cells overexpressing Gpm1-CCmut, which was newly identified in this study as having a similarly low NI. We therefore performed validation experiments using Gpm1-CCmut overexpression cells to assess whether they exhibit the characteristic phenotypes observed in mox-YG overexpression cells. These phenotypes included: transcriptional responses, mitochondrial development, metabolic shift toward respiration, and nucleolar shrinkage.</p>
<p>As a result, mitochondrial development and nucleolar shrinkage were also observed in Gpm1-CCmut overexpression cells, consistent with mox-YG. In contrast, the transcriptional response associated with amino acid starvation and the metabolic shift toward respiration were not observed. Furthermore, an abnormal rounding of cell morphology—absent in mox-YG overexpression cells—was uniquely observed in Gpm1-CCmut cells. These results suggest that the phenotypes observed under mox-YG overexpression may comprise both general effects of protein burden and effects specific to the mox-YG protein. Alternatively, it is possible that Gpm1-CCmut imposes a different kind of constraint or toxicity not shared with mox-YG. In any case, these findings highlight that the full range of phenotypes associated with protein burden cannot yet be clearly defined and underscore the need for future analyses using a variety of “non-toxic” proteins.</p>
<p>Given that these results form a coherent set, we have relocated original Figure 3—which previously presented the NI values of Gpm1 and Tdh3 in the original version—to new Figure 6, which now includes all related phenotypic analyses. Correspondingly, we have added new Figures 6—figure supplement 1 through 6—figure supplement 7. The associated results have been incorporated into the Results section, and we have expanded the Discussion to address this point</p>
<p>As a result of these revisions, the order of figures has changed from the original version. The correspondence between the original and revised versions is as follows:</p>

<p>Thank you for your comment. This point is in fact the core message we wished to convey in this study. We believe that every protein possesses some degree of what can be described as “cytotoxicity,” and that this should be defined by the expression limit—specifically, the threshold level at which growth inhibition occurs. This index corresponds to what we term the neutrality index. We further argue that protein cytotoxicity arises from a variety of constraints inherent to each protein. These constraints act in a stepwise manner to determine the expression limit (i.e., the neutrality) of a given protein (Figure 1A). To demonstrate the real existence of such constraints, there are two complementary approaches: an inductive one that involves large-scale, systematic investigation of naturally occurring proteins, and a deductive one that tests hypotheses using selected model proteins. Our current study follows the latter approach. In addition, we define protein burden as a phenomenon that can only be elicited by proteins that are ultimately harmless (Figure 1B). We assume that such burden results in a shared physiological state, such as depletion of cellular resources. Through continued efforts to identify a protein suitable for investigating this phenomenon, we eventually arrived at mox-YG. As the reviewer rightly pointed out, examining only mox-YG does not reveal the full picture of protein burden. In fact, in response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we investigated the physiological consequences of overexpressing a mutant glycolytic protein, Gpm1-CCmut (General Response 3). We found that the resulting phenotype was notably different from that observed in cells overexpressing mox-YG. Going forward, we believe that our study provides a foundation for further systematic exploration of “harmless proteins” and the cellular impacts of their overexpression.</p>

<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 3. Gpm1-CCmut overexpression cells exhibited both phenotypes that were shared with, and distinct from, those observed in mox-YG overexpression cells. To define a unified set of phenotypes associated with &quot;protein burden,&quot; we believe that extensive omics analyses targeting multiple &quot;non-toxic&quot; protein overexpression strains will be necessary. However, such an effort goes beyond the scope of the current study, and we would like to leave it as an important subject for future investigation.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s clear understanding of both the advantages and limitations of the gTOW system. As rightly pointed out, since our system relies on leucine depletion, it is essential to carefully consider the potential impact this may have on cellular metabolism. Another limitation—though it also serves as one of the strengths—of the gTOW system is its reliance on copy number variation to achieve protein overexpression. This feature limits the possibility of observing rapid responses, as immediate induction is not feasible. To address this issue, we have recently developed a strong and inducible promoter that minimizes effects on other metabolic systems (Higuchi et al., 2024), and we believe this tool will be essential in future experiments.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s comments, we conducted two additional sets of experiments. First, we established a new overexpression system in nutrient-rich conditions (YPD medium) that is conceptually similar to gTOW but uses aureobasidin A and the <italic>AUR1d</italic> resistance gene to promote gene amplification (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Using this system, we observed that non-fluorescent YG mutants led to increased expression of mox. Total protein levels appeared to rise correspondingly, suggesting that the overall synthetic capacity of cells might be higher in YPD compared to SC medium. However, the degree of overexpression achieved in this system was insufficient to strongly inhibit growth, meaning we could not replicate the stress conditions observed with the original gTOW system. Further studies will be needed to determine whether stronger induction under these nutrient-rich conditions will yield comparable responses.</p>
<p>Second, we performed a control experiment to examine whether the amino acid starvation response observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells could be attributed to leucine depletion from the medium (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3). By titrating leucine concentrations in SC medium, we confirmed that lower leucine levels reduced the growth rate of vector control cells, indicating leucine limitation. However, <italic>GAP1</italic> induction was not observed under these conditions. In contrast, mox-YG overexpression led to strong <italic>GAP1</italic> induction under similar growth-inhibitory conditions, suggesting that the amino acid starvation response is not simply due to environmental leucine depletion, but rather a consequence of the cellular burden imposed by mox-YG overexpression.</p>
<p>These findings have been incorporated into the manuscript, along with the corresponding figures (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 3), and relevant descriptions have been added to the Results and Discussion sections.</p>

<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 2. We assessed the rapamycin sensitivity of mox-YG overexpression cells—which was found to be reduced—and attempted to detect phosphorylation of the TORC1 target Atg13, although the latter was only partially successful. These findings have been incorporated into the Results section.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>As also described in our General Response 3, we observed nucleolar shrinkage upon Gpm1-CCmut overexpression as well (new Figure 6E and 6—figure supplement 7), suggesting that this phenomenon may represent a general feature of protein burden. The reviewer’s suggestion to test whether this effect persists when mox-YG is excluded from the nucleus is indeed intriguing. However, based on our previous work, we have shown that overexpression of NES-tagged proteins (e.g., NES-EGFP) causes severe growth inhibition due to depletion of nuclear export factors (Kintaka et al., 2020). Unfortunately, this technical limitation makes it difficult for us to carry out the proposed experiment as suggested.</p>

<p>(5) It would be great if the authors could directly compare the changes they observed at the transcriptome and proteome levels.

</disp-quote>
<p>We also considered this point to be important, and therefore compared the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with mox-YG overexpression. However, somewhat unexpectedly, we found little correlation between these two layers of response. As shown in new Figure 3 and 4 (original Figures 4 and 5), while genes related to oxidative phosphorylation were consistently upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in mox-YG overexpressing cells, ribosomal proteins showed a discordant pattern: their mRNA levels were significantly increased, whereas their protein levels were significantly decreased.</p>
<p>Several factors may explain this discrepancy: (1) differences in analytical methods between transcriptomics and proteomics; (2) temporal mismatches arising from the dynamic changes in mRNA and protein expression during batch culture; and (3) the possibility that, under protein burden conditions, specific regulatory mechanisms may govern the selective translation or targeted degradation of certain proteins. However, at this point, we were unable to clearly determine which of these factors account for the observed differences.</p>
<p>For this reason, we did not originally include a global transcriptome–proteome comparison in the manuscript. In response to the reviewer’s comment, however, we have now included the comparison data (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3D).</p>

<p>Major points:</p>
<p>(1) While the study provides a detailed description of physiological changes, the underlying mechanisms remain speculative. For example, the exact reasons for nitrogen source depletion or increased respiration are unclear. The transcriptomic and proteomic data should be complemented by basic growth assay tests on rapamycin or glycerol to strengthen these observations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment has been addressed in General Responses 1 and 2. We conducted oxygen consumption assays and growth assays in the presence of rapamycin, and incorporated these results into the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>We also performed culture experiments using glycerol as a carbon source. However, both the vector control and mox-YG overexpression cells showed extremely poor growth. Although there was a slight difference between the two, we judged that it would be difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from these results. Therefore, we have chosen not to include them in the main text (the data are attached below for reference).</p>

<p>(2) The study mainly focuses on two proteins, mox-YG/ FP proteins and Gpm1-CCmut. Did the authors look also at a broader range of proteins with varying degrees of cytotoxicity to validate the neutrality index and generalize their findings? Such as known cytotoxic proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In our calculation of the Neutrality Index (NI), we use two parameters: the maximum growth rate (expressed as %MGR relative to the control) and the protein expression level. For the latter, we measure the abundance of the overexpressed protein as a percentage of total cellular protein, based on the assumption that the protein is expressed at a sufficiently high level to be detectable by SDS-PAGE. In our view, proteins typically regarded as “cytotoxic” cannot be overexpressed to levels detectable by SDS-PAGE without the use of more sensitive techniques such as Western blotting. This limitation in expression itself is an indication of their high cytotoxicity. Consequently, for such proteins, NI is determined solely by the MGR value, and will inherently fall below 100.</p>
<p>To test whether this interpretation is valid, we re-evaluated a group of EGFP variants previously reported by us to exhibit higher cytotoxicity than EGFP (Kintaka et al., 2016), due to overloading of specific cellular transport pathways. These include EGFPs tagged with localization signals. At the time of the original study, we had not calculated their NI values. Upon re-analysis, we found that all of these localization-tagged EGFP variants indeed have NI values below 100.</p>
<p>This result has been included as a new Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and the relevant descriptions have been added to the Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The partial rescue of ribosomal biosynthesis defects by a mutation in the nuclear exosome is intriguing but not fully explored. The specific role of the nuclear exosome in managing protein burden remains unclear. This result could be supported by alternative experiments. For example, would tom1 deletion or proteasome inhibition (degradation of ribosomal proteins in the nucleus) partially rescue the nuclear formation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in the main text, our interest in exosome mutants was prompted by our previous SGA (Synthetic Genetic Array) analysis, in which these mutants exhibited positive genetic interactions with GFP overexpression—namely, they acted in a rescuing manner (Kintaka et al., 2020). In contrast, proteasome mutants did not show such positive interactions in the same screening. On the contrary, proteasome mutants that displayed negative genetic interactions have been identified, such as the <italic>pre7ts</italic> mutant. Furthermore, the proteasome is involved in various aspects of proteostasis beyond just orphan ribosomal proteins, making the interpretation of its effects potentially quite complex.</p>
<p>Regarding the <italic>TOM1</italic> mutant raised by the reviewer, we attempted to observe nucleolar morphology using the <italic>NSR1-mScarlet-I</italic> marker in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> deletion strain. However, we were unsuccessful in constructing the strain. This failure may be due to the strong detrimental effects of this perturbation in the <italic>tom1Δ</italic> background. As we were unable to complete this experiment within the revision period, we would like to address this issue in future work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) It would be interesting to include long-term cellular and evolutionary responses to protein overexpression to understand how cells adapt to chronic protein burden.</p>

<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We are currently conducting experiments related to these points. However, as they fall outside the scope of the present study, we would like to refrain from including the data in this manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The microscopy of Nsr1 in Figure 6G does not clearly demonstrate the restored formation of the nucleolus in the mrt4-1 mutant. Electron microscopy images would be a better demonstration.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The restoration of nucleolar size in the <italic>mtr4-1</italic> mutant, as shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 5 (original Figure 6_S5), is statistically significant. However, as described in the main text, the degree of rescue by the mutation is partial, and, as the reviewer notes, not clearly distinguishable by eye. It becomes apparent only when analyzing a large number of cells, allowing for detection as a statistically significant difference. Given that electron microscopy images are inherently limited in the number of cells that can be analyzed and pose challenges for statistical evaluation, we believe it would be difficult to detect such a subtle difference using this method. Therefore, we respectfully ask for your understanding that we will not include additional EM experiments in this revision.</p>

In S. cerevisiae, many ribosomal protein genes are duplicated due to gene duplication events, resulting in a total of 136 ribosomal proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ribosome.med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/rpg.cgi?mode=genetable">http://ribosome.med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/rpg.cgi?mode=genetable</ext-link>). However, not all of them are duplicated, and among the duplicated pairs, some can be distinguished by proteomic analysis based on differences in amino acid sequences, while others cannot. As a result, we report that 84 ribosomal proteins were “detected” in our proteomic analysis. To avoid confusion, we have added the following explanation to the legend of Figure 5—figure supplement 1 (original Figure 6_S1), as follows.</p>
<p>“Note that when the amino acid sequences of paralogs are identical, they cannot be distinguished by proteomic analysis, and the protein abundance of both members of the paralog pair is represented under the name of only one.”</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors mentioned that based on their proteomics results, overexpressing mox-YG appears to increase respiration. I think it is worth doing some quick verification, such as oxygen consumption experiments or mitochondrial membrane potential staining to provide some verification on that.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 1. We measured oxygen consumption in mox-YG overexpression cells and found that it was indeed elevated, suggesting a metabolic shift from fermentation toward aerobic respiration.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Similar to point 1, the authors concluded from their proteomics data that the mox-YG overexpression induced responses that are similar to TORC1 inactivation. It might be worth testing whether there is any actual TORC1 inactivation, e.g. by detecting whether there is reduced Sch9 phosphorylation by western blot.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 2. We assessed the rapamycin sensitivity of mox-YG overexpression cells—which was found to be reduced—and attempted to detect phosphorylation of the TORC1 target Atg13, although the latter was only partially successful. These findings have been incorporated into the Results section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors showed that overexpressing excess mox-YG caused downregulated glycolysis pathways. It is worth discussing whether overexpressing glycolysis-related non-toxic proteins such as Gpm1-CCmut will also lead to similar results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 3. Gpm1-CCmut overexpression cells exhibited both phenotypes shared with mox-YG overexpression and distinct ones. These findings suggest that a unified set of phenotypes associated with &quot;protein burden&quot; has yet to be clearly defined, and further investigation will be necessary to elucidate this.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors identify several proteins with high neutrality scores but only analyze the effects of mox/mox-YG overexpression in depth. Hence, it remains unclear which molecular phenotypes they observe are general effects of protein burden or more specific effects of these specific proteins. To address this point, a proteome (and/or transcriptome) of at least a Gpm1-CCmut expressing strain should be obtained and compared to the mox-YG proteome. Ideally, this analysis should be done simultaneously on all strains to achieve a good comparability of samples, e.g. using TMT multiplexing (for a proteome) or multiplexed sequencing (for a transcriptome). If feasible, the more strains that can be included in this comparison, the more powerful this analysis will be and can be prioritized over depth of sequencing/proteome coverage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 3. Gpm1-CCmut overexpression cells exhibited both phenotypes that were shared with, and distinct from, those observed in mox-YG overexpression cells. To define a unified set of phenotypes associated with &quot;protein burden,&quot; we believe that extensive omics analyses targeting multiple &quot;non-toxic&quot; protein overexpression strains will be necessary. However, such an effort goes beyond the scope of the current study, and we would like to leave it as an important subject for future investigation.</p>

<p>(2) The genetic tug-of-war system is elegant but comes at the cost of requiring specific media conditions (synthetic minimal media lacking uracil and leucine), which could be a potential confound, given that metabolic rewiring, and especially nitrogen starvation are among the observed phenotypes. I wonder if some of the changes might be specific to these conditions. The authors should corroborate their findings under different conditions. Ideally, this would be done using an orthogonal expression system that does not rely on auxotrophy (e.g. using antibiotic resistance instead) and can be used in rich, complex mediums like YPD. Minimally, using different conditions (media with excess or more limited nitrogen source, amino acids, different carbon source, etc.) would be useful to test the robustness of the findings towards changes in media composition.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s clear understanding of both the advantages and limitations of the gTOW system. As rightly pointed out, since our system relies on leucine depletion, it is essential to carefully consider the potential impact this may have on cellular metabolism. Another limitation—though it also serves as one of the strengths—of the gTOW system is its reliance on copy number variation to achieve protein overexpression. This feature limits the possibility of observing rapid responses, as immediate induction is not feasible. To address this issue, we have recently developed a strong and inducible promoter that minimizes effects on other metabolic systems (Higuchi et al., 2024), and we believe this tool will be essential in future experiments.</p>
<p>In response to the reviewer’s comments, we conducted two additional sets of experiments. First, we established a new overexpression system in nutrient-rich conditions (YPD medium) that is conceptually similar to gTOW but uses aureobasidin A and the <italic>AUR1d</italic> resistance gene to promote gene amplification (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Using this system, we observed that non-fluorescent YG mutants led to increased expression of mox. Total protein levels appeared to rise correspondingly, suggesting that the overall synthetic capacity of cells might be higher in YPD compared to SC medium. However, the degree of overexpression achieved in this system was insufficient to strongly inhibit growth, meaning we could not replicate the stress conditions observed with the original gTOW system. Further studies will be needed to determine whether stronger induction under these nutrient-rich conditions will yield comparable responses.</p>
<p>Second, we performed a control experiment to examine whether the amino acid starvation response observed in mox-YG overexpressing cells could be attributed to leucine depletion from the medium (new Figure 3—figure supplement 3). By titrating leucine concentrations in SC medium, we confirmed that lower leucine levels reduced the growth rate of vector control cells, indicating leucine limitation. However, <italic>GAP1</italic> induction was not observed under these conditions. In contrast, mox-YG overexpression led to strong <italic>GAP1</italic> induction under similar growth-inhibitory conditions, suggesting that the amino acid starvation response is not simply due to environmental leucine depletion, but rather a consequence of the cellular burden imposed by mox-YG overexpression.</p>
<p>These findings have been incorporated into the manuscript, along with the corresponding figures (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 3), and relevant descriptions have been added to the Results and Discussion sections.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors suggest that the TORC1 pathway is involved in regulating some of the changes they observed. This is likely true, but it would be great if the hypothesis could be directly tested using an established TORC1 assay.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This comment has been addressed in General Response 2.

<p>(4) The finding that the nucleolus appears to be virtually missing in mox-YG-expressing cells (Figure 6B) is surprising and interesting. The authors suggest possible mechanisms to explain this and partially rescue the phenotype by a reduction-of-function mutation in an exosome subunit. I wonder if this is specific to the mox-YG protein or a general protein burden effect, which the experiments suggested in point 1 should address. Additionally, could a mox-YG variant with a nuclear export signal be expressed that stays exclusively in the cytosol to rule out that mox-YG itself interferes with phase separation in the nucleus?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As also described in our General Response 3, we observed nucleolar shrinkage upon Gpm1-CCmut overexpression as well (new Figure 6E and 6—figure supplement 7), suggesting that this phenomenon may represent a general feature of protein burden. The reviewer’s suggestion to test whether this effect persists when mox-YG is excluded from the nucleus is indeed intriguing. However, based on our previous work, we have shown that overexpression of NES-tagged proteins (e.g., NES-EGFP) causes severe growth inhibition due to depletion of nuclear export factors (Kintaka et al., 2020). Unfortunately, this technical limitation makes it difficult for us to carry out the proposed experiment as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) It would be great if the authors could directly compare the changes they observed at the transcriptome and proteome levels. This can help distinguish between changes that are transcriptionally regulated versus more downstream processes (like protein degradation, as proposed for ribosome components).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We also considered this point to be important, and therefore compared the transcriptomic and proteomic changes associated with mox-YG overexpression. However, somewhat unexpectedly, we found little correlation between these two layers of response. As shown in new Figure 3 and 4 (original Figures 4 and 5), while genes related to oxidative phosphorylation were consistently upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in mox-YG overexpressing cells, ribosomal proteins showed a discordant pattern: their mRNA levels were significantly increased, whereas their protein levels were significantly decreased.</p>
<p>Several factors may explain this discrepancy: (1) differences in analytical methods between transcriptomics and proteomics; (2) temporal mismatches arising from the dynamic changes in mRNA and protein expression during batch culture; and (3) the possibility that, under protein burden conditions, specific regulatory mechanisms may govern the selective translation or targeted degradation of certain proteins. However, at this point, we were unable to clearly determine which of these factors account for the observed differences.</p>
<p>For this reason, we did not originally include a global transcriptome–proteome comparison in the manuscript. In response to the reviewer’s comment, however, we have now included the comparison data (new Figure 4—figure supplement 3D).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>(1) The authors repeatedly state that 'mitochondrial function' is increased. This is inaccurate in two ways: first, mitochondria have multiple functions, and it should be specified which one is referred to (probably mitochondrial respiration); second, the claim is based solely on the abundance of transcripts/proteins, which may or may not reflect increased activity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The authors should either perform functional tests (e.g. measure oxygen consumption or extracellular acidification), or change their wording to more accurately reflect the findings.</p>
<p>To more directly reflect our findings, we revised two instances of the phrase “mitochondrial function” to “mitochondrial proteins” in the manuscript. Furthermore, as described in General Response 1, we confirmed that oxygen consumption is elevated in mox-YG overexpression cells. This observation suggests that mitochondrial respiratory activity is indeed enhanced under these conditions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Similarly, the authors state that FPs are 'not localized' (e.g. line 137). This should be specified (e.g. 'not actively sorted into cellular compartments other than the cytosol').</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, we have revised the relevant sections accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 4D, some of the reporter assays don't fully recapitulate the RNAseq findings (e.g. for PHO84 and ZPS1, where mox-FS and mox-YG behave differently in the reporter assay, but not in the RNAseq data). This may stem from technical limitations given that the reporter assay relies on RFP expression which could generally be affected by protein overexpression (cf. ACT1pro in mox-FS), but it should be mentioned in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the confusion caused by our insufficient explanation of &quot;moxFS&quot; in new Figure 3D (original Figure 4D). As clarified here, &quot;moxFS&quot; refers to a frameshift mutant in which the mRNA is transcribed but the protein is not translated due to an early frameshift mutation. This is not a functional mox protein. The behavior of this mutant is nearly identical to that of the vector control, indicating that the transcriptional response observed in this assay is not triggered by mRNA expression itself, but rather by events occurring after protein synthesis begins. Importantly, the transcriptional responses identified by RNA-seq in mox-YG overexpression cells are largely recapitulated by this reporter assay, supporting the reliability of our experimental design.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment, which helped us recognize the lack of clarity in our original description. In response, we have added an explanation of the FS mutation to the figure legend (new Figure 3D), and we have also expanded the description of the moxFS experimental results in the Results section.</p>
