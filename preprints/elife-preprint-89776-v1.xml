<title>Abstract</title><p>Inflammation in ulcerative colitis is typically restricted to the mucosal layer of distal gut. Disrupted mucus barrier coupled with microbial dysbiosis has been reported to occur prior to the onset of inflammation. Here, we show the involvement of vesicular trafficking protein Rab7 in regulating the colonic mucus system. We identified a lowered Rab7 expression in goblet cells of colon during human and murine colitis. <italic>In vivo</italic> Rab7 knocked down mice (Rab7<sup>KD</sup>) displayed a compromised mucus layer, increased microbial permeability and depleted gut microbiota with enhanced susceptibility to dextran sodium-sulfate induced colitis. These abnormalities emerged owing to altered mucus composition, as revealed by mucus proteomics, with increased expression of mucin protease Chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1). Mechanistically, Rab7 maintained optimal CLCA1 levels by controlling its lysosomal degradation, a process that was dysregulated during colitis. Overall, our work establishes a role for Rab7 dependent control of CLCA1 secretion required for maintaining mucosal homeostasis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A close association of gut with diverse microbial antigens demand for well-regulated mechanisms for tolerance and homeostasis. On a cellular level, intestinal epithelium and local immune cells execute diverse regulatory mechanisms to maintain this intestinal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Goblet cells, a specialized epithelial cell type, participate by secreting mucins that form mucus layer, functioning as the first line of defense against the microbial population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>]. Impairment in mucus layer has been observed before intestinal inflammation in ulcerative colitis (UC), one of the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Active UC patients exhibit reduced number of goblet cells and a compromised mucus layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. This highlights the importance of goblet cell secretory function and mucus layer in UC pathogenesis. Two stratified layers of mucus exist in colon-a loose outer layer permeable to the luminal flora, and a dense adherent sterile inner layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. The core structure of mucus is formed of Muc2. Several other known protein constituents of mucus layer are- FCGBP, CLCA1, TFF3 and ZG16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1) is a metalloprotease exclusively secreted by goblet cells and forms one of the major non-mucin components of mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. It has Muc2 cleaving properties and thus is involved in intestinal mucus dynamics and homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. In view of its ability to protect intestinal epithelium and prevent infections and inflammation, the underlying cause of aspects related to mucus layer alterations during intestinal inflammation needs investigation.</p>
<p>In a recent report focusing on epithelial-immunocyte crosstalk, our group demonstrated a critical role of SENP7, a deSUMOylase in IBD pathophysiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, Rab7, among the several other Rab GTPases identified to physically interact with SENP7, was observed in murine model of IBD. Rab7 protein participates in vesicular transport of a cell, influencing protein turnover, secretion, autophagy and intracellular pathogen survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]â[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Each of these functions is arguably essential in intestinal homeostasis, yet these have not been studied in detail in the context of IBD. With all the knowledge provided earlier, it is apparent that Rab proteins may be crucial molecules for IBD pathogenesis. But surprisingly, not a lot is known about these proteins being involved in implications linked to IBD. In light of this information, in the present study, we aimed to systematically look at the role of Rab7 in UC pathogenesis. Our data suggests that dysregulated Rab7 during colitis modulates the secretions from goblet cells thus triggering inflammation in the gut.</p>

<title>Rab7 expression is reduced during murine and human colitis</title>
<p>To understand the possible role of Rab7 in gut homeostasis and its relevance to colitis we utilized dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) murine model. The animals were fed with 2.5% DSS in their drinking water, their body-weights were regularly monitored. After 7 days of DSS treatment (hereafter DSS mice), they were euthanized and various tissues were harvested for analysis. Compared to control mice which were given normal drinking water, the DSS mice displayed discernible signs of inflammation including reduced body weight, decreased colon length and various histopathological features (as depicted previously by Suhail et. al. 2019). We examined Rab7 expression in inflamed intestine harvested from DSS-colitis mice. A significant reduction of Rab7 protein was seen in tissue lysates of distal colon from DSS mice compared to healthy control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of colon sections revealed ubiquitous presence of Rab7 protein over whole tissue with intensified expression in crypts and other zones of epithelium in healthy mice which got significantly lessened in DSS mice (inset of <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>). To further understand the dynamics of the Rab7 expression change during the course of disease development, DSS treatment was given for different time durations i.e. for three days (DSS 3), five days (DSS 5) and seven days (DSS 7) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1B</xref>). Increased duration of DSS treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in body weight (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C</xref>) and colon length (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1D</xref>) in DSS 7 and DSS 5 mice when compared with DSS 3 mice. DSS 5 and DSS 7 mice also displayed increased splenomegaly (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1E</xref>) mirroring severe inflammation seen during human IBD. While whole colonic tissue lysate and crypts (isolated from colons of mice) showed upregulated expression of Rab7 at the early inflammation states (DSS 3-5) (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1F</xref>), interestingly, the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) displayed significant reduction in expression of Rab7 at the early onset of colitis from day 3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate if these observations are relevant to Human IBD, we carried out a systematic analysis of Rab7 in human UC endoscopic samples. Details of the patientâs clinical parameters are summarized in <xref rid="tblS1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>. A total of 65 human samples were utilized for different experiments. qRT-PCR of 22 colonoscopy tissue samples each of UC and controls revealed â¼ â11 fold downregulation of <italic>Rab7</italic> in colitis relative to healthy controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). The downregulation was also evident at protein levels as revealed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). In Crohnâs disease (CD), another form of IBD, similar pattern was visible (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1G</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1H</xref>). To evaluate any correlation between Rab7 expression and disease severity, UC patients were grouped into mild (score 2-4), moderate (score 5-6) and remission (score 0-1) based on ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) score. At the transcriptional level, a decrease in Rab7 expression was observed, with more reduction in moderate patients (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). The lowering of expression was correlative to disease severity as noticed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>). Notably, similar expression alteration of Rab7 was observed in UC remission patients (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1I</xref>). Together these data suggest that Rab7 is reduced during murine and human colitis.</p>

<title>Goblet cells of intestine display dominant expression of Rab7</title>
<p>The results of the immunoblotting and qRT-PCR clearly indicate the lowering of Rab7 protein. Although this decrease could be a result of lower cellular expression, a decrease in the number of Rab7-positive cells or an increase in Rab7-negative cells. For a finer understanding, Rab7 was examined for its localization in specific cell types and defined regions of the intestine. Sections of small intestine, proximal and distal colon part of healthy mice were immunostained for Rab7. In line with the earlier data, apart from intestinal crypts, IHC showed Rab7 specific staining in certain portions of the epithelial lining. A closer look revealed that the staining was higher in cells having a vacuolated morphology, a specific characteristic of goblet cells of the epithelium (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>). Further, colocalizing Rab7 with UEA1, a goblet cell specific marker, confirmed dominant expression in secretory cells of intestine i.e. goblet cells (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). Notably, Rab7 was seen in both crypt based and inter crypt goblet cells (inset in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). We further examined for additional changes in sub-tissue level Rab7 protein expression pattern during colitis. Interestingly, immunofluorescence based staining of Rab7 and goblet cells in colonic sections of DSS mice revealed significantly reduced levels of Rab7 distinctively in goblet cells compared to control mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained in the case of UC patient colonic biopsy sections with respect to healthy controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>

<p>Goblet cells have a secretory role and as such involve a vigorous and tightly regulated intracellular vesicle trafficking system. Since, Rab7 GTPase is a key regulator of cellular vesicle transport pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], we investigated its possible role in goblet cell function in the context of intestinal inflammation. Pluripotent HT29 cells were cultured in media and condition that is known to induce their differentiation into goblet-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Post culturing, the cells showed vacuolated cell morphology along with a loss of expression of Lgr5, stem cell marker, and a concomitant increase in Muc2, a goblet cell specific marker (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref>). Interestingly, compared to undifferentiated HT29 cells, these goblet-like cells showed an increased expression of Rab7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D</xref>). To reconfirm these findings in an alternate cell type, we used HT29-MTX-E12 cells, a differentiated goblet-like cell line. In these cells Rab7 was detectable using gold-labeled antibodies in immune-electron microscopy. Moreover, ultrastructural details (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E</xref>) showed Rab7 protein to be present in the vicinity of secretory vesicles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that Rab7 may be involved in regulating the goblet cell function in the intestine.</p>

<title>Knock-down of Rab7 <italic>in vivo</italic> aggravates DSS-induced colitis in mice</title>
<p>A reduction in Rab7 protein levels during colitis specifically in goblet cells prompted us to further investigate its role in intestinal inflammation. Rab7 knockout mice are embryonic lethal, therefore we developed a transient Rab7 knock-down mice model using an in-house nanogel based oral nucleic acid delivery system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Briefly, mice were fed with either scrambled (C<sup>Scr</sup>) or Rab7 specific siRNA (Rab7<sup>KD</sup>) engineered with nanogel. A sub-group of each category of mice was then fed with DSS (DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup>, DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup>) or left untreated (C). Schematic representation that summarizes the different treatments to mice is presented (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). Interestingly, only 4 days of DSS administration was able to generate severe inflammation in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice which was atypical for DSS-colitis model. This was evident by reduced body weight (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>), diarrhea and rectal bleeding (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). These mice were dissected and relevant organs were harvested for further analysis. Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from colon to check for the expression of Rab7 after siRNA treatment through western blot. Almost 50% of protein expression was reduced in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice groups, thus confirming successful knock-down (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). No significant alterations in Rab7 expression were visible in other organs such as spleen, MLN and liver proving no off-targeting of nucleic acid by nanogel (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3A</xref>). DSS and DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice showed a significant reduction in colon length with inflamed appearance in comparison to C, C<sup>Scr</sup> and Rab7<sup>KD</sup> groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Notably, the features were more severe in the case of DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> group in comparison to DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice. In line with this we observed splenomegaly in DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> group depicting higher inflammation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). H&amp;E staining of distal colon of DSS+ Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice showed exacerbated signs of inflammation such as immune cell infiltration, colonic wall thickening, goblet cell and crypt loss and epithelial erosion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). While many of these signs were evident in DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice, in DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> group the intensity was higher as can be seen in the histopathology score plot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). Mucus scrapings from the colons of different groups of mice were examined for the presence of TNFÎ±, the key proinflammatory cytokine. ELISA revealed a significant upregulation of TNFÎ± in DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice, which was further higher in DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3I</xref>). These data led us to conclude that downregulation of Rab7 heightens DSS induced colitis in mice, thus hinting towards its functional importance during colitis.</p>

<title>Depletion of Rab7 in intestinal epithelium modulates mucus layer permeability and gut microbiota</title>
<p>Goblet cells primarily function to secrete mucins which release to form a mucus layer protective for the mucosal surface. Dysfunction of goblet cells leading to reduced mucus layer secretion and decreased barrier function is a frequent abnormality reported in UC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. We observed a conspicuously higher expression of Rab7 in goblet cells in steady state, while reduction during colitis as seen in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>. Based on these data, we hypothesized that Rab7 perturbation would impact goblet cell function and mucus secretion. To test this, histological examination of the colon from various groups described above was carried out through Alcian-blue staining for mucins. DSS-treated mice groups showed a significantly decreased staining indicating reduced goblet cell number. Notably, this phenotype was observed in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice colon also, although the data was not significant (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3B</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3C</xref>). For the analysis of the mucus, thickness of the inner mucus layer (IML) was measured in Alcian blue-stained colon specimens. As expected, the decrease in goblet cell number was accompanied by thinning of the mucus layer in both the DSS-treated mice groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). Surprisingly, in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice IML was significantly much wider and seemed to be less dense showing a lighter stain of alcian blue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). This led us to expect alterations in the permeability of the mucus layer. We speculated that depletion of or lack of Rab7 may be resulting in compromised mucus properties. To test this, initially a Rab7 knockout HEK cell line (hereafter HEK Rab7<sup>-/-</sup>) was generated. Knockout in intestinal epithelial cells was attempted but we were unable to obtain a line without Rab7 expression. HEK Rab7<sup>-/-</sup>or HEK WT cells were transfected with pSNMUC2-MG plasmid (a kind gift from Professor Gunnar C Hansson, University of Gothenburg). This plasmid expresses human Muc2 N-terminal domains fused with GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Surprisingly, the Muc2 protein was seen to be not forming a theca and was scattered over cell cytoplasm as compared to wildtype cells corroborating the above <italic>in vivo</italic> data (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S3D</xref>).</p>

<p>To check for any alterations in the permeability of the IML of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice, we analyzed the colon sections, using published protocol, for bacterial presence in the mucus layer by fluorescence-in situ hybridization (FISH) involving a universal bacterial probe EUB388. In control mice as anticipated, bacteria were detected in the outer mucus layer but not in inner layer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). On the contrary, in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice, in spite mucus layer being wider several bacteria were detected in the inner mucus layer verifying increased permeability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice showed a dramatic increase in number of bacteria penetrating the inner layer. As, there was complete invasion of bacteria to epithelium surface in case of DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> treated mice, quantification of the number of penetrating bacteria was unworkable. These data clearly indicated towards the involvement of Rab7 in modulating the mucus secreting function of goblet cells which further alters the mucus layer characteristics leading to bacterial breach and generation of inflammation.</p>
<p>Besides mucus barrier integrity, intestinal microbiota plays an important role in gut inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. We analyzed the microbial community in stool samples of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> and DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> compared to C<sup>Scr</sup> mice. Our main motive here was to specifically examine alterations in microbial diversity/abundance in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice relative to DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> and C<sup>Scr</sup> mice. Fecal samples were collected at day 5 of DSS treatment in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice model, particularly since these mice display significant inflammation by day 5 due to Rab7-deficiency. As anticipated, Shannon index plot showed decreased microbial diversity richness and evenness in DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice groups (Âµ<sub>median</sub>=3.67). This phenotype was more severe in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice (Âµ<sub>median</sub>=3.46) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Further, principal-coordinates analysis (PCoA) indicated that each of the three groups assumed a discrete cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Similar divergence among the DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> and C<sup>Scr</sup> were seen in non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plots (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4A</xref>). While, each group displayed presence of some unique Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), some shared OTUs were also notable (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Beta diversity index heatmap revealed differences in the microbial diversity among different experimental mice groups (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4B</xref>). The map clearly indicated a shift in microbial diversity in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice such that they appeared to occupy an intermediate position between C<sup>Scr</sup> and DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice. Substantial differences in the relative abundance of many microbes were found (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). At the phylum level, bacteroidetes, showed an increase in abundance, whereas firmicutes were significantly less represented in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> and DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice groups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). The other analyzed phyla did not show any significant changes. Firmicutes are known to get less abundant in IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Class level analysis revealed that the Firmicutes reduced were clostridia, while the abundance of Bacteroidia was more among Bacteroidetes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). Abundance of several other microbes getting altered could be appreciated at family, order, genus and species level (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4C</xref>). Genus such as <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Parabacteroidetes</italic> were found to be significantly altered in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice in comparison to C<sup>Scr</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). Intriguingly, compared to CScr mice, Rab7KD and DSS+CScr mice showed a decrease in the abundance of a particular category of bacterial species (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S4D</xref>, red box). The majority of these contained probiotic microorganisms. These include <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus helveticus</italic>, both of which have been thoroughly researched in relation to colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]â[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. All these data demonstrated aberrant composition of gut microbiota of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice with more similarity with DSS mice inflamed gut microbiota.</p>

<title>Rab7 perturbation impacts mucus composition in colon</title>
<p>We next sought to investigate in details the alterations in the colonic mucus composition in Rab7 perturbed mice which might influence penetrability and gut microbiota. The secreted mucus is composed of a mixture of proteins, including those contributing to mucus gel architecture, antimicrobial peptides and regulatory processes. We went on to investigate any modifications in the total amount or composition of the secreted mucus of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice. Mice colon was harvested and secreted mucus was isolated by gentle scrapping using a rubber policeman (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) and run on a mucin gel stained with alcian blue dye. No significant change was observed in the total mucin content between any of the groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). We speculated that there may be changes in specific components of mucus. For identification of proteins in the secreted mucus, isolated mucus samples were subjected to reducing buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE followed by high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (mucus proteomics) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Raw data was analyzed in MaxQuant software (v1.6.0.16). Masses were searched against the mouse UniProt proteome database and additional databases such as miceMucinDB and VerSeDa. 522 proteins were detected among different mice groups (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>) of which 288 were common in all along with some unique proteins in each group as is evident through the venn diagram (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed proper grouping of the biological replicates from different experimental groups (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5A</xref>). Label free quantification identified approximately 500 differentially expressed proteins among the samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Significantly altered proteins were analyzed with FDR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). Proteins observed to be differentially expressed in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice in comparison to C<sup>Scr</sup> mice or DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice and DSS+C<sup>Scr</sup> mice are represented in respective volcano plots (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>). These proteins were part of certain pathways over represented in Gene ontology (GO) analysis like extracellular exosome biogenesis, vesicle localization, calcium-dependent phospholipase A2 activity based on biological processes (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5B</xref>) and molecular function (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5C</xref>). All the proteins which displayed significant differential expression were localized in different subcellular compartments (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5D</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5E</xref>). Some cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were also represented in this which may be debris or exudates from lysed cells. Certain secretory proteins such as Chloride channel accessory 1 (CLCA1), Apolipoprotein AI (APOA1) and Transferrin (Tf) caught our interest as they were seen to be upregulated in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice group when compared with the C<sup>Scr</sup> (highlighted in red in <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5D</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5E</xref>). As, transferrin or Tf is an iron binding glycoprotein secreted from the liver, their increased amount in mucus indirectly hinted towards the decrease in transferrin receptors (TFRC) in the intestinal cells which uptake them. We therefore examined the expression level of <italic>CLCA1</italic>, <italic>APOA1</italic> and <italic>TFRC</italic> in colon tissue through qRT-PCR analysis. While <italic>TFRC</italic> showed down expression in DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice, no significant change was observed for <italic>CLCA1</italic> and <italic>APOA1</italic> (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5F</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5G</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S5H</xref>). In case of <italic>CLCA1</italic>, several folds downregulation at RNA level in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> and DSS+Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice was seen, although the changes were non-significant. CLCA1 is a protease exclusively secreted by goblet cells and forms one of the major mucus components. It has recently been demonstrated that CLCA1 helps in maintaining the dynamics of mucus layer in colon by processing Muc2. The CAT/Cys and VWA domain containing part of CLCA1 protein (53 kDa) has maximum Muc2 cleaving property. We went on to check for the expression of CLCA1 at protein levels in the mucus of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice. Remarkably, CLCA1 (53 kDa) was found to be highly upregulated in mucus samples of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> followed by DSS-treated mice compared to controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). CLCA1 could thus be an interesting and probable candidate to justify modifications in mucus layer with its increased secretion in mucus upon Rab7 knock-down in mice.</p>

<title>Altered Rab7 influences CLCA1 expression in goblet cells</title>
<p>We investigated the expression alteration of CLCA1 in human UC. Earlier, van der Post et al. 2019 reported CLCA1 to be getting downregulated in active UC patients. In line with this, qRT-PCR analysis of <italic>CLCA1</italic> in 22 UC and control biopsy samples each revealed significant downregulation in UC relative to healthy controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). Next, expression of CLCA1 protein was investigated in tissue and secreted mucus from UC patients (same as used for analyzing Rab7 expression in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). To achieve that, human colon biopsies were treated with N-Acetyl cysteine, a mucolytic agent, to isolate secreted mucus (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S6A</xref>). The mucus samples obtained this way and the remaining tissues were processed separately for immunoblotting. Interestingly, similar to the Rab7 knock-down mice, a higher expression of CLCA1 was seen in these human UC samples compared to healthy controls both in tissue and secreted mucus (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between expressions of Rab7 and CLCA1 both in tissue and secreted mucus of human colon biopsies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>). Also, the immunostaining of Rab7 and CLCA1 in human UC and control colon sections revealed higher expression of CLCA1 in crypts and goblet cells of UC compared to healthy controls, opposite to the pattern seen for Rab7 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7E</xref>). These data depicted that CLCA1 protein expression is increased in tissue resulting in higher secretion into mucus during colitis.</p>
<p>To examine the mechanism of possible Rab7 mediated control of CLCA1 secretion, we used HT29-MTX-E12, cultured goblet cells. siRNA mediated knock-down of Rab7 was carried out in these cells followed by analysis of CLCA1 protein expression. We observed an increase in CLCA1 expression in the Rab7 knocked down cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). Further, overexpression of Rab7-GTP locked form (active Rab7) lowered CLCA1 in cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7G</xref>). All this data led us to anticipate the involvement of Rab7 in regulating the CLCA1 expression in the goblet cells of intestine.</p>
<p>Since currently there are no reports addressing CLCA1 protein stability in goblet cells, we carried out experiments to delineate this further. HT29-MTX-E12 cells were treated with MG132 (proteasome inhibitor) and bafilomycin (lysosome inhibitor) and CLCA1 expression was checked. CLCA1 showed rescue upon bafilomycin treatment confirming that it gets degraded via lysosomal pathway (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7H</xref>). No significant change was seen in CLCA1 expression upon proteasomal pathway inhibition (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S6C</xref>). We speculated a role for Rab7 in regulation of CLCA1 protein turnover via lysosomal degradation pathway, since Rab7 GTPase is known to facilitate fusion of late endosomes to lysosomes for degradation. Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) images revealed colocalization of Rab7-CLCA1 with lysosomes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>). Further, Rab7 was knocked down in HT29-MTX-E12 cells and the process of CLCA1 fusion with lysosomes was imaged using confocal microscopy. The images revealed less colocalization of CLCA1 with lysosomes upon Rab7 knock-down as compared to vehicle control (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7J</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7K</xref>). Together, these data suggested modulation of CLCA1 protein degradation by Rab7 in goblet cells. Overall, our data highlights a crucial role of Rab7 in maintaining gut homeostasis. Rab7 downregulation, as observed during colitis, results in increased CLCA1 in goblet cell and thereby a higher secretion. These changes adversely affect the mucus layer, the composition of microbiota and epithelial barrier function altogether leading to inflammation (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Rab7 maintains mucus layer dynamics in intestine by regulating degradation of CLCA1 protein via lysosomal fusion</title>
<p>Healthy intestine inhabits lumen microbes well separated by mucus layer secreted by goblet cells along with CLCA1 protein in balanced levels (1). During colitis, Rab7 downregulates along with increased expression of CLCA1 resulting in diffused mucus layer penetrable to microbes (2). In a goblet cell, CLCA1 filled vacuoles destined for secretion are rerouted for degradation pathway by Rab7 and fuse with lysosomes (3) leading to a balanced release outside the cell (4). However, during inflammation the loss of Rab7 consequently impedes CLCA1 degradation (5) fostering its increased secretion from the cell (6) (Created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://BioRender.com">BioRender.com</ext-link>).</p></caption>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we report significant contribution of one of the essential cellular protein i.e. Rab7 GTPase in colitis pathogenesis. Rab GTPases are amongst the fundamental proteins of a cell regulating important cellular mechanisms like membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. A number of comprehensive studies summarizing the molecular, physiological and pathological aspects of vesicle transport system link trafficking proteins dysfunction with human diseases such as carcinoma, neurodegenerative disorders, charcot-marie-tooth type B and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]â[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Interestingly, the involvement of Rab GTPases in underlying mechanisms implicating IBD is still not well understood. Rab5, Rab34 and Rab11 have earlier been reported to contribute to correct assembly and maintenance of junctional complexes in intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Dislocation of Rab13 has been shown in patients with Crohnâs disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>].</p>
<p>Rab7 protein was strikingly observed to be down expressed during human and murine colitis. To explain the discordance about Rab7 getting upregulated in crypts of IBD patients as observed by Gang Du et al., 2020, we systematically analyzed different phases of inflammation development at diverse regions of intestinal mucosa. It seems Rab7 downregulation is dependent on stages of inflammation progression and the pattern varies between regions of the intestine viz. epithelium and crypts.</p>
<p>Using an inhibitor (CID1067700) of Rab7, its role in impairing B-cell class switching during murine lupus has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Though specific to inhibit Rab7 GTPase activity, using this inhibitor limits the user to distinctively target any specific organ. In the current study we have exploited a recently created technique to deliver nucleic acids to intestine. Although being transient, this mouse model appears promising to briefly study and understand the outcomes of gut-specific knock-down of Rab7. Successful knock-down of Rab7 in mice intestine revealed several cues regarding its role in intestinal homeostasis. DSS treatment to Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice displayed worsening of inflammation in the intestine. This explains that down expression of Rab7 during colitis can be the cause of disease.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis pathogenesis is majorly associated with decreased number of goblet cells which in turn attributes to compromised mucus layer. A recent report describes that the reduction in mucus layer is related to reduced secretory function of remaining goblet cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Though ubiquitously expressed in all cell types, dominant expression of Rab7 in goblet cells of intestine was unpredicted. The fact that Rab7 was specifically getting altered in goblet cells during colitis was rather intriguing and necessitated us to investigate in this aspect. Our findings revealed alterations in thickness and permeability leading to disrupted sterility in the inner mucus layer of Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice. Further, dysbiosis in luminal microbiota was also evident through 16S metagenomics analysis. Reduction in Firmicutes is the most consistent observation in IBD patients. Our data shows significantly decreased abundance of Clostridia, a class of Firmicutes in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice.</p>
<p>Alterations in the mucus layer characteristics could be attributed to changes in its composition. A report on alterations of colonic mucus composition in UC shows that the structural weakening of mucus layer is due to reduction in 9 proteins among the 29 mucus core proteins such as Muc2, FCGBP, ZG16 and CLCA1. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed changes in the mucus composition upon Rab7 perturbation in mice colon. It was seen that CLCA1, among the few altered proteins, was surprisingly upregulated in Rab7<sup>KD</sup> mice. Several omics studies in human UC patients have suggested variations in the CLCA1 protein expression during inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. In an attempt to investigate this protein in colitis, a series of studies negated the involvement of CLCA1 in gut inflammation until recently by using <italic>ex vivo</italic> assays it was revealed that CLCA1 is important in maintaining the intestinal homeostasis and possess Muc2 cleaving properties thus plays role in regulating the mucus dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. CLCA1 poses to be an apt candidate to justify modifications in mucus layer upon Rab7 knock-down in mice.</p>
<p>Lack of knowledge regarding the secretion, regulation and stability of CLCA1 in a cell led us to investigate it at a deeper level. Our data reveals that Rab7 is responsible to direct the CLCA1 containing vesicles towards lysosomes for further degradation. No report has shown the presence of its free molecules in cytoplasm. However, we are not certain whether CLCA1 exclusively localizes in vesicles. It is evident that goblet cells maintain a basal level of CLCA1 to be secreted out in order to maintain the mucus dynamics and homeostasis. Rab7 perturbation disturbs this balance and thus leads to disrupted mucus layer dynamics and sterility which may initiate inflammation. Together, in the present study we establish the importance of Rab7 in maintaining the intestinal homeostasis by regulating the secretory functioning in the gut. Specifically, the involvement of Rab7 in managing core mucus component CLCA1 opens up avenues for therapeutic interventions. Our findings demonstrate the importance of a fundamental protein like Rab7 which can pose to be the root causative for initiating incurable diseases like IBD.</p>

<p>Assessment:</p>
<p>The manuscript titled 'Rab7 dependent regulation of goblet cell protein CLCA1 modulates gastrointestinal 1 homeostasis' by Gaur et al discusses the role of Rab7 in the development of ulcerative colitis by regulating the lysosomal degradation of Clca1, a mucin protease. The manuscript presents interesting data and provides a potential molecular mechanism for the pathological alterations observed in ulcerative colitis. Gaur et al demonstrate that Rab7 levels are lowered in UC and CD. However, a similar analysis of Rab7 levels in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) patient samples was conducted recently (Du et al, Dev Cell, 2020) which showed that Rab7 levels are found to be elevated under these conditions. While Gaur et al have briefly mentioned Du et al's paper in passing in the discussion, they need to discuss these contradictory results in their paper and clarify these differences. Additionally, Du et al are not included in the list of references.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript used a multi-pronged approach and compares patient samples, mouse models of DSS, and protocols that allow differentiation of goblet cells. They also use a nanogel-based delivery system for siRNAs, which is ideal for the knockdown of specific genes in the gut.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Du et al, Dev Cell 2020 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.03.002">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.devcel.2020.03.002</ext-link>) have previously shown that Rab7 levels are elevated in a similar set of colonic samples (age group, number etc) from UC and CD patients. Gaur et al have not discussed this paper or its findings in detail, which directly contradicts their results. Clarification regarding this should be provided.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors report a role for the well-studied GTPase Rab7 in gut homeostasis. The study combines cell culture experiments with mouse models and human ulcerative colitis patient tissues to propose a model where, Rab7 by delivering a key mucous component CLCA1 to lysosomes, regulates its secretion in the goblet cells. This is important for the maintenance of mucous permeability and gut microbiota composition. In the absence of Rab7, CLCA1 protein levels are higher in tissues as well as the mucus layer, corroborating with the anti-correlation of Rab7 (reduced) and CLCA1 (increased) from ulcerative colitis patients. The authors conclude that Rab7 maintains CLCA1 level by controlling its lysosomal degradation, thereby playing a vital role in mucous composition, colon integrity, and gut homeostasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biggest strength of this manuscript is the combination of cell culture, mouse model, and human tissues. The experiments are largely well done and in most cases, the results support their conclusions. The authors go to substantial lengths to find a link, such as alteration in microbiota, or mucus proteomics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are also some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The association of Rab7 with UC in both mice and humans is clear, however, claims on the underlying mechanisms are less clear. Does Rab7 regulate specifically CLCA1 delivery to lysosomes, or is it an outcome of a generic trafficking defect? CLCA1 is a secretory protein, how does it get routed to lysosomes, i.e. through Golgi-derived vesicles, or by endocytosis of mucous components? Mechanistic details on how CLCA1 is routed to lysosomes will add substantial value.</p>
<p>Why does the level of Rab7 fluctuate during DSS treatment (Fig 1B)? Does the reduction seen in Rab7 levels (by WB) also reflect in reduced Rab7 endosome numbers? Are other late endosomal (and lysosomal) populations also reduced upon DSS treatment and UC? Is there a general defect in lysosomal function?</p>
<p>The evidence for lysosomal delivery of CLCA1 (Fig 7 I, J) is weak. Although used sometimes in combination with antibodies, lysotracker red is not well compatible with permeabilization and immunofluorescence staining. The authors can substantiate this result further using lysosomal antibodies such as Lamp1 and Lamp2. For Fig 7J, it will be good to see a reduction in Rab7 levels upon KD in the same cell. In this connection, Fig S3D is somewhat confusing. While it is clear that the pattern of Muc2 in WT and Rab7-/- cells are different, how this corroborates with the in vivo data on alterations in mucus layer permeability -- as claimed -- is not clear.</p>
<p>Overall, the work shows a role for a well-studied GTPase, Rab7, in gut homeostasis. This is an important finding and could provide scope and testable hypotheses for future studies aimed at understanding in detail the mechanisms involved.</p>

<p>We thank and appreciate the reviewer for bringing this point.</p>
<p>The results shown by Du et al, Dev Cell, 2020 depict elevated expression of Rab7 in UC and CD patients compared to controls. In first occurrence, these results appear contradictory, but there may be a few possible explanations for this.</p>
<p>Firstly, Rab7 expression levels may fluctuate in the tissue depending on the degree of the gut inflammation. This can be concluded from our observations in DSS-mice dynamics model and the human patient samples with mild and moderate UC. Furthermore, Du et al provide no information of the severity of the condition among the patients employed in the study. Our motive, in the current work, was to emphasise this aspect. This point was mentioned in the discussion section of the manuscript. However, in view of the reviewerâs concern, we now intend to add a detailed comment on this in the main text of the revised version of the manuscript.</p>
<p>Secondly, the control biopsies in our investigation were acquired from non-IBD patients, and not what was done by Du et al., wherein biopsies from the normal para-carcinoma region of the colorectal cancer patients was used. One can not overlook the fact that physiological and molecular changes are apparent even in non-inflamed regions in the gut of an IBD or CRC patient. It is possible that the observed discrepancy arises due to the differences in the sample type used for comparing the Rab7 expression.</p>
<p>Finally, the main sub-tissue region showing a decrease in Rab7 expression in UC samples, appeared to be the Goblet cells which was not covered by Du et al.</p>
<p>Keeping these points in mind we do not think that there is a contradiction in our findings with that of Du et al., 2020. In the revised  submission some of these explanations will be incorporated.
Include Du et al in the reference list and add the comment in main text.</p>
<p>This was an oversight from our side. We have actually mentioned Du et al., 2020 in the discussion (line number 338) but somehow the reference was missing in the main list. We will ensure that the reference is included in the revised version and that their findings are included both in main text and in the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, the authors report a role for the well-studied GTPase Rab7 in gut homeostasis. The study combines cell culture experiments with mouse models and human ulcerative colitis patient tissues to propose a model where, Rab7 by delivering a key mucous component CLCA1 to lysosomes, regulates its secretion in the goblet cells. This is important for the maintenance of mucous permeability and gut microbiota composition. In the absence of Rab7, CLCA1 protein levels are higher in tissues as well as the mucus layer, corroborating with the anticorrelation of Rab7 (reduced) and CLCA1 (increased) from ulcerative colitis patients. The authors conclude that Rab7 maintains CLCA1 level by controlling its lysosomal degradation, thereby playing a vital role in mucous composition, colon integrity, and gut homeostasis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The biggest strength of this manuscript is the combination of cell culture, mouse model, and human tissues. The experiments are largely well done and in most cases, the results support their conclusions. The authors go to substantial lengths to find a link, such as alteration in microbiota, or mucus proteomics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are also some weaknesses that need to be addressed. The association of Rab7 with UC in both mice and humans is clear, however, claims on the underlying mechanisms are less clear. Does Rab7 regulate specifically CLCA1 delivery to lysosomes, or is it an outcome of a generic trafficking defect? CLCA1 is a secretory protein, how does it get routed to lysosomes, i.e. through Golgi-derived vesicles, or by endocytosis of mucous components? Mechanistic details on how CLCA1 is routed to lysosomes will add substantial value.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful comment. We would like to bring forth the following explanation for each these concerns:</p>
<p>(a) Our immunofluorescence imaging experiments revealed co-localization of Rab7 protein with CLCA1 and the lysosomes (Fig 7I). In addition, the absence of Rab7 affects the transport of CLCA1 to lysosomes (Fig 7J). This demonstrates that Rab7 may be involved in regulation of CLCA1 transport (presumably along with other cargo), to lysosomes selectively. However, we do recognise that the point raised by the reviewer about possible effect of a generic trafficking defect is valid. (b) As mentioned in the manuscript, the trafficking of CLCA1 protein or CLCA1-containing vesicles within the goblet cell is unknown, with no information on the proteins involved in its mobility. The switching of CLCA1 containing vesicles from the secretory route to lysosomes needs extensive investigation involving overall trafficking of the protein. Taken together, the complete answer to both these important questions will need a series of experiments and those may be interesting avenues for future research.</p>

<p>(a) Why does the level of Rab7 fluctuate during DSS treatment (Fig 1B)? (b) Does the reduction seen in Rab7 levels (by WB) also reflect in reduced Rab7 endosome numbers?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a very thoughtful point from the reviewer. We detected a distinct pattern of Rab7 expression fluctuation in intestinal epithelial cells after DSS-dynamics treatment in mice. Perhaps, these changes are the result of complex cellular signalling in response to the DSS treatment. Rab7, being a fundamental protein involved in protein sorting pathway, is expected to undergo alteration based on cells requirement. Presently there are no reports suggesting the regulatory mechanisms that govern Rab7 levels in the gut. (b) We observed reduction in Rab7 expression both at RNA and protein levels. To confirm whether this alteration will lead to reduced Rab7 positive endosome numbers may require detailed investigations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are other late endosomal (and lysosomal) populations also reduced upon DSS treatment and UC? Is there a general defect in lysosomal function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are no direct evidences showing reduction in the late endosomal and lysosomal population during gut inflammation, but few studies link lysosomal dysfunction with risk for colitis (doi: 10.1016/j.immuni.2016.05.007).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The evidence for lysosomal delivery of CLCA1 (Fig 7 I, J) is weak. Although used sometimes in combination with antibodies, lysotracker red is not well compatible with permeabilization and immunofluorescence staining. The authors can substantiate this result further using lysosomal antibodies such as Lamp1 and Lamp2. For Fig 7J, it will be good to see a reduction in Rab7 levels upon KD in the same cell.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used Lysotracker red in live cells followed by fixation. So, permeabilization issues were resolved. Lamp1, as suggested by the reviewer, is definitely a better marker for lysosomes in immunofluorescence studies, but is also shown to mark late endosomes (doi:
10.1083/jcb.132.4.565). As Rab7 protein also marks the late endosomes, using Lamp1 may leave the ambiguity of CLCA1 in Rab7 positive late endosomes versus lysosomes. Nevertheless, we will be carrying out this experiment and the data will be shared in revised version of the work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this connection, Fig S3D is somewhat confusing. While it is clear that the pattern of Muc2 in WT and Rab7-/- cells are different, how this corroborates with the in vivo data on alterations in mucus layer permeability -- as claimed -- is not clear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The data in Fig. S3D suggest the involvement of Rab7 in packaging of Muc2. The whole idea for doing this experiment was to support our observation in the Rab7KD-mice model where mucus layer was seen to be loose and more permeable in Rab7 deficient mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Overall, the work shows a role for a well-studied GTPase, Rab7, in gut homeostasis. This is an important finding and could provide scope and testable hypotheses for future studies aimed at understanding in detail the mechanisms involved.</p>
