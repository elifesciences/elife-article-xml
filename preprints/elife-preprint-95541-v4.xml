<title>Abstract</title><p>Male factors account for almost half of the causes of infertility. In rodents and humans, most of the components of semen are supplied by the seminal vesicles, and they support male reproductive ability, but there are many unknown details. In this study, the metabolic changes in the seminal vesicle epithelial cells were focused on, and the mechanisms by which testosterone affected the seminal plasma composition were investigated. A factor improving the linear motility of sperm was secreted from the seminal vesicles, and it was produced in an androgen-dependent manner. Bioassays, gene expression, and flux analysis studies demonstrated that testosterone promotes glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells via GLUT4, resulting in fatty acid synthesis. ACLY was a critical factor in this metabolic change, which produced fatty acid, especially oleic acid. In conclusion, the critical role of testosterone-induced metabolic changes in the seminal vesicles is to ensure the synthesis of fatty acid. These findings suggest that testosterone-dependent lipid remodeling may contribute to sperm straight-line motility, and further functional verification is required.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Infertility is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the failure to conceive within 12 months despite contraceptive-free sexual intercourse. Its prevalence has increased over the decades and is observed in 17.5% of couples worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The male partner is thought to be solely or in combination responsible for 50% of infertility cases, and the male factor in the etiology of infertility is highly recognized. Male fertility depends largely on the quality of semen composed of sperm and seminal plasma and decreases with aging(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>).</p>
<p>Sperm that have completed spermatogenesis in the testis acquire the potential to fertilize during maturation in the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The physiological change of sperm during fertilization process are collectively referred to as âcapacitationâ. This change is characterized by large-amplitude flagellar beating (called hyperactivation) and developing the capacity to undergo the acrosome reaction, and can be induced by culturing sperm collected from the epididymis in a medium containing bicarbonate and cholesterol acceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). However, once capacitation is complete, sperm cannot maintain this state for a long time. Therefore, even if epididymal sperm that have not been exposed to seminal plasma are artificially inseminated into the cervix or uterus, the fertilization rate remains low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). This is because, <italic>in vivo</italic>, during ejaculation, exposure of epididymal sperm to seminal plasma masks the unintended capacitation as they pass through the female reproductive tract and ensures fertilization of sperm that reaches the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). In other words, seminal plasma plays an important role in fine-tuning the timing of sperm capacitation and in maintaining the sustained sperm motility required to reach the oviduct.</p>
<p>Seminal plasma is mainly produced in the seminal vesicles (approximately 65-75%), with approximately 20-30% produced by the prostate, and small amounts secreted by the bulbourethral and urethral glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). The mixing of seminal fluid with accessory reproductive gland fluid during ejaculation causes semen to clot and liquefy in humans and causes vaginal plug formation in rodents. Vaginal plugs not only inhibit continuous mating but also play a role in maintaining sperm in the uterus and ensuring male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). TGFÎ², a component of seminal plasma, increases antigen-specific Treg cells in the uterus of mice and humans, which induces immune tolerance, resulting in pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Furthermore, SVS2, secreted from the seminal vesicle, is also known to be required for sperm to escape attack by the female immune system in the uterus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In addition, seminal plasma contains various biochemical components that support sperm metabolism, including lipids and organic acids. Differences in the relative size of the accessory reproductive glands reflect differences in the seminal plasma composition. Accordingly, there are considerable differences in the properties of seminal plasma among animal species. Specifically, Rosecrans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>) found significant differences in the levels of most biochemical components in seminal plasma compared to those in blood, with specific factors like fructose being rarely detected in blood but abundant in seminal plasma. Our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) documented that seminal plasma also contains creatine and fatty acids taken up by sperm within minutes. These substances play crucial roles in regulating sperm metabolic pathways and enhancing sperm motility. These observations indicate that seminal plasma not only alters the female immune system to protect sperm but also directly influences sperm metabolic pathways, facilitating the transformation of sperm capable of <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization.</p>
<p>Several specific factors produced by the male accessory glands that contribute to seminal plasma and impact male fertility have been elucidated. For example, surgical removal of seminal vesicles in male mice and rats was associated with infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). The observations that fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and citrate(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) concentrations in seminal plasma of control mice and rats are higher than in castrated animals suggest that the specific metabolism of the accessory glands might be affected by testosterone derived from the testes, which activate intracellular androgen receptors (AR; NR3C4) required for gene regulation of transcription. AR-deficient mice have been found to be infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), and long-term administration of androgen receptor antagonists, like flutamide, abolished male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). AR-deficient mice and transcriptome analyses have identified specific targets of AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In both mice and humans, androgen levels decrease with aging, and their concentrations have been reported to cause a decrease in male fertility, especially ejaculated sperm motility. In addition to impairments in spermatogenesis, a decline in androgen levels may also disrupt the metabolic functions of the accessory glands and alter the composition of seminal plasma. Therefore, the intricate interplay between testosterone and seminal plasma synthesis in the accessory glands requires further investigation.</p>
<p>In this study, various bioassays were done to identify which accessory glands are essential for sperm fertility. Subsequently, comparative <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> analyses were performed using a hypoandrogenic model. In addition, biochemical and molecular techniques such as RNA-seq, flux analysis, mass spectrometry, and knockdown experiments were employed. These analyses revealed that testosterone promotes the synthesis of oleic acid in seminal vesicle epithelial cells and its secretion into seminal plasma.</p>

<title>The effect of androgen-dependent changes in mouse seminal vesicle secretions on the linear motility of sperm</title>
<p>A direct comparison was conducted to clarify the effects of secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles on the motility parameters of epididymal sperm. Since it is difficult to collect the ejaculated semen of mice, a pseudo-seminal plasma was prepared using seminal vesicle secretions and homogenized prostate tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1A</xref>). When seminal vesicle secretions were added to the HTF medium, the sperm motility, progressive motile, the straight line velocity (VSL), and the percentage of linearity (LIN) values increased significantly compared to when only prostate extract was used. However, the curvi-linear velocity (VCL) did not change (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1B-F</xref>). Meanwhile, the secretions from the prostate and seminal vesicles did not affect the viscosity of the medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1G</xref>). These results indicate that sperm exposure to seminal plasma factors significantly improved sperm linear motility (high VSL and LIN).</p>

(G) Viscosity of a solution containing prostate or seminal vesicle secretion with a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL. (H) Experimental design to evaluate the effect of seminal vesicle secretions collected from male mice treated with or without flutamide (50 mg/kg subcutaneously every day for 7 days) on sperm. Note that the donor mice for sperm and seminal vesicle secretions were different. (I-L) Performed bioassay using seminal vesicle fluid after treatment with vehicle (Ctrl) or flutamide: (I) Motile, (J) Progressive motile, (K) LIN, (L) VSL. (M) The high mitochondrial membrane potential (hMMP) was checked by the JC-1 kit. Antimycin (Anti) was used as the negative control for hMMP. Data are mean Â± SEM. n=3-9 independent replicates. The viscosity measurement data were from n=3 repeated experiments using pooled prostate or seminal vesicle extracts from at least 20 mice. Percentage data were subjected to arcsine transformation before statistical analysis. (B-G, I-L) Significance was tested in comparison using Studentâs t-test. (M) Since the results of the Bartlett test were significant, a two-way ANOVA using a generalized linear model was performed. Both the flutamide administration and antimycin addition were significant. The interaction was not significant. Games-Howell was performed as a post hoc test. Different letters represent significantly different groups.</p></caption>

<p>Androgens regulate the functions of seminal vesicles. Therefore, to elucidate whether the seminal vesicle factors, which enhance sperm linear motility, are synthesized in an androgen-dependent manner, bioassays were performed using seminal vesicle secretions collected from control mice or mice treated daily for 7 consecutive days with flutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1B</xref>). The results showed that Motile, Progressive motile, LIN, and VSL were significantly reduced in the sperm cultured in seminal vesicle secretions from flutamide-treated (Flutamide) compared to the sperm cultured in seminal vesicle secretions from controls (Ctrl) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1I-L</xref>). The reduction of VSL, Motile, and Progressive motile were also significantly lower in the sperm treated with seminal vesicle secretions from over 12 months old mice that showed low circulating testosterone levels as compared with the sperm treated with seminal vesicle secretions from young adult mice (3 months old mice) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.2A</xref>,B). Furthermore, JC-1 staining to measure mitochondrial membrane potential, which is important for sperm linear motility, showed a significantly lower percentage of high mitochondrial membrane potential in sperm treated with the secretions of seminal vesicles from flutamide-treated mice and over 12 months old mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1M</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1C</xref>,D, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.2C</xref>). Since flutamide treatment and aging also affect spermatogenesis and sperm motility, it should be noted that epididymal sperm donors differ from seminal vesicle donors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref>). Due to the strong effect of the decapacitation factor, it was found that seminal vesicle fluid, regardless of the presence or absence of androgens, reduces the fertilization rate in <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (Supplemental Figure 1E). The baseline information for the epididymal sperm used in the experiment showed that the sperm were normal (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig.1A</xref>). These results indicated that androgen-dependent changes in seminal vesicle functions alter the levels/activity of seminal vesicle secretion factors, which regulate sperm linear motility. The changes in seminal vesicle functions were also induced by aging.</p>

<title>Testosterone-androgen receptor activity suppresses the proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>To understand the difference between seminal vesicles that secrete factors for enhancing sperm linear motility and those that are impaired in this function, we performed histological analysis of seminal vesicles recovered from mice treated and non-treated with flutamide. In control mice, the seminal vesicle epithelial cells were in a single layer, and androgen receptors were localized in the nuclei of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). However, in mice treated with continuous administration of flutamide, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were multilayered, and the strong accumulation of androgen receptors in nucleus was not observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2A</xref>). To investigate the cause of this multilayering of cells, we performed Ki67 staining, a marker of cell proliferation, and apoptosis detection by TUNEL staining (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2B</xref>). The results showed that the percentage of Ki67-positive cells increased significantly after treatment with flutamide, but the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells did not change, suggesting that the testosterone-androgen receptor pathway is responsible for the inhibition of proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2C</xref>). These changes of abnormal morphology and high proliferation activity were also observed in seminal vesicle of more than 12 months old mice that showed the low level of testosterone in serum (Supplemental Figure 2D-F). Therefore, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were collected and cultured in primary culture, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>. The changes in cell number were counted, and the cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. When cultured without testosterone (c), the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells increased time-dependent manner. However, the addition of testosterone significantly decreased the number of seminal vesicle epithelial cells during the 8-day culture period in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.2E</xref>). Flow cytometry on day 7 revealed a significant increase in the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase and a corresponding decrease in the G2/M phase. The G2/M phase was significantly decreased by the addition of testosterone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F,G</xref>). These results indicate that the testosterone-androgen receptor pathway inhibits seminal vesicle epithelial cells in cell division.</p>

<title>Testosterone alters metabolic gene expression in seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>To better understand the roles of testosterone in suppressing the proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, RNA sequencing was done using the epithelial cells cultured with or without testosterone. DEG (Differential Expressed Genes) analysis revealed that a total of 23,459 genes were identified, including 997 upregulated genes and 3463 downregulated genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by testosterone relative to control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref>). Genes largely upregulated by testosterone included those already reported in seminal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>), such as the Seminal Vesicle Secretion (<italic>Svs</italic>) family (<italic>Svs1</italic>â¼<italic>6</italic>), <italic>Pate4</italic>, <italic>Spinkl</italic>, <italic>Ceacam10</italic>, and <italic>Sva</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3B</xref>,C). Therefore, the primary culture of seminal vesicle epithelial cells used in this experiment was considered to maintain the characteristics of seminal vesicle epithelial cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Many genes were downregulated by testosterone, and those with a high rate of variation included collagen synthase and <italic>Mmp2</italic>, which are involved in extracellular matrix formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3C</xref>). However, KEGG analysis, rather than individual genes, was used to predict functions altered by testosterone. It was found that the expression of genes involved in the metabolic pathway was the most highly affected by testosterone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3D</xref>). Because there is a close relationship between cell proliferation and metabolic activity and between metabolic substrates in seminal plasma and sperm motility, we hypothesized that testosterone induced changes in seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolism alter the components of seminal plasma to mediate the enhancement of sperm motility.</p>

<title>Testosterone shifts the metabolic flux of seminal vesicle epithelial cells</title>
<p>In the presence of testosterone, the addition of glucose significantly activated the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) normalized by the total number of live cells compared to that in epithelial cells cultured without testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4A-C</xref>). These data indicate that testosterone enhances glucose utilization. This leads to the interpretation that testosterone increases the flow of glycolysis by increasing glucose uptake and alters metabolic flux distribution. To determine the metabolic fate of glycolytic end products, seminal vesicle epithelial cells were cultured with and without testosterone. Subsequently, the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate in the culture supernatant normalized by the total number of live cells were measured. The addition of testosterone significantly decreased the pyruvate concentration; however, the lactate concentration did not change significantly (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4D</xref>,E). We therefore examined cellular energy metabolism with a flux analyzer, anticipating that testosterone would elevate glycolytic flux, thereby producing more pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate. Because extracellular pyruvate levels simultaneously declined, we inferred that the cells had an increased pyruvate demand and, at that time, hypothesized that the excess pyruvate would enter the mitochondria to support enhanced oxidative metabolism. Unexpectedly, when measuring mitochondrial respiratory metabolism normalized by the total number of live cells with the flux analyzer, the basal respiratory rate (the electron transport chain activity) was significantly decreased by testosterone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.4F-J</xref>). Oligomycin-sensitive respiration was also significantly suppressed by exposure to testosterone. Furthermore, the FCCP uncoupled respiration and spare respiration capacity were also significantly decreased in response to testosterone treatment. Overall, these data indicate that testosterone promotes the redistribution of metabolic flux. In other words, testosterone increased glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells while decreasing mitochondrial respiration. To determine whether these changes were accompanied by changes in gene expression of specific metabolic-related enzymes, we analyzed gene expression levels.</p>

<p>The expression of genes involved in glucose catabolism and anabolism in the <italic>in vitro</italic> culture system of seminal vesicle epithelial cells was analyzed by qPCR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>). The gene expression of glucose transporter (<italic>Glut</italic>) and enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway was not significantly affected by testosterone, consistent with the results of metabolic flux analysis, which showed that the glycolytic pathway was not enhanced despite the activation of the glycolysis.

<title>Mechanism of testosterone-induced enhancement of glucose uptake and, thereby, fatty acid synthesis</title>
<p>Since it is known that testosterone regulates the intracellular localization of GLUT4, we focused on the intracellular localization of GLUT4 and its glucose uptake capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). The effect of testosterone on glucose uptake in seminal vesicle epithelial cells was analyzed using fluorescence-labeled glucose. As expected from the results of flux metabolic analyses, testosterone treatment significantly increased glucose uptake (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>). Indinavir, a functional inhibitor of GLUT4, significantly suppressed glucose uptake and significantly decreased fatty acid synthesis (the amount of fatty acids accumulated in the cell), which was increased by testosterone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6A</xref>,B).</p>

<p>Furthermore, immunostaining analysis of the localization of GLUT4 in seminal vesicles revealed that GLUT4 was translocated outside the nucleus of seminal vesicle epithelial cells under the presence of testosterone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>). These data suggest that GLUT4 was partially localized at the plasma membrane and contributed to glucose uptake. In contrast, in seminal vesicles from mice continuously treated with flutamide, no strong signal was detected at the presumed location of GLUT4 near the plasma membrane of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, even though the protein expression level was not affected (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6C</xref>,D). The same characteristics were observed in aged mice.</p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the fatty acids synthesis was performed by GC-MS. In seminal vesicles, C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 were detected, in which C18:1 was decreased to an undetectable level in seminal vesicles of mice treated with the flutamide (Supplemental Figure 4A). In the cultured seminal vesicle epithelial cells, C18:1, oleic acid, was significantly increased by the addition of testosterone as observed in the seminal vesicle (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6E</xref>). The expression of <italic>Elovl6</italic> encoding ELOVL6, which desaturates C18:0 saturated fatty acids to C18:1, was significantly up-regulated by testosterone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig.6F</xref>,G).

<title>ACLY expression is upregulated by testosterone and is essential for the metabolic shift that is associated with increased linear motility</title>
<p>ACLY is upregulated in seminal vesicle epithelial cells as a factor that enables the utilization of citrate from the TCA cycle for fatty acid synthesis outside the mitochondria. Therefore, we performed shRNA knockdown experiments on ACLY to clarify the impact of ACLY on the cellular metabolic shift. The addition of testosterone significantly increased the amount of ACLY protein in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A</xref>,B). Viral infection with shRNAs encoding <italic>Acly-</italic>targeted shRNAs markedly decreased the amount of ACLY (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7C</xref>). When ACLY was knocked down using shRNA, the proliferation arrest caused by testosterone was released, and the cells began to proliferate again (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7D</xref>). This knockdown of ACLY increased the oxygen consumption of seminal vesicle epithelial cells in the control and testosterone-treated group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7E</xref>,F). Thus, ACLY expression is associated with mitochondrial metabolic pathway activity in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. Furthermore, the knockdown of ACLY also significantly suppressed testosterone-induced fatty acid synthesis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7G</xref>). According to the GC-MS quantification results, the amount of fatty acids secreted into the culture medium was also reduced by ACLY knockdown. In particular, the enhancement of oleic acid secretion by testosterone was inhibited by ACLY knockdown (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7H-J</xref>). Supernatants from epithelial cells of the testosterone-added group induced motility and linear motility (Highest VSL and LIN; <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7K-N</xref>). However, the knockdown of ACLY significantly reduced the effects of the culture supernatant on sperm motility and LIN (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7K-N</xref>). These results found that cell proliferation stops when a metabolic shift mediated by ACLY occurs, and glucose is reallocated to fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthesis is an important function of the seminal vesicles, and it was found that when testosterone is present, fatty acid synthesis enhancement and cell proliferation stop simultaneously. However, it is not known what effects occur when cell proliferation stops.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Seminal plasma has a variety of functions, including sperm transport, nutritional support, interactions with the female reproductive tract, and especially the regulation of its relationship with the female immune system. Mammalian seminal plasma is secreted mainly from the seminal vesicle and is rich in cytokines, prostaglandins, and SVS family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). For this reason, recent studies have focused on the immunomodulatory function of seminal plasma in the female reproductive tract. On the other hand, fructose and lipids in seminal plasma are the major energy sources for sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>). However, although metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have shown that metabolic substrates are present at higher concentrations in seminal plasma than in blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), how these substrates are synthesized and specifically how they alter sperm motility has not been determined. Moreover, though the motility of ejaculated spermatozoa is known to decrease with aging, few reports have revealed age-related changes in the seminal vesicles, which are responsible for seminal plasma synthesis.</p>
<p>In this study, we focused on the reproductive organs that synthesize seminal vesicle secretion as target organs for testosterone and found that factors formed by testosterone-dependent metabolic changes in seminal vesicles activate sperm mitochondria and enhance their linear motility. Testosterone is known to activate intracellular ARs and alter intracellular metabolic pathways in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) and cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). ARs are known to directly regulate the expression of glycolytic and lipid metabolic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). In the present study, the nuclear localization of AR in seminal vesicle epithelial cells (i.e., functioning as a transcription factor) and the activation of the glycolytic system by testosterone were similar to those in the above cell types. In seminal vesicle epithelial cells, an increased trend in the expression of <italic>Glut3</italic> and an enhancement of GLUT4 function were observed in a testosterone-dependent manner. Such effects of testosterone on glucose metabolism have also been reported in skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, where testosterone leads to the phosphorylation of GLUT4 and enhances its translocation to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). This is consistent with the results of our metabolic flux analyses, which show that testosterone increases the rate of glycolysis in seminal vesicle epithelial cells by increasing glucose uptake. We further confirmed that GLUT4 is the transporter that mediates this glucose uptake using indinavir, a GLUT4-specific inhibitor.</p>
<p>This study suggests that fatty acid synthesis is an important function of the seminal vesicles, which provide an environment where the ejaculated sperm can carry out active metabolism. The shift to fatty acid synthesis was consistent with the cessation of cell proliferation in the presence of testosterone. This mechanism could prevent the seminal vesicles from excessively consuming the substrates necessary for sperm motility. Manipulation of ACLY expression in mouse myoblasts and embryonic stem cells has been shown to alter the TCA cycle into a ânon-normal cycleâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). One advantage of the non-normal TCA cycle is its ability to retain carbon instead of combusting it and to regenerate the cytosolic NAD+ needed to maintain glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). It suggests that ACLY, activated by testosterone, may suppress proliferation by skipping several steps in the mitochondrial TCA cycle and minimizing ATP production associated with aerobic respiration in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</p>
<p>Testosterone has been reported to cause hypertrophy of cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Cell hypertrophy is partly due to the accumulation of fatty acids in the cytoplasm, which causes significant damage to cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). On the other hand, normal cell hypertrophy, especially in myofibers, involves the activation of signaling molecules such as Myc, hypoxia-inducible factor, and Pi3k-Akt-mTor, which regulate metabolic reprogramming in cancer by increasing glucose uptake in the presence of oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). In the present study, induction of ACLY expression by testosterone not only decreased cycling in the TCA cycle, but also promoted glucose assimilation, which played an important role in fatty acid synthesis. Thus, in tissues where fatty acid synthesis is promoted, either Î²-oxidation-dependent ATP production in mitochondria or the secretion of fatty acids occurs to maintain cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>) providing evidence to explain why the presence of fatty acids in the cell has no adverse effect. In accessory reproductive glands, such as the prostate and seminal vesicles, the glucose uptake is activated in a testosterone dependent. However, mitochondrial respiration is not enhanced, cell proliferation is not induced, and the metabolites are used as a substrate for sperm motility. This may be because, in the prostate, pyruvate synthesized by the glycolytic system in response to testosterone is converted to acetyl CoA, which is then converted to citrate in the TCA cycle, citrate is released as the main component of seminal plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>The testosterone-dependent growth of cancerous prostate epithelial cells may be due to genetic mutations, such as elevated expression of the gene encoding aconitase, which converts citrate to isocitrate, which blocks the TCA cycle and inhibits citrate secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). On the other hand, in the analysis of seminal vesicle epithelial cells, testosterone treatment induced the expression of <italic>Acc</italic>, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme for fatty acid synthesis, and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, which desaturates to oleic acid, significantly increasing total saturated fatty acid and oleic acid content. Therefore, testosterone promotes glucose conversion into fatty acids, especially oleic acid, in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. Although there is a commonality in the activation of the glycolytic system testosterone target tissues, the different expression patterns of genes involved in metabolism in mitochondria may exert their specific functions in each tissue. In addition to genes involved in fatty acid synthesis such as <italic>Fasn</italic> and <italic>Elovl6</italic>, <italic>Acly</italic> is also encoded in a region in close proximity to human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11, suggesting that in seminal vesicle epithelial cells, this region is targeted to promote gene expression. The co-regulation of these genes in seminal vesicle epithelial cells leads to synthesizing the fatty acids. Decreased testosterone synthesis in the testes is a phenomenon observed with aging associated with decreased spermatogenesis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). However, the probability of obtaining sperm without ICSI or IVF is extremely low, despite the presence of sufficient numbers of sperm with normal-morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). This indicates that testosterone plays a major role not only in spermatogenesis but also in the functional maturation of sperm. In this study, metabolic abnormalities induced by inhibition of androgen receptor function caused abnormal proliferation of seminal vesicle epithelial cells in aged mice. In other words, the findings of the seminal vesicle epithelial cell culture experiments and flutamide treatment may mimic the changes that occur with aging. Oleic acid synthesis by testosterone-dependent metabolic pathways was regulated in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. It could be assumed that a decrease in testosterone levels causes abnormalities in the components of human semen. In particular, the results open up the possibility of a translational study to detect low testosterone levels in men by testing for oleic acid in semen.</p>
<p>Because seminal plasma contains components specific to certain male reproductive organs, differences in protein composition may reflect pathological processes in these specific organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). However, although proteomic and metabolomic analyses of seminal plasma have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), the functional changes in seminal plasma, especially the effects on <italic>in vivo</italic> fertilization potential, are not fully understood. This is because there are many challenges to measuring the direct relationship between sperm metabolism and movement patterns. It has been suggested that the potential importance of the effect of oleic acid on improving fertility, yet it is too early to conclude this in this study. If a direct causal relationship between fatty acid composition and improved sperm motility is established, differences in the concentration of fatty acids in the seminal plasma will become a predictive marker of the fertilizing ability of semen. The interspecies differences between humans and mice should be interpreted with caution, and the translational aspects to humans are speculative, but this study revealed a testosterone-dependent mechanism of oleic acid production in seminal vesicle epithelium.</p>
<p>Overall, the results of the studies described herein strongly support the hypothesis that testosterone-dependent glucose to oleic acid conversion processes are required for normal seminal plasma functions in the seminal vesicle (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig.9</xref>). This study advances our understanding of the role of testosterone in glucose metabolism and fatty acid synthesis and lays the groundwork for future research in reproductive biology and fertility.</p>

<caption><title>Testosterone-induced metabolic reprogramming in seminal vesicle epithelial cells.</title>
<p>Testosterone promotes glucose uptake by changes in the localization of GLUT4 in seminal vesicle epithelial cells. ATP-citrate-lyase (ACLY) activated by testosterone promotes fatty acid synthesis by skipping some tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle steps. Simultaneously, cell proliferation in the epididymal epithelial cells is suppressed. Testosterone also promotes the synthesis of oleic acid from acetyl-CoA synthesized by ACLY.</p></caption>

<title>Study design</title>
<p>The objective of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of seminal plasma synthesis. Testosterone-dependent changes in the seminal plasma function were examined by comparative analysis of adult mice and flutamide-treated mice. The bioassays of extracts from male accessory glands by epididymal sperm motility analysis were used to examine the seminal plasma components important for sperm function. We also isolated the mouse seminal vesicle epithelial cultured cells, and investigated the synthesis mechanism of the seminal plasma components using RNA-seq, FluxAnalyzer, and shRNA knockdown. Finally, we performed validation using the human epithelial cells.</p>

<title>Bioassay using pseudo-seminal plasma and epididymal sperm</title>
<p>Prostate (mixed anterior, dorsal, lateral, and ventral) and seminal vesicles were collected from adult C57BL/6NCrl mice. Seminal vesicle secretions were obtained by pressing the seminal vesicles immediately after euthanasia. Prostatic extracts were obtained by homogenizing the prostate immediately after euthanasia. Seminal vesicle secretions and prostate extracts collected from one male mouse were dissolved in 500 ÂµL and 200 ÂµL of mHTF medium without BSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>), respectively, then centrifuged at 2000 Ã g for 5 min at room temperature, and the supernatant was collected, and protein levels were determined.

<p>Cauda epididymis sperm recovered from male mouse were dispersed in 500 ÂµL of mHTF without BSA and centrifuged at 300 Ã g, 3 min to wash out epididymis-derived factors. The final protein concentration of prostate and seminal vesicle secretion was adjusted to 10 mg/mL. An aliquot (2 mL) of the pooled prostate or seminal vesicle extracts was conducted the viscosity measurement data using Tuning Fork Vibro Viscometers (SV-1A, A&amp;D Company, Tokyo, Japan). The epididymis sperm was mixed with seminal vesicle secretion and/or prostate extract as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1</xref> and Supplementary Figure 1. The samples were incubated at 37Â°C for 60 min in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Sperm motility patterns were then examined using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA; HT CASA-Ceros II, Hamilton Thorne, Beverly, MA, USA), with software version 1.11.9. The following sperm motility parameters were analyzed: percentage of motile sperm (denoted by a path velocity &gt;40 Î¼m/s and a VSL &gt;20 Î¼m/s), percentage of motile sperm with progressive motility (denoted by a path velocity &gt;40 Î¼m/s and a straightness ratio &gt;60%). Straight-Line Velocity; VSL: The distance between the first and last tracking points of the sperm trajectory divided by the elapsed time. Curvi-Linear Velocity; VCL: The sum of the distances between the centers of brightness in each frame divided by the elapsed time. Linearity; LIN: Measures the straightness of the path.

In FSC-A and FSC-H dot plots and FSC-A and FSC-W dot plots, similar-size cells were accumulated near area; thus, using these plots, again similar-size cells were selected (R2, R3). The cells in R3 were applied to the propidium iodide (PI) histogram plot. Labelling DNA with PI allows fluorescence-based analysis of the cell cycle. The intensity of PI fluorescence correlates with the amount of DNA in each cell. Comparing the G1 and G2 phases, the amount of DNA doubles in the G2 phase, so the fluorescence intensity of the cell population also doubles.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this revised report, Yamanaka and colleagues investigate a proposed mechanism by which testosterone modulates seminal plasma metabolites in mice. The authors have made improvements from the previous version by softening the claim that oleic acid derived from seminal vesicle epithelium strongly affects linear progressive motility in isolated cauda epididymal sperm in vitro. They have also addressed the ambiguous references to the strength of the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility, making the manuscript more balanced and nuanced.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This study addresses an important gap in our understanding of how testosterone influences seminal plasma metabolites and, in turn, sperm motility. The findings provide valuable insights into the sensitivity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells to testosterone, which could improve in vitro conditions for studying sperm motility. The authors have added methodological details and re-performed experiments with more appropriate control groups, enhancing the robustness of the study. These revisions, along with more carefully modified language reflecting measurement nuances, add significant value to the field. The study's detailed exploration of the physiological role of reproductive tract glandular secretions in modulating sperm behaviors is likely to be of broad interest, providing a strong foundation for future research on the relationship between fatty acid beta-oxidation and sperm motility patterns.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the connection between media fatty acids and sperm motility patterns is still not fully conclusive, the authors have taken substantial steps to clarify and tone down their conclusions. The revised manuscript presents a more balanced view, acknowledging the complexity of the relationship and providing a more solid basis for follow-on studies.</p>

<p>Using a combination of in vivo studies with testosterone-inhibited and aged mice with lower testosterone levels, as well as isolated mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells, the authors demonstrate that testosterone induces an increase in glucose uptake. The study reveals that testosterone triggers differential gene expression, particularly focusing on metabolic enzymes. They specifically identify increased expression of enzymes regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to heightened production of 18:1 oleic acid. The revised version of the manuscript significantly strengthens the role of ACLY as a central regulator of seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolic programming. The authors suggest that fatty acids secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells are taken up by sperm, resulting in a positive impact on sperm function. While the lipid mixture mimicking the lipids secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells shows marginal positive effect on sperm motility, the authors have made considerable progress in refining their conclusions. The revised manuscript acknowledges the complexity of pinpointing the specific seminal vesicle fluid component that potentially positively affects sperm function, providing a more measured and credible interpretation of their findings.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Editor's note:</bold></p>
<p>Thank you for taking time and efforts to improve this study. After re-review, two reviewers have a consensus that the connections the fatty acids and sperm motility is still ambiguous. Thus, I recommend to further tone down this conclusion consistently in the title and the text pointed out by reviewers before making a final version of record.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely appreciate the considerable time and effort you and the reviewers devoted to evaluating our manuscript. We have revised the title and text to express the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility more consistently and toned down. With these revisions, we would like to proceed with publishing the manuscript as the Version of Record (VoR). Thank you very much for your guidance in improving our study.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this revised report, Yamanaka and colleagues investigate a proposed mechanism by which testosterone modulates seminal plasma metabolites in mice. Based on limited evidence in previous versions of the report, the authors softened the claim that oleic acid derived from seminal vesicle epithelium strongly affects linear progressive motility in isolated cauda epididymal sperm in vitro. Though the report still contains somewhat ambiguous references to the strength of the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Often, reported epidydimal sperm from mice have lower percent progressive motility compared with sperm retrieved from the uterus or by comparison with human ejaculated sperm. The findings in this report may improve in vitro conditions to overcome this problem, as well as add important physiological context to the role of reproductive tract glandular secretions in modulating sperm behaviors. The strongest observations are related to the sensitivity of seminal vesicle epithelial cells to testosterone. The revisions include the addition of methodological detail, modified language to reflect the nuance of some of the measurements, as well as re-performed experiments with more appropriate control groups. The findings are likely to be of general interest to the field by providing context for follow-on studies regarding the relationship between fatty acid beta oxidation and sperm motility pattern.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The connection between media fatty acids and sperm motility pattern remains inconclusive.</p>

<p>We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the judges for their cooperation in reviewing the manuscript and for your helpful comments, which were instrumental in improving manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Using a combination of in vivo studies with testosterone-inhibited and aged mice with lower testosterone levels as well as isolated mouse and human seminal vesicle epithelial cells the authors show that testosterone induces an increase in glucose uptake. They find that testosterone induces a difference in gene expression with a focus on metabolic enzymes. Specifically, they identify increased expression of enzymes regulating cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, leading to increased production of 18:1 oleic acid. The revised version strengthens the role of ACLY as the main regulator of seminal vesicle epithelial cell metabolic programming. The authors propose that fatty acids are secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells and are taken up by sperm, positively affecting sperm function. A lipid mixture mimicking the lipids secreted by seminal vesicle epithelial cells, however, only has a small and mostly non-significant effect on sperm motility, suggesting the authors were not apply to pinpoint the seminal vesicle fluid component that positively affects sperm function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We greatly appreciate the reviewerâs thoughtful comments and time spent reviewing this manuscript. The relationship between lipids such as fatty acids and sperm motility remains unclear in the current dataset. Therefore, before finalizing the manuscript, we revised the title and text, as suggested by the reviewers, to express this conclusion more cautiously and consistently.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Some additional comments are provided below to aid the authors in improving the quality of the work:</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) In the newly added supplemental figure 5, the authors note that the percentage data were arcisine transformed prior to statistical analysis without providing any other justification. This seems strange, especially for such a small sample size. It seems more appropriate for the authors to use a nonparametric test. Forcing symmetry without knowing what the shape of the true distribution is makes the ANOVA hard to interpret. Additionally, why use pairwise comparisons rather than comparing each group to the control (LM 0%). Also, note that the graphs are not individually labeled to distinguish them in the legend (A, B, C, etc.). Ultimately, the treatment differences don't seem that meaningful, even if the authors were able to observe statistical significance with the somewhat over-manipulated method of analysis.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Ultimately, the conclusion of this experiment (Supplemental figure 5) remains unchanged, but we agree that the relationship between fatty acids and sperm motility remains unclear. Therefore, before finalizing the manuscript, we revised the title and text as pointed out by the reviewers to express this conclusion more cautiously and consistently throughout the manuscript.</p>
<p>Arcsin transform is commonly used for percentage data [Zar, J.H. 2010. Biostatistical analysis., McDonald, J.H. 2014. Handbook of biological statistics.]. If the values are low or high, such as 0 to 30% or 70 to 100%, without arcsine transformation will result in a large deviation from the normality of the data. However, even if such a conversion is performed, it does not necessarily mean that the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance, which are prerequisites for parametric statistical analysis methods, are satisfied.</p>
<p>Given the small sample size and the possibility of non-normal data, we performed ShapiroâWilk tests for each group (n = 6) and found no departure from normality (all p &gt; 0.1). QâQ plots and Leveneâs test (p &gt; 0.1) likewise supported the assumptions of ANOVA. Following the reviewerâs recommendation, we repeated the analysis with a KruskalâWallis test followed by Dunnâs post-hoc comparisons (Bonferroni corrected). Both approaches led to the same conclusions, with non-parametric p-values equal to or smaller than the parametric ones. In the revised manuscript we now report ANOVA as the primary analysis. The author response image includes effect sizes with 95 % confidence intervals, and provide the non-parametric results for transparency.</p>

<p>(2) I appreciate that the authors toned down the interpretation of the effects of seminal plasma metabolites on sperm motility with a cautionary statement on Lines 397-405 and Line 259. However, they send mixed signals with the title of the report: &quot;Testosterone-Induced Metabolic Changes in Seminal Vesicle Epithelial cells Alter Plasma Components to Enhance Sperm Motility&quot;, and on line 265 when the say &quot;ACLY expression is upregulated by testosterone and is essential for the metabolic shift of seminal vesicle epithelial cells that mediates sperm linear motility&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The wording has been softened overall. The title has been changed to âTestosterone-Induced Metabolic Changes in Seminal Vesicle Epithelium Modify Seminal Plasma Components with Potential to Improve Sperm Motilityâ In the results (lines 265-266), we have stated that âACLY expression is upregulated by testosterone and is essential for the metabolic shift that is associated with increased linear motilityâ without implying a causal relationship.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor Comments:</p>
<p>(1) Typo on line 31: &quot;understanding the male fertility mechanisms and may perspective for the development of potential biomarkers of male fertility and advance in the treatment of male infertility.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have made the following corrections. âThese findings suggest that testosterone-dependent lipid remodeling may contribute to sperm straight-line motility, and further functional verification is required.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Line 193: the statement is confusing &quot;Therefore, we analyzed mitochondrial metabolism using a flux analyzer, predicting that more glucose is metabolized, pyruvate is metabolized from phosphoenolpyruvic acid through glycolysis in response to testosterone, and is further metabolized in the mitochondria.&quot; For example, 'Metabolized through glycolysis' is an ambiguous way to describe the pyruvate kinase reaction. Additionally, phosphoenolpyruvate has three acid ionizable groups, two of which have pKa's well below physiological pH, so phosphoenolpyruvate is the correct intermediate rather than phosphoenolpyruvic acid. The authors make similar mistakes with other organic acids such as citric acid.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Rewritten as âWe therefore examined cellular energy metabolism with a flux analyzer, anticipating that testosterone would elevate glycolytic flux, thereby producing more pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate. Because extracellular pyruvate levels simultaneously declined, we inferred that the cells had an increased pyruvate demand and, at that time, hypothesized that the excess pyruvate would enter the mitochondria to support enhanced oxidative metabolism.â (lines 193-198)</p>
<p>The organic acids are now referenced in their appropriate forms (e.g., citrate, phosphoenolpyruvate).</p>

<p>(3) Line: 271: &quot;Acly&quot; should be all capitalized to &quot;ACLY&quot;. The report mixes capitalizing through out and could be more consistent.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewerâs attention to nomenclature and have standardized the manuscript accordingly. Proteins are written in Roman letters, all in capital letters. Mouse gene symbols: italics, first letter capitalize.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) 'Once capacitation is complete, sperm cannot maintain that state for a long time'. The publications cited by the author do not support that statement and this reviewer also does not agree. Lower fertilization efficiency from in vitro capacitated epidydimal sperm does not have to mean capacitation is reversed, it can simply mean in vitro capacitation conditions not accurately mimic capacitation in vivo.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and would like to clarify our position. Our statement does not suggest a &quot;reversal&quot; of active capacitation. Rather, it reflects the well-documented fact that capacitation is a transient process. Sperm that undergo capacitation too early cannot maintain that state for long enough to retain their ability to fertilize at the moment and location of fertilization in vivo.</p>

<p>(2) How do the authors explain the discrepancy between the results shown in Fig. S1E, the increase in sperm motility upon mixing of sperm with SVF and the results reported in Li et al 2025. Mentioning decapacitating factors without further explanation is insufficient.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's feedback pointing out the need for a clearer explanation.</p>
<p>Seminal plasma is inherently binary, containing both decapacitation factors that delay or inhibit capacitation and nutrient substrates that promote sperm motility.</p>
<p>In vivo, it is believed that the coating of sperm by decapacitation factors is removed by uterine fluid and albumin as it passes through the female reproductive tract [PMID: 22827391, PMID: 24274412]. In contrast, standard fertilization culture media lack a clearance pathway, so decapacitating factors are retained throughout the culture period. As a result, the cleavage rate after in vitro fertilization using sperm exposed to seminal vesicle fluid decreased dramatically.</p>
<p>Lipids, such as fatty acids, increased sperm motility without directly inducing markers of fertilization. These results suggest that the enhancement of motility by lipids is functionally distinct from the capacitation-inhibiting function of seminal plasma proteins. The data from this study are consistent with the biphasic model. Specifically, decapacitation factors temporarily stabilize the sperm membrane, preventing early capacitation. Meanwhile, lipids enhance sperm motility, enabling them to rapidly pass through the hostile uterine environment.</p>

<p>(3) This reviewer does not see the merit in including a lipid mixture motility experiment compared to using OA alone. The increase in motility is still small and far from comparable to the motility increase with seminal vesicle fluid. In this reviewer's opinion the experiment is still inconclusive and should not be highlighted in the manuscript title.</p>

<p>The wording has been softened overall. The title has been changed to âTestosterone-Induced Metabolic Changes in Seminal Vesicle Epithelium Modify Seminal Plasma Components with Potential to Improve Sperm Motilityâ. (Please see also Reviewer 1's main comment 1)</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1) 'This change includes a large amplitude of flagella' does not make sense. Please correct.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The following corrections have been made. âThis change is characterized by large-amplitude flagellar beating.â (lines 44-45)</p>
