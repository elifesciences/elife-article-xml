<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Rare and common genetic variants contribute to the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF). Although ion channels were among the first AF candidate genes identified, rare loss-of-function variants in structural genes such as <italic>TTN</italic> have also been implicated in AF pathogenesis partly by the development of an atrial myopathy, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. While <italic>TTN</italic> truncating variants (<italic>TTN</italic>tvs) have been causally linked to arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy syndromes, the role of missense variants (mvs) remains unclear. We report that rare <italic>TTN</italic>mvs are associated with adverse clinical outcomes in AF patients and we have identified a mechanism by which a <italic>TTN</italic>mv (T32756I) causes AF. Modeling the <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I variant using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs) revealed that the mutant cells display aberrant contractility, increased activity of a cardiac potassium channel (KCNQ1, Kv7.1), and dysregulated calcium homeostasis without compromising the sarcomeric integrity of the atrial cardiomyocytes. We also show that a titin-binding protein, the Four-and-a-Half Lim domains 2 (FHL2), has increased binding with KCNQ1 and its modulatory subunit KCNE1 in the <italic>TTN-</italic>T32756I-iPSC-aCMs, enhancing the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (<italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub>). Suppression of FHL2 in mutant iPSC-aCMs normalized the <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub>, supporting FHL2 as an <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub> modulator. Our findings demonstrate that a single amino acid change in titin not only affects function but also causes ion channel remodeling and AF. These findings emphasize the need for high-throughput screening to evaluate the pathogenicity of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs and establish a mechanistic link between titin, potassium ion channels, and sarcomeric proteins that may represent a novel therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, affects more than 60 million people worldwide and is associated with increased risk for stroke, heart failure, and dementia, justifying it as a major public healthcare burden<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. AF is characterized by irregular and often abnormally fast heart rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Over the last decade, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture of AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 140 common loci associated with AF, while family-based studies have implicated rare variants primarily encoding ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Although AF has been traditionally classified as a ‘channelopathy’, variants in myocardial sarcomeric proteins such as titin have been increasingly associated with familial or early-onset AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The <italic>TTN</italic> gene encodes for a massive myofilament (∼4200 kDa), titin, which stretches along the Z-disk (N-terminus) to the M-band (C-terminus) region of the sarcomere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Titin serves as a molecular scaffold for other muscle proteins, participates in downstream signaling, and provides passive tension to cardiac muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Due to its large size, the rate of genetic variation in <italic>TTN</italic> is high, including both truncating (<italic>TTN</italic>tvs) and missense variants (<italic>TTN</italic>mvs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The prevalence of rare <italic>TTN</italic>tvs and <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in the general population is 2% and 5.7%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. While <italic>TTN</italic>tvs are the most common genetic cause (10-20%) of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), <italic>TTN</italic>mvs are often disregarded in clinical practice, fulfilling a stand-alone benign criterion in DCM-specific variant interpretation frameworks based on the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) recommendations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Yet, <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may have the potential to confer disease, as a recent study in two families revealed that <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in a conserved cysteine of <italic>TTN</italic> can cause DCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Another study demonstrated segregation of a novel <italic>TTN</italic>mv among five individuals with atrioventricular block in a Chinese family, suggesting that <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may also be implicated in arrhythmia syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. To date, a relationship between rare <italic>TTN</italic>mvs and AF has not been explored at either clinical or mechanistic levels. This has potentially heightened importance across racial and ethnic groups, in whom the likelihood of detecting variants of uncertain significance (which are predominantly <italic>TTN</italic>mvs), is higher than in individuals of European descent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Despite the clinical importance, the pharmacological therapy of AF is limited in part because of the incomplete understanding of the myocardial substrate for AF as human atrial tissue is rarely available and the limitations of existing in vitro and in vivo models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. However, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) not only possess the complex array of cardiac ion channels that make up the atrial action potential (AP) but also hold great promise for modeling AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Modeling patient-specific mutations associated with familial AF using mature human iPSC-CMs offers a powerful, naturally integrated system with distinct advantages over animal models and heterologous expression systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Recent reports using human iPSC-CM models have elucidated the pathophysiological mechanisms of DCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, Brugada syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, long QT syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Human iPSC-CMs also have the potential to uncover the molecular mechanisms of AF as they can be easily modified to contain the precise genetic background of the individual patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To examine the potential role of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in AF, we examined the prevalence of rare <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in a single-center cohort of African-American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals with AF who underwent whole exome sequencing, compared clinical characteristics between <italic>TTN</italic>mv carriers and non-carriers, and evaluated whether <italic>TTN</italic>mvs were associated with increased risk of AF or heart failure (HF)-related hospitalizations. To explore whether the <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may be mechanistically linked to the development of AF, we introduced a rare <italic>TTN</italic>mv (<italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I) into human iPSC-aCMs using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated 9 (CRISPR-Cas9). We performed electrophysiological (EP), pharmacological, and mechanistic analyses to elucidate the mechanisms by which the <italic>TTN</italic>mv causes AF. Our study showed that the <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I iPSC-aCMs exhibited a striking AF-like EP phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic>, and transcriptomic analyses revealed that the <italic>TTN</italic>mv increases the activity of the Four-and-a-half LIM domain protein 2 (FHL2) which then modulates the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>) to cause AF, possibly through a reentrant mechanism.</p>

We identified 138 <italic>TTN</italic>mvs, most commonly in the <italic>TTN</italic> A-band (108 [78.8]%), followed by the I-band (20 [14.6%]), M-band (2 [1.5%]), near the Z-disk (6 [4.4%], and in the Z-disk (2 [1.5%]) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Based on the REVEL <italic>in silico</italic> score, 52 (37.7%) <italic>TTN</italic>mvs variants were predicted to be deleterious. A total of 77 (58.8%) subjects carried a <italic>TTN</italic>mv, with 43 (32.8%) carrying a predicted deleterious variant. Carriers of a <italic>TTN</italic>mv had a higher QTc interval on electrocardiogram (ECG) closest to AF diagnosis (mean [SD] 466.5 [42.3] vs. 449.6 [37.7] ms, P=0.027); there were otherwise no other significant clinical or demographic differences between variant carriers and non-carriers. When stratifying by predicted deleterious <italic>TTN</italic>mv only (<xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), a higher proportion of variant carriers were non-Hispanic Black (36 [83.7%] vs. 57 [64.8%], P=0.026). On index ECG, carriers additionally had higher ventricular rate (mean [SD] 103.7 [31.4] vs. 90.9 [27.4] beats/min, P=0.022), QTc interval (mean [SD] 470.6 [44.0] vs. 453.9 [38.7] ms, P=0.035), and LVEDD on index echocardiogram (mean [SD] 49.8 [8.0] vs. 45.6 [9.2] mm, P=0.021). Seventeen (15.2%) subjects met criteria for left ventricular (LV) dilatation, with a higher proportion of LV dilatation in <italic>TTN</italic>mv carriers but without a significant difference compared to non-carriers (13 [20.3%] vs. 4 [8.3%], P=0.111). Twelve subjects (9.2%) met criteria for a clinical diagnosis of nonischemic DCM based on a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;50%, presence of LV dilatation, and confirmation of non-severe coronary artery disease by coronary angiography. Of those, 8 subjects carried <italic>TTN</italic>mvs of which 6 were predicted to be deleterious (<xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>A total of 174 hospitalizations (64 AF-related and 110 HF-related) occurred after a median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time of 4.14 (1.25-6.04) years, with 119 (68.4%) events occurring in <italic>TTN</italic>mv carriers and 55 (31.6%) of events occurring in non-<italic>TTN</italic>mv carriers.

This remained significant after partial adjustment for age and sex (HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.04-3.17, p=0.035) as well as full adjustment that additionally included ethnicity and baseline LVEF &lt;50% (HR 1.80, 95% CI 1.03-3.15, p=0.039; <xref rid="tbls4" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). No other covariates were significantly associated with the outcome. To assess whether baseline LVEF influenced the relationship between <italic>TTN</italic>mvs and hospitalization risk, an interaction term between LVEF&lt;50% and presence of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs was tested and was not significant (interaction P=0.843). To assess whether prediction of deleterious effect influenced the relationship between <italic>TTN</italic>mv presence and hospitalization risk, subgroups based on high or low REVEL score were separately examined (<xref rid="tbls5" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). Compared to non-<italic>TTN</italic>mv carriers, hospitalization risk was significantly increased in subjects carrying predicted deleterious <italic>TTN</italic>mvs (HR 1.92, 1.04-3.53, P=0.036). While subjects with <italic>TTN</italic>mvs not predicted to be deleterious also had an elevated point estimate of hospitalization risk, this difference was not significant (HR 1.60, 95% CI 0.78-3.28, P=0.198). Findings remained similar with exclusion of patients with nonischemic DCM (<xref rid="tbls6" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 6</xref>).

<title>Altered cardiac potassium current and calcium handling underlies the arrhythmia phenotype in <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs</title>
<p>As studies have shown that abnormal atrial electrophysiology and calcium-handling underlie atrial arrhythmogenesis and contractile dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that the <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I variant modulates atrial APs, ion channels and intracellular calcium.

<title>RNA sequencing analysis reveals alterations in cardiac signaling and disease pathways in <italic>TTN-</italic>T32756I-iPSC-aCMs</title>
<p>To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism by which <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I causes contractile defects and ion channel remodeling, we performed transcriptome sequencing of the mutant iPSC-aCMs and WT. Comparison of total RNA levels in <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756-iPSC-aCMs with WT-iPSC-aCMs and differential expression analysis showed genes related to cardiac muscle contraction and calcium handling were predominantly affected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5A</xref>). Gene-ontology (GO) pathway enrichment further showed that the top significantly downregulated cardiac-related GO Biological Processes (-BP) in <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I iPSC-aCMs included key processes such as cardiac myofibril assembly, skeletal muscle myosin thick filament assembly, extracellular matrix organization, and regulation of potassium ion transmembrane transporter assembly among others (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). As for GO-Molecular function pathways (GO-MF), outward potassium channel activity, voltage-gated potassium channel activity, calcium channel activity, and gap junction channel activity were enriched (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis identified downregulation in critical pathways including Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, the Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, Dilated cardiomyopathy pathway, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy pathway and Calcium signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>), which are crucial for normal cardiac electrophysiology and contractility. Upregulated pathways in both GO and KEGG analyses were mostly restricted to neuronal pathways including axon and neuron development, Hippo signaling pathway, and Notch signaling pathway. In the transcriptomic analysis of <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs, several transcription factors (TFs) showed significant alterations, highlighting their potential roles in the mutation’s impact (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 5D</xref>). Top-cardiac related upregulated TFs include <italic>MYC</italic>, linked to cell growth and apoptosis, suggesting an increase in cellular proliferation. Stress-related TFs such as <italic>NFE2L2</italic> and <italic>CEBPB</italic> are also elevated, indicating a heightened stress response. Additionally, TFs like <italic>ESRRA</italic> and <italic>FOXM1</italic>, which regulate metabolic processes and cell cycle respectively, along with <italic>FOXO1</italic> for metabolism and stress resistance, were upregulated. Key TFs in muscle function such as <italic>MYOD1</italic>, <italic>MYOCD</italic>, <italic>KLF5</italic>, and <italic>NKX2.5</italic> were enhanced, alongside <italic>SMAD2</italic>, <italic>CREBBP</italic>, <italic>PITX2</italic>, <italic>NFKB1</italic>, and <italic>GATA4</italic>, which are vital for diverse roles ranging from signal transduction to immune regulation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Conversely, downregulated transcription factors include <italic>SIRT1</italic>, which plays a role in cellular stress resistance and mitochondrial function, pointing to potential vulnerabilities in cellular defenses.

As FHL2 has also been shown to directly interact with the <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub>-binding partner mink (KCNE1) and increases its current density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, we postulate that elevated FHL2 level in <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs may cause enhanced binding to <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub>, and thus increase its activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We identified an association between <italic>TTN</italic>mvs and clinical outcomes among a multiethnic cohort of AF patients and elucidated a causal mechanism by which a <italic>TTN</italic>mv may lead to AF. Although <italic>TTN</italic>tvs are a well-recognized cause of DCM and have been associated with early-onset AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, the role of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in either arrhythmia or cardiomyopathy pathogenesis is unknown. Here, for the first time, we show that <italic>TTN</italic>mvs are associated with increased hospitalization risk in a multiethnic AF cohort, and that a <italic>TTN</italic>mv can cause AF by impairing contractility and ion channel remodeling in atrial cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmented <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub> mediated by FHL2 can create a substrate for AF. Together, these findings establish a potential causal role of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in AF and support <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub> and FHL2 as potential therapeutic targets for <italic>TTN</italic>-related AF.</p>
<p>The genetic architecture of AF is complex, with both monogenic and polygenic contributions that intersect with age and comorbidities to define an individual’s risk. Despite AF being traditionally considered an ion channelopathy, the sarcomeric gene, <italic>TTN,</italic> is the most common in which rare loss-of-function variants have been associated with AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, and penetrance of such variants was found to be even greater for AF than for heart failure in the UK Biobank<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. As rare <italic>TTN</italic> variants comprise the strongest monogenic contribution to AF risk, we sought to explore whether <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may similarly have implications in AF development or outcomes. A study of 147 probands with DCM identified 44 severe <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in 37 probands, which clustered in the A-band region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. There were no differences in heart transplant-free survival between carriers and noncarriers. In a more recent study of 530 subjects with DCM using more stringent allele frequency criteria, 31 predicted deleterious variants were identified, also predominantly located in the A-band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. However, these <italic>TTN</italic>mvs were found with similar frequency to reference populations. Finally, a study of two families with DCM demonstrated segregation of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs affecting the same highly conserved cysteine residue in the I-band, which showed impaired contraction and folding at physiological temperatures in a homozygous iPSC model, demonstrating that a <italic>TTN</italic>mv can cause DCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We identified <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in 58% of subjects in our cohort, and 33% carried a potentially deleterious variant by REVEL in silico prediction. This frequency was higher than the 37/147 (25.2%) of <italic>TTN</italic>mv carriers in a DCM cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, understanding that differing methods of bioinformatic filtering may limit ability for direct comparison. Aligning with prior studies, most deleterious variants in our study were found in the A-band<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, where <italic>TTN</italic>tvs have been linked most strongly to disease. Presence of predicted deleterious <italic>TTN</italic>mvs was associated with higher LV end diastolic diameter but without statistically significant differences in LVEF, potentially suggesting overlap between a subclinical left ventricular cardiomyopathy and AF in these subjects. We additionally noted higher ventricular rate and QTc interval on index ECGs in these subjects. Rare deleterious variants in <italic>TTN</italic> have previously been associated with changes in the QT interval<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, but the mechanism for this remains unclear. Finally, evidence on the relationship between <italic>TTN</italic>mvs and clinical outcomes is sparse and limited to examining event-free survival in DCM patients. We observed a significant association between <italic>TTN</italic>mv presence and increased cumulative incidence of AF or HF-related hospitalizations, which remained unchanged in multivariable adjustment and in sensitivity analyses. This importantly suggests that <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may correlate with disease severity. Further study exploring these associations in larger validation cohorts and examining AF-specific measures such as arrhythmia burden or treatment response will be necessary to fully understand the clinical importance of <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in AF.</p>
<p>Prediction of missense variant impact using <italic>in silico</italic> tools and algorithms can be limited by low specificity, contributing to challenges in clinical interpretation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Functional studies are often helpful in these cases to confirm or support variant pathogenicity. As existing in vitro or in vivo models do not adequately replicate the complexity of AF, human iPSC-aCMs possess the complex array of cardiac ion channels that make up the atrial AP and provide an adequate model to establish causal relationships in AF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We identified the missense variant <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I in three unrelated subjects in our multiethnic AF registry and studied this variant in an iPSC-aCM model. Remarkably, the single amino acid change in this giant protein titin results in aberrant contractility and EP remodeling without affecting the sarcomeric integrity. Although we did not observe any defects in the sarcomere, in a separate study we showed that deletion of nine amino acids including the T32756I in the same area caused significant perturbation in the sarcomere assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. T32756 corresponds to a conserved Threonine of the Ig139 domain (UniProt# Q8WZ42, predicted Ig155 by TITINdb2) and the replacement of a conserved hydrophilic residue (Thr) in WT with a hydrophobic residue (Ile) may cause thermal instability and destabilize the domain. It is now well recognized that point mutations may drastically disrupt the Ig domains and could possibly unfold under pathological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Such mutations have been proposed to modify titin-based passive stiffness and may lead to cardiomyopathy.</p>
<p>Missense mutations such as T2850I, R57C, S22P in the I-band titin have been reported to significantly destabilize Ig domains and display a higher tendency for unfolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Likewise, T32756I may unfold under the physiological settings and increase susceptibility to protein loss (haploinsufficiency) or degradation (poison peptide effect), leading to impaired sarcomere function. Furthermore, as titin acts as a crucial signaling hub that transduces mechanical forces to downstream signaling pathways within cardiomyocytes and interacts with various sarcomeric proteins and signaling molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, subtle destabilization of Ig139 domain by the T32756I could alter the biochemical signals that regulate various downstream signaling pathways involved in cardiac function and adaptation. Hence, the contractile and ion channel dysfunction caused solely by the homozygosity of T32756I in the iPSC-aCMs provide strong evidence that the AF is exclusively caused by the <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I missense variant.</p>
<p>Although several studies have identified possible pathways associated with <italic>TTN</italic>tvs and AF, the pathogenic mechanisms of <italic>TTN</italic>mv-associated AF remain unclear. We show for the first time that the T32756I creates an EP substrate for AF by ion channel remodeling with an enhanced <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub>, which is mediated by a titin interacting protein FHL2. FHL2 is enriched in cardiac muscle and is a multifunctional protein that regulates cardiac myocyte signaling and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. FHL2 interacts with KCNE1 that binds to the outer face of the KCNQ1 channel pore domain and may modify the interactions between the voltage sensor, S4-S5 linker, and the pore domain to augment the channel current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. It has been suggested that FHL2 interacts with titin N2B segment, titin kinase domain and forms a complex with other proteins, such as MURF1 and MURF2, calmodulin, and Nbr1, playing a role in hypertrophy signaling and the atrophy response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. It also binds to the edge of titin (M-line), which is in close proximity to T32756I, and interacts with myospryn and obscurin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>. It is tempting to postulate that T32756I may interfere with FHL2’s ability to interact with titin, which could then disrupt with subsequent mechano-biochemical signaling and increase FHL2’s availability for binding with the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex. While our study provides mechanistic insights into the role of the <italic>TTN</italic>-32756I missense variant in AF, <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may be involved in the regulation of ion channel modulation and atrial rhythmicity through a multitude of interrelated signaling pathways. Further studies are needed to fully uncover the molecular basis of this regulation and its implications for AF pathophysiology and potential therapeutic interventions.</p>
<p>In summary, this study supports a causal relationship between a <italic>TTN</italic>mv and AF and suggests that <italic>TTN</italic>mvs may be associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AF. The study also unveils the critical role of FHL2 in modulating the atrial action potential via binding to Kv7.1-KCNE1 and enhancing the <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> in <italic>TTN</italic>-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs. Importantly, we found that the increased <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> can be rescued by FHL2 suppression. This suggests that targeting <italic>I</italic><sub>Ks</sub> or FHL2 may restore and maintain sinus rhythm and improve atrial contractility. Further study is needed to determine if <italic>TTN</italic>mvs in other regions are associated with AF by a similar mechanism. Our data indicate that AF-associated <italic>TTN</italic>mv can cause arrhythmia, provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying AF and suggest that targeting KCNQ1 or FHL2 could represent a new therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac function. Our findings may also have broader implications for the treatment of patients harboring disease-causing rare variants in sarcomeric proteins and suggest that genomic analyses that encompass <italic>TTN</italic>mvs should also consider experimental evidence in advancing our understanding of AF etiology and improving patient care in the era of precision medicine.</p>

<title>Study population</title>
<p>The UIC Multi-Ethnic AF Biorepository was established in 2015 to explore the genetic basis of AF across race and ethnicity. This study was approved by the UIC Institutional Review Board (#2015-0681). Subjects are prospectively enrolled from outpatient and inpatient sites within the University of Illinois Health (UIH) healthcare system. Subjects must have a documented history of AF by electrocardiogram, Holter/event monitor, or implantable cardiac device, with confirmation by an attending cardiologist. At time of enrollment, blood is drawn for DNA extraction and genetic analysis. Baseline demographics are obtained through provider notes in the electronic health record (EHR) and confirmed with the patient at the time of enrollment as necessary. Longitudinal clinical outcomes are followed through serial EHR review. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Adults 18 years of age or older at time of AF diagnosis were prospectively enrolled between August 25, 2015, and May 19, 2019. Samples from 161 subjects who identified as non-Hispanic Black (NHB) or Hispanic/Latinx (HL) and had an echocardiogram performed within 3 months of enrollment date underwent whole exome sequencing. A total of 27 subjects with congenital or rheumatic disease, severe mitral stenosis, and end stage renal disease on dialysis were excluded. Three subjects who carried a predicted loss-of-function frameshift or stop-gain <italic>TTN</italic> variant were additionally excluded. The primary exposure was the presence of one or more missense <italic>TTN</italic> variants. The primary outcome was time from initial AF diagnosis to hospitalizations with a primary diagnosis of either AF or acute decompensated HF recorded in the clinical discharge summary, captured as repeating events. Clinical data was obtained through manual review of EHR and comorbidities were defined if present in clinical notes on or prior to AF diagnosis date. Subjects were censored on date of death, last known clinical encounter (up to August 26, 2023), or at 10 years after AF diagnosis. Echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular dilatation was defined as left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) &gt; 2 standard deviations (SD) above sex-specific mean according to standard guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Subjects meeting echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular dilatation fulfilled clinical criteria for nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 50% and ischemic cardiomyopathy was ruled out by coronary angiogram.</p>

<p>The study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings regarding the incidence and clinical impact of a mutation in a cardiac muscle protein and its association with the development of atrial fibrillation. The authors provide some <bold>convincing</bold> evidence of electrophysiological disturbances in cells with this mutation which would be of interest to cellular electrophysiologists. However, evidence supporting the conclusion that this mutation causes atrial fibrillation would benefit from more rigorous electrophysiologic approaches.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pavel et al. analyzed a cohort of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients from the University of Illinois at Chicago, identifying TTN truncating variants (TTNtvs) and TTN missense variants (TTNmvs). They reported a rare TTN missense variant (T32756I) associated with adverse clinical outcomes in AF patients. To investigate its functional significance, the authors modeled the TTN-T32756I variant using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs). They demonstrated that mutant cells exhibit aberrant contractility, increased activity of the cardiac potassium channel KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), and dysregulated calcium homeostasis. Interestingly, these effects occurred without compromising sarcomeric integrity. The study further identified increased binding of the titin-binding protein Four-and-a-Half Lim domains 2 (FHL2) with KCNQ1 and its modulatory subunit KCNE1 in the TTN-T32756I iPSC-aCMs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work has translational potential, suggesting that targeting KCNQ1 or FHL2 could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac function. The findings may also have broader implications for treating patients with rare, disease-causing variants in sarcomeric proteins and underscore the importance of integrating genomic analysis with experimental evidence to advance AF research and precision medicine.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Variant Identification: It is unclear how the TTN missense variant (T32756I) was identified using REVEL, as none of the patients' parents reportedly carried the mutation or exhibited AF symptoms. Are there other TTN variants identified in the three patients carrying TTN-T32756I? Clarification on this point is necessary.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors present data from a single-center cohort of African-American and Hispanic/Latinx individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study provides insight into the incidences and clinical impact of missense variants in the Titin (TTN) gene in this population. In addition, the authors identified a single amino acid TTN missense variant (TTN-T32756I) that was further studied using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs). These studies demonstrated that the Four-and-a-Half Lim domains 2 (FHL2), has increased binding with KCNQ1 and its modulatory subunit KCNE1 in the TTN-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs, enhancing the slow delayed rectifier potassium current (Iks) and is a potential mechanism for atrial fibrillation. Finally, the authors demonstrate that suppression of FHL2 could normalize the Iks current.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this manuscript/study are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) This study includes a previously underrepresented population in the study of the genetic and mechanistic basis of AF.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors utilize current state-of-the-art methods to investigate the pathogenicity of a specific TTN missense variant identified in this underrepresented patient population.</p>
<p>
(3) The findings of this study identify a potential therapeutic for treating atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors do not include a non-AF group when evaluating the incidence and clinical significance of TTN missense variants in AF patients.</p>
<p>(2) The authors do not provide evidence that TTN-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs are arrhythmogenic only that there is an increase in the Iks current and associated action potential changes. More specifically, the authors report &quot;compared to the WT, TTN-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs exhibited increased arrhythmic frequency&quot; yet is it is unclear what they are referring to by &quot;arrhythmic frequency&quot;.</p>
<p>(3) There seem to be discrepancies regarding the impact of the TTN-T32756I variant on mechanical function. Specifically, the authors report &quot;both reduced contraction and abnormal relaxation in TTN-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs&quot; yet, separately report &quot;the contraction amplitude of the mutant was also increased . . . suggesting an increased contractile force by the TTN-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs and TTN-T32756I-iPSC-CMs exhibited similar calcium transient amplitudes as the WT.&quot;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe the abnormal contractile function and cellular electrophysiology in an iPSC model of atrial myocytes with a titin missense variant. They provide contractility data by sarcomere length imaging, calcium imaging, and voltage clamp of the repolarizing current iKs. While each of the findings is separately interesting, the paper comes across as too descriptive because there is no merging of the data to support a cohesive mechanistic story/statement, especially from the electrophysiological standpoint. There is definitely not enough support for the title &quot;A Titin Missense Variant Causes Atrial Fibrillation&quot;, since there is no strong causative evidence at all. There is some interesting clinical data regarding the variant of interest and its association with HF hospitalization, which may lead to future important discoveries regarding atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written and there is a wide range of experimental techniques to probe this atrial fibrillation model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the clinical data is interesting, it is extremely important to rule out heart failure with preserved EF as a confounder. HFpEF leads to AF due to increased atrial remodeling, so the fact that patients with this missense variant have increased HF hospitalizations does not necessarily directly support the variant as causative of AF. It could be that the variant is actually associated directly with HFpEF instead, and this needs to be addressed and corrected in the analyses.</p>
<p>(2) All of the contractility and electrophysiologic data should be done with pacing at the same rate in both control and missense variant groups, to control for the effect of cycle length on APD and calcium loading. A claim of shorter APD cannot be claimed when the firing rate of one set of cells is much faster than the other, since shorter APD is to be expected with a faster rate. Similarly, contractility is affected by diastolic interval because of the influence of SR calcium content on the myocyte power stroke. So the cells need to be paced at the same rate in the IonOptix for any direct comparison of contractility. The authors should familiarize themselves with the concept of electrical restitution.</p>
<p>(3) It is interesting that the firing rate of the myocytes is faster with the missense variant. This should lead to a hypothesis and investigation of abnormal automaticity or triggered activity, which may also explain the increased contractility since all these mechanisms are related to the calcium clock and calcium loading of the SR. See #2 above for suggestions on how to adequately probe calcium handling. Such an investigation into impulse initiation mechanisms would be very powerful in supporting the primary statement of the paper since these are actual mechanisms thought to cause AF.</p>
<p>(4) The claim of shortened APD without correcting for cycle length is problematic. However, the general concept of linking shortened APD in isolated cells alone to AF causation is more problematic. To have a setup for reentry, there must be a gradient of APD from short to long, and this can only be demonstrated at the tissue level, not really at the cellular level, so reentry should not be invoked here. If shortened APD is demonstrated with correction of the cycle length problem, restitution curves can be made showing APD shortening at different cycle lengths. If restitution is abnormal (i.e. the APD does not shorten normally in relation to the diastolic interval), this may lead to triggered activity which is an arrhythmogenic mechanism. This would also tie in well with the finding of abnormally elevated iKs current since iKs is a repolarizing current directly responsible for restitution.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Pavel et al. analyzed a cohort of atrial fibrillation (AF) patients from the University of</p>
<p>Illinois at Chicago, identifying TTN truncating variants (TTNtvs) and TTN missense variants (TTNmvs). They reported a rare TTN missense variant (T32756I) associated with adverse clinical outcomes in AF patients. To investigate its functional significance, the authors modeled the TTN-T32756I variant using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-aCMs). They demonstrated that mutant cells exhibit aberrant contractility, increased activity of the cardiac potassium channel KCNQ1 (Kv7.1), and dysregulated calcium homeostasis. Interestingly, these effects occurred without compromising sarcomeric integrity. The study further identified increased binding of the titin-binding protein Four-and-a-Half Lim domains 2 (FHL2) with KCNQ1 and its modulatory subunit KCNE1 in the TTN-T32756I iPSCaCMs.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work has translational potential, suggesting that targeting KCNQ1 or FHL2 could represent a novel therapeutic strategy for improving cardiac function. The findings may also have broader implications for treating patients with rare, disease-causing variants in sarcomeric proteins and underscore the importance of integrating genomic analysis with experimental evidence to advance AF research and precision medicine.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) Variant Identification: It is unclear how the TTN missense variant (T32756I) was identified using REVEL, as none of the patients' parents reportedly carried the mutation or exhibited AF symptoms. Are there other TTN variants identified in the three patients carrying TTN-T32756I? Clarification on this point is necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comment. Our study identified deleterious missense variants using a stringent REVEL score threshold of ≥0.7; however, variants with a REVEL score above 0.5 are generally considered potentially pathogenic (Ioannidis, Nilah M., et al., Am J Human Genetics 2016; 9.4: 877-885). The TTN-T32756I variant (REVEL Score: 0.58758, Supplementary Table 1) was prioritized due to its occurrence in multiple unrelated individuals within our clinical AF cohort, despite no reported family history of AF in affected individuals. While no parental inheritance was observed, the possibility of a de novo origin cannot be excluded. Furthermore, this variant is located within a region overlapping a deletion mutation recently shown to cause AF in a zebrafish model (Jiang et al., iScience, 2024;27(7):110395) supporting its potential pathogenicity. Notably, the affected individuals did not carry additional loss-of-function TTN variants. We will clarify these points in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Patient-Specific iPSC Lines: Since the TTN-T32756I variant was modeled using only one healthy iPSC line, it is unclear whether patient-specific iPSC-derived atrial cardiomyocytes would exhibit similar AF-related phenotypes. This limitation should be addressed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s concern that patient-specific iPSC lines could further validate our findings. However, due to the patients' unavailability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), we utilized a healthy iPSC line and introduced the TTN-T32756I variant using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. This approach ensures an isogenic background, thereby minimizing genetic variability and providing a controlled system to study the direct effects of the mutation. We will acknowledge this limitation in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Hypertension as a Confounding Factor: The three patients carrying TTN-T32756I also have hypertension. Could the hypertension associated with this variant contribute secondarily to AF? The authors should discuss or rule out this possibility.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with AF and could contribute to disease progression. However, all three individuals carrying TTN-T32756I exhibited early-onset AF (onset before 66 years), with one case occurring as early as 36 years. This suggests a potential two-hit mechanism, where genetic predisposition and comorbidities influence disease risk. Importantly, our iPSC model isolates the genetic effects of TTN-T32756I from other factors, supporting a direct pathogenic role. We will explicitly discuss this in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) FHL2 and KCNQ1-KCNE1 Interaction: Immunostaining data demonstrating the colocalization of FHL2 with the KCNQ1-KCNE1 (MinK) complex in TTN-T32756I iPSC-aCMs are needed to strengthen the mechanistic findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that additional immunostaining data would strengthen the evidence for FHL2 colocalization with the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex in TTN-T32756I iPSC-aCMs. We will work on obtaining these additional data to validate our mechanistic findings further.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Functional Characterization of FHL2-KCNQ1-KCNE1 Interaction: To further validate the proposed mechanism, additional functional assays are necessary to characterize the interaction between FHL2 and the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex in TTN-T32756I iPSC-aCMs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that additional functional assays would further validate the proposed mechanism. We will perform contractility and electrophysiological experiments, such as multielectrode array (MEA) assays, to characterize better the interaction between FHL2 and the KCNQ1-KCNE1 complex in TTN-T32756I iPSC-aCMs.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the limitation of not including a non-AF group in our clinical analysis. Our cohort is derived from a single-center registry of individuals with AF, and we do not have a matched cohort of non-AF controls to compare the incidence of TTN missense variants. We recognize this as a limitation and will clarify that further studies are needed to define the prevalence of TTN missense variants in broader, multiethnic cohorts that include both AF and non-AF individuals.</p>

<p>(2) The authors do not provide evidence that TTN-T32756I-iPSC-aCMs are arrhythmogenic, only that there is an increase in the Iks current and associated action potential changes.

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s request for clarification regarding &quot;arrhythmic frequency.&quot; In our study, this term refers to the increased spontaneous beating rate and irregular action potentials observed in TTN-T32756I iPSC-aCMs compared to WT. Our findings suggest that the AF-associated TTN-T32756I variant induces ion channel remodeling and beating abnormalities, possibly contributing to an arrhythmogenic substrate for AF. We will refine our wording in the revised manuscript to enhance clarity and precision.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and apologize for the inconsistency. We intended to report on contraction duration and relaxation rather than contraction force alone. The increased contraction amplitude reflects altered contractile force, whereas the reduced contraction duration and impaired relaxation indicate dysfunctional contractile dynamics. We will revise the text and corresponding figures to convey these findings accurately.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors describe the abnormal contractile function and cellular electrophysiology in an iPSC model of atrial myocytes with a titin missense variant. They provide contractility data by sarcomere length imaging, calcium imaging, and voltage clamp of the repolarizing current iKs. While each of the findings is interesting, the paper comes across as too descriptive because there is no data merging to support a cohesive mechanistic story/statement, especially from the electrophysiological standpoint. There is not enough support for the title &quot;A Titin Missense Variant Causes Atrial Fibrillation&quot;, since there is no strong causative evidence. There is some interesting clinical data regarding the variant of interest and its association with HF hospitalization, which may lead to future important discoveries regarding atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is well written, and a wide range of experimental techniques are used to probe this atrial fibrillation model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>(1) While the clinical data is interesting, it is essential to rule out heart failure with preserved EF as a confounder. HFpEF leads to AF due to increased atrial remodeling, so the fact that patients with this missense variant have increased HF hospitalizations does not necessarily directly support the variant as causative of AF. It could be that the variant is associated directly with HFpEF instead, and this needs to be addressed and corrected in the analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We recognize that AF and HFpEF frequently coexist and that HFpEF-related atrial remodeling could contribute to AF development. The primary aim of our cohort analysis was to explore the potential clinical significance of TTNmv. While we acknowledge the inherent limitations of retrospective observational data in establishing causality, our subsequent in vitro experiments were designed to demonstrate that TTNmv can alter the electrophysiological substrate, potentially predisposing individuals to AF.</p>
<p>As HFpEF is a potential confounder, it is reasonable to consider whether TTNmv may also be associated with HFpEF. However, to our knowledge, no existing literature directly links TTNmv to HFpEF. In contrast, loss-of-function TTN variants are typically associated with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and dilated cardiomyopathy, and even their role in HFrEF remains controversial. To address potential confounding, our multivariable analysis for clinical outcomes was adjusted for reduced ejection fraction, and we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (Supplementary Table 6). We will clarify these points in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) All contractility and electrophysiologic data should be done with pacing at the same rate in both control and missense variant groups, to control for the effect of cycle length on APD and calcium loading. A shorter APD cannot be claimed when the firing rate of one set of cells is much faster than the other, since shorter APD is to be expected with a quicker rate. Similarly, contractility is affected by diastolic interval because of the influence of SR calcium content on the myocyte power stroke. So the cells need to be paced at the same rate in the IonOptix for any direct comparison of contractility. The authors should familiarize themselves with the concept of electrical restitution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s technical concern. iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) exhibit spontaneous beating due to the presence of pacemaker-like currents and the absence of I<sub>k1</sub>, which allows for the study of intrinsic electrophysiological properties, ion channel function, and disease modeling. In our study, we utilized this unique property of iPSCCMs to test our hypothesis that TTNmvs alter electrophysiological properties through ion channel remodeling.</p>
<p>While iPSC-CMs with identical backgrounds are expected to show comparable electrophysiological phenotypes under the same conditions, variability due to biological and technical factors (e.g., protein expression and culture handling) can result in differences between samples. We agree with the reviewer that pacing iPSC-CMs at the same rate for action potential duration (APD) and contractility measurements will control for cycle length effects and improve the reliability and interpretability of our findings. We will incorporate this approach into our revised experimental design.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) It is interesting that the firing rate of the myocytes is faster with the missense variant. This should lead to a hypothesis and investigation of abnormal automaticity or triggered activity, which may also explain the increased contractility since all these mechanisms are related to the SR's calcium clock and calcium loading. See #2 above for suggestions on how to probe calcium handling adequately. Such an investigation into impulse initiation mechanisms would be compelling in supporting the primary statement of the paper since these are actual mechanisms thought to cause AF.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that investigating abnormal automaticity or triggered activity about the increased firing rate observed with the missense variant could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying AF. As these processes are closely linked to calcium handling and the calcium clock, probing calcium cycling abnormalities could strengthen our understanding of how TTNmvs contribute to AF. We will incorporate additional experiments to investigate these mechanisms, further supporting our study's central hypothesis.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The claim of shortened APD without correcting for cycle length is problematic. However, linking shortened APD in isolated cells alone to AF causation is more complicated. To have a setup for reentry, there must be a gradient of APD from short to long, and this can only be demonstrated at the tissue level, not at the cellular level, so reentry should not be invoked here. If shortened APD is demonstrated with correction of the cycle length problem, restitution curves can be made showing APD shortening at different cycle lengths. If restitution is abnormal (i.e. the APD does not shorten normally in relation to the diastolic interval), this may lead to triggered activity which is an arrhythmogenic mechanism. This would also tie in well with the finding of abnormally elevated iKs current since iKs is a repolarizing current directly responsible for restitution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment. We recognize that isolated cell studies cannot directly demonstrate reentrant circuits, and we agree that reentry should not be invoked solely based on cellular data. Our claim of shortened APD is based on observed abnormalities in APD and beating patterns, which may contribute to conditions conducive to reentry at the tissue level. We will clarify this distinction in the revised manuscript and refrain from directly linking APD shortening to reentry without tissue-level evidence.</p>
