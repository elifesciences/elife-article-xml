<title>Abstract</title><p>Invariant natural-killer T (<italic>i</italic>NKT) cells play pathogenic roles in allergic asthma in murine models and possibly also humans. While many studies show that the development and functions of innate and adaptive immune cells depend on their metabolic state, the evidence for this in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells is very limited. It is also not clear whether such metabolic regulation of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells could participate in their pathogenic activities in asthma. Here, we showed that acetyl-coA-carboxylase 1 (ACC1)-mediated <italic>de novo</italic> fatty-acid synthesis is required for the survival of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells and their deleterious functions in allergic asthma. ACC1, which is a key fatty-acid synthesis enzyme, was highly expressed by lung <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from WT mice that were developing asthma. <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice failed to develop OVA-induced and HDM-induced asthma.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Invariant natural-killer T (<italic>i</italic>NKT) cells are a subset of innate T cells that express a restricted T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire (Vα24-Jα18 in humans and Vα14-Jα18 in mice) and respond to glycolipids presented on the CD1d molecule. One such glycolipid is α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), which originates from a marine sponge and strongly activates <italic>i</italic>NKT cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Once activated, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells secrete a diverse array of cytokines, including interferon (IFN)γ, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13, IL-17A, and IL-10 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. These <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-derived cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of various immunological diseases, including sepsis, arthritis, tumors, and asthma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. With regard to the latter, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells are one of the key effectors that promote allergic asthma in murine models. Specifically, by secreting IL-4, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells stimulate the differentiation of T-helper (Th)2 cells and their responses. Moreover, by secreting IL-13, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells promote the contraction of airway smooth muscle, which is a cardinal feature of asthma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, we recently reported that <italic>i</italic>NKT cells contribute to the development of asthma by secreting X-C motif chemokine ligand-1, which recruits conventional X-C motif chemokine receptor 1-expressing type-1 dendritic cells into the lungs: this then stimulates the Th2 responses that drive asthma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-derived soluble factors play multiple critical roles in the development of allergic asthma in murine models. It should be noted that it is somewhat unclear what role <italic>i</italic>NKT cells play in human asthma. Several studies suggest that human asthmatic airways contain large numbers of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, but this was not observed by other studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. However, a recent review describes additional lines of evidence that suggest that <italic>i</italic>NKT cells do contribute to the development and exacerbation of human asthma development, although the mechanisms may not necessarily involve increased <italic>i</italic>NKT cell frequencies. Thus, further research on the roles of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in mouse models and humans with asthma is needed to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease.</p>
<p>Many studies show that the development and functions of innate and adaptive immune cells are dependent on the metabolic states of these cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In particular, the metabolic balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) shapes the differentiation and functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs), cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and macrophages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The development and functions of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may also depend on their metabolism: while the evidence to date is quite limited <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, the thymic development of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells and their inflammatory cytokine production as mature cells associate with changes in their glycolysis:OXPHOS balance <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, peripheral <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell functions are regulated by their levels of reactive oxygen species, which are byproducts of aerobic metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. It is also possible that immune-cell metabolism may participate in asthma since a recent study showed that fatty acid-oxidation inhibitors alleviate house-dust mite (HDM)-induced airway inflammation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly, the airway Th2 cells that mediate allergic responses against HDM depend on glycolysis and lipid metabolism <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Several studies show that lipid biogenesis, which is a major metabolic pathway, also affects the differentiation and functions of conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>: for example, a CD5-like molecule enforces low cholesterol biosynthesis in Th17 cells, which limits ligand availability for Rorγt, the Th17 master transcription factor, thereby preventing Th17 cells from becoming pathogenic and inducing autoimmunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Similarly, several studies show that acetyl-CoA-carboxylase 1 (ACC1) affects multiple T-cell subsets. ACC1 is a key fatty-acid synthesis enzyme in the cytosol that catabolizes the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, and its downregulation impairs the peripheral persistence and homeostatic proliferation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, augments Treg development from naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and their suppressive functions, blocks the development of Th17 cells from naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, impairs the formation of IL-5-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, and promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell development <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The T-cell changes caused by inhibiting ACC1 reduce disease severity in murine models of listeria infection, chronic graft-versus-host disease, multiple sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, and T cell-mediated asthma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>; it also promotes resistance to parasites <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Thus, by shaping fatty-acid synthesis, ACC1 can alter pathogenic and protective T-cell responses.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, the role(s) of ACC1-mediated fatty-acid synthesis in other immune cells, including <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, and in asthma have not been assessed. In this study, we used ACC1-deficient (<italic>Cd4-</italic>Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>) mice and adoptive transfer experiments to determine whether ACC1-mediated fatty-acid metabolism in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells participates in the development of asthma. Indeed, we found that ACC1 promotes the survival of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells by regulating a fatty acid-binding protein (FABP)-PPARγ axis that can downregulate glycolysis. The improved ACC1-mediated <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell survival shapes the homeostasis and functions of these cells, which in turn promote the development of ovalbumin (OVA)- or HDM-induced allergic asthma in mice. We also observed that the ACC1-FABP-PPARγ axis may be active in patients with allergic asthma but not controls.</p>

<title>Activated <italic>i</italic>NKT cells express high levels of a fatty-acid synthesis-related gene whose deletion blocks allergen-induced asthma</title>
<p>To determine whether intracellular metabolic processes in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells play important roles in allergic asthma, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells sorted from the lungs of OVA-induced asthma model mice were assessed for the expression of key enzymes involved in glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, β-oxidation, and fatty-acid synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Indeed, OVA challenge significantly increased <italic>i</italic>NKT cell expression of β-oxidation and fatty-acid synthesis enzymes and tended to elevate TCA-cycle enzyme expression. However, glycolysis-enzyme expression remained low (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, B</xref>). The significantly upregulated fatty-acid synthesis enzymes were Acc1, Fasn, and Oxsm: Acc1 and Fasn play a particularly key role in <italic>de novo</italic> fatty-acid synthesis. Notably, when purified murine <italic>i</italic>NKT cells and conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated <italic>in vitro</italic> with anti-CD3/CD28, the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells expressed much higher levels of <italic>Acc1</italic> and <italic>Fasn</italic> than the other cells. By contrast, the CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressed higher levels of TCA cycle (<italic>Sdh2b</italic> and <italic>Idh1a</italic>) and glycolysis (<italic>Hk2</italic> and <italic>Pkm2</italic>) enzymes, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). This is consistent with the previous Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of Oh et al.: when they compared unstimulated murine <italic>i</italic>NKT and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to each other, they found that genes involved in the ‘lipid, fatty acid and steroid metabolism’ pathway were enriched in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells express <italic>Acc1</italic> and <italic>Fasn</italic> when they are stimulated, including in asthma, whereas conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells do not.</p>

<p>We then focused on ACC1. To test whether ACC1-mediated <italic>de novo</italic> fatty-acid synthesis in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells shapes AHR and allergic immune responses, we generated <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice: the CD4-positive cells (<italic>i.e.</italic> conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T and <italic>i</italic>NKT cells) in these mice cannot express ACC1. Since conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not upregulate ACC1 when stimulated <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, C</xref>), the knockout is likely to be physiologically relevant for <italic>i</italic>NKT cells only. When the <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> control mice were induced to undergo OVA-mediated asthma, we indeed observed that the loss of ACC1 expression attenuated AHR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>) and the total immune-cell numbers in the lung and the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1B</xref>). These changes associated with significantly decreased total lymphocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, and macrophage frequencies in the BALF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>) and lower eosinophil frequencies in the lung (Fig. S1D). The lung CD8<italic><sup>+</sup></italic>T cell and alveolar- and interstitial-macrophage frequencies did not change. Importantly, the total lung CD4<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> T cell population (excluding <italic>i</italic>NKT cells) also did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1D</xref>). By contrast, there was a sharp drop in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in the lung; this was also associated with a significant increase in PI staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis of the conventional lung CD4<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> T cell population (excluding <italic>i</italic>NKT cells) showed that loss of ACC1 expression associated with lower <italic>Gata3</italic>, <italic>Il4</italic>, <italic>Il5</italic>, and <italic>Il13</italic> expression but similar <italic>Tbx21</italic>, <italic>Rorc</italic>, <italic>Foxp3</italic>, <italic>Ifng</italic>, <italic>Il-17a</italic>, and <italic>Il-10</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1E, F</xref>).

<title>ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells exhibit defects in thymic development, homeostasis, and activation</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of ACC1-mediated metabolic programming on the development and function of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, we examined the thymic development and peripheral homeostasis of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Mature <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice had fewer <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in the thymus, spleen, and liver than <italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>).

However, the ACC1 deletion did not alter the frequencies of the NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17 subsets in the <italic>i</italic>NKT cell population at any of the developmental stages, namely, stage S1 (CD24<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>-</sup>), stage S2 (CD24<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>), and stage S3 (CD24<sup>+</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>) (Fig. S2C). Thus, ACC1 deficiency appeared to reduce <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell numbers.</p>
<p>This was tested further by generating mixed bone marrow (BM) chimera mice: thus, a 1:1 ratio of CD45.1<sup>+</sup> WT BM cells and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> BM cells were transferred into lethally irradiated CD45.2<sup>+</sup> WT recipient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2D</xref>). The ACC1-deficient BM cells generated markedly fewer <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in the thymus, spleen, and liver than the WT BM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2E, F</xref>). This confirmed that ACC1 deficiency induced an intrinsic defect in <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell thymic development and peripheral homeostasis. Moreover, when <italic>i</italic>NKT cells sorted from the livers of <italic>Cd4</italic>-<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice underwent TCR ligation with anti-CD3/CD28 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the ACC1-deficient cells produced less CD69 activation marker and cytokine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2G, H</xref>).</p>

<title>Enhanced glycolysis promotes the cell death of ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism(s) by which ACC1-mediated metabolic programming of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells promotes allergic asthma, we subjected the sorted unstimulated <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to transcriptome and metabolome analyses (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A–D</xref>). The ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells displayed distinct metabolic reprogramming compared to WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. Specifically, they exhibited low fatty-acid synthesis but high glycolysis. Indeed, compared to WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, their extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), the level of 2-NBDG, which is an indicator of glucose uptake, and expression of Glut1 and other glycolysis-related genes were higher while their expression of gluconeogenesis genes were lower. However, their oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was similar (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E–H</xref>). Furthermore, the transcriptome analysis revealed significantly altered levels of cell death-related genes in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). These observations suggest that ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells are prone to dying and that this may correlate positively with glycolysis. Indeed, the ECAR and cell death in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells correlated positively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref>). This relationship was confirmed by treating the ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), which inhibits glycolysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>: this decreased their cell death and expression of the pro-apoptotic genes while increasing their expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes. These effects were not observed in WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J, K</xref>).

<title>ACC1-mediated metabolic programming promotes PPARγ expression and the subsequent survival of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells</title>
<p>To identify the target genes that regulate the metabolic reprogramming and cell death in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, we analyzed the transcription factors in the transcriptome data described above.

<p>ACC1 catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which is then converted to the long-chain fatty acid palmitate <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. We found that treatment with palmitate had similar effects on CD3/CD28-stimulated ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells as pioglitazone, namely, it increased <italic>Pparg</italic> and gluconeogenesis gene expression and downregulated glycolysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). These effects were also observed when unstimulated ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells were treated with palmitate: <italic>Pparg</italic> expression rose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) while glucose uptake and cell death dropped (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Thus, restoring the levels of palmitate, the downstream product of ACC1 activity, restored PPARγ expression, which in turn downregulated glycolysis and thereby protected the cells from cell death.</p>
<p>PPARγ activity can be regulated by a variety of ligands, including fatty acids, whose transport to the nucleus is actively facilitated by fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The unstimulated ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells showed depressed expression of the genes encoding FABP1, FABP3, and FABP5 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Thus, ACC1 deficiency downregulated the expression of these genes. We then asked whether circumventing the ACC1 deficiency by treating the unstimulated cells with palmitate could improve the expression of these FABPs, as exogenous treatment of palmitate has been shown to induce FABPs in macrophages: indeed, <italic>Fabp1</italic>, <italic>Fabp3</italic>, and especially <italic>Fabp5</italic> expression were upregulated in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells as well (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>We then determined whether the FABPs mediate the proglycolytic and pro-apoptotic effects of ACC1 (and palmitate) deficiency in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells by culturing unstimulated palmitate-treated ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells with a FABP inhibitor, FABP-IN-1, which is known to inhibit FABP 3, 5 and 7. Indeed, the inhibitor blocked the ability of palmitate to restore PPARγ expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>) and suppress glucose uptake and cell death (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). These findings were also observed when CD3/CD28-stimulated ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells were treated with palmitate with and without FABP inhibitor: the FABP inhibitor reversed the ability of palmitate to increase <italic>Pparg</italic> and gluconeogenesis gene expression and downregulate glycolysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Since FABP-inhibitor treatment did not affect the PPARγ expression, glucose uptake, and cell death in WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, G, H</xref>), it seems that the ACC1 deficiency in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells mediated their metabolic reprogramming by abolishing palmitate production: this downregulated their FABP expression, which in turn suppressed PPARγ expression, which increased glycolysis and thereby promoted cell death (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I</xref>).</p>
<p>On a side note, the WT and ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells did not differ in terms of the methylation of the promoter site of PPARγ (Fig. S3A), and treatment of the unstimulated cells with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor did not alter their cell-death rates or expression of <italic>Pparg</italic>, <italic>Hk2</italic>, <italic>Bcl2</italic>, or <italic>Bak</italic> (Fig. S3B, C). Thus, the regulation of PPARγ expression in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may not involve epigenetic changes such as methylation and acetylation.</p>

This is consistent with our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with the unstimulated and anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated <italic>i</italic>NKT cells above (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Notably, the sorted <italic>i</italic>NKT cell population in the lungs of Jα18 KO mice that received untreated ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells also demonstrated less PPARγ expression and more glucose uptake and Glut1 expression compared to when untreated WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells were transferred, and this was reversed when the ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells were pretreated with palmitate or pioglitazone (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J</xref>). Thus, treatment with palmitate or pioglitazone increased the survival of adoptively transferred ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in Jα18 KO mice, which restored their ability to induce AHR in allergic asthma. Meanwhile, chemokine receptor signaling is also implicated in regulating homeostasis of <italic>i</italic>NKT cell in the periphery. In particular, Meyer et al. suggested that <italic>i</italic>NKT cells require CCR4 to localize to the airways and to induce AHR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, we examined the expression of several chemokine receptors, including CCR4. We found that WT and ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells did not differ in their chemokine receptor expressions, suggesting that the chemokine signaling may not be critical for ACC1-mediated regulation in AHR.</p>
<p>Altogether, these results show that ACC1-mediated metabolic programming in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells maintains their PPARγ expression, which downregulates their glycolysis and thereby increases their survival. This allows these cells to promote AHR and airway inflammation in allergic asthma models.</p>

<title>The ACC1-PPARγ axis in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may also contribute to allergic asthma in humans</title>
<p>We next asked whether patients with allergic asthma demonstrate altered expression of fatty-acid synthesis-related metabolic enzymes in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells compared to healthy volunteers. Thus, we sorted the <italic>i</italic>NKT, Treg, CD4<italic><sup>+</sup></italic> T, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the PBMCs of 10 healthy volunteers, 10 patients with allergic asthma, and 10 patients with nonallergic asthma and examined their mRNA expression of <italic>ACC1</italic> and <italic>PPARG</italic>. We also examined the expression of <italic>FASN</italic> because it, like ACC1, is a key <italic>de novo</italic> fatty-acid synthesis enzyme and our experiment with CD3/CD28-stimulated murine <italic>i</italic>NKT cells and conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells showed that the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells expressed much higher levels of <italic>Fasn</italic> as well as <italic>Acc1</italic> than the other cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Indeed, circulating <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from allergic asthma patients expressed significantly higher levels of <italic>ACC1, FASN</italic>, and <italic>PPARG</italic> than <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from healthy controls and nonallergic asthma patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5A</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from the allergic asthma patients expressed significantly higher <italic>FBP1</italic> levels than the control <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, although this difference was not observed for <italic>HK2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5B</xref>). Lastly, the expression levels of <italic>IL4</italic> and <italic>IL13</italic> were significantly higher in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from the allergic asthma patients compared to those from healthy controls and nonallergic asthma patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5C</xref>). These changes in <italic>ACC1, FASN</italic>, <italic>PPARG</italic>, and <italic>FBP1</italic> expression were much more pronounced in the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from allergic asthma patients than in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and Tregs from the same patients (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Thus, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from allergic asthma patients express higher <italic>ACC1, FASN</italic> and <italic>PPARG</italic> levels and lower levels of a glycolysis which is accompanied with higher levels of <italic>IL4</italic> and <italic>IL13</italic> than <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from healthy controls and nonallergic asthma patients. These findings suggest that the ACC1-PPAR-γ axis in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may also be involved in human allergic asthma.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study showed that <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice exhibited attenuated AHR and airway inflammation in OVA- and HDM-induced asthma models due to the enhanced apoptosis and loss of <italic>Gata3</italic>, <italic>Il4</italic>, and <italic>Il13</italic> expression in lung <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. The mechanism appeared to partly involve the low production in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells of the ACC1-downstream long-chain fatty acid palmitate, which impaired FABP expression; this reduced PPARγ expression and enhanced glycolysis in the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, which promoted their apoptosis. Moreover, the <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice displayed significant defects in the thymic development and peripheral homeostasis of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in a cell-intrinsic manner; thus, homeostatic dysregulation of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may also contribute to the attenuation of AHR in <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.</p>
<p>The negative effect of ACC1 deficiency on the asthmogenic <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell functions is consistent with several studies that suggest that ACC1-mediated <italic>de novo</italic> fatty-acid synthesis can also shape the behavior of other T cells, including Th17 cell and Treg differentiation, IL-5 production by Th2 cells in the lungs, the generation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation. Like us, these studies also show that blocking ACC1 function can improve various diseases in mouse models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In this regard, Tregs may also play a major role in asthma. However, the expression level of Foxp3 was comparable between WT and ACC1-deficient Tregs. The level of Foxp3 to some extent, serves as a critical determinant of suppressive function of Tregs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. Thus, we speculate that they might not critically contribute to the development of asthma, although we cannot completely rule out the contribution of Tregs to our studies.</p>
<p>It should be noted that <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice lack ACC1 expression in both conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. It should be noted that <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice lack ACC1 expression in both conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. While the use of <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-specific Cre system would demonstrate critical role of ACC1 in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells regarding allergic asthma, there is no <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-specific Cre system available yet. In addition, the study conducted by Nakajima et al, which reported that the absence of ACC1 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells resulted in reduced numbers and functional impairment of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, leading to less airway inflammation further suggests possibility of involvement of conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in regulation of allergic asthma.</p>
<p>However, based on our experimental results, we believe that <italic>i</italic>NKT cells more contribute to the regulation of allergic asthma for the following reasons - (i) while the number of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells were significantly reduced in <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice, the number of conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were only slightly reduced, (ii) <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were dramatically decreased in their AHR in α-GalCer induced allergic asthma model, and (iii) Jα18 KO mice that lack <italic>i</italic>NKT cells almost completely restore their AHR when adoptively transferred with WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells but not ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. These results indicate that ACC1-mediated regulation of AHR is significantly dependent on <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, which might contribute to AHR in the study conducted by Nakajima et al. as well. From these, we believe that while ACC1 is a critical regulator of both conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in regulation of allergic asthma, <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may contribute more to regulation of allergic asthma compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>
<p>The possibility that ACC1 regulates survival of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells by programming their metabolism was first revealed by our transcriptome analysis of treatment-naïve <italic>i</italic>NKT cells: the ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells exhibited downregulation of fatty-acid synthesis genes, as could be expected, but also upregulation of glycolysis pathway-related genes. This impaired the survival of the cells: compared to the WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, the ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells were prone to apoptosis. This was observed in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells regardless of whether they were treatment-naïve, stimulated by TCR ligation <italic>in vitro</italic>, or activated during OVA/HDM-mediated asthma. And the apoptotic tendency of these cells was completely reversed by treatment with glycolysis inhibitor <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings are consistent with those of Kumar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, who reported that the production of lactate by <italic>i</italic>NKT cells when their glycolysis is upregulated promotes their cell death.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the apoptotic tendency of the ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells was accompanied by their functional impairment. The ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells exhibited impaired viability and functionality. Treatment of glycolysis inhibitor in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells not only restored cellular survival but also their functionalities. From these results, we speculate that ACC1-mediated regulation of both cellular homeostasis and cytokine production cooperatively contributed to the asthma phenotype.</p>
<p>Our transcriptome assays of naïve <italic>i</italic>NKT cells showed that of the multiple candidate transcription factors that were examined, only <italic>Pparg</italic> was upregulated in WT <italic>i</italic>NKT cells but not ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. This difference was augmented by TCR ligation. This suggested that downregulation of PPARγ could mediate the enhanced glycolysis and apoptosis in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. This was supported by the fact that the PPARγ agonist pioglitazone largely restored gluconeogenesis and downregulated glycolysis and apoptosis in these cells. These findings are consistent with reports that PPARγ regulates the glycolytic pathway, although heterogeneous effects have been noted <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. Our study also supports Fu et al., who observed that lipid biosynthesis is increased in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells after activation, and that this is mediated by PPARγ. Specifically, PPARγ acts synergistically with the transcription factor PLZF (which drives the acquisition of T-helper effector functions by innate and innate-like lymphocytes) to activate the <italic>Srebf1</italic> transcription factor <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, which regulates lipid biosynthesis. This induces cholesterol synthesis, which is required for the optimal production of IFNγ by the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. This PPARγ/PLZ-<italic>Srebf1</italic>-cholesterol pathway was found to contribute to anti-tumor immunity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Previous studies also reported that the PPARγ agonist ciglitazone promotes the TGFβ-dependent conversion of naïve effector T cells into Tregs whereas PPARγ deficiency increases the infiltration of Th17 cells into the central nervous system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Thus, PPARγ can regulate the differentiation of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into both Th17 or Treg cells, which supports the role of PPARγ in <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell homeostasis and functions. However, further research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which PPARγ regulates the metabolic programming and biological changes in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells.</p>
<p>We also explored how PPARγ expression was downregulated in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. Several studies have reported that PPARγ expression can be regulated by endogenous ligands such as FABPs, as well as by histone methylation and acetylation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>, and that these changes can be regulated by the intracellular lipid levels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observed that (i) ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells demonstrated low FABP expression, (ii) exogenous fatty acid not only reversed the effects of ACC1 deficiency on glycolysis and apoptosis, it also restored the expression of both FABPs and PPARγ, and (iii) treating ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells with exogenous palmitate or a PPARγ agonist and then transferring them into <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-deficient mice restored AHR in OVA- or HDM-induced asthma models. Thus, the reduced <italic>de novo</italic> fatty-acid synthesis in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells downregulated the expression of FABPs, which decreased the expression and activity of PPARγ, which in turn promoted glycolysis and apoptosis. This FABP-PPARγ axis was also observed in studies on hepatocytes and adipocytes, which reported that FABPs interact with PPARγ, thereby inducing its transactivation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. However, we did not observe that PPARγ promoter methylation was altered in the ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that the ACC1-FABP-PPARγ axis drives the proglycolytic metabolic reprogramming in ACC1-deficient <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, thereby downregulating <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell homeostasis, and functions, including <italic>i</italic>NKT cell-mediated AHR in asthma models.</p>
<p>Finally, we showed that the ACC1-FABP-PPARγ axis in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may also play pathogenic roles in human allergic asthma: <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in the blood of patients with allergic asthma expressed higher levels of <italic>IL4</italic>, <italic>IL13</italic>, <italic>ACC1</italic>, <italic>FASN</italic>, and <italic>PPARG</italic> and lower levels of a glycolytic gene than the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells of nonallergic asthma patients and healthy controls. Moreover, these genes were up/downregulated much more strongly in the <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from allergic asthma patients than in the other T-cell subsets from the same patients. Notably, the differences between allergic asthma patients and the control patients did not reflect lower frequencies of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells in the PBMCs from the allergic asthma patients (data not shown). This is consistent with speculation in the literature that <italic>i</italic>NKT cells participate in human asthma by altering their phenotype rather than their frequencies: for example, although asthma patients and controls do not differ in terms of <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell frequencies in the BALF, the asthma <italic>i</italic>NKT cells express more IL-4 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Thus, the ACC1-FABP-PPARγ axis in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may be activated and thereby contribute to human allergic asthma pathology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, derangement of the ACC1-FABP-PPAR-γ axis induces glycolysis-related impairment of cell viability in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells, which limits their ability to induce AHR and airway inflammation in murine asthma models. Therefore, <italic>de novo</italic> lipid synthesis in <italic>i</italic>NKT cells may play a critical regulatory role in the development of AHR.</p>

Metabolic profiling was performed by GC-MS/MS dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) analyses using the Agilent 7890/7000 GC triple quadrupole mass spectrometer system. Gas chromatography was conducted using an Agilent J&amp;W HP-5ms UI 15 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm (P/N 19091S-431UI) capillary column. Helium was used as the carrier gas with a constant column flow rate of 1.5 mL min<sup>−1</sup>. The initial oven temperature of 60°C was increased to 320°C at a rate of 10°C min<sup>−1</sup>. The mass spectrometer was operated in the electron ionization mode at 70 eV. The analyses were performed in the dMRM mode. The area ratios of the analyte and the internal standard were used for the evaluation. The split/splitless injector temperature was set to 280°C. The samples were injected in the splitless mode with an autosampler Agilent 7683 A injector. Agilent MassHunter Data Acquisition Software (ver. B.04.00) and MassHunter Workstation Software for Quantitative Analysis (QQQ) were used for data acquisition and the quantitative analysis, respectively. The results were normalized to the <italic>i</italic>NKT-cell numbers and/or total protein concentrations.</p>

<title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title>
<p>To analyze gene-expression levels in the metabolic pathways, immune cells were sorted and pooled from four-eight mice/group, and used in the analysis. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Maloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). For quantitative RT-PCR, gene-specific PCR products were quantified by an Applied Biosystems 7500 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The list of primers and their sequences used are summarized in Table S2. Gene-expression levels were normalized to those of <italic>Actb</italic> for mice and <italic>ACTB</italic> for humans.</p>

<p>Lung tissues were obtained from WT and J[18 KO mice that did or did not undergo transfer of <italic>i</italic>NKT cells from <italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> and <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre<italic>Acc1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice during OVA- or HDM-induced asthma. The tissues were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned, followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Lung inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia were graded using a semi-quantitative scoring system as previously described <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Briefly, inflammatory-cell numbers were graded as follows: 0: normal; 1: few cells; 2: a ring of inflammatory cells that was 1 cell-layer deep; 3: a ring of inflammatory cells that was 2–4 cell-layers deep; and 4: a ring of inflammatory cells that was &gt;4 cell-layers deep. The goblet-cell numbers in the airway were graded as follows: 0: &lt; 0.5% PAS-positive cells; 1: &lt; 25%; 2: 25–50%; 3: 50–75%; and 4: &gt; 75%. Two fields were counted for each slide and mean score was calculated for each group. Two pulmonary pathologists reviewed and analyzed representative images.</p>

<title>ECAR and OCR assays</title>
<p><italic>i</italic>NKT cells were sorted from eight mice/group and pooled together. ECAR and OCR assays were performed using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer XF24e (Seahorse Bioscience Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a Seahorse plate and cultured overnight to 70–80% confluence. The culture medium was then replaced with cellular assay medium supplemented with 1 mM glutamine for the ECAR assay and 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and 10 mM glucose for the OCR assay. The cells were incubated for 1 h in a CO<sub>2</sub>-free incubator before measurement. The assays were performed according to the Seahorse protocols with final concentrations of 10 mM glucose, 2 μM oligomycin, and 50 mM 2-DG for ECAR, and 2 μM oligomycin, 1 μM carbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 1 μM antimycin A for OCR. These assays were performed in at least three independent experiments on separate days.</p>

<title>Pyrosequencing assay</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was converted with bisulfite by using the EZ DNA Methylation Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PyroMarkTM software was used to design the pyrosequencing primers. In brief, bisulfite-converted DNA was subjected to PCR amplification in a total volume of 25 µL. DNA methylation was assessed using a PyroMark Q48 Autoprep system (Qiagen) and PyroMark Q48 Advanced CpG Reagents (Qiagen). The nucleotide dispensation order was generated by entering the sequences into the PyroMark Q48 Autoprep software ver. 2.4.2 (Qiagen). The methylation at each CpG site was determined using the PyroMark Q48 Autoprep software set in CpG mode. The mean methylation of all CpG sites within the target region was determined by using the methylation at the individual CpG sites.</p>

<p>In this study the authors sought to investigate how the metabolic state of iNKT cells impacts their potential pathological role in allergic asthma. The authors used two mouse models, OVA and HDM-induced asthma, and assessed genes in glycolysis, TCA, B-oxidation and FAS. They found that acetyl-coA-carboxylase 1 (ACC1) was highly expressed by lung iNKT cells and that ACC1 deficient mice failed to develop OVA-induced and HDM-induced asthma. Importantly, when they performed bone marrow chimera studies, when mice that lacked iNKT cells were given ACC1 deficient iNKT cells, the mice did not develop asthma, in contrast to mice given wildtype NKT cells. In addition, these observed effects were specific to NKT cells, not classic CD4 T cells. Mechanistically, iNKT cell that lack AAC1 had decreased expression of fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)γ, but increased glycolytic capacity and increased cell death. Moreover, the authors were able to reverse the phenotype with the addition of a PPARg agonist. When the authors examined iNKT cells in patient samples, they observed higher levels of ACC1 and PPARG levels, compared to healthy donors and non-allergic-asthma patients.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript focused on roles of a key fatty-acid synthesis enzyme, acetyl-coA-carboxylase 1 (ACC1), in the metabolism, gene regulation and homeostasis of invariant natural killer T (NKT_ cells and impact on these T cells' roles during asthma pathogenesis. The authors presented data showing that the acetyl-coA-carboxylase 1 enzyme regulates the expression of PPARg then the function of NKT cells including the secretion of Th2-type cytokines to impact on asthma pathogenesis. The results are clearcut and data were logically presented.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. This study heavily relied on the CD4-CreACC1fl/fl mice. While using of a-GalCer stimulation and Ja18KO mice mitigated the concern, it is still a major concern that at least some of the phenotype were due to the effect on conventional CD4 T cells. For example, the deletion of ACC1 gene seems also decreased the numbers of conventional CD4 T cells (Fig. 2D, Fig. S1D). Previously there were reports showing ACC1 gene in conventional CD4 T cells also plays a role in lung inflammation (Nakajima et al., J. Exp. Med. 218, 2021). If the authors believe the phenotype observed was mainly due to iNKT cells, rather than conventional CD4 T cells, a compare/contrast of the two studies should be discussed to explain or reconcile the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer pointed out, although we have experimentally demonstrated the critical role of ACC1 in iNKT cells in the regulation of allergic asthma, use of Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice inevitably brings the role of conventional CD4+ T-cells in question.</p>
<p>The study conducted by Nakajima et al, which reported that the absence of ACC1 in CD4+ T-cells resulted in reduced numbers and functional impairment of memory CD4+ T-cells, leading to less airway inflammation further suggests possibility of involvement of conventional CD4+ T-cells in regulation of allergic asthma. The direct compare/contrast of two studies seems difficult since Nakajima et al have focused on the role of ACC1 in memory CD4+ T cells while we have focused on iNKT cells.</p>
<p>However, based on our experimental results, we believe that iNKT cells more contribute to the regulation of allergic asthma for the following reasons - (i) while the number of iNKT cells were significantly reduced in Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice, the number of conventional CD4+ T cells were only slightly reduced, (ii) Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice were dramatically decreased in their AHR in α-GalCer induced iNKT cell dependent allergic asthma model, and (iii) Jα18 KO mice that lack iNKT cells almost completely restore their AHR when adoptively transferred with WT iNKT cells but not ACC1-deficient iNKT cells. These results indicate that ACC1-mediated regulation of AHR is significantly dependent on iNKT cells, which might contribute to AHR in the study conducted by Nakajima et al. as well. From these, we believe that while ACC1 is a critical regulator of both conventional CD4+ T cells and iNKT cells in regulation of allergic asthma, iNKT cells may contribute more to regulation of allergic asthma compared to CD4+ T cells. We have summarized the above-mentioned contents in LINES: 421-441 with the reference you have mentioned:</p>
<p>&quot;It should be noted that Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice lack ACC1 expression in both conventional CD4+ T cells and iNKT cells. It should be noted that Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice lack ACC1 expression in both conventional CD4+ T cells and iNKT cells. While the use of iNKT cell- specific Cre system would demonstrate critical role of ACC1 in iNKT cells regarding allergic asthma, there is no iNKT cell-specific Cre system available yet. In addition, the study conducted by Nakajima et al, which reported that the absence of ACC1 in CD4+ T cells resulted in reduced numbers and functional impairment of memory CD4+ T cells, leading to less airway inflammation further suggests possibility of involvement of conventional CD4+ T cells in regulation of allergic asthma.

<p>1. The overall significance of the manuscript is related to the potential clinical suppression of ACC1 in human asthma patients. However, the authors only showed the elevated ACC1 genes in these patients, not even in vitro data demonstrating that suppression of ACC1 genes in the iNKT cells from patients could have potential therapeutic effect or suppression of the relevant cytokines.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to appreciate reviewer’s critical comment here. Due to paucity of iNKT cells in human PBMCs, it is extremely difficult to experimentally manipulate expression level of ACC1 in human iNKT cells. Alternatively, to address reviewer’s comment, we compared the cytokine expression of ACC1high iNKT cells from human allergic asthma patients to ACC1low iNKT cells from healthy individuals or non-allergic asthma patients. Our results show that iNKT cells from allergic asthma patients express higher levels of IL4 and IL13 than those from healthy individuals or non-allergic asthma patients, suggesting that the level of ACC1 is most likely involved in functionality of human iNKT cells as well. The results are newly shown in supplementary Fig. 5C with explanation in LINES 376-378 and 382-384:</p>
<p>LINES 376-378: Lastly, the expression levels of IL4 and IL13 were significantly higher in iNKT cells from the allergic asthma patients compared to those from healthy controls and nonallergic asthma patients (Fig. S5C).</p>
<p>LINES 382-384: Thus, iNKT cells from allergic asthma patients express higher ACC1, FASN and PPARG levels and lower levels of a glycolysis which is accompanied with higher levels of IL4 and IL13 than iNKT cells from healthy controls and nonallergic asthma patients.</p>

<p>1. The authors report that a-GalCer administration can induce the AHR, however, in the cited paper (Hachem et al., Eur J. Immunol. 35, 2793, 2005), iNKT cell activation seems to have the opposite effect to inhibit AHR. Did the authors mean to cite different papers?</p>

<p>1. Related to major concern I, an iNKT cell-specific knockout of ACC1 in iNKT cells is highly desirable and should be used to directly address the question.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, iNKT cell-specific deletion of ACC1 will provide invaluable information to our study. Unfortunately, Cre-Loxp system that specifically targets iNKT cells has not be developed. Thus, we opted to use CD4-Cre system, which is the gold standard Cre system for the study of iNKT cells. In addition, to highlight the role of ACC1 in iNKT cells in relation to regulation of allergic asthma, we performed iNKT cell-dependent experiment models and conducted adoptive transfer of iNKT cells into iNKT cell-deficient mice (Jα18 KO). These have been discussed in the section of Discussion in LINES:421-441:</p>
<p>&quot;It should be noted that Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice lack ACC1 expression in both conventional CD4+ T cells and iNKT cells. While the use of iNKT cell- specific Cre system would demonstrate critical role of ACC1 in iNKT cells regarding allergic asthma, there is no iNKT cell-specific Cre system available yet.

<p>1. For Fig. 5A, RT-PCR verification of PPARg gene expression level change is needed.</p>

<p>As suggested, we have verified the level of Pparg expression of ACC1-deficient iNKT cells through real time PCR and have added the results to Figure 5A.</p>

<p>1. Verifying at least the cytokine secretion can be regulated by manipulating ACC1 expression in human asthma patient samples will make the paper much stronger.</p>

<p>Minor points:</p>
<p>1. What are the cells being stained in Fig. S2C? Are they iNKT cells? If yes, why there is a tetramer-negative population?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The density plot on the left panel of Fig. S2C represents magnetically enriched thymic iNKT cells. Due to their scarcity, thymic iNKT cells were enriched using CD1d tetramer via magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS)-based enrichment technique. After enrichment, we re-stained enriched cells with CD1d tetramers and gated out CD3 and CD1d tetramer double positive cells via flow cytometry to specifically identify iNKT cells. Due to the imperfect purity of magnetic cell separation technique, a small proportion of CD1d tetramer-negative population is seen in the left panel of Fig. S2C.</p>
<p>A brief mention of this methodology has been added to the “Preparation and activation of murine T and iNKT cells” section under Materials and Methods in LINES 560-566:</p>
<p>&quot;Alternatively, thymic and liver mononuclear cells were labeled with APC-conjugated ɑ-GalCer/CD1d tetramers, bound to anti-APC magnetic beads, and enriched on a MACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA; purity 89%). To analyze the development of thymic iNKTs cells, we re-stained enriched cells with CD1d tetramer and gated out CD3 and CD1d tetramer double positive cells via flow cytometry to identify thymic iNKT cells, which were used for further analysis.&quot;</p>

<p>1. Where are the adoptive transferred iNKT cells purified/sorted from? Are they from lungs of Acc1fl/fl or CD4-cre/Acc1fl/fl mice, asthma-induced already? As there are very few iNKT cells in healthy and untreated mice. There is little described or explained in Methods and Materials.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The adoptively transferred iNKT cells were purified and pooled from the lungs of at least 10 mice per group. Briefly, mouse lungs were finely chopped into small pieces using razor blades and enzymatically digested using type IV collagenase. iNKT cells from the lungs were sorted via FACS using CD1d tetramers. Approximately, 6.0 × 105 of iNKT cells were obtained from the lungs at least of 10 mice. A brief mention of this methodology was added to the “Adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in allergic asthma models” section in Materials and Methods in LINES 568-574: iNKT cells were obtained from the lungs of at least 10 Acc1fl/fl or Cd4-CreAcc1fl/fl mice. Mouse lungs were finely chopped into small pieces using razor blades and were enzymatically digested using type IV collagenase. iNKT cells from the lungs were sorted via FACS using CD1d tetramers. Approximately, 6.0 × 105 of iNKT cells were obtained from at least 10 mice and were adoptively transferred into individual recipient mouse via the intratracheal route.</p>

<p>1. The use of 2-NBDG was not explained in multiple locations, particularly in Fig.5H. How is its fluorescence used to track iNKT cells? No description in Materials and methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>2-NBDG, a fluorescence tagged glucose analog is a indicator for measurement of glucose uptake in cells. The fluorescence intensity in 2-NBDG-treated cells represents the degree of glucose uptake in cells, which can be measured using flow cytometry. Thus, in the experiments where we treated 2-NBDG, we described the results as &quot;glucose uptake&quot;. A brief explanation of this methodology was added to the main text in LINES 253-254. In addition, we have provided the detailed use of 2-NBDG in ‘Measurement of glucose uptake capacity’ under the section of Materials and methods in LINES 599-607: Measurement of glucose uptake capacity using 2-NBDG assay. After treating 2-NBDG, the fluorescence intensity of cells were measured using flow cytometry and represented the degree of glucose uptake in cells.</p>

<p>1. Fig. 3A legends: it should be &quot;Ja18 KO&quot;?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to appreciate your comment on our mistake here. We have corrected this in the legend of figure 3A.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There are two different mechanisms for explaining the less severe asthma/AHR phenotype in ACC1-KO iNKT cells. One is lower number of iNKT cells due to cell death, the other decreased cytokine secretions. It is not clear to the reviewer, what are the relationship between two mechanisms. Are they both contributing to the asthma phenotype or cooperative?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you mentioned, ACC1-deficient iNKT cells showed increase in intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as well as decrease in their cytokine secretion simultaneously. Thus, we believe that increase in cell death and decrease in cytokine expression of ACC1-deficient iNKT cells cooperatively contributed to the asthma phenotype. The above-mentioned point was discussed in LINES 453-458: Furthermore, the apoptotic tendency of the ACC1-deficient iNKT cells was accompanied by their functional impairment. The ACC1-deficient iNKT cells exhibited impaired viability and functionality. Treatment of glycolysis inhibitor in ACC1-deficient iNKT cells not only restored cellular survival but also their functionalities. From these results, we speculate that ACC1-mediated regulation of both cellular homeostasis and cytokine production cooperatively contributed to the asthma phenotype.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, this is a very strong study with few concerns.</p>
<p>1. Are there tissue specific differences in the iNKT cell populations? The authors examined lung iNKT cells in the Figs 1-3, and used liver NKT cells for the mechanistic studies in Fig 4-5. The studies shown in Fig S2 suggest that ACC1 deficient iNKT cells have developmental defects and impaired homeostatic proliferative capacity. Does ACC1 impact lung and liver iNKT cells similarly and is the lack of allergic asthma in ACC1 deficient iNKT cells due to defective iNKT cell trafficking to the lungs or a failure to survive after transfer (Fig 3)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In absence of ACC1, the number of iNKT cells from both lungs and livers decreased and showed consistent features (i.e: metabolic parameters), suggesting that there was no tissue specific role of ACC1 in INKT cells.</p>
<p>In the adoptive transfer experiments, we transferred equal number of WT and ACC1-deficient iNKT cells directly into mouse lungs via intratracheal route. Thus, decreased numbers of adoptively transferred ACC1-deficient iNKT cells is more likely from their intrinsically impaired homeostatic proliferative capacity, not due to defective trafficking to the lungs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Similarly, are chemokine receptor expression patterns similar between WT and ACC1 deficient iNKTs (Fig 4)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We compared chemokine receptor expression of WT and ACC1-deficient iNKT cells using our RNA-seq and verified their expression levels via real time q-PCR. The expression levels of these chemokine receptors were comparable between the two groups of iNKT cells. The results are newly shown in supplementary Fig. 4I with explanation in LINES 351-357:</p>
<p>Meanwhile, chemokine receptor signaling is also implicated in regulating homeostasis of iNKT cell in the periphery. In particular, Meyer et al. suggested that iNKT cells require CCR4 to localize to the airways and to induce AHR. Thus, we examined the expression of several chemokine receptors, including CCR4. We found that WT and ACC1-deficient iNKT cells did not differ in their chemokine receptor expressions, suggesting that the chemokine signaling may not be critical for ACC1-mediated regulation in AHR.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors data suggest that Tregs are not playing a major role in the regulation of asthma induction in their ACC1 deficient mice, based on FoxP3 expression. Did the authors perform suppressor assays to show that the Tregs function similarly in WT and ACC1 deficient mice?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to appreciate reviewer’s reasonable comment. However, we did not experimentally compare the suppressive capacity of WT and ACC1-deficient Tregs under the asthmatic conditions, due to minimal differences in their Foxp3 expression (Foxp3 expression is a critical determinant of suppressive function of Tregs- (Immunity. 2019 Feb 19;50(2):302-316.; Nat Immunol 2003; 4: 330–336; Cell Mol Immunol. 2015 Sep;12(5):558-65.)). Thus, we speculate that the suppressive capacity between WT and ACC1-deficient Tregs might be similar. Nevertheless, since the suppressive capacity of Tregs can also be regulated by other soluble factors and surface molecules, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that ACC1-deficient Tregs might differ in their suppressive capacity to WT Tregs in asthma. In short, while there are clear limitations to our interpretation here, we believe it is unlikely that Tregs from WT and ACC1 deficient mice show difference in their suppressive capacity during asthma. We have included above-mentioned points in the section of Discussion in LINES 415-419: In this regard, Tregs may also play a major role in asthma. However, the expression level of Foxp3 was comparable between WT and ACC1-deficient Tregs. The level of Foxp3 to some extent, serves as a critical determinant of suppressive function of Tregs. Thus, we speculate that they might not critically contribute to the development of asthma, although we cannot completely rule out the contribution of Tregs to our studies.</p>
