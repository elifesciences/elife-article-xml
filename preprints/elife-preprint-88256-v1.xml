<title>Abstract</title><p>In tumors with WT p53, alternate mechanisms of p53 inactivation are reported. Here we have identified a long noncoding RNA, PITAR (<italic>p</italic>53 <italic>I</italic>nactivating <italic>T</italic>RIM28 <italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>R</italic>NA), as an inhibitor of p53. PITAR is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). We found that TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of PITAR. PITAR interaction with TRIM28 RNA stabilized TRIM28 mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels, enhanced p53 ubiquitination, and attenuated DNA damage response. While PITAR silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. DNA damage also activated PITAR, in addition to p53, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop. Thus, we establish an alternate way of p53 inactivation and propose PITAR, an oncogenic Cancer/testis lncRNA, as a potential therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much of the human genome once considered as “junk DNA” is now shown to be pervasively transcribed into thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Accumulated evidence over the last two decades implicated lncRNA in fundamental biological processes that play an essential role in several pathological conditions like cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Djebali et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Slack &amp; Chinnaiyan, 2019b</xref>). LncRNA constitutes a major subset among ncRNAs, and is arbitrarily defined as transcripts of longer than 500 bps, which are spliced, 5’ capped, and poorly conserved across species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cabili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Derrien et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Iyer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mattick et al., 2023</xref>). LncRNAs function through multiple mechanisms, such as their specific interactions with DNA, RNA, and proteins, that can modulate chromatin structure, regulate the assembly and function of membrane-less bodies, alter the stability and translation of mRNAs and interfere with their signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Statello et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays an important role in preserving genome integrity and inhibiting malignant transformation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Levine, 1997</xref>). p53, which gets activated in response to stress like DNA damage, activates the transcription of many protein coding genes that control several cellular processes like cell cycle, programmed cell death, and senescence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Beckerman &amp; Prives, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bieging &amp; Attardi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Riley et al., 2008</xref>). p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vousden &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>). In cancers that do not carry mutations in p53, the inactivation occurs through other genetic or epigenetic alterations(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mitra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Olivier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vousden &amp; Lu, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>LncRNAs have been shown to play an important role in the p53 network. While several lncRNAs such as LincRNA-p21, DINO, PANDA, LINC-PANT, GUARDIN, NEAT1, NBAT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mitra et al., 2021</xref>), and PVT1 are shown to function as downstream effectors of p53, other lncRNA like MEG3, MALAT1, H19, Linc-ROR, and PSTAR act as upstream regulators of p53(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jain, 2020</xref>). Our study identified a lncRNA called <italic>p</italic>53 <italic>I</italic>nactivating <italic>T</italic>RIM28 <italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>R</italic>NA (PITAR) as a p53 inactivator with a protumorigenic function. PITAR is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and interacts with TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM28 inhibits p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner(C. Wang et al., 2005a). PITAR-TRIM28 interaction stabilized TRIM28 mRNA resulting in higher levels of TRIM28 protein that promoted ubiquitin-mediated degradation of p53. We also found that PITAR is essential for glioma tumor growth, and PITAR is induced by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner. Thus, our study discovered PITAR as an inhibitor of p53 via a unique mechanism of interaction with TRIM28 mRNA and a potential target for developing novel therapy.</p>

<title>Identification of PITAR (FAM95B1), conserved cancer/testis lncRNA that promotes cell proliferation in GBM</title>
<p>In a recent study involving our group’s transcriptional profiling of mRNAs and lncRNAs, we identified several GBM-specific clinically relevant lncRNA regulatory networks(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Paul et al., 2018</xref>). To identify GBM-associated lncRNAs with functional relevance to glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) biology, we integrated the differentially regulated RNAs (DEGs) from GBM vs control brain samples (TCGA) (<bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold>) with DEGs from GSC vs differentiated glioma cells (DGCs)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Suvà et al., 2014</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). The GBM and GSC integrated analysis revealed three interesting lncRNA PVT1, H19, and FAM95B1, showing significant upregulation in both GBM and GSCs (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></bold>). Of the three GBM and GSC-specific regulated lncRNAs, PVT1 and H19 have been extensively investigated for their role in cancer development and progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Azab &amp; Azzam, 2021</xref>; R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lv et al., 2022</xref>; G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Xue et al., 2018</xref>), whereas FAM95B1 (ENSG00000223839.7, NONHSAG052279.2, Lnc-ANKRD20A3-51) has not been explored for its role in cancer. We have named the FAM95B1 lncRNA as PITAR (<bold><italic>p</italic></bold>53 <bold><italic>i</italic></bold>nactivating <bold><italic>T</italic></bold>RIM28-<bold><italic>a</italic></bold>ssociated lnc<bold><italic>R</italic></bold>NA) as we found it has a strong functional association with the well-known tumor suppressor gene p53.</p>

<p>PITAR is significantly upregulated in multiple GBM cohorts (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-E</xref></bold>) and patient-derived GSCs, (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F and G</xref></bold>). The PITAR transcript also showed a one-to-one significant negative correlation between GSCs, and DGCs (<bold>Supplementary figure 1A</bold>). PITAR promoter harbored active histone marks (H3k27Ac) in GSCs but not in DGCs (<bold>Supplementary figure 1B</bold>); thus, H3K27ac levels at the PITAR promoter in GSCs correlate with its expression status. Additional independent validation confirmed its higher expression in multiple glioma cell lines compared to immortalized astrocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>) and in multiple patient-derived GSC lines (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref></bold>). Pan cancer data analysis revealed specific upregulation of PITAR in GBM and low-grade glioma (LGG) except in neuroendocrine tumor Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma (PCPG) (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref></bold>). Further, the interrogation of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) of normal tissues revealed highly tissue-restricted expression of PITAR, with the highest expression in the testis, thus resembling the expression properties of cancer-testis antigens (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1K</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>PITAR, located in human chromosome 9, has a 4236-nucleotide-long transcript (Transcript: ENST00000455995.5) with four exons (<bold>Supplementary figure 2A</bold>). The noncoding nature of PITAR was confirmed by the Coding Potential Assessing Tool (CPAT) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/orffinder/</ext-link>; data not shown). The subcellular localization by fractionation followed by RT-qPCR identified that PITAR is primarily located in the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Similarly, the RNA In situ hybridization using RNAScope technology revealed that PITAR is located 80% in the nucleus (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). PITAR silencing by two different siRNAs, # 1 and # 2 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>), reduced cell proliferation, viable cell count, colony formation, arrested cells in G0/G1 phase, and induced apoptosis in U87 glioma cell line (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E, F, G</xref>, and H</bold>). PITAR silencing in U343 glioma cells also showed similar results (<bold>Supplementary figure 2B, C, D, and E</bold>). Further, PITAR silencing showed more sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, Adriamycin, and Temozolomide (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref></bold>). Interestingly, PITAR silencing did not affect the viable cell count in immortalized astrocytes (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref></bold>). Overall, PITAR is a cancer-testis lncRNA that displays GBM and GSC-specific higher expression. We also demonstrate that PITAR promotes the growth of glioma cells and confers resistance to DNA damaging agents.</p>

<title>TRIM28 (Tripartite Motif Containing 28) mRNA is the direct target of PITAR</title>
<p>To identify PITAR interacting RNAs, we carried out an integrated analysis of RNA-Seq data from Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP), performed using biotinylated PITAR-specific antisense probes and RNA-Seq data of PITAR silenced glioma cells. ChIRP was carried out using an odd (n=7) and even (n=7) set of biotinylated PITAR-specific antisense probes (<bold>Supplementary figure 2A</bold>). RNA-Seq data of ChIRP RNA and further independent validation of ChIRP RNA with RT-qPCR showed an efficient pulldown of PITAR by both odd and even probes compared to LacZ (Control) probes (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and B</bold>). The ChIRP data demonstrated that 827 mRNAs were enriched in the pulldowns using even and odd antisense probes compared to LacZ probes (<bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold>). To choose the physiologically relevant target(s) for further studies, we intersected the ChIRP RNAs with i) GBM-associated differentially expressed transcripts that show a significant positive correlation (p &lt;0.05 and r &gt; 0.25) with PITAR transcript (<bold>Supplementary Table 3</bold>), ii) GBM upregulated transcripts (<bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>), and iii) GSC upregulated transcripts (<bold>Supplementary Table 5</bold>). This analysis identified 15 transcripts as potential targets of PITAR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, D</xref></bold>). Parallelly, RNA-Seq data of PITAR silenced U87 cells identified 946 differentially regulated genes (526 upregulated and 420 downregulated) (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>; Supplementary Table 6</bold>). Gene ontology analysis of DEGs showed significant enrichment of biological processes such as “cell cycle,” “apoptosis,” and “p53” (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed significant enrichment of p53-regulated gene networks (<bold>Supplementary Table 7; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref></bold>), indicating that PITAR executes its functions by interfering with p53 functions.</p>

<p>To explore the functional role of PITAR in p53-dependent gene expression, we chose TRIM28 among the ChIRP targets considering its role as p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase(C. Wang et al., 2005b). TRIM28, also known as KAP1 (Krüppel-Associated Box (KRAB)-Associated Protein 1), is a multidomain protein involved in various biological functions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Czerwińska et al., 2017</xref>). TRIM28 inhibits p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner(C. Wang et al., 2005a). RNA-Seq data of the ChIRP assay showed specific pulldown of TRIM28 mRNA by PITAR-specific odd and even antisense probes compared to LacZ probes (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3A</bold>). TRIM28 is significantly upregulated in multiple GBM cohorts (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4A, B, C, D, and E</bold>). Consistent with the ChIRP data, TRIM28 and PITAR transcripts showed a significant positive correlation in all GBM cohorts (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4F, G, H, I, and J</bold>). Like PITAR, the TRIM28 transcript is also expressed at higher levels in GSCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4K</bold>), with a significant positive correlation between their expression in GSCs (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4 L</bold>). Further, TRIM28 protein showed higher levels in GBM as measured by quantitative proteomics data from Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) and immunohistochemistry from the Protein atlas (<bold>Supplementary Figure 4M and N</bold>).</p>
<p>Next, we investigated the specificity and impact of the interaction between PITAR and TRIM28 transcripts. Independent validation of ChIRP RNA with RT-qPCR showed an efficient pulldown of PITAR by PITAR-specific probes compared to LacZ (Control) probes (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Noncoding RNAs interact with target mRNAs through direct or indirect RNA-RNA interactions(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Engreitz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Faghihi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gong &amp; Maquat, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kretz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Mahale et al., 2022b</xref>). Enrichment of TRIM28 mRNA in the PITAR ChIRP pulldowns indicates the presence of potential TRIM28:PITAR mRNA:lncRNA interactions. Hence, we checked for the possible direct interaction between PITAR and TIRM28 by performing an RNA-RNA interaction analysis using the IntaRNA tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp">http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp</ext-link>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gawronski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Mann et al., 2017</xref>). This analysis identified the most energetically favorable 80 bp interacting region between the 3’ UTR of the TRIM28 transcript and the first exon of PITAR (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>; Supplementary Table 8</bold>). Next, we performed multiplexed RNAScope in U87 cells to evaluate the interaction between PITAR and TRIM28 in the cellular environment. The co-staining of U87 cells for TRIM28 transcript with the PITAR or PDE2A and PITAR with PDE2A demonstrated a specific colocalization of PITAR and TRIM28 transcripts, mainly in the nucleus. The extent of colocalization was much greater than that expected from coincidental colocalization with a similar abundant transcript, such as PDE2A (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure. 4C</xref>; Supplementary figure 3C</bold>).</p>

<p>To further confirm the interaction between PITAR and TRIM28, we cloned the first exon under the CMV promoter (PITAR OE) for exogenous overexpression and in vitro synthesis of biotin-labeled sense PITAR RNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). First, we checked the ability of biotin-labeled PITAR sense RNA (first exon; made from PITAR OE) to bring down the TRIM28 mRNA from total RNA. PITAR-specific sense, but not antisense, biotinylated RNA brought down TRIM28 RNA efficiently (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, compare bar four with three</bold>). PITAR sense RNA with a deletion of the 80 bp interacting region failed to bring down TRIM28 RNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, compare bar five with four</bold>). The control biotin-labeled RNA (FLuc) and bead control did not bring down TRIM28 mRNA as expected. Further, we performed an antisense oligo-blocking experiment to validate the TRIM28 binding site on PITAR. Preincubation of fragmented total RNA with unlabelled PITAR antisense probe # 3, which is located close to the TRIM28 binding region on the exon 1 of PITAR, inhibited the ability of PITAR biotinylated antisense (odd) probe set to bring down TRIM28 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 3B</bold>). Next, we tested the ability of PITAR to regulate luciferase activity from the TRIM28-3’UTR-Luc construct (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref></bold>). The exogenous overexpression of PITAR (PITAR OE), but not PITAR with a deletion of 1303-1381 nucleotides (ΔPITAR OE), significantly increased the luciferase activity from the TRIM28-3’UTR-Luc construct (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>, compare bars two and three with one</bold>). In contrast, PITAR silencing significantly decreased the luciferase activity from TRIM28-3’UTR-Luc but was rescued by the exogenous overexpression of PITAR (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>, compare bar two with one or four</bold>). In contrast, the ability of PITAR exogenous overexpression to increase the luciferase activity from the delTRIM28-3’UTR-Luc construct, which has a deletion of 80 bp region corresponding to the PITAR binding region, is significantly reduced (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>, compare bar four with two</bold>). Next, to study the impact of PITAR interaction on TRIM28 expression, we measured TRIM28 transcript and protein levels in PITAR-silenced conditions. PITAR silencing significantly reduced TRIM28 mRNA (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, compare bar four with three</bold>) and protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>, compare lane two with one</bold>). In actinomycin-treated U87 glioma cells, PITAR silencing reduced the TRIM28 mRNA half-life significantly compared with control cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>, compare red line with blue line</bold>). From these results, we conclude that PITAR interaction stabilizes TRIM28 mRNA to promote TRIM28 expression.</p>

<title>PITAR is DNA damage-inducible in a p53-independent manner and inhibits basal and DNA damage-induced p53 protein levels by its association with TRIM28 mRNA</title>
<p>TRIM28 inhibits p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner(C. Wang et al., 2005a). We next investigated the impact of PITAR interaction with TRIM28 on p53. PITAR silencing in U87 glioma cells increased the luciferase activity from PG13-Luc, a p53-dependent reporter(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">El-Deiry et al., 1993</xref>) (<bold>Supplementary figure 5A</bold>), decreased PITAR and TRIM28 mRNA levels increased CDKN1A mRNA levels with no change in p53 mRNA levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></bold>). At the protein level, PITAR silencing decreased TRIM28 levels but increased p53 and CDKN1A levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, compare lane two with one</bold>). In contrast, exogenous PITAR overexpression increased PITAR and TRIM28 mRNA levels and reduced CDKN1A mRNA levels without changing p53 mRNA levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Further, exogenous PITAR overexpression increased TRIM28 protein levels but decreased p53 and CDKN1A protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, compare lane two with one</bold>), thus indicating that PITAR reduces p53 protein levels by regulating TRIM28. In cycloheximide-treated U87 glioma cells, the half-life of p53 increased (1.20 hr) under PITAR silenced conditions compared to control cells (0.50 hrs) (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>). In good correlation, PITAR overexpression increased the ubiquitinated p53 levels in MG132-treated U87 glioma cells compared to the control condition (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>, compare lane four with two</bold>). To confirm that TRIM28 mediates PITAR regulation of p53, we checked the ability of exogenously overexpressed TRIM28 (using a 3’UTRless TRIM28 construct) to rescue the phenotype in PITAR-silenced cells. In TRIM28 overexpressing cells, PITAR silencing failed to increase luciferase activity from PG13-Luc (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>, compare bar four with two</bold>) and CDKN1A transcript levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>, compare bar four with two</bold>). TRIM28 overexpression resulted in a several-fold increase in TRIM28 mRNA levels in U87/siNT cells (<bold>Supplementary figure 5B, compare bar three with one</bold>). While this increase was significantly affected by PITAR silencing, the TRIM28 transcript levels remained high in U87/siPITAR cells (<bold>Supplementary figure 5B, compare bar four with two</bold>). As expected, TRIM28 overexpression did not affect the PITAR mRNA levels in U87/siNT and U87/siPITAR cells (<bold>Supplementary figure 5C</bold>). More importantly, TRIM28 overexpression significantly reduced p53 and CDKN1A protein levels in PITAR-silenced U87 glioma cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>, compare lane four with two</bold>).

<p>Next, we investigated the impact of PITAR on DNA damage-induced p53. Adriamycin-induced luciferase activity from PG13-Luc (<bold>Supplementary figure 5D, compare bar four with three</bold>) and CDKN1A mRNA levels are significantly reduced by PITAR overexpression (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>, compare bar four with three</bold>). At the protein level, PITAR overexpression significantly reduced adriamycin-induced total p53, acetylated p53, and CDKN1A levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>, compare lane four with three</bold>). PITAR overexpression also affected the functions of adriamycin-induced p53. The viable cell count increased substantially in adriamycin-treated cells by PITAR overexpression (<bold>Supplementary figure 5E, compare bar four with three</bold>). Similarly, the extent of G2/M arrest seen in adriamycin-treated cells is reduced significantly by PITAR overexpression (<bold>42.34 % is reduced to 34.42%; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref></bold>). To verify the possible existence of a negative feedback loop between PITAR and p53, we checked the ability of p53, expressed from a recombinant adenovirus, to induce PITAR transcript levels. We found that Ad-p53 induced p53 and CDKN1A mRNA and protein levels compared to the control virus (Ad-GFP) but did not alter the PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels (<bold>Supplementary figure 5F and G</bold>), thus confirming that neither PITAR nor TRIM28 is the direct target of p53. Interestingly, DNA damage by adriamycin treatment induced PITAR, TRIM28, and CDKN1A transcripts and TRIM28, p53, and CDKN1A protein levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref> and Supplementary figure 5H</bold>). The pretreatment of U87 glioma cells with CGK733, a small molecule inhibitor of ATM/ATR kinase, prevented the adriamycin-mediated induction of PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5N</xref></bold>) and TRIM28 protein level (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5O</xref></bold>). ATM/ATR kinase mediates DNA damage-induced activation of p53(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cheng &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Tibbetts et al., 1999</xref>). Our results show that adriamycin treatment induced PITAR transcript levels efficiently in U87/shP53 #1 cells (<bold>Supplementary figure 5I, compare bar four with three</bold>), indicating DNA damage-mediated PITAR induction is p53 independent. However, the DNA damage-induced TRIM28 transcript upregulation is found to be dependent on PITAR upregulation, as adriamycin failed to induce TRIM28 in PITAR-silenced U87 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5P</xref>, compare bar eight with seven</bold>). This was further confirmed by the fact that adriamycin-induced luciferase activity from TRIM28 3’-UTR-Luc is inhibited by CGK733 treatment (<bold>Supplementary figure 5J, compare bar three with two</bold>), suggesting the requirement of PITAR for the TRIM28 transcript upregulation in DNA-damaged cells. These results establish that PITAR is DNA damage-inducible in a p53-independent manner, and it inactivates p53 through its association with TRIM28 mRNA.</p>

<title>PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth and resistance to Temozolomide chemotherapy</title>
<p>Towards investigating the role of PITAR on glioma tumor growth, we tested the impact of modulation of PITAR on the growth of glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) in vitro. The ability of RG5, a patient-derived glioma stem cell line containing WT p53 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6A</bold>), to grow as a neurosphere was investigated in PITAR-silenced and overexpressed conditions. PITAR silencing inhibited the RG5 GSC growth in the neurosphere growth assay and limiting dilution assay (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B, C</xref>, and D</bold>). PITAR silencing resulted in a decrease in PITAR and TRIM28 but an increase in CDKN1A transcript levels (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). As expected, there was no change in p53 transcript levels (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref></bold>). The exogenous overexpression of PITAR promoted the neurosphere growth by RG5 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F, G</xref>, and H</bold>) and increased PITAR and TRIM28 transcript levels but decreased the CDKN1A transcript levels with no change in p53 transcript levels (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref></bold>). In contrast, the growth of MGG8, a patient-derived glioma stem cell culture containing mutant p53 (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6A</bold>), is not affected by PITAR silencing (<bold>Supplementary Figure 6C, B, D, E, and F</bold>). The requirement of inhibition of WT p53 for the cell survival-promoting functions of PITAR was also confirmed by using short hairpin interfering RNA to p53. PITAR silencing inhibited colony formation efficiently in U87/shNT cells but not in U87/shp53#1 (<bold>Supplementary figure 7, panels A and B</bold>). As shown before, PITAR silencing significantly increased CDKN1A transcript levels in U87/shNT cells but was compromised significantly in U87/shp53#1 (<bold>Supplementary figure 7, panel C</bold>).</p>

<p>To investigate the role of PITAR on tumor growth, we checked the ability of PITAR-silenced U87 glioma cells to form a tumor in an intracranial orthotopic tumor model using NIH nu/nu mice. We found that PITAR silencing (U87/siPITAR) significantly reduced tumor growth (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A, B</xref>, and C</bold>) and enhanced mouse survival (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). U87/siPITAR tumors showed reduced TRIM28 staining (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref></bold>). Next, we investigated the impact of PITAR overexpression on glioma tumor growth and Temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy. U87/PITAR OE cells-initiated tumors grew much faster than U87/VC cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>, and G; Supplementary Figure 8A</bold>), thus confirming that PITAR overexpression promotes tumor growth. While the growth of the tumors formed by U87/VC glioma cells is inhibited substantially by TMZ chemotherapy, U87/PITAR OE tumors showed resistance to TMZ chemotherapy (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref> and G; Supplementary Figure 8A</bold>). U87/PITAR OE tumors showed higher TRIM28 levels and Ki67 (proliferation marker) staining but reduced p21 staining (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8B</bold>). These results demonstrate that PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth and confers resistance to TMZ chemotherapy.</p>
<p>To further explore the clinical relevance of our findings, we investigated the survival significance of PITAR using the GBM transcriptome datasets. While PITAR and TRIM28 transcripts showed a significant positive correlation in the GBM full cohort and p53 wild-type cohort, there was no significant correlation in the p53 mutant cohort (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8C</bold>). However, survival analysis by univariate cox regression revealed that PITAR transcript level predicted survival only p53 wild-type GBM cohort but neither in the full nor p53 mutant cohort (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8D).</bold> The PITAR transcript level was dichotomized on further analysis to elucidate the cut-off in predicting the prognosis. We found that high PITAR transcript levels predicted poor prognosis significantly compared to low PITAR transcript levels in the p53 wild-type cohort (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8F</bold>). However, the low vs. high PITAR transcript levels failed to predict survival in full or p53 mutant GBM cohorts (<bold>Supplementary Figure 8E and G</bold>). These results prove that PITAR promotes tumor growth and therapeutic resistance by inactivating p53 by its association with TRIM28.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Research into cancer for many decades focussed on protein-coding genes. However, recent evolution in RNA-Seq technologies and bioinformatic methods to analyze transcriptome and genome has changed our perception of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) from “junk RNAs” to functional regulatory molecules that control various biological processes, such as chromatin remodeling, gene regulation at transcription, post-transcription, and post-translation level, post-translational modifications of proteins, and signal transduction pathways. It appears lncRNAs can influence various macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and protein to execute specific biological responses and cell fate. Concerning cancer, lncRNAs are critical regulators of cancer and have been shown to influence cancer origin and progression by acting as tumor drivers and/or suppressors in a cancer-specific fashion(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anastasiadou et al., 2018</xref>; Slack &amp; Chinnaiyan, 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yan &amp; Bu, 2021</xref>). Besides, several lncRNAs are identified as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Qian et al., 2020</xref>). p53 inactivation is an essential step in cancer development and is associated with therapy resistance. While genetic alteration forms the major mode of p53 inactivation, alternate ways of p53 inactivation, such as amplification of MDM2 and deletion of p19arf, have been reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Olivier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vousden &amp; Lane, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vousden &amp; Lu, 2002</xref>). Deregulated lncRNAs that modulate p53 activity positively and negatively have been reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jain, 2020</xref>). In this study, we discovered that PITAR, an oncogenic lncRNA, inhibits p53 by promoting its ubiquitination through its association with the mRNA of TRIM28 that encodes p53-specific E3 ligase. PITAR is activated by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner suggesting an incoherent feedforward loop.</p>
<p>Several deregulated lncRNAs acting as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in glioma and glioma stem cells have been identified(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Paul et al., 2018</xref>; L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Wang &amp; He, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yadav et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identify PITAR as a highly expressed lncRNA in GBM and GSCs and display oncogenic properties. PITAR is primarily located in the nucleus. Its downregulation by RNA interference inhibited glioma cell growth, and colony formation, arrested cells in the G1 phase, induced cell death, and sensitized cells to chemotherapy. An integrated analysis of PITAR-bound targets identified by ChRIP assay and differentially regulated genes in PITAR silenced cells identified PITAR as an inhibitor p53 through its association with the transcript encoding TRIM28.</p>
<p>TRIM28 (KAP1), an E3 ligase, is an mdm2 interacting protein, and it inhibits p53 through HDAC-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Czerwińska et al., 2017</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). Our results show TRIM28 transcript is upregulated in GBM, as reported earlier(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Czerwinska et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Su et al., 2018</xref>), and GSCs in multiple datasets. TRIM28 protein was also found to be high in GBM tissue samples. In addition, we found a significant positive correlation between PITAR and TRIM28, suggesting that PITAR expression is likely to promote TRIM28 expression. Our results show that PITAR-dependent TRIM28 expression regulation occurs at the post-transcription level via RNA: RNA interactions, where PITAR interaction with TRIM28 mRNA increases its stability. This interaction between PITAR and TRIM28 was confirmed by colocalization using multiplexed RNAscope. We further demonstrated that the first exon of PITAR interacts with 3’ UTR of TRIM28. Thus, we have comprehensively established that high levels of PITAR in GBM promote TRIM28 expression by binding and stabilizing TRIM28 mRNA. TRIM28 inhibits p53 through its association with MDM2(C. Wang et al., 2005a). Since our results show that PITAR binding to TRIM28 transcript promotes TRIM28 expression, PITAR is expected to inhibit p53. Indeed, our results show that PITAR inhibits both endogenous and DNA damage-induced p53 at the protein level without altering its transcript levels. Increased TRIM28 protein in high PITAR cells increased p53 ubiquitination and reduced p53 acetylation. Thus, we establish PITAR as a bona fide inhibitor of p53 through its association with TRIM28 mRNA.</p>
<p>Several cellular stresses, including DNA damage, hypoxia, and nucleotide deprivation, activate p53. Several lncRNAs have been shown to regulate p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Jain, 2020</xref>). LncRNAs such as LOCC572558, NBAT1, MT1JP, PSTAR, and MEG3 are shown to activate p53 using a variety of mechanisms(L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Mitra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Uroda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, lncRNAs such as PURPL, MALAT1, H19, and RMRP inhibit p53 (R. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; Y. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; X. L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). While PITAR is found to inhibit p53 through its interaction with TRIM28 mRNA, we also found PITAR level is induced by DNA damage in a p53-independent manner. Thus, based on our data, we propose a model wherein DNA damage not only activates p53, but it also activates PITAR, with oncogenic properties, to inhibit p53-dependent functions, thus creating an incoherent feedforward mechanism to promote oncogenesis and therapy resistance in GBM (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Several oncogenic lncRNAs have been demonstrated as potential therapeutic targets in many cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anastasiadou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Slack &amp; Chinnaiyan, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Yan &amp; Bu, 2021</xref>). In GBM, glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are the main culprits behind highly aggressive GBM progression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Visvanathan et al., 2018</xref>). It has been shown that GSCs alone can initiate glioma tumors in mouse models(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Suvà et al., 2014</xref>). Cancer/testis (CT) antigens are a family of tumor-associated antigens expressed only in tumors but not in normal tissues except for the testis and placenta. Their tumor-specific expression and strong in vivo immunogenicity made them suitable for tumor-specific immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fratta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gjerstorff et al., 2015</xref>). Because of its high expression in GBM and testis normal tissue, PITAR is identified as CT lncRNA. PITAR silencing efficiently inhibited the growth of glioma cells and GSCs containing WT p53. Intracranial orthotopic mouse model experiments show that PITAR promotes glioma tumor growth and confers resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy. Our study establishes PITAR as an oncogenic CT lncRNA, which promotes oncogenesis by inactivating p53 by interacting with TRIM28 mRNA. Thus it can serve as a potential therapeutic target for GBM.</p>

<title>Colony formation assay</title>
<p>U87 and U343 cells were transfected with the PITAR siRNA and control siRNA. Twenty-four hours later, 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> cells were cultured in a 6-well plate. Two weeks later, cells were fixed, stained with crystal violet, and photographed. The percentage and intensity of the area covered by crystal violet-stained cell colonies were quantified using the ImageJ software.</p>

<title>Fluorescent immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>The FFPE tissue sections (5 μm thick) were de-waxed and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed in a pressure cooker for 20 min in 10 mM Tris with 1 mM EDTA (pH 9). Nonspecific binding was blocked using blocking buffer (PBS (pH 7.4), 3% serum, 1% BSA and 0.1% Tween) for 60 min at room temperature. Sections were then incubated with primary antibodies (Ki67, TRIM28 and p21) diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing twice with 0.1% PBS–Tween, slides were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher). After washing, sections were incubated with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) as a counterstaining. The sections were mounted using prolonged antifade glass mounting media (Thermo Fisher). Two investigators examined the slides. The percentage of positive cells was estimated from 0% to 100%. The intensity of staining (intensity score) was judged on an arbitrary scale of 0–4: no staining (0), weakly positive staining (1), moderately positive staining (2), strongly positive staining (3), and very strong positive staining (4). An immunoreactive score was derived by multiplying the percentage of positive cells with staining intensity divided by 10.</p>

<title>H&amp;E staining</title>
<p>Brain tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydration (gradient ethanol), and embedding in paraffin. Then, the Brain tissues were cut into 5-um slices using a microtome instrument. Afterward, the slices were dewaxed with xylene I and xylene II; dehydrated with 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70% ethanol; and addressed with distilled water. Finally, the slices were processed with Harris hematoxylin, 1% hydrochloric acid alcohol, 0.6% ammonia, and eosin. After dehydration (gradient ethanol) and immersion (xylene), the Brain tumor’s pathologic structure was observed with a microscope.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study reports that a long non-coding RNA disrupts the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 to contribute to the growth and therapeutic response of glioblastoma. Most evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, but the conclusions would benefit from more rigorous approaches. The work will be of interest to biologists working on the non-coding RNA and brain tumors.</p>

<p>The authors characterized a new non-coding RNA, which they named as PITAR. They first showed that the PITAR expression levels are higher in glioblastoma, and then demonstrated that knockdown of PITAR in glioblastoma cells decreased cell growth, induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis. They further identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM28 is the target of PITAR, and showed that PITAR bound to the TRIM28 mRNA and regulated the stability and expression of the latter. Since TRIM28 has been reported to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase for the tumor suppressor p53, the authors tried to link the PITAR function to p53 regulation. They showed that one PITAR siRNA increased the levels of p53 and p21, and the stability of p53, and these effects could be diminished by overexpression of TRIM28. They also showed that PITAR overexpression decreased the levels of adriamycin-induced p53/p21 expression and reversed DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest. Lastly, the authors showed that PITAR siRNA decreased the growth of glioblastoma, while PITAR overexpression increased glioblastoma growth and counteracted temozolomide for its anti-glioblastoma activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the manuscript has provided preliminary evidence supporting the important role of PITAR in the regulation of the growth and drug resistance of glioblastoma. The results supporting the regulation of PITAR on TRIM28 appear to be convincing. However, the study suffers significant weaknesses summarized as below.</p>
<p>(1) Only one PITAR siRNA was tested in majority of the experiments, which compromises the validity of the results. Some results are inconsistent. For example, Fig 2G indicates that PITAR siRNA caused G1 arrest. However, PITAR overexpression in the same cell line did not show any effect on cell cycle progression in Fig 5I.</p>
<p>(2) The conclusion that PITAR inactivates p53 through regulating TRIM28, which is highlighted in the title of the manuscript, is not supported by convincing results. Although the authors showed that a PITAR siRNA increased while PITAR overexpression decreased p53 level, the siRNA only marginally increased the stability of p53 (Fig 5E). The p53 ubiquitination level was barely affected by PITAR overexpression in Fig 5F. To convincingly demonstrate that PITAR regulates p53 through TRIM28, the authors need to show that this regulation is impaired/compromised in TRIM28-knockout conditions. The authors only showed that TRIM28 overexpression suppressed PITAR siRNA-induced increase of p53, which is not sufficient. Note that only one cell line was investigated in Fig 5.</p>
<p>(3) Another major weakness of this manuscript is that the authors did not provide any evidence indicating that the glioblastoma-promoting activities of PITAR were mediated by its regulation of p53 or TRIM28 (Fig 6 and Fig 7). Thus, the regulation of glioblastoma growth and the regulation of TRIM28/p53 appear to be disconnected.</p>
<p>(4) It is not clear what kind of message the authors tried to deliver in Fig 7F/G. Based on the authors' hypothesis, DNA damaging agents like TMZ would induce PITAR to inactivate p53, which would compromise TMZ's anti-cancer activity. However, the data show that TMZ was very effective in the inhibition of U87 growth. The authors may need to test whether PITAR downregulation, which would increase p53 activity, have any effects on TMZ-insensitive tumors. Such results are more therapeutically relevant.</p>
<p>(5) Lastly, the model presented in Fig 7H is confusing. It is not clear what the exact role of PITAR in the DNA damage response based on this model. If DNA damage would induce PITAR expression, this would lead to inactivation of p53 as revealed by this manuscript. However, DNA damage is known to activate p53. Do the authors want to imply that PITAR induction by DNA damage would help to bring down the p53 level at the end of DNA damage response? The presented data do not support this role unfortunately.</p>

<p>This manuscript identified a long noncoding RNA, PITAR (p53 Inactivating TRIM28 associated RNA), as an inhibitor of p53. PITAR is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSC). The authors found that TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase, is a direct target of PITAR. PITAR interaction with TRIM28 RNA stabilized TRIM28 mRNA, which resulted in increased TRIM28 protein levels, enhanced p53 ubiquitination, and attenuated DNA damage response. While PITAR silencing inhibited the growth of WT p53 containing GSCs in vitro and reduced glioma tumor growth in vivo, its overexpression enhanced the tumor growth and promoted resistance to Temozolomide. DNA damage also activated PITAR, in addition to p53, thus creating an incoherent feedforward loop. Together, this study established an alternate way of p53 inactivation and proposed PITAR as a potential therapeutic target.</p>
<p>P53 is a well-established tumor suppressor gene contributing to cancer progression in many human cancers. It plays a vital role in preserving genome integrity and inhibiting malignant transformation. p53 is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers. In cancers that do not carry mutations in p53, the inactivation occurs through other genetic or epigenetic alterations. Therefore, further study of the mechanism of regulation of wt-p53 remains vital in cancer research. This study identified a novel LncRNA PITAR, which is highly expressed in glioblastoma (GBM) and glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) and interacts with and stabilizes TRIM28 mRNA, which encodes a p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase. TRIM28 can inhibit p53 through HDAC1-mediated deacetylation and direct ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner. Thus, the overall impact of this study is high because of the identification of a novel mechanism in regulating wt-p53.</p>
<p>The other significant strengths of this manuscript included an apparent research strategy design and a clearly outlined and logically organized research approach. They provided both the in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the effect of PITAR. They offered reasonable control of the study by validating the results in cells with mutant p53. They also performed a rescue experiment to confirm the PITAR and TRIM28 relationship regulating p53. The conclusions were all supported by solid results. The overall data presentation is clear and convincing.</p>

<p>1. Only one PITAR siRNA was tested in majority of the experiments, which compromises the validity of the results. Some results are inconsistent. For example, Fig 2G indicates that PITAR siRNA caused G1 arrest. However, PITAR overexpression in the same cell line did not show any effect on cell cycle progression in Fig 5I.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, we have used two siRNAs in experiments related to Fig. 2C, 2D, and 2E. Keeping the reviewer’s comment, we plan to reproduce the results of Fig. 2F, 2G, 2H, 2I, 5A, 5B, 5E, and supplementary Fig. 5A using additional siRNA targeting PITAR.</p>
<p>The reason for the fact that “PITAR silencing showed a robust G1 arrest, but PITAR overexpression failed to show any effect on the cell cycle profile” is as follows: since glioma cells overexpress PITAR (which keeps the p53 suppressed), silencing PITAR (which will elevate p53 levels) in glioma cells will show a robust phenotype in cell cycle profile (in the form of increase G1 arrest). In contrast, the overexpression of PITAR in glioma cells (which already has high levels of PITAR and hence drastically reduced p53 levels) is unlikely to show any significant change in the cell cycle profile. But, a phenotype for PITAR overexpression on cell cycle profile can be shown in DNA-damaged (which induces p53 levels) glioma cells. Indeed, we have done this experiment in Fig. 5L, which shows G2/M arrest (42.34%) induced by DNA damage is reduced significantly (19%) in PITAR overexpressed condition (34.42%).  However, keeping reviewers' comments in the right spirit, we plan to repeat this experiment with appropriate modifications to arrive at a more robust phenotype for PITAR overexpression.</p>

<p>To address this issue, we will overexpress PITAR in TRIM28 silenced cells to show the requirement of TRIM28 for PITAR to inhibit p53. In addition, we also plan to carry out PITAR silencing and overexpression experiments in another glioma cell line as recommended by the reviewer.</p>

<p>1. Another major weakness of this manuscript is that the authors did not provide any evidence indicating that the glioblastoma-promoting activities of PITAR were mediated by its regulation of p53 or TRIM28 (Fig 6 and Fig 7). Thus, the regulation of glioblastoma growth and the regulation of TRIM28/p53 appear to be disconnected.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this particular point.  We have indeed provided the following evidence in the current version of the manuscript glioblastomapromoting activities of PITAR were mediated by its regulation of p53 or TRIM28.</p>
<p>A)  In Fig. 6, we demonstrate that PITAR silencing-induced reduction in the neurosphere growth is accompanied by a reduction in TRIM28 RNA and an increase in the CDKN1A RNA without a change in p53 RNA levels. We also demonstrate that PITAR overexpression-induced neurosphere growth is accompanied by an increase in the TRIM28 RNA, and a decrease in CDKN1A RNA without a change in p53 RNA levels.</p>
<p>B)  To add strength to the above results, we plan to do western blot experiments under similar conditions to demonstrate the appropriate changes in TRIM28, p53, and CDKN1A levels. Also, we will do a TRIM28 rescue experiment in RG5 neurosphere cells.</p>
<p>C)  In supplementary Fig. 6 (related to Fig. 6), we show that PITAR silencing failed to decrease neurosphere growth in mutant p53 containing GSC line (MGG8).</p>
<p>D)  In supplementary Fig. 7 (related to Fig. 6), we show that PITAR silencing failed to inhibit colony growth of p53-silenced U87 glioma cells (U87/shp53#1). We also show that while PITAR silencing decreased TRIM28 RNA levels in U87/shNT and U87/shp53#1 glioma cells, it failed to increase CDKN1A and MDM2 (p53 targets) at the RNA level.</p>
<p>E)  In Fig. 7, we show that the TRIM28 protein level is drastically reduced in small tumors formed by U87/siPITAR cells.</p>
<p>F)  In supplementary Fig. 8 (related to Fig. 7), we show that glioma tumor formed by U87/PITAR OE express high levels of TRIM28 protein but reduced levels of p21 protein.</p>
<p>G)  We also plan to do additional experiments, as described below, to demonstrate that glioblastoma-promoting activities of PITAR are indeed mediated by its regulation of p53 or TRIM28. We will demonstrate the inability of PITAR overexpression to induce the growth of glioma-tumor initiated by TRIM28 silenced U87 cells.</p>

<p>1. It is not clear what kind of message the authors tried to deliver in Fig 7F/G. Based on the authors' hypothesis, DNA-damaging agents like TMZ would induce PITAR to inactivate p53, which would compromise TMZ's anti-cancer activity. However, the data show that TMZ was very effective in the inhibition of U87 growth. The authors may need to test whether PITAR downregulation, which would increase p53 activity, have any effects on TMZ-insensitive tumors. Such results are more therapeutically relevant.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #1 rightly pointed out that TMZ induces PITAR expression, which should compromise TMZ's anti-cancer activity. In addition, overexpression of PITAR also promotes glioma-tumor growth. Figure 7F&amp;G demonstrates the following two facts:1. PITAR overexpression increases the glioma-tumor growth (Figure 7G, compare red line with the blue line), 2. PITAR overexpressing glioma-tumor are resistant to TMZ chemotherapy (Figure 7G, compare the pink line with the green line).</p>
<p>In addition, in Figure 2I, we indeed show that PITAR-silenced cells are more sensitive to TMZ and Adriamycin chemotherapy.</p>
<p>However, considering reviewers’ comments, we plan to repeat Figure 7A, combining TMZ chemotherapy and PITAR silencing to demonstrate that TMZ chemotherapy-induced PITAR indeed promotes chemo-resistance.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate reviewer #1 comments. Based on our model in 7H, we believe DNA damageinduced PITAR attenuates DNA damage response by increasing TRIM28 protein levels. TRIM28 ubiquitinates p53 in an MDM2-dependent manner ( Wang et al., 2005). Based on this, we hypothesised that PITAR-induced TRIM28 also contributes to MDM2 mediated ending of DNA damage response.</p>
<p>Considering the reviewers' comments, we plan to do the following experiment.</p>
<p>The kinetics of p53, TRIM28, p21, MDM2 protein levels, and PITAR RNA levels after DNA damage will be monitored in PITAR-silenced conditions. It is known that reduction in the DNA damage-induced p53 levels coincides with high levels of MDM2 accumulation. We believe that in PITAR-silenced cells, p53 levels will remain high for a longer time compared to control cells because of the lack of PITAR-induced TRIM28-mediated degradation of p53.</p>
