<title>Abstract</title>
<p>The rates of appearance of new mutations play a central role in evolution. However, mutational processes in natural environments and their relationship with growth rates are largely unknown, particular in tropical ecosystems with high biodiversity. Here, we examined the somatic mutation landscapes of two tropical trees, <italic>Shorea laevis</italic> (slow- growing) and <italic>S. leprosula</italic> (fast-growing), in central Borneo, Indonesia. Using newly- constructed genomes, we identified a greater number of somatic mutations in tropical trees than in temperate trees. In both species, we observed a linear increase in the number of somatic mutations with physical distance between branches. However, we found that the rate of somatic mutation accumulation per meter of growth was 3.7-fold higher in <italic>S. laevis</italic> than in <italic>S. leprosula</italic>. This difference in the somatic mutation rate was scaled with the slower growth rate of <italic>S. laevis</italic> compared to <italic>S. leprosula,</italic> resulting in a constant somatic mutation rate per year between the two species. We also found that somatic mutations are neutral within an individual, but those mutations transmitted to the next generation are subject to purifying selection. These findings suggest that somatic mutations accumulate with absolute time and older trees have a greater contribution towards generating genetic variation.</p>

<title>Significance Statement</title>
<p>The significance of our study lies in the discovery of an absolute time-dependent accumulation of somatic mutations in long-lived tropical trees, independent of growth rate. Through a comparative analysis of somatic mutation landscapes in slow- and fast-growing species, we observed a clock-like accumulation of somatic mutations in both species, regardless of their growth rates. Although the majority of somatic mutations were restricted to a single branch, we also identified mutations present in multiple branches, likely transmitted during growth. Our findings suggest that older trees make a greater contribution towards generating genetic variation.</p>

<p>Biodiversity ultimately results from mutations that provide genetic variation for organisms to adapt to their environments. However, how and when mutations occur in natural environments is poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Recent genomic data from long-lived multicellular species have begun to uncover the somatic genetic variation and the rate of naturally occurring mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. The rate of somatic mutations per year in a 234-year-old oak tree has been found to be surprisingly low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> compared to the rate in an annual herb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Similar analyses in other long-lived trees have also shown low mutation rates in both broadleaf trees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> and conifers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Despite the growing body of knowledge of somatic mutation landscapes in temperate regions, there is currently no knowledge on the somatic mutation landscapes in organisms living in tropical ecosystems, which are among the most diverse biomes on Earth.</p>
<p>Mutations can arise from errors during replication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, or from DNA damage caused by exogenous mutagens or endogenous reactions at any time during cell growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. While DNA replication errors have long been assumed to be major sources of mutations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, a modeling study that relates the mutation rate to rates of DNA damage, repair and cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> and experimental studies in yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, and other animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> have shown the importance of mutagenic processes that do not depend on cell division. Consequently, it remains largely unknown which source of mutations, whether replicative or non-replicative, predominates in naturally growing organisms.</p>
<p>To investigate the rates and patterns of somatic mutation and their relation to growth rates in tropical organisms, we studied the somatic mutation landscapes of slow- and fast- growing tropical trees in a humid tropical rain forest of Southeast Asia. By comparing the somatic mutation landscape between slow- and fast-growing species in a tropical ecosystem, we can gain insights into the mutagenesis that occurs in a natural setting. This comparison provides a unique opportunity to understand the impact of growth rate on somatic mutations and its potential role in driving evolutionary processes.</p>

<title>Detecting somatic mutations in slow- and fast-growing tropical trees</title>
<p>The humid tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia are characterized by a preponderance of trees of the Dipterocarpaceae family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Dipterocarp trees are highly valued for both their contribution to forest diversity and their use in timber production. For the purposes of this study, we selected <italic>Shorea laevis</italic> and <italic>S. leprosula</italic>, both native hardwood species of the Dipterocarpaceae family (Supplementary Fig. 1a). <italic>S. laevis</italic> is a slow-growing species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, with a mean annual increment (MAI) of diameter at breast height (DBH) of 0.38 cm/year (as measured over a 20 year period in <italic>n</italic> = 2 individuals; Supplementary Data 1). In contrast, <italic>S. leprosula</italic> exhibits a faster growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, with an MAI of 1.21 cm/year (<italic>n</italic> = 18; Supplementary Data 1), which is 3.2 times greater than that of <italic>S. laevis</italic>. We selected the two largest individuals of each species (S1 and S2 for <italic>S.laevis</italic> and F1 and F2 for <italic>S. leprosula</italic>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) at the study site, located just below the equator in central Borneo, Indonesia (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We collected leaves from the apices of seven branches and a cambium from the base of the stem from each tree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 2), resulting in a total of 32 samples. To determine the physical distance between the sampling positions, we measured the length of each branch (Supplementary Data 2) and DBH (Supplementary Table 1). The average heights of the slow- and fast-growing species were 44.1 m and 43.9 m, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; Supplementary Data 1). While it is challenging to accurately estimate the age of tropical trees due to the absence of annual rings, we used the DBH/MAI to approximate the average age of the slow-growing species to be 256 years and the fast-growing species to be 66 years (Supplementary Table 1).</p>

<p>To identify somatic mutations, we constructed new reference genomes of the slow- and fast-growing species. We generated sequence data using long-read PacBio RS II and short-read Illumina sequencing and assembled the genome using DNA extracted from the apical leaf at branch 1-1 of the tallest individual of each species (S1 and F1). The genomes were estimated to contain 52,935 and 40,665 protein-coding genes, covering 97.9% and 97.8% of complete BUSCO genes (eudicots_odb10) for the slow- and fast-growing species (Supplementary Table 2). Genome sizes estimated using k-mer distribution were 347 and 376 Mb for the slow- and fast-growing species, respectively.</p>
<p>To accurately identify somatic mutations, we extracted DNA from each sample twice to generate two biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 2). A total of 64 DNA samples were sequenced, yielding an average coverage of 69.3 and 56.5× per sample for the slow- and fast- growing species, respectively (Supplementary Data 5). We identified Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) within the same individual by identifying those that were identical within two biological replicates of each sample (Supplementary Fig. 2). We identified 728 and 234 SNVs in S1 and S2, and 106 and 68 SNVs in F1 and F2, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 4). All somatic mutations were unique and did not overlap between individuals. Experimental validation of a subset of the inferred SNVs revealed that 93.9% were accurately annotated (Supplementary Data 5).</p>

<title>Somatic mutation rates per year is independent of growth rate</title>
<p>Phylogenetic trees constructed using somatic mutations were almost perfectly congruent with the physical tree structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). The majority of somatic mutations were present at a single branch, but we also identified somatic mutations present in multiple branches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>) which are likely transmitted to new branches during growth. We also observed somatic mutations that did not conform to the branching topology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), as theoretically predicted due to the stochastic loss of somatic mutations during branching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Unlike previous empirical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>, we did not incorporate knowledge of the branching topology of the tree in the SNV discovery process. The strong concordance between the phylogenetic trees and physical tree structure in the absence of prior knowledge of tree branching topology suggests the reliability of the SNV detection pipelines developed in this study.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed that the number of SNVs increases linearly as the physical distance between branch tips increases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The somatic mutation rate per site per meter was determined by dividing the slope of the linear regression of the number of SNVs against the physical distance between branch tips by the number of callable sites from the diploid genome of each tree (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). The somatic mutation rate per nucleotide per meter was 7.08 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (95% CI: 6.41–7.74 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) and 4.27 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (95% CI: 3.99–4.55 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) for S1 and S2, and 1.77 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (95% CI: 1.64–1.91 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) and 1.29 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> (95% CI: 1.05–1.53 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) for F1 and F2, respectively. The average rate of somatic mutation for the slow-growing species was 5.67 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> nucleotide<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> m<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, which is 3.7-fold higher than the average rate of 1.53 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> nucleotide<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> m<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> observed in the fast-growing species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). This result indicates that the slow-growing tree accumulates more somatic mutations compared to the fast-growing tree to grow the unit length. This cannot be explained by differences in the number of cell divisions, as the length and diameter of fiber cells in both species are not significantly different (1.29 mm and 19.0 μm for the slow-growing species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and 0.91mm and 22.7 μm for the fast-growing species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>).</p>

<p>Based on the estimated age of each tree, somatic mutation rate per nucleotide per year was calculated for each tree. On average, resultant values were largely similar between the two species, with 7.71 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and 8.05 × 10<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> nucleotide<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> year<sup>-</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> for the slow- and fast-growing species, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>; Supplementary Table 3). This result suggests that somatic mutation accumulates in a clock-like manner as they age regardless of tree growth. The result suggests that somatic mutation accumulates in a clock-like manner as they age regardless of tree growth. Our estimates of somatic mutation rates per nucleotide per year in <italic>Shorea</italic> are higher than those previously reported in other long-lived trees such as <italic>Quercus robur</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, <italic>Eucalyptus melliodora</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> and <italic>Picea sitchensis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This suggests that long-lived trees in the tropics do not necessarily suppress somatic mutation rates to the same extent as their temperate counterparts.</p>

<title>Mutational spectra are similar between slow- and fast-growing trees</title>
<p>Somatic mutations may be caused by exogenous factors such as ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, or endogenous factors such as oxidative respiration and errors in DNA replication. To identify characteristic mutational signatures caused by different mutagenic factors, we characterized mutational spectra by calculating the relative frequency of mutations at the 96 triplets defined by the mutated base and its flanking 5’ and 3’ bases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 3). Across species, the mutational spectra showed a dominance of cytosine-to-thymine (C&gt;T and G&gt;A on the other strand, noted as C:G&gt;T:A) substitutions at CpG sites with CG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>, b). This is believed to result from the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Methylated CpG sites spontaneously deaminate, leading to TpG sites and increasing the number of C&gt;T substitutions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>We compared the mutational spectra of our tropical trees to single-base substitution (SBS) signatures in human cancers using the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) compendium of mutation signatures (COSMICv.2<sup>29–31)</sup>. The mutational spectra were largely similar to the dominant mutation signature in humans known as SBS1 (cosine similarity = 0.789 and 0.597 for the slow- and fast-growing species; Supplementary Data 6). SBS1 is believed to result from the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine. The mutational spectra were also comparable to another dominant signature in humans, SBS5 (cosine similarity = 0.577 and 0.558 for the slow- and fast-growing species; Supplementary Data 6), the origin of which remains unknown. Our finding that somatic mutations in tropical trees accumulate in a clock-like manner (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) is consistent with the clock-like mutational process observed in SBS1 and SBS5 in human somatic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.

<title>Somatic mutations are neutral but inter-individual SNVs are subject to selection</title>
<p>We tested whether the somatic mutations and inter-individual SNVs are subject to selection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>).

<p>Overall, the mutational spectra were similar between somatic and inter-individual SNVs (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, the fraction of C&gt;T substitutions, in particular at CpG sites, was lower in inter-individual SNVs compared to somatic SNVs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates that while the somatic mutation rate per meter is higher in the slow- than in fast-growing species, the somatic mutation rate per year is independent of growth rate. To gain deeper understanding of these findings, we developed a simple model that decomposes the mutation rate per site per cell division (<italic>µ</italic>) into the two components: DNA replication dependent (<italic>α</italic>) and replication independent (<italic>β</italic>) mutagenesis. This can be represented as <italic>µ</italic> = <italic>α</italic> + <italic>βτ</italic>, where <italic>τ</italic> is the duration of cell cycle measured in years. The replication dependent mutation emanates from errors that occur during DNA replication, such as the misincorporation of a nucleotide during DNA synthesis. The replication independent mutation arises from DNA damage caused by endogenous reactions or exogenous mutagens at any time of cell cycle. Since the number of cell division per year is given as <italic>r</italic> = 1/<italic>τ</italic>, the mutation rate per year becomes <italic>rµ</italic> = <italic>α</italic>/<italic>τ</italic> + <italic>β</italic>. From the relationship, the number of nucleotide substitution per site accumulated over <italic>t</italic> years, denoted as <italic>m</italic>(<italic>t</italic>), is given by <italic>m</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = (<italic>α</italic>/<italic>τ</italic> + <italic>β</italic>)<italic>t</italic>. The formula indicates that when <italic>β</italic> is significantly greater than <italic>α</italic>, somatic mutations accumulate with tree age rather than with tree growth.</p>
<p>We estimated the relative magnitudes of <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> by using the results obtained from our study. Given that the cell cycle duration is likely inversely proportional to MAI, we have <italic>τ<sub>S</sub></italic>/<italic>τ<sub>F</sub></italic> = 3.2 (Supplementary Data 1), where <italic>τ<sub>S</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>F</sub></italic> denote the cell cycle duration for the slow- and fast-growing species, respectively. It is also reasonable to assume that the same number of cell divisions are required to achieve 1 m of growth in both species as the cell size is similar between the two species. Based on our estimates of the somatic mutation rate per site per meter for the slow- (<italic>µ<sub>S</sub></italic>) and fast-growing species (<italic>µ<sub>F</sub></italic>), we have <italic>µ<sub>S</sub>/µ<sub>F</sub></italic> = (<italic>α</italic> + <italic>βτ<sub>S</sub></italic>)/(<italic>α</italic> + <italic>βτ<sub>F</sub></italic>) = 3.7, which is close to the ratio of cell cycle duration <italic>τ<sub>S</sub></italic>/<italic>τ<sub>F</sub></italic>. This consistency can be explained by the substantial contribution of the replication independent mutagenesis to the somatic mutation rate (i.e. <italic>β</italic> ≫ <italic>α</italic>), as long as the magnitudes for <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> are similar between the two species. The time required for a unit length to grow can vary even within the same species, depending on microenvironmental conditions such as the availability of light and nutrients. These variations could explain the differences in somatic mutation rates per unit growth between two individuals within the same species (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>This argument concords with previous studies in human and other animals, which showed the presence of mutations that do not track cell division<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. This study contributes to understanding the importance of non-replicative mutagenesis in naturally grown trees by decoupling the impacts of growth and time on the rate of somatic mutation. The preponderance of non-replicative mutational process can be attributed to its distinct molecular origin, the accumulation of spontaneous CpG mutations with absolute time. The neutral nature of newly arising somatic mutations within the tree results in a molecular clock, a constant rate of molecular evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. For our argument, we made an intuitive assumption that the number of stem cell divisions increases with distance regardless of species when cell size is similar. However, to further validate this assumption, we require mathematical models that consider the asymmetric division of stem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> and complex stem cell population dynamics during elongation and branching in tree growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In trees, somatic mutations can be transmitted to seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, resulting in a rich genetic variation that can facilitate the effectiveness of natural selection to subsequent generations. The humid tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, which are renowned for their high species diversity, are currently facing threats from deforestation and climate change. Our study suggests that long- lived trees may contribute to the generation of genetic variation in tropical systems.</p>

<p>The study site is in a humid tropical rain forest in Central Borneo, Indonesia (00°49′ 45.7′′ S, 112°00′ 09.5′′ E; Supplementary Fig. 1b). The forest is characterized by a prevalence of trees of the Dipterocarpaceae family and is managed through a combination of selective logging and line planting (Tebang Pilih Tanam Jalur, TPTJ). The mean annual temperature range from 2001 to 2009 was between 22 to 28°C at night and 30 to 33°C during the day, with an average annual precipitation of 3376 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The study focuses on two native Dipterocarpaceae species, <italic>S. laevis</italic> and <italic>S. leprosula</italic> (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We logged two individuals from each species (S1 and S2 for <italic>S. laevis</italic> and F1 and F2 for <italic>S leprosula</italic>; Supplementary Fig. 1a) on July 17–18, 2018 and collected samples prior to their transportation for timber production. Approximately 0.4–1.0 g of leaf tissue was collected from each of the apices of seven branches and approximately 5 g of cambium tissue was taken from the base of the stem per individual (Supplementary Fig. 2). To calculate the physical distance between sampling positions within the tree architecture, we measured the length of each branch (Supplementary Data 2). Samples were promptly preserved in a plastic bag with silica gel following harvest and transported to the laboratory within 4 days of sampling. During transportation, samples were kept in a cooler box with ice to maintain a low temperature. Once in the laboratory, samples were stored at −80°C until DNA and RNA extraction.</p>
<p>DBH have been recorded for the trees with DBH greater than 10 cm every two years since 1998 within three census plots of 1 hectare (100 × 100 m) in size located near the target trees. The mean growth was calculated by taking the average of MAI of DBH for 2 and 18 trees for the slow- and fast-growing species, respectively (Supplementary Data 1).</p>

The sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome, yielding average mapping rates of 91.61% and 89.5% for the slow- and fast- growing species, respectively. To identify reliable SNVs, we utilized two SNP callers (bcftools mpileup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup> and GATK (4.2.4.0) HaplotypeCaller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>) and extracted SNVs detected by both (Supplementary Fig. 2).</p>
<p>We first called SNVs with BCFtools 1.13<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup> mpileup at three different thresholds; threshold 1 (T40): mapping quality (MQ) = 40, base quality (BQ) = 40; threshold 2 (T30): MQ = 30, BQ = 30; threshold 3 (T20): MQ = 20, BQ = 20. SNVs detected under each threshold were pooled for further analyses, with duplicates removed. We normalized indels using bcftools norm for vcf files. We removed indels and missing data using vcftools 0.1.16<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Second, we called SNVs using GATK (4.2.4.0) HaplotypeCaller and merged the individual gvcfs into a vcf file containing only variant sites. We removed indels from the vcf using the GATK SelectVariants. We filtered out unreliable SNVs using GATK VariantFiltration with the following filters: QD (Qual By Depth) &lt; 2.0, QUAL (Base Quality) &lt; 30.0, SOR (Strand Odds Ratio) &gt; 4.0, FS (Fisher Strand) &gt; 60.0, MQ (RMS Mapping Quality) &lt; 40.0, MQRankSum (Mapping Quality Rank Sum Test) &lt; -12.5, ReadPosRankSum (Read Pos Rank Sum Test) &lt; -8.0. After performing independent SNV calling for each biological replicate using each SNP caller, we extracted SNVs that were detected in both replicates for each SNP caller. We further extracted SNVs that were detected by both bcftools mpileup and GATK HaplotypeCaller (Supplementary Fig. 2) using Tassel5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and a custom python script, generating potential SNVs for each threshold. Finally, SNVs detected at any of the three thresholds were extracted to obtain candidate SNVs. The number of SNVs at each filtering step can be found in Supplementary Data 4.</p>
<p>The candidate SNV calls were manually confirmed by two independent researchers using the IGV browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>.

We illustrated three types of false positive SNVs that were removed from the list of candidates in Supplementary Fig. 4b–d. The final set of SNVs can be found in Supplementary Data 7.

Most of the somatic SNVs were heterozygous, whereas 4% of the total SNVs (46/1136) were homozygous (Supplementary Data 7).

Subsequent next-generation sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq platform using the MiSeq Reagent Kit v2 (300 cycles: Illumina).</p>
<p>Amplicon sequencing reads were mapped to the reference genome using bwa-mem2 22.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup> with default parameters. Using bcftools mpileup<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, we called the genotypes of all sites on target regions and eliminated candidate sequences with MQ and BQ less than 10. The final set of sites selected for confirmation consisted of 24 for the S1 individual and 9 for the S2 individual. We manually confirmed the polymorphic patterns at the target sites using the IGV browser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. If the alternative allele was present or absent in all eight branches in the amplicon sequence, the site was determined as fixed. The site was determined as mismatch if the difference of polymorphic patterns between the somatic SNV calls and amplicon sequence was supported by more than four reads per branch. The sites that were neither fixed nor mismatched were determined as true. 93.9% (31/33) of SNVs at the final target sites were confirmed to exhibit a polymorphic pattern that exactly matched between the somatic SNV calls and amplicon sequence (Supplementary Data 5).</p>

<title>Somatic mutation rates per growth and per year</title>
<p>To estimate the somatic mutation rate per nucleotide per growth (<italic>µ<sub>g</sub></italic>), a linear regression analysis of the number of somatic SNVs against the physical distance between sampling positions within an individual was conducted using the lm package, with an intercept of zero, in R version 3.6.2. The somatic mutation rate per nucleotide per growth was estimated as:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="525665v2_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>b</italic> indicates the slope of linear regression and <italic>R</italic> denotes the number of callable sites, respectively. Note that the denominator includes a factor of two due to diploidy. A site was considered callable when it passed the filters as the polymorphic sites, that is, a mapping quality of at least 40 using GATK, a mapping quality of at least 20 using BCFtools, and a depth greater than or equal to 5. This resulted in 388,801,756 and 320,739,335 base pairs for S1 and S2 and 327,435,618 and 263,488,812 base pairs for F1 and F2, respectively.</p>
<p>The somatic mutation rate per nucleotide per year (<italic>µ<sub>y</sub></italic>) was estimated as:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="525665v2_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
Here, <italic>M</italic> indicate the total number of SNVs accumulated from the base (ID 0 in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>; Supplementary Data 2) to the branch tip and <italic>A</italic> represents tree age, respectively. <italic>R</italic> denotes the number of callable sites that was also used to estimate <italic>µ<sub>g</sub></italic>. Because there are seven branch tips for each tree (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), we estimated <italic>µ<sub>y</sub></italic> for each of branch tips and then calculated the mean and 95% confidence interval for each tree (Supplementary Table 3).</p>

<sec id="s3m">
<title>Mutational spectrum</title>
<p>Mutational spectra were derived directly from the reference genome and alternative alleles at each variant site. There are a total of six possible classes of base substitutions at each variant site: A:T&gt;G:C (T&gt;C), G:C&gt;A:T (C&gt;T), A:T&gt;T:A (T&gt;A), G:C&gt;T:A (C&gt;A), A:T&gt;C:G (T&gt;G), and G:C&gt;C:G (C&gt;G), By considering the bases immediately 5′ and 3′ to each mutated base, there are a total of 96 possible mutation classes, referred to as triplets, in this classification. We used seqkit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup> to extract the triplets for each variant site. To count the number of each triplet, we used the Wordcount tool in the EMBOSS web service (https://www.bioinformatics.nl/cgi-bin/emboss/wordcount). We calculated the fraction of each mutated triplet by dividing the number of mutated triplets by the total number of triplets in the reference genome.</p>
<p>We compared the mutational signatures of our tropical trees to those of single-base substitution (SBS) signatures in human cancers using Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) compendium of mutation signatures (COSMICv.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2">https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/signatures_v2</ext-link>). Cosine similarity was calculated between each tropical tree species and each SBS signature in human cancers.</p>

<title>Testing selection of somatic and inter-individual SNVs</title>
<p>To test whether somatic and inter-individual SNVs are subject to selection, we calculated the expected rate of non-synonymous mutation. For the CDS of length <italic>L</italic><sub>cds</sub>, there are possible numbers of mutations of length of 3<italic>L</italic><sub>cds</sub> (Supplementary Fig. 6). We classified all possible mutations into three types based on the codon table: synonymous, missense, and nonsense (Supplementary Fig. 6). Each type of mutation was counted for each of the six base substitution classes (Supplementary Fig. 6). We generated count tables based on two distinct categories of CDS: those that included all isoforms and those that only encompassed primary isoforms (Supplementary Data 8). As the two tables were largely congruent, we employed the version which included all isoforms of CDS.</p>
<p>Using the count table and background mutation rate for each category of substitution class, we calculated the expected number of synonymous <italic>λ<sub>S</sub></italic>) and non-synonymous mutations <italic>λ<sub>N</sub></italic>) (Supplementary Fig. 6). As a background mutation rate, we adopted the observed somatic mutation rates in the six substitution classes in the intergenic region (Supplementary Table 5), assuming that the intergenic region is nearly neutral to selection. Because the number of nonsense somatic mutation is small, we combined missense and nonsense mutations as non- synonymous. The intergenic regions were identified as the regions situated between 1 kbp upstream of the start codon and 500 bp downstream of the stop codon. Expected rate of synonymous mutation (<italic>p<sub>N</sub></italic>) is given as <italic>λ<sub>N</sub></italic>/<italic>λ<sub>S</sub></italic> + <italic>λ<sub>N</sub></italic>). Given the observed number of non- synonymous and synonymous mutations, we rejected the null hypothesis of neutral selection using a binomial test with the significance level of 5% (Supplementary Table 4). We used the package binom.test in R v3.6.2.</p>
<p>We also used the observed somatic mutation rate in the whole genome (Supplementary Table 5), including genic and intergenic regions, as the background mutation rate and confirmed the robustness of our conclusion (Supplementary Tables 4). The somatic mutation rates in the intergenic region and the whole genome were calculated for each species by pooling the data from two individuals (Supplementary Table 5). While cancer genomics studies have accounted for more detailed context-dependent mutations, such as the high rate of C&gt;T at CpG dinucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup> or comprehensive analysis of 96 possible substitution classes in triplet context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>, the number of SNVs in our tropical trees is too small to perform such a comprehensive analysis. Therefore, we used the relatively simple six base substitution classes. The genes with somatic SNVs can be found in Supplementary Data 7.</p>

<p>8 samples (seven leaves and one cambium) were collected from four trees (two trees from each species). DNA was extracted twice independently from each sample and sequenced independently.

SNVs over 8 samples were called using GATK HaplotypeCaller (GATK) and Bcftools mpileup (BCF tools) for each set of biological replicates from 7 branches and 1 cambium independently, generating potential SNVs for each set of replicates and for each SNP caller (G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> for GATK, B<sub>1</sub> and B<sub>2</sub> for BCF tools). For BCF tools, we set three thresholds (T40, T30, and T20) with different base quality (BQ) and mapping quality (MQ). SNVs detected in both replicates were extracted for each SNP callers and generated potential SNVs for each SNP caller, SNV<sub>GATK</sub> for GATK and SNV<sub>BCF</sub> for Bcftools with three thresholds. These SNVs were filtered by extracting SNVs detected in both SNP callers, generating potential SNVs for each threshold: SNV<sub>T40</sub>, SNV<sub>T30</sub>, and SNV<sub>T20</sub>. Finally, SNVs detected at any of the three thresholds were extracted to obtain candidate SNVs. We checked the candidate SNVs manually and obtained a final set of SNVs, SNVFinal.</p></caption>

<p>This study is an <bold>important</bold> contribution to our understanding of somatic mutation mechanisms in plants, uncovering a surprising constancy in the yearly accumulation of somatic mutations regardless of the species' growth rates. The authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence, leveraging rigorous sequencing analysis and innovative bioinformatic techniques, to demonstrate that many plant somatic mutations are accumulated in a replication-independent manner. This research is poised to captivate not only scholars focused on plant evolution and development, but also scientists broadly interested in mutation mechanisms in multicellular organisms.</p>

<p>In this study, Satake and colleagues endeavored to explore the rates and patterns of somatic mutations in wild plants, with a focus on their relationship to longevity. The researchers examined slow- and fast-growing tropical tree species, demonstrating that slow-growing species exhibited five times more mutations than their fast-growing counterparts. The number of somatic mutations was found to increase linearly with branch length. Interestingly, the somatic mutation rate per meter was higher in slow-growing species, but the rate per year remained consistent across both species. A closer inspection revealed a prevalence of clock-like spontaneous mutations, specifically cytosine-to-thymine substitutions at CpG sites. The author suggested that somatic mutations were identified as neutral within an individual, but subject to purifying selection when transmitted to subsequent generations. The authors developed a model to assess the influence of cell division on mutational processes, suggesting that cell-division independent mutagenesis is the primary mechanism.</p>
<p>The authors have gathered valuable data on somatic mutations, particularly regarding differences in growth rates among trees. Their meticulous computational analysis led to fascinating conclusions, primarily that most somatic mutations accumulate in a cell-division independent manner. The discovery of a molecular clock in somatic mutations significantly advances our comprehension of mutational processes that may generate genetic diversity in tropical ecosystems. The interpretation of the data appears to be based on the assumption that somatic mutations can be effectively transmitted to the next generation unless negative selection intervenes. However, accumulating evidence suggests that plants may also possess &quot;effective germlines,&quot; which could render the somatic mutations detected in this study non-transmittable to progeny. Incorporating additional analyses/discussion in the context of plant developmental biology, particularly recent studies on cell lineage, could further enhance this study.</p>
<p>Specifically, several recent studies address the topics of effective germline in plants. For instance, Robert Lanfear published an article in PLoS Biology exploring the fundamental question, &quot;Do plants have a segregated germline?&quot; A study in PNAS posited that &quot;germline replications and somatic mutation accumulation are independent of vegetative life span in Arabidopsis.&quot; A phylogenetic-based analysis titled &quot;Rates of Molecular Evolution Are Linked to Life History in Flowering Plants&quot; discovered that &quot;rates of molecular evolution are consistently low in trees and shrubs, with relatively long generation times, as compared with related herbaceous plants, which generally have shorter generation times.&quot; Another compelling study, &quot;The architecture of intra-organism mutation rate variation in plants,&quot; published in PLoS Biology, detected somatic mutations in peach trees and strawberries. Although some of these studies are cited in the current work, a deeper examination of the findings in relation to the existing literature would strengthen the interpretation of the data.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors used an original empirical design to test if somatic mutation rates are different depending on the plant growth rates. They detected somatic mutations along the growth axes of four trees - two individuals per species for two dipterocarp tree species growing at different rates. They found here that plant somatic mutations are accumulated are a relatively constant rate per year in the two species, suggesting that somatic mutation rates correlate with time rather than with growth, i.e. the number of cell divisions. The authors then suggest that this result is consistent with a low relative contribution of DNA replication errors (referred to as α in the manuscript) to the somatic mutation rates as compared to the other sources of mutations (β). Given that plants - in particular, trees - are generally assumed to deviate from the August Weismann's theory (a part of the somatic variation is expected to be transmitted to the next generation), this work could be of interest for a large readership interested by mutation rates as a whole, since it has implications also for heritable mutation rates too. In addition, even if this is not discussed, the putatively low contribution of DNA replication errors could help to understand the apparent paradox associated to trees. Indeed, trees exhibit clear signatures of lower molecular evolution (Lanfear et al. 2013), therefore suggesting lower mutation rates per unit of time. Trees could partly keep somatic mutations under control thanks to a long-term evolution towards low α values, resulting in low α/β ratios as compared to short-lived species. I therefore consider that the paper tackles a fundamental albeit complex question in the field.</p>
<p>Overall, I consider that the authors should clearly indicate the weakness of the studies. For instance, because of the bioinformatic tools used, they have reasonably detected a small part of the somatic mutations, those that have reached a high allele frequency in tissues. Mutation counts are known to be highly dependent on the experimental design and the methods used. Consequently, (i) this should be explicit and (ii) a particular effort should be made to demonstrate that the observed differences in mutation counts are robust to the potential experimental biases. This is important since, empirically, we know how mutation counts can vary depending on the experimental designs. For instance, a difference of an order of magnitude has been observed between the two papers focusing on oaks (Schmid-Siegert et al. 2017 and Plomion et al. 2018) and this difference is now known to be due to the differences in the experimental designs, in particular the sequencing effort (Schmitt et al. 2022).</p>
<p>Having said that, my overall opinion is that (i) the authors have worked on an interesting design and generated unique data, (ii) the results are probably robust to some biases and therefore strong enough (but see my comments regarding possible improvements), (iii) the interpretations are reasonable and (iv) the discussion regarding the source of somatic mutations is valuable.</p>

<p>In animals, several recent studies have revealed a substantial role for non-replicative mutagenic processes such as DNA damage and repair rather than replicative error as was previously believed. Much less is known about how mutation operates in plants, with only a handful of studies devoted to the topic. Authors Satake et al. aimed to address this gap in our understanding by comparing the rates and patterns of somatic mutation in a pair of tropical tree species, slow-growing Shorea lavis and fast-growing S. leprosula. They find that the yearly somatic mutation rates in the two species is highly similar despite their difference in growth rates. The authors further find that the mutation spectrum is enriched for signatures of spontaneous mutation and that a model of mutation arising from different sources is consistent with a large input of mutation from sources uncorrelated with cell division. The authors conclude that somatic mutation rates in these plants appears to be dictated by time, not cell division numbers, a finding that is in line with other eukaryotes studied so far.</p>
<p>In general, this work shows careful consideration and study design, and the multiple lines of evidence presented provide good support for the authors' conclusions. In particular, they use a sound approach to identify rare somatic mutations in the sampled trees including biological replicates, multiple SNP-callers and thresholds, and without presumption of a branching pattern. By applying these methods consistently across both species, the authors provide confidence in the comparative mutation rate results. Further steps could be taken to ensure the validity of the results; however, these issues are relatively minor and should minimally impact the overall findings.</p>
<p>Some of the identified somatic mutations (primarily those in individual F1) appear to require two mutation events-one on each chromosome-to be generated and should be either removed or accounted for. Also, while the authors provide estimates of their false positive rate at different filtering thresholds, an assessment of the false negative rate is absent and would help assure readers that the differing number of somatic mutations found is not due to differences in statistical power.</p>
<p>The authors compare the mutation rate per meter of growth, demonstrating that the rate is higher in slow-growing S. laevis: a key piece of evidence in favor of the authors' conclusion that somatic mutations track absolute time rather than cell division. To estimate the mutation rate per unit distance, they regress the per base-pair rate of mutations found between all pairwise branch tips against the physical distance separating the tips (Fig. 2a). While a regression approach is appropriate, the narrowness of the confidence interval is overstated as the points are not statistically independent: internal branches are represented multiple times. (For example, all pairwise comparisons involving a cambium sample will include the mutations arising along the lower trunk.) Regressing rates and lengths of distinct branches might be more appropriate. Judging from the data presented, however, the point estimates seem unlikely to change much.</p>
<p>The most obvious drawback of this study is the low sample size with only two individuals of each species sequenced. To eliminate lingering doubts, it would be helpful to include a more in-depth discussion about stray factors that might affect the authors' conclusions. For example: Could an error in estimation of the trees' ages affect the yearly mutation rate comparisons? If mutations are replicatively driven, could the 30% species difference in the number of cell divisions per meter be sufficient to explain the results?</p>
<p>This work deepens our understanding of how mutation operates at the cellular level by adding plants to the list of eukaryotes in which many mutations appear to derive from non-replicative sources. Given these results, it is intriguing to consider whether there is a fundamental mechanism linking mutation across distantly related species. Plants, generally, present a unique opportunity in the study of mutation as the germline is not sequestered, as it is in animals, and thus the forces of both mutation and selection acting throughout an individual plant's life could in principle affect the mutations transmitted to seed. The authors touch on this aspect, finding no evidence for a reduction in non-synonymous somatic mutations relative to the background rate, but more work-both experimental and observational-is needed to understand the dynamics of mutation and cell-competition within an individual plant. Overall, these results open the door to several intriguing questions in plant mutation. For example, is somatic mutation age-dependent in other species, and do other tropical plants harbor a high mutation rate relative to temperate genera? Any future inquiries on this topic would benefit from modeling their approach for identifying somatic mutations on the methods laid out here.</p>
