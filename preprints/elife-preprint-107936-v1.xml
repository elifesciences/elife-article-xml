<title>Abstract</title><p>Widespread antibiotic usage has resulted in the rapid evolution of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens and poses significant threats to public health. Resolving how pathogens respond to antibiotics under different contexts is critical for understanding disease emergence and evolution going forward. The impact of antibiotics has been demonstrated most directly through <italic>in vitro</italic> pathogen passaging experiments. Independent from antibiotic selection, interactions with hosts have also altered the evolutionary trajectories and fitness landscapes of pathogens, shaping infectious disease outcomes. However, it is unclear how interactions between hosts and antibiotics impact the evolution of pathogen virulence. Here, we evolved and re-sequenced <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> a major bacterial pathogen, varying exposure to host and antibiotics to tease apart the contributions of these selective pressures on pathogen adaptation. After 12 passages, <italic>S. aureus</italic> evolving in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematodes exposed to a sub-minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotic (oxacillin) became highly virulent, regardless of whether the ancestral pathogen was methicillin-resistant (MRSA) or methicillin-sensitive (MSSA). Host and antibiotic exposure selected for reduced drug susceptibility in MSSA lineages while increasing MRSA total growth outside hosts. We identified mutations in genes involved in complex regulatory networks linking virulence and metabolism, including <italic>codY</italic>, <italic>agr</italic>, and <italic>gdpP</italic>, suggesting that rapid adaptation to infect hosts may have pleiotropic effects. In particular, MSSA populations under selection from host and antibiotic accumulated mutations in the global regulator gene <italic>codY</italic>, which controls biofilm formation in <italic>S. aureus.</italic> These populations had indeed evolved more robust biofilms—a trait linked to both virulence and antibiotic resistance—suggesting evolution of one trait can confer multiple adaptive benefits. Mutations that arose in these genes were also enriched in clinical isolates associated with systemic infections in humans. Despite evolving in similar environments, MRSA and MSSA populations proceeded on divergent evolutionary paths, with MSSA populations exhibiting more similarities across replicate populations. Our results underscore the importance of considering the host context as a critical driver of pathogen traits like virulence and antibiotic resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is a global crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Pathogens that evolve resistance and are able to survive antibiotic therapy can go on to cause disease and transmit to other hosts; hence antibiotic resistance and virulence are intertwined. Selective pressures like antibiotic usage and host defenses have independently been shown to alter the evolution of pathogen traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. However, pathogens face multiple selective pressures in their environment, and selection by concurrent forces can interact synergistically to alter evolutionary rates and trajectories relative to individual pressures alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. It is unclear how virulence evolves in the face of simultaneous selective pressures and whether this trait is constrained or facilitated by antibiotic resistance. These dynamics are even less understood in the early stages of disease emergence, where pathogens face a different suite of selection dynamics than pathogens having reached equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. Identifying conditions under which antibiotic resistance and virulence evolve in novel host populations will shed light on how diseases emerge and potential mitigation measures.</p>
<p>The strength of selection impacts pathogen evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. While antibiotic therapy administers concentrations that should kill all pathogen cells, low concentrations of antibiotics (sub-minimum inhibitory concentration, or sub-MIC) are pervasive in a variety of settings, including in natural environments (e.g., water bodies and soil) due to pollution and biological waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. In the host, antibiotic concentrations will gradually decline after administration due to metabolism and excretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Sub-MICs allow susceptible populations to continue dividing, affording opportunities for mutations conferring greater resistance to emerge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Ultimately, selection by sub-MICs can lead to highly resistant pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], which tend to incur less fitness costs compared to those under selection by high antibiotic concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Importantly, mutations not related to antibiotic resistance can arise, such as those involved in adaptation to the growth environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Low concentrations of antibiotics can also alter expression of virulence factors <italic>in vitro</italic> across a broad range of pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], suggesting that they can affect virulence during infection. Sub-MIC antibiotics therefore have the potential to alter the early stages of disease emergence in host populations, particularly for those pathogens that can spend parts of their life history outside the host. Taken together, exposure to low antibiotic concentrations likely alters how pathogens interact with their hosts, shaping evolution of both virulence and antibiotic resistance. However, there is a knowledge gap in the interaction between antibiotics and pathogen evolution <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>The host can exert strong selection on pathogens, especially during the period when a new organism is infected (e.g., a zoonotic transition). Infection of new host individuals tends to bottleneck pathogen populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. These bottlenecks can confer a fitness advantage to resistant bacteria in the face of low antibiotic concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. In addition to defenses like the immune system, the host environment differs drastically in nutrient availability compared to rich laboratory media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. For example, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> passaged through macrophage cell lines had increased pathogen survival as well as resistance to antibiotics; these traits were lost when the pathogen was exposed to nutrient-rich media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Similarly, the human defensive peptide b-defensin 3 can maintain reduced susceptibility of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to the antibiotic vancomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. Adapting to different niches within a host can also bring about drastic genomic changes. <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> transitioning from an intestinal to a systemic lifestyle exhibited genome degradation in genes no longer necessary for inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. While sub-MIC antibiotic exposure and host factors have been shown to independently shape pathogen evolution, it is unclear how the collective actions of both selective pressures affect the evolution of virulence and antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly colonizes nares and skin in humans but can invade internal organs and blood, causing systemic infections and bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. In 2017, more than 119,000 bactemia infections caused by <italic>S. aureus</italic> occurred in the United States with a mortality rate of 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. <italic>S. aureus</italic> colonizing host surfaces exhibit distinct genomic signatures against those isolated during systemic infection, indicating that the pathogen employs different strategies to adapt to different host sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. For example, hemolytic strains tend to be more abundant than non-hemolytic ones in murine systemic infection models, whereas the opposite occurs for wound models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Once inside the host, <italic>S. aureus</italic> evades detection by the immune system by hindering or lysing immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Sub-MIC concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics—which disrupts bacterial cell wall synthesis—modify expression of virulence factors in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, increasing the expression of alpha-hemolysin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics systemically exposes <italic>S. aureus</italic> to low antibiotic levels at non-target host tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. The pathogen can also survive for extended periods of time outside of hosts and have been isolated from environments such as veterinary clinics and schools, as well as natural and constructed settings such as wastewater and beaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Combined with the increasing prevalence and concentrations of antibiotics in the environment, these factors likely increase opportunities for exposure of <italic>S. aureus</italic> to sub-MIC antibiotics, subsequently affecting its interaction with the host during infection.</p>
<p>Experimental evolution has been used to elucidate how different selective pressures impact pathogen evolution. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have yielded insights into the phenotypes and genetic loci generated by longer-term antibiotic selection through passaging experiments lasting hundreds of generations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Conversely, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies have focused on transmitting pathogens through individual hosts for a single to a handful of passages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. However, few systems have been suitable to examine how antibiotics affect pathogen adaptation within a host context. In this study, we take advantage of the suitability of a multicellular host, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> nematodes, to study designs of high replication across an appreciable temporal scale. The <italic>S. aureus</italic> used here was originally isolated from a skin and soft tissue infection of a human inmate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and thus is a novel pathogen to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Nonetheless, <italic>S. aureus</italic> can kill nematodes by colonizing the host intestine and lysing cells, inducing expression of defense genes in nematodes with roles conserved in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Virulence screens in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using <italic>S. aureus</italic> transposon libraries also showed overlapping results to other infection models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], with the degree of <italic>S. aureus</italic> virulence in <italic>C. elegans</italic> reflecting disease severity of human infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. Experimentally evolving <italic>S. aureus</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> thus allows us to track the early stages of virulence and antibiotic resistance evolution in novel host populations with the potential to identify clinically-relevant genomic regions underlying evolved traits.</p>
<p>Here, we directly test the impact of host and sub-MIC antibiotic exposure on pathogen evolution. Selection exerted by two concurrent forces may impede the pathogen’s response to one or both forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. Adaptation may require resources to be expended toward either virulence or antibiotic resistance, leading to a trade-off between these traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Alternatively, weaker selection from sub-MIC antibiotics may interact synergistically with hosts and facilitate the evolution or maintenance of high virulence and antibiotic resistance. Sub-MIC antibiotics can favor no-cost mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], wherein pathogens can rapidly adapt without affecting other traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Because emerging pathogens tend to be far from the optimum of the fitness landscape, we expect pleiotropic or large-effect mutations to play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. We took advantage of the tractability of the system to determine how virulence, fitness, and antibiotic resistance are connected and how multiple selective pressures shape the evolutionary trajectory of two <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates differing only in their antibiotic susceptibility.</p>
<p>Carriage of Staphylococcal cassette chromosome <italic>mec</italic> (SCC<italic>mec</italic>), which encodes <italic>mecA</italic> and provides resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics, is a major mechanism for existing antibiotic resistance in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We passaged two <italic>S. aureus</italic> isogenic strains, one with existing resistance (<italic>mecA+</italic>, MRSA) and one with a transposon insertion in <italic>mecA</italic> (<italic>mecA-</italic>, MSSA) under selection by <italic>C. elegans</italic> and a sub-MIC level of oxacillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic that has replaced methicillin as a therapy for Staphylococcal infections. We selected for virulence in both strains to determine whether antibiotic resistance can hinder the evolution of greater virulence. We then quantified the ability of evolved pathogens to kill hosts as the metric for virulence. We also assessed whether populations maintained their ability to hemolyze red blood cells—an indicator of virulence expression in both humans and nematodes. Because growth outside the host is important for transmission of opportunistic pathogens, we quantified the <italic>in vitro</italic> growth and MIC of evolved pathogens. Finally, we identified mutations potentially underlying evolved traits and compared them against a database of over 80,000 <italic>S. aureus</italic> genomes to ascertained whether these mutations may be associated with adaptation to different human host sites.</p>

<title>Host and sub-MIC antibiotic exposure selected for the greatest virulence in both MRSA and MSSA</title>
<p>We experimentally evolved two <italic>S. aureus</italic> isogenic variants of USA300 JE2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], MRSA and MSSA, with or without a host and sub-MIC antibiotic exposure. The ancestral MRSA and MSSA isolates did not differ in terms of total growth without oxacillin, but exhibited a slight decline in sub-MIC oxacillin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>; 𝜒<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = 6.39, P = 0.01). For each ancestor, we passaged six independently evolving populations under each condition 12 times, for a total of 48 evolved <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

<p>To assess the changes in virulence of evolved <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we measured the mortality of <italic>C. elegans</italic> infected with evolved pathogens. While the MRSA and MSSA ancestors caused similar levels of host mortality (dotted and dashed lines in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), there was a significant treatment effect for evolved pathogens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>; 𝜒<sub>7</sub><sup>2</sup> = 460.43, P &lt; 0.001). For the MRSA genotype, host and oxacillin exposure selected for the greatest virulence (P &lt; 0.001 for all Tukey’s post-hoc tests of +host+ox <italic>vs</italic>. other treatments). Conversely, pathogens evolved in the absence of either pressure exhibited attenuated virulence (-host-ox <italic>vs.</italic> +host-ox: P &lt; 0.001; -host-ox <italic>vs.</italic> -host+ox: P &lt; 0.001). These populations also had significantly greater variance (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance F<sub>3,20</sub> = 4.06, P = 0.021) compared to those under selection from host and oxacillin (Tukey’s post-hoc test P = 0.026), and those under solely host selection (P = 0.045). For MSSA, host and oxacillin exposure similarly favored greater virulence over the other three conditions (P &lt; 0.001 for all Tukey’s post-hoc tests of +host+ox <italic>vs</italic>. other treatments). There was no difference between variances (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance F<sub>3,20</sub> = 0.99, P = 0.417).</p>

</fig>
<p>We also characterized the hemolytic activity of evolved populations, which correlates with the ability to secrete extracellular toxins and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. At least one population from most treatments had lost the ancestral ability to hemolyze sheep’s blood (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Sub-MIC oxacillin maintained hemolytic activity (𝜒<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = 5.82, P = 0.016), suggesting that constant exposure to low concentrations of oxacillin favored retention of extracellular toxicity. While hemolysis was not necessary for increased host-killing, this ability was correlated with greater nematode mortality (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>; Kruskal-Wallis 𝜒<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = 3.97, P = 0.046). As virulence was still heightened in pathogens unable to destroy red blood cells (e.g., MSSA pathogens evolving without host or oxacillin caused greater than 90% mean mortality despite none being hemolysis-positive), other virulence factors may be compensating for the absence of hemolysis.</p>
<p>Natural populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> exhibit variation in hemolytic ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], even within an individual host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that a significant selective pressure like oxacillin would favor little variation of this trait within a population. We determined the hemolysis status of isolates from each evolved population (10 isolates x 48 populations)—most populations were in consensus (Figure S1). Furthermore, oxacillin still has a significant effect, where hemolysis was maintained when under sub-MIC exposure selection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>; 𝜒<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = 23.30, P &lt; 0.001). Oxacillin favored less hemolytic diversity in MSSA populations (Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance F<sub>1,22</sub> = 26.06, P &lt; 0.001), further demonstrating the interaction between antibiotics and virulence, and that antibiotics can shape variation in virulence traits.</p>

We used rich media to replicate the conditions under which <italic>S. aureus</italic> evolved during the experiment. Importantly, rich media prevents introduction of additional selective pressures than those being tested. In media without oxacillin, there were no significant differences in total growth between treatments (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; 𝜒<sub>7</sub><sup>2</sup> = 9.24, P = 0.24). However, in sub-MIC oxacillin, MRSA populations under selection from both pressures exhibited the greatest growth (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; 𝜒<sub>7</sub><sup>2</sup> = 106.16, P &lt; 0.001), with some achieving more growth than those in the absence of oxacillin. Similarly, MSSA populations exposed to host and sub-MIC oxacillin exhibited a moderate increase in growth compared to other combinations of selective pressures.</p>

<p>We then determined the MICs of evolved populations to ascertain how host and sub-MIC exposure affected the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance. For the MRSA genotype, all but two populations retained the ancestral level of oxacillin resistance (16ug/mL oxacillin; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). During evolution in hosts without antibiotic selection, two populations lost their resistance and exhibited similar susceptibility as the MSSA ancestor (0.25ug/mL). For the MSSA genotype, host and oxacillin exposure selected for decreased antibiotic sensitivity (Fisher’s exact test P &lt; 0.001; pairwise post-hoc P &lt; 0.05 for +host+ox <italic>vs.</italic> all other treatments), up to 8-fold the ancestral MIC. These results suggested sub-MIC exposure combined with host factors potentiated the increase in antibiotic resistance in MSSA. One population under selection from solely the host also had an increased MIC, supporting previous evidence showing non-antibiotic selective pressures, such as a host in our study, can select for reduced antibiotic susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. There was no variation in antibiotic resistance within MRSA populations and little variation within MSSA populations across the most genetically diverse populations (Figure S2).</p>

<p>Between pathogens with the highest virulence—those under selection from both selective pressures—populations arisen from MRSA had mutations in 25 genes and intergenic regions, while those from MSSA had mutations in 12 genes and intergenic regions. Both treatments had mutations in virulence regulators <italic>codY</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] and <italic>saeRS</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] suggesting some shared pathways to heightened virulence among the two treatments, but mutations in these genes did not occur across all replicate populations. These treatments also had mutations in <italic>gdpP</italic> and <italic>pbpA</italic>, which have been implicated in resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], with <italic>gdpP</italic> playing a role in MSSA resistance to oxacillin in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Five out of six populations evolved from the MSSA ancestor had a mutation in either gene, which may have contributed to the reduced oxacillin sensitivity in these populations.</p>
<p>Regulatory genes were enriched with mutations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>; one-sample Poisson test P &lt; 0.001 for MRSA and MSSA genotypes). These included <italic>agr</italic>, <italic>saeRS,</italic> and <italic>codY</italic>. <italic>agr</italic> is a quorum sensor that regulates the expression of virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. All 22 mutations in <italic>agr</italic> were found in populations that have lost the ability to hemolyze red blood cells.

<title>Mutations in antibiotic resistance genes are associated with heightened virulence</title>
<p>We correlated mutations arising in specific genes with measured traits to identify loci potentially underlying evolved phenotypes. We focused on genes where two or more mutations (excluding intergenic or synonymous mutations) had fixed during the experiment regardless of treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). Mutations in three genes were associated with significant increases in virulence from the ancestor: <italic>codY</italic> (one-sample t-test = 19.56, df = 7, P &lt; 0.001), <italic>gdpP</italic> (one-sample t-test = 17.02, df = 3, P = 0.002), and <italic>pbpA</italic> (one-sample t-test = 7.54, df = 3, P = 0.012). Mutations in <italic>agr</italic> in general were not associated with changes in overall virulence, but greater host mortality was associated with <italic>agr</italic> mutations arising from the MSSA ancestor compared to the MRSA ancestor (Wilcoxon rank sum exact test P = 0.045).</p>
<p>Mutations in specific genes had a significant association with the ability to hemolyze red blood cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; Fisher’s exact test P &lt; 0.001). There was a greater proportion of populations with <italic>agr</italic> mutations unable to hemolyze red blood cells compared to <italic>alr</italic> (P = 0.036)<italic>, argR</italic> (P = 0.006)<italic>, codY</italic> (P = 0.005)<italic>, gdpP</italic> (P = 0.006), and <italic>purR</italic> (P = 0.006). There were also significant differences between the mutations associated with oxacillin resistance in populations evolved from the MSSA ancestor (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>; Fisher’s exact test P = 0.0015), where a greater proportion of populations with mutations in <italic>codY</italic> had reduced oxacillin susceptibility compared to <italic>brnQ1</italic> (P = 0.043). Exposure to oxacillin maintained hemolysis in evolved populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting low concentrations of oxacillin exerted negative selection on the <italic>agr</italic> locus. By contrast, mutations in <italic>agr</italic> were associated with the loss of hemolytic activity, consistent with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Because mutations in <italic>codY</italic> appeared to be important for both virulence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and antibiotic resistance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), we hypothesized that traits controlled by <italic>codY</italic> were responsible for the traits observed in MSSA populations under selection from both pressures. A potential mechanism underlying changes in virulence and antibiotic sensitivity in MSSA may involve biofilm formation. Biofilm is implicated in <italic>S. aureus</italic> pathogenesis as well as in dampening the efficacy of antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm enhances virulence and protects the pathogen from host innate immune defenses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Both sub-MIC level of beta-lactam antibiotics and null-mutants of <italic>codY</italic> induce robust biofilm formation and hemolysis activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. Taken together, exposure to sub-MIC level of oxacillin and acquisition of potentially deleterious mutations in <italic>codY</italic> may underlie both increased virulence and reduced antibiotic susceptibility. Our findings partially supported this hypothesis: biofilm formation did not significantly differ for the MRSA genotype (𝜒<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> = 7.24, P = 0.06). By contrast, biofilm production differed between treatments for the MSSA genotype (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; 𝜒<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> = 17.91, P &lt; 0.001), with populations exposed to both selective pressures forming more biofilm than those evolved without host (Tukey’s post-hoc test P &lt; 0.001) or either pressure (P = 0.014), but not those evolved in solely sub-MIC oxacillin (P = 0.095). While host and sub-MIC oxacillin selection favored robust biofilms in MSSA, oxacillin by itself also increased biofilm formation, suggesting low antibiotic concentrations contributed significantly to the evolution of drug-sensitive populations. The loci underlying biofilm formation may be different in these two treatments, since mutations in <italic>codY</italic> did not appear in populations under solely oxacillin selection (biofilm is a polygenic trait in <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]).</p>

<title>MRSA and MSSA exhibited divergent phenotypic and genomic evolution during adaptation</title>
<p>We conducted principal component analysis on the evolved traits (virulence, growth in media with or without sub-MIC oxacillin, and biofilm production) in MRSA and MSSA populations to determine the impact of selective pressures on overall pathogen phenotypic evolution (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

</fig>
<p>To determine how host and sub-MIC antibiotic shaped pathogen genomic evolution, we built phylogenies using mutations that arose from the MRSA and MSSA ancestors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C and D</xref>). We compared Euclidean distances calculated from the frequency of each mutation to determine the genetic distance from the ancestor—how fast each population was evolving—and the genetic distance between populations within each treatment—how much each population had diverged from one another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. There was no significant difference between treatments for MRSA populations in terms of genetic distance to the ancestor (Figure S6A; F<sub>(3,20)</sub> = 2.39, P: 0.099), suggesting that populations generally exhibited similar evolutionary rates. By contrast, MSSA populations had a significant effect of treatment (Figure S6B; F<sub>(3,19)</sub> = 10.44, P &lt; 0.001), where populations under selection from solely the host had greater genetic distance from the ancestor than populations under selection from solely oxacillin (Tukey’s post-hoc test P &lt; 0.001) or under neither selective pressure (P = 0.004).</p>
<p>For the MSSA group, populations within each treatment tended to exhibit more genetic similarity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6D</xref>). For MRSA, treatments varied in how divergent populations were (Figure S6C; Kruskal-Wallis 𝜒<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>= 21.09, P &lt; 0.001), where populations exposed to both selective pressures diverged more from each other than populations in the other three treatments (Dunn’s post-hoc test P &lt; 0.05 for all pairwise comparisons). Likewise, MSSA populations also differed in how much they varied (Figure S6D; F<sub>(3,51)</sub> = 54.20, P &lt; 0.001). Populations under solely host selection had greater divergence from each other than all other treatments (Tukey’s post-hoc test P &lt; 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons). By contrast, populations under selection solely from sub-MIC oxacillin diverged the least (P &lt; 0.05 for all pairwise comparisons). These findings altogether suggest that even concentrations well below the MIC differentially impacts sensitive and resistant pathogens.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>While antibiotics have existed for millions of years, the mass production and overuse of antibiotics by humans in the last century have exerted an unprecedented level of selection on pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. In addition to antibiotics, pathogens face numerous selective pressures such as host defenses and competitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>]. Opportunistic pathogens are especially likely to encounter diverse selective pressures due to their ability to proliferate outside a host. In this study, we evolved <italic>S. aureus</italic> with or without pre-existing antibiotic resistance under different combinations of host and sub-MIC antibiotics to explore the evolution of virulence and antibiotic resistance. We determined whether increased virulence trades-off with antibiotic resistance by directly selecting for virulence across all host-associated treatments. Nonetheless, we observed differing evolutionary trajectories, where exposure to oxacillin resulted in pathogens causing the greatest host mortality. Our experimental design allowed us to tease apart the contributions of the host, sub-MIC antibiotics, and their interaction to demonstrate that adaptation to novel hosts did not require trade-offs in pathogen traits. Indeed, selection from both host and antibiotics actually resulted in rapid pathogen adaptation, potentially creating the conditions under which a pathogen may emerge in new hosts.</p>
<p>Simultaneous selection from the host and sub-MIC antibiotic favored the greatest virulence and growth in antibiotics, indicating that interactions between these pressures can shape both traits. Sub-MIC antibiotics can facilitate adaptation to high drug concentrations and to the growth environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Frequent exposure to low concentrations of antibiotics in <italic>S. aureus</italic> may occur due to its ability to grow and survive in non-host environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], in addition to infection of antibiotic-treated hosts, where there is uneven distribution of drugs across tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. At the cellular level, sub-MIC antibiotics can affect <italic>S. aureus</italic> by directly binding to virulence factors, modulating virulence regulators, and inducing the expression of toxins like hemolysin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Prior exposure to sub-MIC inside and outside hosts can thus mediate traits involved in virulence upon host encounter. Our results further provided evidence for potential links between responses to antibiotic selection and virulence. Mutations genes involved in resistance to antibiotics were correlated with increased virulence, suggesting that adaptation to antibiotics may allow for virulence to evolve. Furthermore, in the absence of oxacillin selection, populations lost their ability to hemolyze red blood cells, supporting previous findings that antibiotics can influence expression of virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Likewise, host factors contributed to antibiotic resistance. All populations initially sensitive to oxacillin exhibited increased MICs when under selection from both host and sub-MIC oxacillin. One population evolving under selection from either solely sub-MIC antibiotics or solely the host exhibited decreased oxacillin sensitivity, which is consistent with previous studies examining hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] and sub-MIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>] exposure separately. The pathogens in these studies evolved for much longer than our study, suggesting that having a host accelerated the evolution of antibiotic resistance, potentially due to bottlenecks that favor resistant isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Evolution in hosts also contributed to pathogen growth outside hosts, an important trait for opportunistic pathogens as persistence in the environment increases the likelihood of contact with new hosts. Ultimately, exposure to hosts and antibiotics together could create a feedback loop where both evolutionary pressures select for better adaptation in the other, resulting in highly virulent and resistant pathogens that can persist outside hosts.</p>
<p>Several mutations arose in genes with primary roles in metabolism, such as <italic>codY</italic>. It is becoming clear that pathogen metabolism plays a central role in its virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>] and antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. For example, mutations in chromosomal- and plasmid-encoded metabolic genes are widely prevalent among <italic>E. coli</italic> strains and protect them against antibiotic challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. Furthermore, antibiotics can directly select for reduced metabolic rates to dampen the deleterious effects of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], and increased resistance is more likely to evolve at high nutrient concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>]. Similarly, metabolic efficiency can alter virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], while resource limitations can hinder the evolution of virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>]. In <italic>S. aureus</italic>, CodY de-represses expression of virulence factors under resource-depleted conditions in order to acquire nutrients through the lysing of host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Our genomic data were consistent with the observation that <italic>codY</italic> may be mediating virulence through control of <italic>agr</italic>: MSSA populations under selection from both host and sub-MIC oxacillin exhibited the greatest virulence and was one of the two treatments without mutations in <italic>agr</italic>. These results suggested that the <italic>codY</italic> mutations in these populations may be deleterious, rendering CodY less efficient in repressing <italic>agr</italic>-mediated virulence as a result. As resources likely differ in abundance and type between hosts and media, our findings illustrated the importance of taking into consideration the environment in which pathogens evolve when evaluating traits of interest.</p>
<p>Regulatory genes in general acquired more mutations than expected by chance alone. This finding supported previous work showing that regulatory elements were more likely to acquire phenotype-altering mutations, especially in negative regulators (e.g., <italic>codY</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. Enrichment of mutations in regulatory genes has also been found in <italic>E. coli</italic> under antibiotic selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>]. Pleiotropic genes like regulators may increase the capacity to adapt to multiple environments. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> is a novel host to <italic>S. aureus</italic>, selection is more likely to act on genes that have large initial gains in the fitness landscape, such as those that have pleiotropic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Indeed, mutations in several metabolic regulators (<italic>codY, purR, gpmA</italic>) and virulence regulators (<italic>saeRS</italic>) were mainly associated with host infection. The resulting phenotypes of these mutations, such as increased biofilm production, can then confer multiple benefits like increased virulence and antibiotic resistance. Our experimental results revealed similar patterns to a comparative study analyzing over 2000 <italic>S. aureus</italic> genomes, where mutations in genes with pleiotropic effects, such as <italic>purR</italic>, may have underly pathogen adaptation during systemic infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Thus, changes in genes of large effects like global regulators appear to be critical mediators between different traits that altogether allow bacteria to rapidly adapt to new and stressful environments.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance did not impede the evolution of virulence. Antibiotic resistance tends to be costly in the absence of antibiotics; this cost can subsequently constrain evolution of traits requiring cellular resources, such as virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. However, mutations conferring resistance can have little to no costs, depending on the pathogen species and drugs, and costs can be offset by compensatory mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>]. Sub-MIC levels favor low-cost mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], therefore virulence and antibiotic resistance may not trade-off during disease emergence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Virulence may alternatively be costly in the presence of antibiotic resistance—populations evolved from the MRSA ancestor without either selective pressure exhibited the lowest virulence. The corresponding MSSA populations did not have a similar decline in virulence, suggesting that relaxed selection attenuated virulence for populations with existing resistance. Genomic differences between evolved MRSA and MSSA further demonstrate diverging evolutionary pathways in antibiotic-resistant <italic>versus</italic> antibiotic-sensitive populations. Oxacillin-exposed MSSA had no mutations in <italic>agr</italic> and retained their hemolytic ability, while some MRSA populations gained <italic>agr</italic> mutations and lost the trait, suggesting that other pathways are utilized to express virulence. Lastly, mutations in MRSA under selection from both host and antibiotics were significantly enriched in blood and systemic <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolated from humans, suggesting that antibiotics may facilitate MRSA invasive infection. Acquiring mutations in genes that impact antibiotic resistance, such as <italic>pbpA</italic> and <italic>pbpB</italic>, may allow <italic>S. aureus</italic> to persist longer in hosts.</p>
<p>Recent work has shown that diverse genotypes of one pathogen species converge on similar phenotypes when facing similar selective pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>]. Here, we showed that antibiotic resistance status can lead otherwise isogenic pathogens to use different adaptive strategies. Initially susceptible pathogens, facing novel selection from host and antibiotics, exhibited reduced phenotypic and genomic variation over evolutionary time and thus may have had a limited number of pathways to adapt to new environments. By contrast, resistant populations had greater variance and thus may have had more routes to utilize. Overall, the potential for low-cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] and pleiotropic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] may have created ideal conditions for a novel pathogen to establish in host populations regardless of its susceptibility to antibiotics. Our work demonstrated that responding to multiple pressures can result in rapid adaptation to new hosts and even evolution of traits not under selection, emphasizing the importance of non-canonical pathways (e.g., metabolism) in shaping these traits. Pathogen evolution in a tractable animal model recapitulated phenotypic and genomic findings from human studies, highlighting the utility of evolution experiments to identify potential ecological and genetic mechanisms that give rise to pathogen traits of interest. Our findings ultimately emphasize the importance of considering the host context in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Integrating multiple traits, such as virulence, antibiotic resistance, and fitness may be critical in identifying the factors that facilitate host shifts and persistence of drug-resistant pathogens.</p>

<p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> USA300 JE2 (NR-46543) and USA300 JE2 <italic>mecA</italic>-tn (Transposon Mutant NE1868) from the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library were acquired from BEI resources (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.beiresources.org/">https://www.beiresources.org/</ext-link>). To ensure true isogenic ancestors, the <italic>mecA</italic>-tn was transduced into the USA300 JE2 background, selecting for the erythromycin resistance marker on the Mariner transposon, and the insertion site was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Transposon maintenance was confirmed by testing for resistance to erythromycin (5µg/mL) or by genome sequencing when available. In cases where transposon loss was verified by genome sequencing, strains were tested and shown to maintain sensitivity to oxacillin. As the primary function of the transposon was to knock out <italic>mecA</italic> function, loss of the transposon should not confound subsequent analyses as antibiotic sensitivity was maintained.</p>
<p><italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> strain N2 Bristol and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain OP50 were provided by the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, which is funded by the NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs (P40 OD010440). Nematodes were maintained on Nematode Growth Medium Lite (US Biological, Swampscott, MA) according to WormBook protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>].</p>

<title>Experimental evolution</title>
<p>Selection for increased virulence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (USA300 JE2 or USA300 JE2 <italic>mecA-tn</italic>) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> was performed by passaging <italic>S. aureus</italic> from dead hosts 24 hours post-infection. Half of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> populations were additionally subjected to antibiotic pressure during the passages before and after <italic>C. elegans</italic> selection with sub-MIC oxacillin exposure (0.03125µg/mL). This concentration was tested against both ancestral strains and did not substantially inhibit growth of the methicillin-sensitive USA300 JE2 <italic>mecA</italic>-tn strain.</p>
<p>For each passage of experimental evolution, <italic>S. aureus</italic> was grown in Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth with 4µg/mL colistin (to prevent <italic>E. coli</italic> contamination from the nematode intestine) ± 0.03125µg/mL oxacillin and incubated at 37°C overnight, shaking at 250rpm. The next day, 200µL of the overnight <italic>S. aureus</italic> culture was plated onto BHI agar and incubated at 28°C overnight. Approximately 1500 <italic>C. elegans</italic> were plated and allowed to consume <italic>S. aureus</italic> for 24 hours before 30 dead nematodes were picked from each plate. Nematodes were identified as dead by a lack of response to tapping by a platinum wire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Bacterial extraction methods were adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref>]. In brief, picked dead nematodes were washed once with M9 buffer supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100, once with M9 buffer, then subjected to a 1:1000 bleach-M9 buffer solution for 15 minutes. Nematodes were then washed twice with M9 buffer and ground with a motorized pestle to extract <italic>S. aureus</italic> from the host intestine. <italic>S aureus</italic> populations evolving without hosts were obtained from nematode-free bacterial lawns with a loop. Populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were grown as previously before freezing and storage at -80°C. Twenty-five percent of each frozen culture was used as inoculum for the next round of experimental evolution. Preliminary experiments determined colony-forming units per milliliter dropped by approximately 50% after freezing. To maintain population diversity, the inoculum amount (25%), adjusted for freezing, was chosen to be within the dilution ratio presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>] that minimizes the chance that rare beneficial mutations are lost. Twelve rounds of passage were completed for 2 <italic>S. aureus</italic> genotypes x 2 host treatments x 2 antibiotic treatments x 6 replicates = 48 populations. Whole populations were frozen for subsequent analyses. We conducted all assays to evaluate changes in evolved <italic>S. aureus</italic> at the population level instead of single isolates to represent the context under which <italic>S. aureus</italic> evolved in our experiment and generally how pathogens exist in nature and in hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref>]. Population level assays also allow for potential interactions between genotypes that give rise to phenotypes like virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref>] and antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>] that would otherwise not be captured in single-isolate assays.</p>

<title>Mortality assay</title>
<p>Nematodes were age-synchronized as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">95</xref>] and grown on <italic>E.coli</italic> OP50 until L4 larval stage (48 hours at 20°C). Nematodes were subsequently washed off, counted, and approximately 200 individuals were plated on <italic>S. aureus</italic> lawns on BHI plates. Another set of nematodes were plated on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 to estimate the total number of nematodes. Plates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were prepared 24 hours prior by plating 200µL of an overnight population culture on BHI agar and grown at 28°C. After two days at 20°C, plates were scored by counting live nematodes. Host mortality data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution and followed by Tukey multiple-comparison tests to determine pairwise differences. To compare variances across treatments, we conducted Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance. All statistical analyses, including those below, were conducted in R (version 4.2.0).</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>Hemolysis phenotype assay</title>
<p>Populations of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were streaked onto Trypticase Soy Agar II with 5% sheep’s blood plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. Bacteria were assessed as either hemolysis positive or negative depending on whether there was a complete clearing around the colonies. We did not cross-streak with RN4220, which produces beta-hemolysin, and allows for detection of delta-hemolysin. Therefore, our assay mainly detects alpha-toxin and phenol-soluble modulins. Hemolysis data were analyzed using a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution. To determine whether there was an association between hemolysis status and host mortality, we compared the host mortality means of hemolysis-positive vs. hemolysis-negative pathogens using a Kruskal–Wallis test.</p>
<p>To determine whether there was variation in hemolysis ability within populations, we streaked 10 colonies from each of the 48 evolved populations onto Trypticase Soy Agar II with 5% sheep’s blood plates and incubated overnight at 37°C. To compare the number of isolates able to hemolyze, we conducted a generalized linear model with a binomial distribution. To compare variances, we conducted Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> growth assay</title>
<p>We measured growth in BHI to simulate conditions under which pathogens were grown in our experiment. Importantly, rich media allowed us to determine growth when conditions are optimal for evolved pathogens. Measuring growth in minimal media, while being more similar to conditions that <italic>S. aureus</italic> may face in its environment, would introduce another selective pressure. Overnight cultures of each evolved population was diluted 1:1000 in BHI broth, then 200µl of each dilution was added to 96-well plates, covered with a Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma) to minimize evaporation. The optical density at 600nm at 37°C with shaking at 282 cycles per minute was recorded every 10 minutes for 16 hours (1000 minutes) using a BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Reader. We randomly assigned each of the 48 evolved populations to the inner wells of the 96-well plates, with at least three technical replicates per population. Each plate also included technical replicates of each ancestor. Each ancestral strain was assayed with four technical replicates per plate across four plates. These steps were repeated for media with 0.03125µg/mL oxacillin. We used the R package <italic>gcplyr</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref>] to calculate the area under the curve of density, a metric that quantifies the overall bacterial growth. We compared the growth of populations across treatments using the mean area under the curve of the technical replicates for each population. We used a linear model followed by Tukey multiple-comparison tests to determine pairwise differences between the ancestors, and linear mixed models for evolved populations grown with or without oxacillin.</p>

<title>Antimicrobial susceptibility assay</title>
<p>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing for oxacillin was done according to Clinical &amp; Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standard protocols for broth microdilution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref>]. In brief, populations were streaked from frozen stock and re-streaked the next day. From the second day culture, populations were resuspended in normal saline to a 0.5 McFarland standard. Then, these cultures were diluted 1:20 in normal saline before 10µL was added to 90µL of CAMHB + 2% NaCl with the appropriate concentration of oxacillin. Plates were incubated at 35°C without shaking and read at 24 hours. For statistical analysis of populations evolved from the MSSA ancestor, we set a threshold such that anything above the ancestral susceptibility level (0.25ug/ml) was considered a decrease in oxacillin sensitivity. We then compared the proportion of populations exhibiting a decrease in oxacillin sensitivity with those that had not using Fisher’s exact test with false discovery rate-adjusted (FDR) p-values.</p>
<p>To determine whether there was variation in antibiotic susceptibility within evolved populations, we sampled 10 colonies from each of the four populations with the most number of mutations (two from MRSA and two from MSSA), and two additional randomly selected populations. We argued that variation would be the most observable in populations with the most genetic diversity. We then followed the standard protocol for a Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion susceptibility test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref>] using oxacillin. Briefly, we inoculated Mueller-Hinton agar plates (Hardy Diagnostics) of overnight cultures with standardized OD<sub>600</sub> and placed an oxacillin-impregnated disk (HardyDisk AST Oxacillin, OX1) onto each plate. We measured the diameter of the zone of inhibition after incubation at 37°C overnight.</p>

<sec id="s4g">
<title>Biofilm assay</title>
<p>Overnight cultures of each population were diluted 1:40 in BHI broth containing 0.5% glucose, then 100µl of each dilution was added to the inner wells of 96-well plates (NEST Biotechnology, flat-bottom, tissue culture-treated). Plates were incubated for 24 hours at 20°C, the temperature that nematodes experience during infection. Each well was washed three times with 200µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove non-adherent cells. We then stained cells with 125µl of 0.1% crystal violet for 20 minutes, followed by washing each well twice with 200µl PBS. We then resuspended the crystal violet in 125µl of 30% acetic acid. After incubation for 10 minutes, we measured the optical density at 595nm using a BioTek Synergy HTX Multimode Reader. We randomly assigned each of the 48 evolved populations to the inner wells of the 96-well plates, with at least three technical replicates per population. Each plate also included technical replicates of each ancestor. We standardized the mean of technical replicates for each population against the respective ancestor within each plate to control for variation across plates. We used mixed linear models followed by Tukey multiple-comparison tests to assess pairwise differences between treatments.</p>

<title>Whole-genome shotgun sequencing and variant annotation</title>
<p>Bacterial genome DNA was extracted from whole populations using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Population sequencing allows us to capture the genetic variation within populations, which is critical to understanding how pathogens evolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref>]. Genome sequencing of these DNA samples was performed at the M-Gen center using a paired-end library preparation method based on Illumina Nextera and sequenced on the NextSeq 550.</p>
<p>The raw data was quality trimmed and adapters removed using illumina-cleanup (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rpetit3/illumina-cleanup">https://github.com/rpetit3/illumina-cleanup</ext-link>) or with bactopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref>]. Mutations were called based on comparison to the reference USA300 JE2 genome (BioProject: PRJNA224116, BioSample: SAMN06677988, Assembly: GCF_002085525.1) using breseq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>]. The presence of large-scale deletions and other genetic changes were confirmed by analysis of de novo assembled genomes performed by the SKESA assembler software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref>]. The ancestral populations were almost identical to the reference genome used except for three mutations that were not found in any evolved populations. Another three mutations in <italic>bioD1, cls</italic> and <italic>ccdC</italic> were present in all populations derived from the MSSA ancestor and likely occurred in the first passage from the frozen culture before experimental evolution was performed. We therefore removed these six mutations from the analysis.</p>
<p>The number of mutations (excluding synonymous or intergenic regions) across treatments were analyzed using a generalized linear model with a Poisson distribution. For mutation enrichment analysis, we followed the steps as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref>]. Briefly, we calculated the “mutation rate” for each ancestor by dividing the total number of mutations by the reference genome size. We multiplied the mutation rate by the total length of regulatory genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>] with mutations in our study to generate the expected number of mutations for these genes. We then conducted single-tailed Poisson tests to determine whether the actual number of mutations in regulatory genes was greater than expected.</p>
<p>For phenotypes <italic>vs.</italic> mutations, we considered only mutations occurring at least twice throughout the experiment. For host mortality <italic>vs.</italic> mutations and growth rate <italic>vs.</italic> SCC<italic>mec</italic> and ACME, we conducted a one sample t-test for each evolved pathogen against its respective ancestor. P-values were adjusted using the FDR. For hemolysis status <italic>vs.</italic> mutations and oxacillin MIC <italic>vs.</italic> mutations, we conducted Fisher’s exact tests with Bonferroni corrections.</p>

<title>Comparing mutations in experiment against publicly available genomes</title>
<p>For each non-synonymous mutation in each gene, we created the FASTA file of the USA300 JE2 protein product and a cognate file of the mutant protein with the amino acid substitution edited manually. We ran tBLASTn (version 2.12.0) searches of both proteins against 83,383 high quality <italic>S. aureus</italic> whole genome assemblies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. We filtered out matches to genomes with less than 95% identity. We screened for cases where mutants had a better match to a genome than the ancestral protein (higher bitscore).</p>
<p>We collected meta-data for BioSamples accession linked to each genome from NCBI Entrez using a Python script from Jason Stajich (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/stajichlab/biosample_metadata">https://github.com/stajichlab/biosample_metadata</ext-link>), then manually curated the “isolation_source” column to either blood/systemic infection, skin/nose/throat, general host-association, animal, environment, others, and missing (see Table S3 for specific terms). For BioSamples matching mutants within each treatment, we compared the proportion of blood/systemic infection <italic>vs.</italic> skin/nose/throat against the expected proportion (all BioSamples in the dataset) using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test.</p>

<title>Principal component analysis</title>
<p>We conducted a principal component analysis on the phenotypes quantified in evolved populations using the prcomp function in R for each <italic>S. aureus</italic> genotype. We performed permutational analysis of variances (PERMANOVA, 999 permutations) to test for differences between treatments using adonis2 of the <italic>vegan</italic> package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">106</xref>] and pairwiseAdonis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref>].</p>

<title>Genetic distance</title>
<p>We generated a matrix of Euclidian genetic distances (the square root of pairwise differences) using the frequencies of mutations that arose for each <italic>S. aureus</italic> genotype, from which we constructed phylogenies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. We used pairwise differences between the ancestor and each evolved populations to compare rates of evolution across treatments, and pairwise differences between replicate populations within each treatment to compare the degree of divergence across treatments. We compared rates of evolution for MRSA and MSSA treatments, and degree of divergence for MSSA treatments, using linear models followed by Tukey multiple-comparison tests. We compared the degree of divergence for MRSA treatments using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study examines the evolution of virulence and antibiotic resistance in Staphylococcus aureus under multiple selection pressures. The evidence presented is <bold>convincing</bold>, with rigorous data that characterizes the outcomes of the evolution experiments. However, the manuscript's primary weakness is in its presentation, as claims about the causal relationship between genotypes and phenotypes are based on correlational evidence. The manuscript needs to be revised to address these limitations, clarify the implications of the experimental design, and adjust the overall narrative to better reflect the nature of the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors investigate how methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and sensitive (MSSA) Staphylococcus aureus adapt to a new host (C. elegans) in the presence or absence of a low dose of the antibiotic oxacillin. Using an &quot;Evolve and Resequence&quot; design with 48 independently evolving populations, they track changes in virulence, antibiotic resistance, and other fitness-related traits over 12 passages. Their key finding is that selection from both the host and the antibiotic together, rather than either pressure alone, results in the evolution of the most virulent pathogens. Genomically, they find that this adaptation repeatedly involves mutations in a small number of key regulatory genes, most notably codY, agr, and saeRS.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main advantage of the research lies in its strong and thoroughly replicated experimental framework, enabling significant conclusions to be drawn based on the concept of parallel evolution. The study successfully integrates various phenotypic assays (virulence, growth, hemolysis, biofilm formation) with whole-genome sequencing, offering an extensive perspective on the adaptive landscape. The identification of certain regulatory genes as common targets of selection across distinct lineages is an important result that indicates a level of predictability in how pathogens adapt.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The main limitation of the paper is that its findings on the function of specific genes are based on correlation, not cause-and-effect evidence. While the parallel evolution evidence is strong, the authors have not yet performed the definitive tests (i.e., reconstruction of ancestral genes) to ensure that the mutations identified in isolation are enough to account for the virulence or resistance changes observed. This makes the conclusions more like firm hypotheses, not confirmed facts.</p>
<p>(2) In some instances, the claims in the text are not fully supported by the visual data from the figures or are reported with vagueness. For example, the display of phenotypic clusters in the PCA (Figure 6A) and the sweeping generalization about the effect of antibiotics on the mutation rates (Figure S5) can be more precise and nuanced. Such small deviations dilute the overall argument somewhat and must be corrected.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript describes the results of an evolution experiment where Staphylococcus aureus was experimentally evolved via sequential exposure to an antibiotic followed by passaging through C. elegans hosts. Because infecting C. elegans via ingestion results in lysis of gut cells and an immune response upon infection, the S. aureus were exposed separately across generations to antibiotic stress and host immune stress. Interestingly, the dual selection pressure of antibiotic exposure and adaptation to a nematode host resulted in increased virulence of S. aureus towards C. elegans.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data presented provide strong evidence that in S. aureus, traits involved in adaptation to a novel host and those involved in antibiotic resistance evolution are not traded off. On the contrary, they seem to be correlated, with strains adapted to antibiotics having higher virulence towards the novel host. As increased virulence is also associated with higher rates of haemolysis, these virulence increases are likely to reflect virulence levels in vertebrate hosts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Right now, the results are presented in the context of human infections being treated with antibiotics, which, in my opinion, is inappropriate. This is because</p>
<p>
(1) exposure to the host and antibiotics was sequential, not simultaneous, and thus does not reflect the treatment of infection, and</p>
<p>
(2) because the site of infection is different in C. elegans and human hosts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the results are of interest; I just think the interpretation and framing should be adjusted.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Su et al. sought to understand how the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus responds to multiple selection pressures during infection. Specifically, the authors were interested in how the host environment and antibiotic exposure impact the evolution of both virulence and antibiotic resistance in S. aureus. To accomplish this, the authors performed an evolution experiment where S. aureus was fed to Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to study the host environment and then either subjected to the antibiotic oxacillin or not. Additionally, the authors investigated the difference in evolution between an antibiotic-resistant strain, MRSA, and an isogenic susceptible strain, MSSA. They found that MRSA strains evolved in both antibiotic and host conditions became more virulent, and that strains evolved outside these conditions lost virulence. Looking at the strains evolved in just antibiotic conditions, the authors found that S. aureus maintained its ability to lyse blood cells. Mutations in codY, gdpP, and pbpA were found to be associated with increased virulence. Additionally, these mutations identified in these experiments were found in S. aureus strains isolated from human infections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data are well-presented, thorough, and are an important addition to the understanding of how certain pathogens might adapt to different selective pressures in complex environments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are a few clarifications that could be made to better understand and contextualize the results. Primarily, when comparing the number of mutations and selection across conditions in an evolution experiment, information about population sizes is important to be able to calculate the mutation supply and number of generations throughout the experiment. These calculations can be difficult in vivo, but since several steps in the methodology require plating and regrowth, those population sizes could be determined. There was also no mention of how the authors controlled the inoculation density of bacteria introduced to each host. This would need to be known to calculate the generation time within the host. These caveats should be addressed in the manuscript.</p>
<p>Another concern is the number of generations the populations of S. aureus spent either with relaxed selection in rich media or under antibiotic pressure in between the host exposure periods. It is probable then that the majority of mutations were selected for in these intervening periods between host infection. Again, a more detailed understanding of population sizes would contribute to the understanding of which phase of the experiment contributed to the mutation profile observed.</p>
