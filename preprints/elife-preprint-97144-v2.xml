<title>Abstract</title><p>Glial cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) interact closely with the intestinal epithelium and secrete signals that influence epithelial cell proliferation and barrier formation <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on transcriptional programs and the few identified changes varied along the gastrointestinal tract. In the ileum, where enteric glia had been considered most essential for epithelial integrity, glial depletion did not drastically alter epithelial gene expression but caused a modest enrichment in signatures of Paneth cells, a secretory cell type important for innate immunity. In the absence of PLP1<sup>+</sup> glia, Paneth cell number was intact, but a subset appeared abnormal with irregular and heterogenous cytoplasmic granules, suggesting a secretory deficit. Consistent with this possibility, ileal explants from glial-depleted mice secreted less functional lysozyme than controls with corresponding effects on fecal microbial composition. Collectively, these data suggest that enteric glia do not exert broad effects on the intestinal epithelium but have an essential role in regulating Paneth cell function and gut microbial ecology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intestinal epithelium is an important interface between an animal and its external environment, not just as a physical barrier but also as a dynamic regulator of digestion, energy balance, and mucosal immunity. The ENS, the intrinsic nervous system of the digestive tract, directs many intestinal epithelial functions. Glia are major cellular components of the ENS distributed throughout the radial axis of the intestine, from the muscular outer walls to the inner mucosal layer containing the epithelium. Most studies of enteric glia have focused on the cells which closely associate with neuronal soma in the myenteric plexus and have uncovered numerous roles for these glia in the regulation of neuronal functions in both health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Many enteric glia, however, are located outside the myenteric plexus in the mucosa where they closely appose intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], raising the possibility that mucosal glia directly regulate epithelial cell functions.</p>
<p>Several enteric glia-derived cues, ranging from small molecules to growth factors, can alter epithelial cell proliferation and cell-cell adhesion <italic>in vitro</italic> (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]), supporting the possibility of glial-epithelial interactions. In the intestine, however, none of these factors are made exclusively by glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Moreover, studies in which enteric glia were depleted or disrupted <italic>in vivo</italic> have reported conflicting findings in terms of epithelial effects. For example, chemical gliotoxins do not cause major epithelial deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In contrast, a chemical-genetic model using a human <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter fragment to target glia in mice showed profound epithelial barrier defects and fulminant inflammation specifically in the distal small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Subsequent studies by multiple groups using more targeted systems to deplete or functionally disrupt glia defined by <italic>Plp1</italic>, <italic>Sox10,</italic> or <italic>Gfap</italic> expression, however, have not supported this finding. They found no major defects in epithelial properties at steady state or increased vulnerability to inflammation upon glial disruption even though all of these models exhibited deficits in other ENS-regulated functions, such as motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. One study reported that simultaneous depletion of <italic>Plp1</italic>- and <italic>Gfap</italic>-expressing populations could provoke intestinal inflammation, implicating a subset of glia with particularly high <italic>Gfap</italic> transcript expression in the regulation of epithelial turnover through the secretion of Wnt proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Genetic disruption of Wnt secretion in <italic>Gfap<sup>+</sup></italic> cells, however, affected epithelial turnover only upon radiation injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Thus, it largely remains unclear what, if any, epithelial functions enteric glia are necessary for <italic>in vivo</italic> at steady state.</p>
<p>To better delineate the functional significance of enteric glial-epithelial interactions in homeostasis, first we characterized the molecular phenotype of mucosal glia along the crypt-villus axis in both mice and humans. We found that <italic>Plp1</italic> was the most widely expressed marker of mucosal glia in both species, supporting the use of its promoter to probe glial functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. Then, to interrogate glial functions in an unbiased way, we depleted <italic>Plp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in mice and examined gene expression along the longitudinal axis of the intestine. Surprisingly, glial loss had minimal effects on the intestinal transcriptome or the cellular composition of the epithelium. Targeting <italic>Plp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells, however, caused a specific defect in Paneth cells leading to enriched gene expression signatures, diminished antimicrobial peptide secretion, and altered gut microbial composition. These observations uncover a link between enteric glia and Paneth cells and establish a role for enteric glia in regulating epithelial function in the healthy intestine <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>Plp1</italic> expression broadly marks glia in the gut mucosa</title>
<p>Enteric glia, like Schwann cells in the periphery, are neural crest-derived and have been identified within tissues by molecular markers including <italic>Sox10, Gfap, Plp1,</italic> and <italic>S100b</italic>. Although most glia within enteric ganglia are labeled by these markers, heterogeneity in their expression has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], particularly in glia located outside the myenteric plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. To determine which marker is most broadly expressed by mucosal glia and would thus be most useful for genetic interrogation of glial-epithelial interactions, we analyzed publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets of human and mouse intestinal mucosa.</p>
<p>In human small and large intestines, expression of <italic>SOX10</italic> and <italic>PLP1</italic> was restricted to cluster of cells with a glial signature (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1A-B</xref>). <italic>S100B</italic> was highly expressed by cells in this cluster but also detected in non-glial cells including macrophages and monocytes; <italic>GFAP</italic> was overall undetectable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1A-B</xref>). To validate these findings, we examined expression of the corresponding proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the human small intestine and found SOX10-, PLP1-, and S100B-immunoreactive cells in three compartments along the radial axis: the mucosa, enteric ganglia in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses, as well as intramuscular glia in the muscularis externa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">D</xref>). GFAP-immunoreactive cells were readily found within enteric ganglia but were rare in the mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supp. Fig. 2C</xref>). These observations are consistent with a recent study that examined SOX10, GFAP, and S100B by IHC in the human colon and found little to no GFAP, but robust SOX10 and S100B expression across all three compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. In the small intestine of patients with Crohn’s disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), <italic>SOX10</italic>, <italic>PLP1,</italic> and <italic>S100B</italic> transcripts were highly enriched in mucosal glia while <italic>GFAP</italic> was enriched in various non-glial cells including fibroblasts and immune cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). In sum, <italic>SOX10, PLP1 and S100B</italic> are broadly expressed by human enteric glia across the radial axis of the gut, including mucosal glia, in both healthy and inflamed states, with <italic>SOX10</italic> and <italic>PLP1</italic> exhibiting the most cell type specificity.</p>

</fig>
<p>In mice, we previously showed that PLP1 is widely expressed by enteric glia across the radial axis of the small and large intestines where its expression largely overlaps with S100B; a more limited subset expresses GFAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Consistent with these observations, analysis of scRNAseq data from the mouse colonic mucosa showed that <italic>Plp1</italic> is broadly expressed across the single putative cluster of mucosal glia; <italic>Gfap</italic>, <italic>S100b,</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> are also detectable in this cluster to variable extents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supp. Fig. 1C</xref>). Given recent observations that a subset of Gfap<sup>high</sup>/Plp1<sup>low</sup> mucosal glia might be particularly important for epithelial regulation in the mouse small intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], we closely compared <italic>Plp1</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic> expression in the mouse ileum. We performed whole-mount IHC for GFAP in Plp1-eGFP reporter mice to ensure the detection of colocalization despite any potential differences in subcellular distribution. Previous work from our lab and others has validated that eGFP expression in this reporter strain faithfully mirrors endogenous PLP1 expression within the enteric and central nervous systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. In adult Plp1-eGFP mice, we found that mucosal glia diverged sharply in terms of marker expression based on their location along the crypt-villus axis. While the majority of villus <italic>Plp1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed GFAP, virtually none of the crypt-associated <italic>Plp1<sup>+</sup></italic> cells did so (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>). With rare exceptions in some villi, GFAP-immunoreactive cells that did not express <italic>Plp1</italic> were largely undetectable. Together, these observations indicate that <italic>Plp1</italic> expression broadly marks enteric glia in mouse and human tissues and is among the most sensitive and specific markers for glia in the gut mucosa.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Genetic depletion of enteric glia causes muted and region-specific changes in the intestinal transcriptome</title>
<p>To determine what aspects of intestinal homeostasis enteric glia are essential for <italic>in vivo</italic>, we took an unbiased approach. We examined changes in gene expression that occur upon glial loss in three different intestinal regions: proximal small intestine (duodenum), distal small intestine (ileum), and the large intestine (colon). We depleted the cells by administration of tamoxifen to young adult Plp1<sup>CreER</sup> Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup> mice, which we previously showed exhibit loss of the majority of S100B- and SOX10-expressing enteric glia, including 90% of mucosal glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. In this model, glia are lost within 5 days of tamoxifen induction (5dpt) and remain stably depleted through 14dpt; notably female, but not male, mice have intestinal dysmotility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. To facilitate detection of direct effects of glia rather than indirect effects related to dysmotility, we isolated intestinal segments from male Plp1<sup>CreER</sup> Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup> mice and Cre-negative Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup> littermate controls at 11dpt and performed bulk RNA-sequencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Surprisingly, there were minimal changes observed in the transcriptome in all 3 regions of the intestine though the mice exhibited robust depletion of S100B<sup>+</sup> glia by IHC. In the duodenum and ileum, differential gene expression analysis by DESeq2 revealed no genes that reached the standard threshold for statistical significance of p<sub>adj</sub>&lt;0.05 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>).

These results suggest that acute depletion of enteric glia in male mice has limited effects on the intestinal transcriptome.</p>

<p>Enteric glia represent a relatively small proportion of cells in the intestine. Reasoning that transcriptional changes resulting from the biological effects of enteric glial loss might be muted in magnitude but consistent along the length of the intestine, we identified genes differentially expressed in Cre<sup>-</sup> (controls) compared to Cre<sup>+</sup> (glial-ablated) mice using a more lenient significance threshold of p&lt;0.05 and then performed DiVenn analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>] to identify changes that were shared across the duodenum, ileum, and colon. Most genes that were differentially expressed were highly specific to one region of the intestine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). While 331, 516, and 916 genes were changed uniquely in duodenum, ileum, and colon, respectively, only 16 to 29 genes were shared between pairs of tissues (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Remarkably, only two genes were differentially expressed between Cre<sup>-</sup> and Cre<sup>+</sup> mice in all three tissue regions (<italic>Igkv4-91</italic> and <italic>Ighv1-58</italic>), suggesting that enteric glia exert region-specific effects along the longitudinal axis of the intestine.</p>
<p>Focusing on the colon, which showed the most evidence of altered gene expression upon glial loss, we examined the expression of <italic>Lyz1</italic>, the top gene upregulated in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, Supp <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). LYZ1 is an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that is highly and relatively specifically expressed by Paneth cells in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) of colonic tissue isolated from independent cohorts of Plp1<sup>CreER</sup> Rosa26<sup>DTA/+</sup> mice confirmed upregulation of <italic>Lyz1</italic> in the colons of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. 4B</xref>). Reactome pathway analysis of differentially enriched genes in the colon also highlighted pathways characteristic of Paneth cells including defensins and other AMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. 4C</xref>). Paneth cells are not typically present in the healthy mouse colon and their ectopic appearance is considered a marker of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]– [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. To determine if glial depletion provoked the formation of ectopic Paneth cells, we performed IHC for LYZ1 and DEFA5, a second and independent marker of Paneth cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. Although both markers robustly labeled Paneth cells in the small intestine, no LYZ1- or DEFA5-immunoreactive epithelial cells were detected in the colons of either Cre<sup>-</sup> or Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supp. Fig. 4D</xref>). These data suggest that acute glial depletion causes transcriptional dysregulation in the colon linked to Paneth cell biology without evidence of ectopic Paneth cells or corresponding changes in proteins.</p>

<title>Glial depletion selectively alters Paneth cells in the small intestine</title>
<p>Previous studies have indicated that glia might be most important for epithelial homeostasis in the ileum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Although epithelial cells are well-represented in whole gut transcriptomes, there are many other abundant cell types such as immune cells that are also present. To investigate glial effects on epithelial cells more specifically, we mechanically isolated the ileal epithelium from glial-ablated and control mice at 11dpt and examined gene expression by RNA-Seq. DESeq2 and DiVenn analysis detected minimal overlap in the transcriptional changes observed in the whole ileum compared to the ileal epithelium, supporting the utility of focused epithelial analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>
<p>Most intestinal epithelial cells turn over every 3-5 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>] and thus the majority of cells represented in the epithelial transcriptome of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice would not have experienced glial interactions. Nevertheless, epithelial gene expression was similar in control and glial-ablated mice, mirroring the findings from whole tissue. No genes reached the p<sub>adj</sub>&lt;0.05 threshold of significance for differential expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5A-C</xref>).</p>
<p>The intestinal epithelium is composed of a diverse array of cells including absorptive enterocytes, Lgr5<sup>+</sup> stem cells, and various secretory cell types (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). To determine if glial depletion selectively affected any of these cell types, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) using cell-type specific signatures obtained from a published scRNAseq study (Supplementary Table 1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]). Several of these signatures, most significantly that of Paneth cells (p&lt;0.001, FDR &lt;0.001), were enriched in the transcriptional profile of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5D</xref>). An independent GSEA using curated cell signatures derived from bulk RNASeq studies (Supplementary Table 2) also showed an enrichment of the Paneth cell program (p&lt;0.001, FDR &lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supp. Fig. 5E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>The observed enrichment of Paneth or other secretory cell signatures could be a result of altered differentiation and/or survival. Immunostaining for molecular markers of Paneth, Lgr5<sup>+</sup>, goblet, enteroendocrine, and microfold (M) cells, however, revealed no difference in their densities in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice compared to Cre<sup>-</sup> littermates (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>). In glial-ablated mice, all these cell types also appeared grossly normal, except for Paneth cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Paneth cells are highly secretory cells located at the crypt base that are responsible for production and release of the bulk of small intestinal AMPs, such as LYZ1 and α-defensins, which are crucial for homeostatic regulation of the microbiome and innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>].</p>

<p>Labeling Paneth cell granules with the fucose-specific lectin UEA-1, revealed that many Paneth cells in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice had heterogenous secretory granules, some of which appeared giant, fused, or dysmorphic (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). On ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy, Paneth cells in Cre<sup>-</sup> mice had typical morphology with a pyramidal shape, extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum, and relatively homogenous, electron-dense granules with haloes, which were oriented toward the apical surface of the cell (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, Paneth cells had normal rough endoplasmic reticulum, but many exhibited a globular morphology and contained more heterogeneous granules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). In contrast, neighboring intestinal stem cells in the crypt base, as well as other secretory cell types such as enteroendocrine cells and goblet cells appeared no different in Cre<sup>-</sup> and Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (Supp. Fig 6). In sum, glial depletion did not provoke major shifts in small intestinal epithelial gene expression or cell composition but caused upregulation of Paneth cell genes associated with specific morphological changes that were highly specific to this cell type.</p>

<title>Glial depletion impairs Paneth cell secretory activity</title>
<p>Paneth cells secrete their granules both constitutively and in response to various stimuli, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and cholinergic agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. At the level of individual cells, disruption of this secretory activity can manifest as accumulation and/or fusion of their secretory granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. The abnormal granule appearance in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice suggested that glial depletion might compromise Paneth cell secretion. Consistent with this possibility, the “extracellular” and “secretory” cellular compartments were most enriched in pathway analysis of Paneth cell genes that were changed in glial-depleted mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Paneth cell secretion has often been measured in preparations of mechanically isolated epithelial crypts or enteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. These preparations, however, are denervated and lack key neighboring cells including glia. To enable measurement of Paneth cell secretion in a more native environment, we developed an explant-based activity assay to measure luminal lysozyme secretion (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Supporting this assay’s specificity for Paneth cell-derived lysozyme, pre-treatment of mice with dithizone, a zinc chelator known to selectively deplete Paneth cell granules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], reduced detectable lysozyme activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Utilizing this assay, we found that small intestinal explants from Cre<sup>+</sup> mice secreted less active lysozyme than those from Cre<sup>-</sup> controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>), indicating that glial loss disrupts Paneth cell secretion.</p>

In the normal intestine, Paneth cells are loaded with secretory granules containing LYZ1 that are released into the gut lumen in response to acetylcholine (ACh) and other signals to regulate microbial composition. Upon glial depletion, Paneth cell secretion is disrupted leading to dysmorphic granules, diminished LYZ1 secretion, and altered fecal microbial composition. This occurs without a change in Paneth cell number, loss of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor expression, or denervation of the cholinergic fibers that normally surround epithelial crypts.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 3 (mAChR3) is the major neurotransmitter receptor expressed by Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp. Fig. 7A-B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Its expression level in the epithelium was unchanged by glial loss (log2FC = 0.104762356, p-value = 0.6474, p<italic><sub>adj</sub></italic> = 0.9999). In line with this observation, Paneth cells in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice remained capable of degranulation in response to the cholinergic agonist, carbachol, and secreted similar levels of lysozyme upon carbachol stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp. Fig. 7C-D</xref>). Thus, Paneth cells in mice lacking enteric glia exhibit morphological and functional evidence of diminished secretory function at baseline but remain competent to respond to at least some stimuli.</p>
<p>Baseline Paneth cell secretion in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice could be diminished if glia are necessary for tonic Paneth cell stimulation. In the skin, another critical barrier tissue, glia are essential for the maintenance of nerve terminals, and glial depletion causes rapid and dramatic denervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. To determine if enteric glial depletion similarly causes intestinal epithelial denervation that might result in decreased Paneth cell stimulation, we characterized crypt-associated neuronal fibers in Cre<sup>+</sup> and Cre<sup>-</sup> mice. Overall, the density of crypt innervation was no different in the two groups of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp Fig. 7E</xref>). Many types of intrinsic and extrinsic neurons innervate the intestinal epithelium. We found that most nerve fibers surrounding crypts are from cholinergic neurons and these fibers tightly associate with enteric glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp. Fig. 7F-G</xref>). Given that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are among the few neurotransmitter receptors expressed by Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp. Fig. 7A-B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], cholinergic neurons are likely the ones most relevant to Paneth cell function. To test whether these neurons are altered by glial depletion, we assessed vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) immunoreactivity in Cre<sup>-</sup> and Cre<sup>+</sup> mice. We observed no difference in the presentation of cholinergic nerve terminals that surround epithelial crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supp. Fig. 7H</xref>). These observations establish that glia are not required to maintain epithelial innervation in the intestine and that Paneth cell defects in glial-depleted mice do not result from loss of cholinergic innervation.</p>

Bacterial 16S rRNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed no difference in the average distance between bacteria and intestinal crypts in Cre<sup>-</sup> and Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supp. Fig. 8A</xref>) indicating that glial depletion does not provoke microbial invasion into crypts. To determine if enteric glial loss alters gut microbiome composition, we performed 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing of fecal pellets from Cre<sup>-</sup> and Cre<sup>+</sup> mice at baseline (0dpt) and after glial loss (11dpt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supp. Fig. 8B</xref>). Both ⍺- and β-diversity were altered by glial depletion at 11dpt in male and female mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D-E</xref>). β-diversity analysis, in particular, revealed clustering of samples by genotype at 11dpt (p=0.003), which explained a significant proportion of the inter-sample variance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.25679, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).</p>
<p>Paneth cell secretions can influence the abundance of specific members of the gut microbiome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>].

At the species level, the abundance of several taxa was altered in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice relative to Cre<sup>-</sup> controls at 11dpt (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>).

<p>Enteric glia secrete factors that influence intestinal epithelial cell properties <italic>in vitro</italic>, but it has remained unclear what, if any, essential roles these cells play in regulating epithelial functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Enteric glial loss, however, does cause dysregulation of Paneth cell gene expression that is associated with morphological disruption of Paneth cells, diminished lysozyme secretion, and altered gut microbial composition. Together, these observations support a working model in which glia are necessary for Paneth cell secretion of proteins that modulate the composition of the gut microbiome, but unlike in the skin, are not required for maintaining epithelial innervation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>Disruption of mucosal glia provokes muted and region-specific transcriptional changes in the intestine</title>
<p>Comparing expression of the four molecular markers used most commonly to label enteric glia, we found that SOX10 and PLP1 were the most cell type-specific for glia in the mucosa, with little to no non-glial expression in healthy or inflamed states in both mouse and human tissues. In contrast, S100B was detectable in a subset of immune cells, while GFAP was variably expressed in the mouse mucosa and largely undetectable in human mucosal glia at the transcript and protein levels. Having identified PLP1 as the molecular marker most widely expressed by enteric glia adjacent to the epithelial layer, we utilized its promoter to probe their functional significance in adult mice using an unbiased approach. Transcriptional profiling of three different intestinal regions, quantification of cell type composition, and assessment of the histological and ultrastructural presentation of various epithelial subtypes all indicated that genetic depletion of enteric glia does not result in broad changes to the intestinal epithelium.</p>
<p>Our observations are contrary to some reports of the effects of <italic>Gfap</italic><sup>+</sup> cell depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>], but they are consistent with many other studies that did not uncover overt epithelial disruption when: (i) utilizing the <italic>Plp1</italic> or <italic>Sox10</italic> promoters to disrupt glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], (ii) targeting <italic>Gfap<sup>+</sup></italic> cells in some cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], or (iii) administering chemical gliotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. <italic>Gfap</italic> is often used as a marker of reactive glia in the central nervous system in the context of injury or disease. In the intestinal mucosa of human subjects with small intestinal IBD, however, <italic>GFAP</italic> expression appeared most robust in non-glial cells, at least at the transcriptional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Experimental models that employ the <italic>Gfap</italic> promoter to disrupt enteric glia would thus presumably also affect these non-glial cells, which may explain the dramatic epithelial phenotypes reported in some previous studies. Although glia can secrete a variety of factors that modulate epithelial proliferation and barrier integrity <italic>in vitro</italic>, they do not seem essential for these functions <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may indicate the existence of redundant mechanisms to preserve these fundamental epithelial functions <italic>in vivo</italic> and/or that glial-epithelial interactions are more consequential in the context of pathophysiology than normal physiology.</p>
<p>The GI tract exhibits functional, cellular, and molecular specializations along its longitudinal axis. The distinct transcriptional changes resulting from the ablation of PLP1<sup>+</sup> cells along this axis hint at a regional specialization of enteric glia. Consistent with this possibility, enteric glia have been shown to regulate colonic but not small intestinal GI motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], control secretomotor responses in the large intestine but not the upper GI tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], and exert different immunomodulatory roles in the small and large intestines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. The region-specific functions of enteric glia as well as the mechanisms underlying this specialization will be informative to explore.</p>
<p>A limitation of our study and all the others to date is the lack of enteric glial-specific molecular markers and genetic promoters. All available tools to label and manipulate enteric glia also target glia in the rest of the nervous system, making it challenging to isolate their functional significance <italic>in vivo</italic> and shortening experimental timeframes. Future studies utilizing viral or intersectional genetic approaches to target enteric glia more selectively may enable a better understanding of the consequences of long-term glial disruption.</p>

<title>Enteric glia as putative regulators of Paneth cells</title>
<p>Genetic depletion of enteric glia in adult mice provoked selective transcriptional, morphological, and ultrastructural disruption of Paneth cells, a highly secretory cell type in the small intestinal epithelium that is important for regulation of microbial ecology and innate host defense. Although the close physical association between enteric glia and small intestinal crypts in which Paneth cells reside is well known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>], to our knowledge this is the first study linking enteric glia and Paneth cell biology. Loss of PLP1<sup>+</sup> enteric glia did not affect Paneth cell number but caused many of them to lose their typical morphologies and altered the appearance of their secretory granules. These morphological changes were associated with reduced luminal secretion of lysozyme, one of the most abundant AMPs produced by Paneth cells.</p>
<p>Morphologic changes in Paneth cells, similar to those we observed in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, have been reported in studies where cholinergic signaling is blocked or vagal innervation to the intestine is severed. For example, the cholinergic antagonist atropine triggers accumulation and enlargement of Paneth cell secretory granules in mice and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Activation or inhibition of cholinergic signaling to Paneth cells has also been shown to increase or decrease their secretory activity, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. We found that Paneth cells in glial-depleted mice remained competent to respond to cholinergic stimulation. Furthermore, unlike in the skin, glial depletion did not cause denervation. Cholinergic terminals were still present in close proximity to Paneth cells in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice. These observations suggest that while the infrastructure for neuroepithelial signaling remains intact in the intestines of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, neurotransmission across this interface may be compromised in the absence of glia.</p>
<p>An alternative mechanism for glial regulation of Paneth cells is through effects on autophagy, a process important for Paneth cell secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]–[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Autophagy-related pathways were not transcriptionally enriched in glia-deficient mice, but glial-derived signals could modulate secretory autophagy in Paneth cells indirectly. For instance, Paneth cells express a receptor for IL-22, a cytokine whose production is stimulated by neurotrophic factors secreted by enteric glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. IL-22 promotes Paneth cell maturation and can license the cells for secretory autophagy in the context of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. A third potential mechanism is through direct ligand-receptor interactions. Paneth cell development and function are regulated by secreted WNT proteins, which are expressed by subpopulations of enteric glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The Paneth cell phenotypes described in mouse models of disrupted WNT signaling differ from those in glial-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], but this possibility could be further explored.</p>
<p>Although Paneth cells are not typically found in the healthy mouse colon, differential gene expression analysis in glial-deficient mice revealed upregulation of transcripts characteristic of Paneth cells, including <italic>Lyz1</italic>. Although the magnitude of this upregulation was more significant than in the small intestine, the corresponding LYZ1 protein was undetectable by IHC, leaving it unclear which colonic cells upregulate <italic>Lyz1</italic> transcripts upon glial depletion. Colonic Paneth-like cells (PLCs) have been described in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>], [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. At least in humans, these PLCs can express <italic>LYZ1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. It will be informative to assess if colonic PLCs are dysregulated by enteric glial depletion similar to Paneth cells in the small intestine.</p>
<p>We found that genetic depletion of enteric glia was associated with altered fecal microbiome composition within days, including reduced abundance of <italic>L. murinus</italic> and <italic>L. animalis</italic> and increased abundance of several species of <italic>Bacteroidales</italic>. These changes seemed to occur irrespective of the effects of glial depletion on gut motility, because they were observed in both males with normal GI transit times and females with accelerated transit. In mice engineered to either lack or overexpress LYZ1, the fecal abundance of both <italic>L. murinus</italic> and <italic>L. animalis</italic> together drops or increases, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. Conversely, in ZnT2-deficient mice, which exhibit reduced lysozyme activity, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> is the only genus significantly increased in their feces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. The similarities between the shifts in microbial composition observed in these constitutive systems of Paneth cell disruption and our model of acute glial depletion support a functional link between the fecal microbial changes in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice and reduced LYZ1 secretion.</p>
<p>Overall, our results uncover a functional interaction between enteric glia and Paneth cells in the small intestine and establish a role for enteric glia in shaping gut microbial ecology. Given the strong genetic associations between Paneth cells and IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>], and the well-established involvement of the microbiome in a wide variety of human disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>], identifying the mechanisms underlying glial regulation of these secretory cells might reveal novel targets for tuning their activity for therapeutic benefit.</p>

<p>All samples were collected between 9AM and 12PM. Mice were euthanized, and the GI tract was dissected into sterile, ice-cold PBS. The luminal content was flushed out of the tissue; fat and mesentery were trimmed. 1cm fragments of duodenum, proximal ileum, and proximal colon were cut, immersed in TRIzol reagent (Thermofisher #15596026), homogenized, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. For the mechanical separation of ileal epithelium, 6cm of the most distal small intestine (ileum) was used. The tissue was cut longitudinally and cleaned in ice-cold 1xPBS such that any remaining fecal/luminal content was removed. The opened ileal tissue was placed in 10ml 5mM EDTA in sterile PBS, gently mixed, and incubated on ice in a horizontal position for 10min while ensuring its complete submersion in the EDTA solution. Halfway through, the tube was gently tilted twice to mix. Subsequently, the EDTA solution was decanted, and the tissue was washed with 10ml of sterile HBSS twice. To mechanically separate the epithelial fraction, the tissues were extended epithelium-side-up on a glass slide and the epithelial layers (villi first, followed by crypts) were separated using a bent 20G needle.

<p>This study presents <bold>important</bold> findings on the function of enteric glia expressing proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1+ glia). The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although the inclusion of additional data showing the mechanisms by which PLP1+ enteric glia acts on Paneth cells would have strengthened the study.

<p>The role of enteric glial cells in regulating intestinal mucosal functions at steady state has been a matter of debate in recent years. Enteric glial cell heterogeneity and related methodological differences likely underlie the contrasting findings obtained by different laboratories. Here, Prochera and colleagues used Plp1-CreERT2 driver mice to deplete the vast majority of enteric glia from the gut, and performed an elegant set of transcriptomic, microscopic and biochemical essays to examine the impact of enteric glia loss. It was found that enteric glia depletion has very limited effects on the transcriptome of gut cells 11 days after tamoxifen treatment (used to induce Diphtheria Toxin A expression in the majority of enteric glia including those present in the mucosa), and by extension - more specifically, has only minimal impact on cells of the intestinal mucosa. Interestingly, in the colon (where Paneth cells are not present) they did observe transcriptomic changes related to Paneth cell biology. Although no overt gene expression alterations were found in the small intestine - also not in Paneth cells - morphological, ultrastructural and functional changes were detected in the Paneth cells of enteric glia-depleted mice. In addition, and likely related to impaired Paneth cell secretory activity, enteric glia-depleted mice also show alterations in intestinal microbiota composition. This is an excellent study that convincingly demonstrates a role for enteric glia in supporting Paneth cells of the intestinal mucosa, suggesting that enteric glial cells shape host-microbiome interactions via the regulation of Paneth cell homeostasis.</p>

<p>This is an excellent and timely study from the Rao lab investigating the interactions of enteric glia with the intestinal epithelium. Two early studies in the late 90's and early 2000's had previously suggested that enteric glia play a pivotal role in control of the intestinal epithelial barrier, as their ablation using mouse models resulted in severe and fatal intestinal inflammation. However, it was later identified that these inflammatory effects could have been an indirect product of the transgenic mouse models used, rather than due to the depletion of enteric glia. In previous studies from this lab, the authors had identified expression of PLP1 in enteric glia, and its use in CRE driver lines to label and ablate enteric glia.</p>
<p>In the current paper, the authors carefully examine the role of enteric glia by first identifying that PLP1-creERT2 is the most useful driver to direct enteric glial ablation, in terms of the quantity of glial cells targeted, their proximity to the intestinal epithelium, and the relevance for human studies (GFAP expression is rather limited in human samples in comparison). They examined gene expression changes in different regions of the intestine using bulk RNA-seq following ablation of enteric glia by driving expression of diptheria toxin A (PLP1-creERT2;Rosa26-DTA). Alterations in gene expression were observed in different regions of the gut, with specific effects in different regions. Interestingly, while there were gene expression changes in the epithelium, there were limited changes to the proportions of different epithelial cell types identified using immunohistochemistry in control vs glial-ablated mice. The authors then focused on investigation of Paneth cells in the ileum, identifying changes in the ultrastructural morphology and lysozyme activity. In addition, they identified alterations in gut microbiome diversity. As Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides, the authors conclude that the changes in gut microbiome are due to enteric glia-mediated impacts on Paneth cell activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the study is excellent and delves into the different possible mechanisms of action, including investigation of changes in enteric cholinergic neurons innervating the intestinal crypts. The use of different CRE-drivers to target enteric glial cells has led to varying results in the past, and the authors should be commended on how they address this in the Discussion.</p>
<p>Comments on the latest version:</p>
<p>Thanks to the authors for addressing my concerns. The additional stratification of male vs female microbiome data was very helpful.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The role of enteric glial cells in regulating intestinal mucosal functions at a steady state has been a matter of debate in recent years. Enteric glial cell heterogeneity and related methodological differences likely underlie the contrasting findings obtained by different laboratories. Here, Prochera and colleagues used Plp1-CreERT2 driver mice to deplete the majority of enteric glia from the gut. They found that glial loss has very limited effects on the transcriptome of gut cells 11 days after tamoxifen treatment (used to induce DTA expression), and by extension - more specifically, has only minimal impact on cells of the intestinal mucosa. Interestingly, in the colon (where Paneth cells are not present) they did observe transcriptomic changes related to Paneth cell biology. Although no overt gene expression alterations were found in the small intestine - also not in Paneth cells - morphological, ultrastructural, and functional changes were detected in the Paneth cells of enteric glia-depleted mice. In addition, and possibly related to Paneth cell dysfunction, enteric glia-depleted mice also show alterations in intestinal microbiota composition.</p>
<p>In their analyses of enteric glia from existing single-cell transcriptomic data sets, it is stated that these come from 'non-diseased' humans. However, the data on the small intestine is obtained from children with functional gastrointestinal disorders (Zheng 2023). Data on colonic enteric glia was obtained from colorectal cancer patients (Lee 2020). Although here the cells were isolated from non-malignant regions, saying that the large intestines of these patients are nondiseased is probably an overstatement.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the Zheng et al. dataset, “functional GI disorders” refers to biopsies from children that do not have any histopathologic evidence of digestive disease. The children do, however, have at least one GI symptom that prompted a diagnostic endoscopy with biopsies, leading to the designation of “functional” disorder. Given that diagnostic endoscopies are invasive procedures that necessitate anesthesia, obtaining biopsies from asymptomatic children without any clinical indication would not be allowable per most institutional review boards, leading the authors of that study to use these samples as a control group. We had thus used the “non-diseased” label to encompass these samples as well as those from the unaffected regions of large intestine from colorectal cancer patients. We now recognize, however, that this label could be misleading, so we have revised the Results and Figure Legends to more accurately reflect details of control tissue origin for this and the Lee <italic>et al</italic>. (2020) datasets. Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have removed the term “non-diseased”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another existing dataset including human mucosal enteric glia of healthy subjects is presented in Smillie et al (2019). It would be interesting to see how the current findings relate to the data from Smillie et al.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now added an analysis of the Smillie <italic>et al</italic>. dataset in Supp. Fig. 1B. This dataset derives from colonic mucosal biopsies from 12 healthy adults (8480 stromal cells) and 18 adults with ulcerative colitis (10,245 stromal cells from inflamed bowel segments and 13,147 from uninflamed), all between the ages of 20-77 years. These data show that <italic>SOX10, PLP1</italic>, and <italic>S100B</italic> are selectively expressed within the putative glial cluster from colonic mucosa of both healthy adults and individuals with ulcerative colitis, whereas GFAP is not detected (Supp. Fig. 1B). These observations are consistent with our observations from the two other human datasets already included in our manuscript in Fig. 1 and Supp. Fig. 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The time between enteric glia depletion and analyses (mouse sacrifice) must be a crucial determinant of the type of effects, and the timing thereof. In the current study 11 days after tamoxifen treatment was chosen as the time point for analyses, which is consistent with earlier work by the lab using the same model (Rao et al 2017). What would happen when they wait longer than 11 days after tamoxifen treatment? Data, not necessarily for all parameters, on later time points would strengthen the manuscript significantly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an excellent question, particularly given the longer-lived nature of Paneth cells relative to other epithelial cell types. As detailed in our previous study, Cre<sup>+</sup> mice in the Plp1CreER-DTA model are well-appearing and indistinguishable from their Cre-negative control littermates through 11dpt. Unfortunately, a limitation of the model is that beyond 11dpt, Cre<sup>+</sup> mice become anorexic, lose body weight, and have signs of neurologic debility such as hindlimb weakness and uncoordinated gait. These deficits are overt by 14dpt and likely due to targeting Plp1<sup>+</sup> glia outside the gut, such as Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes (as described in another study which used a similar model to study demyelination in the central nervous system, PMID: 20851998). Given these CNS effects and that starvation is well known to affect Paneth cell phenotypes (PMIDs: 1167179, 21986443), we elected not to examine timepoints beyond 11dpt. Technological advances that enable more selective cell depletion will allow study of chronic effects of enteric glial loss in the future.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors found transcriptional dysregulation related to Paneth cell biology in the colon, where Paneth cells are normally not present. Given the bulk RNA sequencing approach, the cellular identity in which this shift is taking place cannot be determined. However, it would be useful if the authors could speculate on which colonic cell type they reckon this is happening in.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we have added a paragraph to the Discussion addressing one plausible hypothesis to explain this observation. Paneth-like cells have been described in the large intestine and are known, particularly in humans, to express markers typical of Paneth cells, such as lysozyme and defensins (PMID: 27573849, 31753849). These cells could represent the source of the Paneth cell-like transcriptional signature observed in our model. Alternatively, ectopic expression of Paneth cell-associated genes in the colon has been documented in certain pathological conditions, such as colorectal cancer models (e.g., PMID: 15059925), where changes in the local microenvironment appear to trigger activation of Paneth cell genes. Similar, yet unidentified changes in our model could potentially underlie the transcriptional dysregulation related to Paneth cell biology observed here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>On the other hand, enteric glia depletion was found to affect Paneth cells structurally and functionally in the small intestine, where transcriptional changes were initially not identified. Only when performing GSEA with the in silico help of cell type-specific gene profiles, differences in Paneth cell transcriptional programs in the small intestine were uncovered. A comment on this discrepancy would be helpful, especially for the non-bioinformatician readers among us.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Standard differential gene expression analysis (DEG) of the effects of glial loss revealed significant differences only in the colon, and even then, only a handful of genes were changed. These changes were not accompanied by corresponding changes at the protein level, at least as detectable by IHC. In the small intestine, there were no significant differences by standard DEG thresholds. Unlike DEG, gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA), provides a significance value based on whether there is a higher than chance number of genes that are changing in a uniform direction without consideration for the significance of the magnitude of change. Therefore, the GSEA detected that a significant number of genes in the curated Paneth cell gene list exhibited a positive fold change difference in the bulk RNA sequencing data. This prompted us to examine Paneth cells and other epithelial cell types in more detail by IHC, functional and ultrastructural analyses, which all converged on the observation that Paneth cells were relatively selectively disrupted in the epithelium of glial depleted mice.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>From looking at Figure 3B it is clear that Paneth cells are not the only epithelial cell type affected (after less stringent in silico analyses) by enteric glial cell depletion. Although the authors show that this does not translate into ultrastructural or numerical changes of most of these cell types, this makes one wonder how specific the enteric glia - Paneth cell link is. Besides possible indirect crosstalk (via neurons), it is not clear if enteric glia more closely associate with Paneth cells as compared to these other cell types. Immunofluorescence stainings of some of these cells in the Plp1-GFP mice would be informative here.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Enteric glia have long been reported to closely associate with crypts, the sites of residence for Paneth cells and intestinal stem cells (PMID: 7043279, 16423922). Consistent with these reports, our observations from Plp1-eGFP mice confirm that enteric glia often appose the entire base of small intestinal crypts (see Author response image 1 below). Given this reproducible observation, we did not pursue histological quantification to compare preferential glial apposition to specific epithelial cell types. Enteric glia have been reported to form close associations with enteroendocrine cells as well (PMID: 24587096), which is not surprising because these cells are highly innervated; however, our analyses did not reveal changes in the abundance and morphology of these cells or other epithelial cell types.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors mention IL-22 as a possible link, but do Paneth cells express receptors for transmitters commonly released by enteric glia? Maybe they can have a look at putative cell-cell interactions by mapping ligand-receptor pairs in the scRNAseq datasets they used.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Beyond IL-22R, it is established that Paneth cells express receptors for secreted WNT proteins, which enteric glia have been shown to express (PMID: 34727519). This interaction could potentially be involved in glial regulation of Paneth cells, but mice lacking glia do not exhibit the same phenotypes as mouse models with disrupted WNT signaling. For example, animals lacking the WNT receptor Frizzled-5 in Paneth cells have mislocalization of Paneth cells to the villi (PMID: 15778706), which we do not readily observe in Plp1CreER-DTA mice. Furthermore, while mucosal enteric glia have been proposed as a source of WNT ligands, this role has been specifically attributed to GFAP+ cells, which may or may not be glia in the mucosa. Moreover, several other cell types in the mucosa around crypts have also been identified as significant sources of WNT ligands (PMID: 16083717, 22922422). We have now added these ideas to the Discussion.</p>
<p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion to use bioinformatics to explore other potential ligand-receptor pairings that might underlie glial regulation of Paneth cells, we conducted a CellPhoneDB analysis focused on these two cell types with a collaborator. This analysis highlighted a handful of potential ligand-receptor interactions, but none of these pathways could be clearly linked to the observed Paneth cell phenotype. Furthermore, virtually all the candidate interactions were not specific to glia, with the candidate ligands expressed by many other more abundant cell types in the mucosa. For these reasons, we decided not to include this analysis in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Previously the authors showed that enteric glia regulation of intestinal motility is sex-dependent (Rao et al 2017). While enteric glia depletion caused dysmotility in female mice, it did not affect motility in males. For this reason, most experiments in the current study were conducted in male mice only. However, for the experiments focusing on the effect of enteric glia depletion on hostmicrobiome interactions and intestinal microbiota composition both male and female mice were used. In Figure 8A male and female mice are distinctly depicted but this was not done for Figure 8C. Separate characterization of the microbiome of male and female mice would have helped to figure out how much intestinal dysmotility (in females) contributes to the effect on gut microbial composition. This is an important exercise to confirm that the effect on the microbiome is indeed a consequence of altered Paneth cell function, as suggested by the authors (in the results and discussion, and in the abstract).</p>

<p>In our microbiome analysis, we initially analyzed males and females separately but did not observe significant differences between the two sexes. Thus, we merged the data to increase the statistical power of the genotype comparisons. It was an oversight on our part to not label the datapoints by sex as we did for the other data in the manuscript. We have now revised the figures related to microbiome characterization (Fig. 5D-E and Supp. Fig. 8C) to indicate the sexes of the mice used. Stratifying the data by sex within-sample revealed no major sex-specific differences in microbiome diversity or enriched/depleted biomarkers in the core genotype-dependent observations.</p>

<p>In this context, it would also be interesting to compare the bulk sequencing data after enteric glia depletion between female and male mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our bulk sequencing analysis of the effects of glial loss was conducted in male mice only in order to assess the effects independent of colonic dysmotility, a phenotype observed only in female Plp1CreER-DTA animals (PMID: 28711628). Given that we found rather muted transcriptional changes in male mice, we chose not to perform subsequent transcriptional analyses in female mice, further reasoning that any changes identified would most likely be attributable to dysmotility rather than direct glial effects. Future studies focusing on sex differences in the small intestine, where motility in the Plp1CreER-DTA model is unaffected by glial loss, could provide additional insights, especially in light of the recently reported sex differences in the gene expression and activity levels of enteric glia in the myenteric plexus (PMID: 34593632, 38895433).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This is an excellent and timely study from the Rao lab investigating the interactions of enteric glia with the intestinal epithelium. Two early studies in the late 1990s and early 2000s had previously suggested that enteric glia play a pivotal role in control of the intestinal epithelial barrier, as their ablation using mouse models resulted in severe and fatal intestinal inflammation. However, it was later identified that these inflammatory effects could have been an indirect product of the transgenic mouse models used, rather than due to the depletion of enteric glia. In previous studies from this lab, the authors had identified expression of PLP1 in enteric glia, and its use in CRE driver lines to label and ablate enteric glia.</p>
<p>In the current paper, the authors carefully examine the role of enteric glia by first identifying that PLP1-creERT2 is the most useful driver to direct enteric glial ablation, in terms of the number of glial cells targeted, their proximity to the intestinal epithelium, and the relevance for human studies (GFAP expression is rather limited in human samples in comparison). They examined gene expression changes in different regions of the intestine using bulk RNA-seq following ablation of enteric glia by driving expression of diphtheria toxin A (PLP1-creERT2;Rosa26-DTA). Alterations in gene expression were observed in different regions of the gut, with specific effects in different regions. Interestingly, while there were gene expression changes in the epithelium, there were limited changes to the proportions of different epithelial cell types identified using immunohistochemistry in control vs glial-ablated mice. The authors then focused on the investigation of Paneth cells in the ileum, identifying changes in the ultrastructural morphology and lysozyme activity. In addition, they identified alterations in gut microbiome diversity. As Paneth cells secrete antimicrobial peptides, the authors conclude that the changes in gut microbiome are due to enteric glia-mediated impacts on Paneth cell activity.</p>
<p>Overall, the study is excellent and delves into the different possible mechanisms of action, including the investigation of changes in enteric cholinergic neurons innervating the intestinal crypts. The use of different CRE drivers to target enteric glial cells has led to varying results in the past, and the authors should be commended on how they address this in the Discussion.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I have a few minor comments:</p>
<p>Changes in bacterial diversity - the authors make a very compelling case that changes in the proportions of various intestinal microbiome species were impacted by the change in Paneth cell secretions resulting from the depletion of enteric glia. Another potential mechanism of action could be alterations in gut motility resulting from loss of enteric glia. It appears that faecal samples were collected from both male and female mice, and hence changes in colonic motility could be involved. This should be addressed in the Results and Discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that GI dysmotility could influence microbial composition. To address this, we initially analyzed microbiome data separately for male and female mice, because only female Plp1CreER-Rosa26DTA exhibit dysmotility. We found no significant sex-specific differences in microbiome composition, however, which suggested to us that dysmotility was unlikely to be the primary driver of the observed microbial changes. Based on these findings, we opted to combine data from male and female mice in our final microbiome analysis. We have now revised the Results, Discussion, and Methods sections to clarify this.</p>

<p>In this study, Prochera, et al. identify PLP1+ cells as the glia that most closely interact with the gut epithelium and show that genetic depletion of these PLP1+ glia in mice does not have major effects on the intestinal transcriptome or the cellular composition of the epithelium. Enteric glial loss, however, causes dysregulation of Paneth cell gene expression that is associated with morphological disruption of Paneth cells, diminished lysozyme secretion, and altered gut microbial composition.</p>
<p>Overall, the authors need to first prove whether the Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice system is viable.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In previous work, we discovered that the gene <italic>Plp1</italic> is broadly expressed by enteric glia and, within the mouse intestine, is quite specific to glial cells (PMID: 26119414). We characterized the Plp1CreER mouse line as a genetic tool in detail in this initial study. Then in a subsequent manuscript, we used Plp1CreER-DTA mice to genetically deplete enteric glia and study the consequences on epithelial barrier integrity, crypt cell proliferation, enteric neuronal health and gastrointestinal motility (PMID: 28711628). In this second study, we performed extensive validation of the Plp1CreER-DTA mouse model including detailed quantification of glial depletion in the small and large intestines across the myenteric, intramuscular and mucosa compartments by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of whole tissue segments to sample thousands of cells. We found that the majority of S100B<sup>+</sup>enteric glia were depleted within 5 days in both sexes, including more than 88% loss of mucosal glia, and that this loss was stable at 3 subsequent timepoints (7, 9 and 14 days post-tamoxifen induction of Cre activity). Glial loss was further confirmed by IHC for GFAP in the myenteric plexus, and by ultrastructural analysis of the small intestine to ensure cell depletion rather than simply loss of marker expression. Our group was the first to use this model to study enteric glia, and since then similar models and our key observations have been replicated by other groups (PMID: 33282743, 34550727). Thus, we consider this model to be well established.</p>

<p>RNA-sequencing and microbiome analyses are inherently quantitative (Figures 1A-B, Supp. Figure 1, Figure 2, Supp. Figure 4A, Figure 3A-B, Supp. Figure 5, Figure 5, and Supp. Figure 8C). Virtually all our other observations are also supported by quantitative analysis including analysis of mucosal glial markers (Fig. 1C-D), validation of Paneth cell transcript expression in the colon (Supp. Fig. 4B), measurement of epithelial cell type composition (Figure 3C, D), assessment of crypt innervation (Supp. Fig. 7E), and measurement of bacteria-to-crypt distance (Supp. Fig. 8A-B). The only observation that was not quantified was that of morphological abnormalities of Paneth cells. Given the inherently low sampling rate of EM studies, we felt that functional assays (explant secretion assays, effects on microbial composition) would be more meaningful for interrogation of a potential Paneth cell phenotype and thus elected to focus our quantitative analyses on those functional assays rather than further histological measurements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, the value of the paper would be enhanced if the significance of why the phenotype appeared in the large intestine rather than the small intestine when PLP1 is deficient for Paneth cells is clarified.</p>

<p>Major Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1)  Supplementary Figure 2; Cannot be evaluated without quantification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Supplemental Figure 2 shows qualitative IHC observations that were highly reproducible across all the subjects indicated for each marker and align well with the quantitative transcriptional data from human subjects shown in Figure 1 and Supplemental Figure 1. The DAB staining in Supplemental Figure 2 could theoretically be quantified by staining intensity or counting cell number but we felt this would be arbitrary and difficult to achieve in a meaningful way with a single chromogen. The DAB reaction is associated with a non-linear relationship between amount of an antigen and staining intensity, especially at higher levels (PMID: 16978204, 19575836), because it is not a direct conjugate and relies upon an enzymatic reaction. The amplification step required for DAB staining using Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) introduces variability, particularly with cytoplasmic markers and in complex tissue structures like the plexuses, where proteins are distributed throughout the glial network. Counting cell number also would not lead to fair comparisons between markers because while SOX10 shows a clear nuclear signal suitable for quantification, the other markers are all membrane or cytoplasmic proteins, making accurate counting nearly impossible in dense ganglia. Finally, quantifying cell number in 5-micron paraffin sections which have major differences in sampling from one subject to another in terms of presence of ganglia and ganglia size, would also make this prone to inaccuracy. Given these limitations and the robust qualitative data we have shown that aligns completely with the quantitative transcriptional analyses, we respectfully disagree with the reviewer’s comment.</p>

<p>(2) Figure 2A; Is Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice system established correctly? S100B immunohistology picture is not clear. A similar study is needed for female Plp1CreER Rosa26DTA/+ mice. What is the justification for setting 5 dpt, 11 dpt? Any consideration of changes to organs other than the intestine? Wouldn't it be clearer to introduce Organoid technology?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see the detailed response to first comment. The Plp1CreER- DTA mouse model is well-established and there are detailed experimental justifications for the 5 and 11dpt timepoints as well as the focus on male mice for RNA-sequencing analyses. As described in our previous work (PMID: 28711628), Plp1<sup>+</sup> cells throughout the animal would be affected, including Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes, which is why we limit our analyses to the first 11dpt, when there are fewer confounding variables. The S100B immunohistology picture in Figure 2A was intended to be a schematic graphical representation of the paradigm of glial loss, not a data figure. Extensive validation of glial loss in this model was shown in our previous study. To improve clarity, we have now enlarged the picture for the reader.</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestion to use organoid technology, standard intestinal epithelial organoids do not incorporate any elements of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which is the focus of this study. Some groups have made heroic efforts to incorporate ENS components into intestinal organoids by introducing neural crest progenitor cells and grafting the hybrid organoids under the renal capsule in mice (example PMID: 27869805); but these studies are still limited, and it remains unclear how much the preparations reflect functional, natively innervated intestine. Our ex vivo explant assay preserves native ENS-epithelial interactions, providing a more effective model for studying the relationship between enteric glia and Paneth cells.</p>

<p>(3) Figure 2B; Need an explanation for the 5 genes that were altered in the colon. Five genes should be evaluated by RT-qPCR. Why was there a lack of change in the duodenum and ileum?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>While RT-qPCR validation of differentially expressed genes was once common practice, especially with microarray data, there is now robust evidence for strong correlations between RNA sequencing (RNAseq) results and RT-qPCR measurements of gene expression (PMID: 26208977, 28484260). Notably Rajkumar et al. (PMID: 26208977) demonstrated that RNAseq analyzed using DESeq2 (a method which we employed in our study), yields highly accurate results. They reported a 0% false positive rate and a 100% positive predictive value for DESeq2, rendering additional RT-qPCR validation redundant. We only performed RT-qPCR analysis of colonic <italic>Lyz1</italic> expression because our IHC analyses failed to show any ectopic expression of the protein in the colons of Cre<sup>+</sup> mice (Supp. Figure 4D) and we wished to validate the gene expression change seen by RNAseq in an independent cohort to be absolutely sure. Per the detailed response to Reviewer 1, we do not have a mechanistic explanation for why there is selective transcriptional induction of Paneth cell-related genes in the colon upon glial depletion. We have elaborated on this in the revised Discussion.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment here and strived very hard to add quantification of the Paneth cell granule phenotype seen by light microscopy to our study. IHC for LYZ1 is typically the gold standard for assessment of Paneth cell granules by light microscopy. In our hands, however, we encountered persistent issues with IHC for this protein. While it very reproducibly detected Paneth cells with sufficient specificity to enable quantification of number of immunoreactive cells (as shown in Figure 3C), it did not enable quantification of granule morphology because it consistently exhibited diffuse staining throughout the cell (see Author response image 2 below). This appearance persisted regardless of extensive titration of fixation parameters (time, temperature, fixative supplier, 10% NBF vs 4% PFA), tissue preparation (fixed as intact tubes versus “swiss-rolls”), permeabilization conditions, operator, antibody used, and other variables. Upon subsequently surveying the literature, it seems that similar diffuse staining patterns for LYZ1 have been observed by numerous other groups and this may simply be an experimental limitation.</p>

<p>As an alternative approach to detecting Paneth cell granules, we tried UEA-I lectin staining. This labeling approach was sufficient to reveal qualitative differences in Paneth granule morphology in Cre<sup>+</sup> mice, as shown in Fig. 4A. However, the transient nature of this lectin labeling made it very difficult to systematically quantify granule morphology in a blinded manner, as we did for our other analyses. Given these persistent challenges, we decided to present qualitative data on morphology by two orthogonal approaches (UEA-I staining by light microscopy and ultrastructure by EM) and focus on functional read-outs for quantitative analyses (explant secretion assays and microbiome analyses). In aggregate, we feel that these data provide robust and complementary evidence of the observed phenotype from independent experimental approaches.</p>
