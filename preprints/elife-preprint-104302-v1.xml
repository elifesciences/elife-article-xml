<title>Abstract</title><p>Two anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) nanobodies, V<sub>H</sub>H123 specific for mouse TfR and V<sub>H</sub>H188 specific for human TfR (huTfR) were used to track transplants non-invasively by PET/CT in mouse models, without the need for genetic modification of the transferred cells. We provide a comparison of the specificity and kinetics of the PET signals acquired when using nanobodies radiolabeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu and <sup>18</sup>F. We used a knock-in mouse that expresses a TfR with a human ectodomain (huTfR <sup>+/+</sup>) as a source of transplants into C57BL/6 recipients and show that V<sub>H</sub>H188 detects such transplants by PET/CT. Conversely, C57BL/6 transplants into huTfR <sup>+/+</sup> recipients can be imaged with V<sub>H</sub>H123. In C57B/6 mice impregnated by huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> males we saw an intense V<sub>H</sub>H188 signal in the placenta showing that TfR-specific V<sub>H</sub>Hs accumulate at the placental barrier but do not enter the fetal tissue. The model presented here can be used to track many transplanted cell types by PET/CT, provided cells express TfR, as is typically the case for proliferating cells such as tumor lines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Non-invasive tracking of specific cell types <italic>in vivo</italic> is a desirable goal in many fields of biomedical research, particularly as it pertains to immunology and cancer. Knowledge of the biodistribution of immune cells and/or tumor cells in a disease model is essential to monitor therapeutic interventions. Real-time non-invasive <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging may be achieved by several methods, each with their strengths and limitations. Fluorescence and luminescence-based methods suffer from absorbance and dispersal of emitted light <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, which limits the depth at which images of acceptable resolution can be obtained. Fluorescence-based methods in conjunction with multi-photon microscopy provide cellular resolution, but usually require invasive surgery to gain access to the cells of interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Methods that rely on the use of radio-isotopes, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) do not suffer those drawbacks. While SPECT and PET lack the resolution of optical microscopy, they have the advantage of being non-invasive, quantitative and enabling whole-body imaging in small animals at a resolution of ∼1 mm, or a 1 microliter volume, for PET <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and even lower than 1 mm for SPECT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. These methods are finding increasing use in the field of tumor immunology, as they can provide a whole-body image, unlike other approaches.</p>
<p>Current PET/CT cell tracing methods require the use of a cell-specific tracer. This typically relies on the detection of an endogenous surface marker that is specific for the cells of interest <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, or by genetically engineering cells of interest to enable their visualization, for example through expression of a viral kinase of unique specificity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, or by introduction of a surface marker that can be selectively visualized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>V<sub>H</sub>Hs, also termed nanobodies, are enjoying increasing use for the generation of immuno-PET tracers that yield images of a quality superior to what is achieved using regular, intact immunoglobulins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Nanobodies are the recombinantly expressed variable fragments (V<sub>H</sub>) of heavy chain-only immunoglobulins produced by camelids <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Their small size (∼15 kDa), superior tissue penetration, specificity, affinity and much shorter circulatory half-life compared to intact immunoglobulins make nanobodies excellent tracers for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. We here apply nanobodies specific for the transferrin receptor to track the fate of transplanted cells non-invasively.</p>
<p>The transferrin receptor (TfR; CD71; encoded by <italic>Tfrc</italic>) is a homodimeric type-II transmembrane protein that is near-ubiquitously expressed, in particular on proliferating cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. This includes many tumor cells with some variability depending on the tumor type and differentiation status <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The TfR binds to and endocytoses iron (Fe<sup>+++</sup>)-loaded transferrin (Tf). Tf remains bound to the TfR in endosomal compartments, where the resident low pH releases the Fe<sup>+++</sup> cargo and thus converts Tf into apoTf, which remains TfR-bound at endosomal pH. From there, TfR-bound apoTf returns to the cell surface, where the TfR releases apoTf at neutral pH. TfR is also expressed by endothelial cells that line the blood-brain barrier (BBB) for delivery of Fe<sup>+++</sup>-loaded transferrin to the central nervous system by transcytosis. The nanobodies used in this study bind TfR and can traverse the BBB <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Mouse embryos critically depend on an iron supply in the form of Tf captured from the maternal circulation, delivered to the embryo via the TfR expressed on the syncytiotrophoblast-I <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Whether the small size of nanobodies allows them -by analogy with the BBB-to traverse the placenta and reach the embryo has not been explored.</p>
<p>We use two nanobodies: V<sub>H</sub>H123 (also termed Nb62 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>) and V<sub>H</sub>H188, which recognize the murine TfR and the human TfR (huTfR), respectively. We use these V<sub>H</sub>Hs together with a knock-in mouse model that expresses a TfR with a human TfR ectodomain (huTfR <sup>+/+</sup>) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> . The specificity of each nanobody for the respective TfR and the availability of huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice as a source of primary cells allows us to track different cell types in a transplant setting. V<sub>H</sub>H123 allows the detection of cells of mouse origin, such as bone marrow progenitors or tumor cells, transplanted into huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice. Conversely, we use V<sub>H</sub>H188 to track primary cells from huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice after transfer into wild-type mice. Pregnancy represents a unique model akin to a transplant. We report the first immuno-PET study on localization of the TfR in mouse embryos in live mice.</p>
<p>We find that <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu, ligated to these TfR-specific V<sub>H</sub>Hs by non-covalent chelation, are released from the imaging agent upon binding the TfR, due to internalization and exposure to low endosomal pH. The release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu from imaging agents are factors to consider when using these over extended periods of time. Covalent modification of V<sub>H</sub>Hs with <sup>18</sup>F avoids the release of free radioisotope, but the short half-life of <sup>18</sup>F limits the observation window to &lt;12 hours. We compare the use of three commonly used positron-emitting isotopes (<sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu and <sup>18</sup>F) and offer a suite of tools to track many cell types in mice, without the requirement for specific cell markers or genome-editing. At most, crossing of a mouse model of interest with the huTfr<sup>+/+</sup> mouse line would be required (deposited at Jackson laboratories, strain 038212).</p>

<title>V<sub>H</sub>H123 binds mouse TfR and V<sub>H</sub>H188 binds human(ized) TfR <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We characterized the specificity of V<sub>H</sub>H123 (anti-mouse TfR) and V<sub>H</sub>H188 (anti-human TfR) by biochemical methods and by PET/CT. We confirmed the specificity of each anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H for its target by immunoprecipitation from lysates of HEK293 (human) or B16.F10 (mouse) cell lines. We show that both V<sub>H</sub>Hs bind only to the appropriate TfR, with no obvious cross-reactivity to other surface-expressed proteins by immunoblot, LC/MSMS analysis of immunoprecipitates, SDS-PAGE of <sup>35</sup>S-labelled proteins and flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> ;<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>For PET experiments we attached a deferoxamine (DFO)-azide moiety to each V<sub>H</sub>H via a sortase A-catalyzed transpeptidation reaction <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The V<sub>H</sub>H-DFO-azide adducts were then modified with dibenzocyclooctyne-polyethyleneglycol<sub>20kDa</sub> (DBCO-PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>) using click chemistry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>, <xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). The PEG<sub>20kDa</sub> moiety, hereafter referred to as ‘PEG’, serves to extend the half-life of the V<sub>H</sub>H in the circulation and decreases non-specific kidney uptake <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. The PEG-DFO-modified V<sub>H</sub>Hs were labeled with <sup>89</sup>Zr through chelation by DFO (see methods) to generate the V<sub>H</sub>H-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr radiotracers. We injected the V<sub>H</sub>H-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates into C57BL/6 mice and huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice and collected PET/CT images at various times after retro-orbital injection. Injection of the V<sub>H</sub>H123-based conjugate into huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice yielded a signal exclusively in the kidneys, which we consider a non-specific signal. <sup>89</sup>Zr radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>Hs typically accumulate in the kidneys in the absence of a specific target. Similarly, injection of the V<sub>H</sub>H188-based conjugate into C57BL/6 mice likewise yielded a strong PET signal only in the kidneys (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B-C</xref>), again considered non-specific accumulation of the tracer.</p>

<p>For the properly matched V<sub>H</sub>H-mouse combinations (<sup>89</sup>Zr radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>H123 conjugate injected into C57BL/6 mice; <sup>89</sup>Zr radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>H188-conjugate injected into huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice), each produced an intense PET signal that localizes to bones, mainly the vertebrae, sacrum, coxal bone as well as both epiphyses of the femur and the proximal epiphysis of the humerus at 48 hours post-radiotracer injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig3A and D</xref>). The mean activity measured by PET was significantly different between matched and unmatched V<sub>H</sub>H/mouse pairs in the liver, spleen, femoro-tibial articulation (knee) and spleen, by region of interest (ROI) analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E-F</xref>). While the signals from long bone extremities and vertebrae suggest uptake of the anti-TfR radioconjugate by bone marrow <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, presumably due to the high demand for iron required for erythropoiesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>, this pattern of label distribution is better explained by sequestration of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in mineralized bone and cartilage <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> (see also <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">supplemental Fig. 8</xref>). The weak signal from the diaphyses of the femora relative to the intense signal in the vertebral column and bone extremities suggests that accumulation of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in mineralized bone predominates under these conditions. To assess this, we measured the activity of specific tissues <italic>ex vivo</italic> 72 hours post radiotracer injection (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G-H</xref>). Several tissues showed significant differences of activity between the matched and unmatched mouse/V<sub>H</sub>H pairs: particularly in the brain, spleen, small intestine and liver. Femur bones flushed of all bone marrow retained a very strong activity in the matched conditions – showing that the mineral bone retains a high activity when depleted of bone marrow (&gt; 200,000 CPM/bone) – confirming the deposit of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in the bone matrix. Nevertheless, flushed bone marrow showed activity (20000 – 30000 CPM/flushed bone) that was significantly higher in the matched vs. unmatched conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>). We conclude that at later timepoints, the strong PET signals in the long bone extremities (femur, tibia and humerus) are due in part to bone marrow accumulation of anti-TfR radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>Hs, but predominantly so to accumulation of free <sup>89</sup>Zr in the mineralized bone matrix. No obvious accumulation of tracer was seen in brain parenchyma by PET, but significant differences of activity were found in the <italic>ex vivo</italic> analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>), in line with the reported ability of V<sub>H</sub>Hs that recognize the TfR to deliver bound materials across the blood brain barrier <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The failure to detect a PET signal of adequate strength in the brain are due to the comparatively small amounts of anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H that cross the BBB. When analyzing PET images obtained with V<sub>H</sub>Hs that recognize targets other than the TfR, which includes V<sub>H</sub>Hs that recognize CD8 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, Ly6C/G <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup> or CD11b <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, as examined previously, no accumulation of <sup>89</sup>Zr in skeletal elements was seen. These previous observations, combined with the lack of any bone signal in the mismatched anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H/mouse pairs, lead us to conclude that free <sup>89</sup>Zr is released from the V<sub>H</sub>H-conjugates <italic>in vivo,</italic> but only when the V<sub>H</sub>H binds to its respective TfR.</p>
<p>Because chelation of <sup>89</sup>Zr to DFO depends on its charge <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that binding of V<sub>H</sub>H-<sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates to the appropriate TfR delivers them to endosomal compartments of low pH, where <sup>89</sup>Zr is then released from the DFO moiety. We examined release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from the V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO construct <italic>in vitro</italic> by exposure to low pH (Suppl Fig 2). <sup>89</sup>Zr is freed from the adduct at pH &lt;5.6, which is well within the pH range of late endosomal compartments <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Whether the mildly acidic pH of early or recycling endosomal compartments is sufficient for isotope release <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined.</p>

<title>Comparison of <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu and <sup>18</sup>F isotopes conjugated to the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs</title>
<p>Having observed the release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from the V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO imaging agent, we considered the use of <sup>64</sup>Cu as alternative radio-isotope. We also synthesized an adduct covalently labeled with <sup>18</sup>F to circumvent any possible release of free radioisotope. The rather different half-lives of <sup>89</sup>Zr (∼3.3 days), <sup>64</sup>Cu (∼12 hours) and <sup>18</sup>F (∼110 minutes) dictate the observation windows allowed by their use, which we arbitrarily set at 3 to 5 half-lives, thus ranging from 10 hours (<sup>18</sup>F) to ∼2 weeks (<sup>89</sup>Zr), with ∼3% of the injected dose remaining after 5 half-lives due to isotope decay.</p>
<p>We generated a V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu version, where <sup>64</sup>Cu is chelated by NOTA and would not accumulate in mineralized bone if released. The use of a <sup>64</sup>Cu-labeled tracer should allow an observation window of 3-5 half-lives, i.e. ∼36-60 hours. For comparison we produced a V<sub>H</sub>H123-tetrazine-TCO-<sup>18</sup>F construct, where <sup>18</sup>F is incorporated covalently through tetrazine-TCO click-chemistry. This precludes isotope release other than by proteolysis. We injected these imaging agents for a side-by-side comparison with V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr in C57BL/6 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). At 1 hour post injection of the <sup>89</sup>Zr, <sup>64</sup>Cu or <sup>18</sup>F-labeled radiotracer, we observe a strong PET signal in the diaphyses and both epiphyses of the femora and in the coxal bones and sacrum (bone marrow), thus showing that V<sub>H</sub>H123 accumulates specifically at those locations, and that the signal is not simply due to free radio-isotope only. <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>H123also accumulated in the spleen. The <sup>18</sup>F based imaging agent provided a sharper picture, with some signal originating from the gut and gall bladder, typically seen when using <sup>18</sup>F-based radiotracers comprising bulky hydrophobic moieties, in this case a TCO-Tetrazine clicked product <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. At the 12h timepoint the <sup>18</sup>F signal had fully decayed due to the short half-life of <sup>18</sup>F. Improved signal quality is thus offset by the shorter half-life of <sup>18</sup>F. For the <sup>64</sup>Cu-based agent, the bone marrow signal remains weakly visible at 24 hours post injection. The liver and gut signals increase at later timepoints for the <sup>64</sup>Cu-labeled tracer, as internalization of V<sub>H</sub>H123 construct may allow release of <sup>64</sup>Cu and its accumulation in those tissues <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. In mice that received the <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled agent we mostly observe a signal from the bone extremities and vertebrae at 24 hours post injection, which we attribute to labelling of mineralized bone with free <sup>89</sup>Zr with a minor contribution of a TfR-specific bone marrow signal. For all imaging agents, we observe a pair of punctiform signals in the anterior region of the cranium. These appear very prominently with the <sup>18</sup>F tracer, and at later timepoints -but less clearly-with the <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu imaging agents, potentially explained by the lower positron emission range of <sup>18</sup>F. Limited by the resolution of the CT images, we tentatively attribute these signals to the accumulation of the radiotracer in the roots of the incisors, where iron uptake is required for proper amelogenesis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup></p>

<p>We conclude that internalization of <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu V<sub>H</sub>H123-based imaging agents leads to release of free radioisotope (<sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu), which is responsible for most of the signal detected at later (24h or later) timepoints and thus does not truly reflect distribution of the TfR itself at those timepoints. This is particularly clear from a ROI analysis of the liver and knee PET signals, when normalized to the average kidney signal (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), that shows a shift of distribution of PET signal towards the liver with <sup>64</sup>Cu-labelled V<sub>H</sub>H123 and towards the knee for <sup>89</sup>Zr-labelled VHHs at later timepoints post injection. Combined, these results establish specificity of recognition of the respective V<sub>H</sub>Hs for their intended targets. Moreover, the results show that release of <sup>89</sup>Zr or <sup>64</sup>Cu from the imaging agents is the unavoidable consequence of their binding to the proper targets. The choice of isotopes for conjugation to anti-TfR nanobodies must therefore be made with respect to the tissue(s) that are to be visualized, as well as the time scale of the experiment (∼3 to 5 isotope half-lives).</p>

<title>89Zr-conjugated V<sub>H</sub>H123 tracks transplanted bone marrow cells <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Having established that V<sub>H</sub>H123 accumulates in the bone marrow <italic>in vivo,</italic> we tested whether V<sub>H</sub>H123 could detect bone marrow cells transplanted into lethally irradiated recipient mice. To enable the specific detection of the donor cells, we isolated bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice and transplanted 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> cells into lethally irradiated (10 Gy) huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> recipient mice by retro-orbital injection. We used V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr to determine whether bone marrow engraftment would suffice to reproduce the signal pattern observed in C57BL/6 wild-type mice. At 2 weeks post bone marrow transplantation, 24 hours after injection of V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr, the presence of the transferred cells marrow is observed in the spleen and femoral bone, together with a strong signal from free <sup>89</sup>Zr accumulation in the bone matrix (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). The signal in the spleen appeared more prominent than that observed when imaging wild-type C57BL/6 mice at 24 hours post injection of the same VHH, as pointed out through ROI analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref> vs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>), which could reveal the presence of hematopoietic bone marrow in the spleen. The same observations were made in the reverse experiment where transplantation of huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> bone marrow into C57BL/6 recipients was performed before imaging the recipients 15 days after transplantation using V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Strikingly, the images acquired at 1 hour post V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr injection show a powerful signal in the spleen, something not observed when imaging huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice with the same radiotracer, which can be easily interpreted as the presence of bone marrow engraftment in the spleen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). As a control, V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr was unable to show engraftment of C57BL/6 bone marrow cells in an isogenic recipient (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>). Because the transferred bone marrow cells proliferated in the 14 days prior to imaging, they reached numbers adequate for the release of <sup>89</sup>Zr that would then accumulate in the bone matrix. Indeed, imaging of huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> recipient mice immediately after C57BL/6 bone marrow transplantation using V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr reveals only a faint signal in the knee and liver (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>). Specific tracing of TfR-positive cells of mouse or human origin is thus possible when using V<sub>H</sub>H123 or V<sub>H</sub>H188 as the tracer in a huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> or wild-type recipient, respectively. Depending on the mass of TfR<sup>+</sup> cells present the recipients, timing of tracer injection and the PET imaging session is critical to avoid the confounding effect of the free <sup>89</sup>Zr bone matrix signal. These data establish the feasibility of detecting transplanted bone marrow cells and their hematopoietic descendants amidst populations or recipient cells that remain invisible to the imaging agent used.</p>

<title>TfR-positive B16.F10 melanoma cells are detected by <sup>64</sup>Cu-conjugated V<sub>H</sub>H123</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether we could trace tumor cells that express mouse TfR, but that are not derived from bone marrow hematopoietic cells. 5×10<sup>4</sup> B16.F10 mouse melanoma cells were injected <italic>i.v.</italic> by tail vein injection to generate metastatic lung tumors in huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice. We allowed the B16.F10 cells to engraft and establish metastases for up to 4 weeks post-transplantation. We injected the recipients with V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu at weeks 2 and 4. Imaging done at 2 weeks post-inoculation of the B16F10 tumor did not yield a clear signal in the lungs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), as metastases typically arise some 3 weeks after injection for this number of cells. At 4 weeks post transplantation, we observed a clear signal originating from the lungs of the same mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). No signal was detected in the no tumor control group (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). To exclude the possibility of non-TfR specific accumulation of radiotracer in necrotic tumor tissue, we injected tumor bearing mice with a non-specific anti-GFP V<sub>H</sub>HEnh-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu conjugate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B,D</xref>), which showed only weak passive accumulation in the lung metastases at 4 weeks post tumor cell infusion. At necropsy we confirmed the presence of melanotic tumors in the lungs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>), which were also visible on the lung CT. By ROI analysis of the PET signals, V<sub>H</sub>H123 gave a significantly higher signal in the whole lungs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). The PET signal from B16.F10 metastases in the lung correlates well with what appears to be dense tumor tissue on the corresponding CT image. When performing ROI analysis restricted to the PET signal in hyperdense lung tumor tissue, V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu gave an overall stronger signal when compared to V<sub>H</sub>HEnh-PEG-NOTA-<sup>64</sup>Cu, although not by a significant margin (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref>). It is important to emphasize that ROI analysis on lung and heart is less precise, due to breathing movements and beating heart during acquisition of the PET signal. The anti-mouse TfR nanobody V<sub>H</sub>H123 is thus well-suited to track TfR-expressing cells of mouse origin in huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> recipient mice. Since all proliferating cells express TfR, in principle any tumor or proliferating cell of mouse origin can be detected non-invasively without the need for genetic modification of the transplanted cells. This congenic pair of mice, in combination with the species specificity of the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs, is thus a unique tool for studies of this type.</p>

<title>89Zr-conjugated VHH188 binds to TfR at the blood-placenta barrier as observed by PET/CT</title>
<p>Pregnancy presents a unique situation akin to a transplant setting. Maternal Tf is taken up at the blood-placenta-barrier (BPB) to deliver iron to the developing embryo. We asked whether the V<sub>H</sub>H188 nanobody would detect TfR expressed by syncytiotrophoblasts-I at the BPB. C57BL/6 females were mated with a huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> male or with a C57BL/6 male as a control. Embryos will thus be heterozygous for the presence of the two TfR isoforms. We hypothesize that proper mouse and human TfR homodimers will be formed, in addition to the possible formation of the interspecific hybrid TfR heterodimer. Two weeks post-fertilization, the pregnant females were injected retro-orbitally with V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr. We observed rapid uptake of the V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr radiotracer in the individual placentas of the huTfR<sup>+/-</sup> embryos (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). Wild-type C57BL/6 placentas were barely detectable in females crossed with a C57BL/6 male, showing a much weaker signal (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). This difference is significant through ROI analysis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). We attribute the low but detectable signal for V<sub>H</sub>H188 to possible cross-reactivity to the mouse TfR when expressed at the very high levels on syncytiotrophoblast-I: placental tissue expresses a much higher than average level of Tfr1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Post-euthanasia dissection and separation of the placenta from the embryo was done, followed by a separate round of PET/CT imaging of the extirpated uterus and the embryos it contained. This confirmed that the intense V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr signal originates from the placenta and not from the embryo (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). V<sub>H</sub>H188-PEG-DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr thus detects huTfR<sup>+/-</sup> placental tissue. Notwithstanding intense labeling of the placenta, we did not see a signal that corresponds to free <sup>89</sup>Zr in either embryos or in the pregnant female. This results therefore departs from what was seen for any of the other imaging experiments, all of which showed release of <sup>89</sup>Zr when the appropriate target TfR was expressed. Of note, the signal in the placenta was already quite intense at 1h post-injection of the radiotracer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The ability to track the fate of transplanted cells non-invasively over time is a useful asset for several applications. These include the monitoring of tumor growth in response to various forms of therapy in a pre-clinical setting, or to follow the fate of transplanted cells of hematopoietic origin. Methods currently in use include luminescence-based approaches, in which the transplanted cells are engineered to express a suitable reporter, such as a luciferase <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Luminescence methods do not provide cellular resolution. Alternatively, to achieve single cell resolution, fluorescence-based methods have been applied in multi-photon microscopy <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>, but this typically involves invasive surgical interventions to expose the target tissue or organ, because absorption by surrounding tissue limits the depth of penetration of the excitation beam and emitted fluorescence.</p>
<p>Non-invasive methods such as NMR lack the specificity to detect particular cell populations, although tumors that exceed a certain size are readily visualized <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) can detect specific cell populations based on the use of radiolabeled ligands that recognize them, but lack single cell resolution. The most widely used radioisotopes for SPECT include <sup>123</sup>I and <sup>99</sup>Tc, with half lives of ∼13 hours and ∼6 hours, respectively <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Radiolabeled immunoglobulins used as imaging agents show excellent specificity, but their molecular mass (∼150 kDa) impedes efficient tissue penetration and imposes a long circulatory half-life. When using immunoglobulin-based imaging agents for PET, the use of long-lived radioisotopes such as <sup>89</sup>Zr (t<sub>1/2</sub>=∼3.3 days) is therefore indicated.</p>
<p>The introduction of nanobodies for SPECT and PET overcomes many of the limitations of immunoglobulin-based imaging agents. The small size of nanobodies improves tissue penetration and drastically reduces the circulatory half-life of nanobody-based imaging agents. Free nanobodies are typically excreted via the kidneys and have a circulatory half-life of ∼30 minutes, versus a half-life (in mice) of several days for intact immunoglobulins <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. This means that unbound nanobodies are rapidly cleared from the circulation to yield a much-improved signal-to-noise ratio. Conjugation of a PEG<sub>20kDa</sub> moiety further improves contrast by reducing somewhat the renal clearance rate of the nanobodies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Chemo-enzymatic methods for the modification of nanobodies allow their site-specific and reproducible modification with substituents of interest, including the installation of chelators for radiometals such as <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu, as well as click handles for site-specific covalent modification with <sup>18</sup>F <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For detection of tumors, xenografts in immunocompromised mice are widely used in combination with tumor-specific imaging agents. Typically, they are based on antibodies that recognize human-specific surface markers <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Methods for the detection of tumors of mouse origin in their natural host are few and far between. It is for this reason that we explored the possibility of using a congenic pair of mice in combination with nanobodies that distinguish the congenic marker, in this case the transferrin receptor (TfR). We show that a combination of anti-TfR nanobodies and mice that express either a wild-type (mouse) or a humanized TfR may be used to trace different cell types <italic>in vivo</italic> that express the TfR. To that end, we transferred hematopoietic bone marrow cells and B16.F10 melanoma cells into the respective mouse recipients. It is thus possible to track cells of mouse origin in humanized huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice and humanized huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mouse bone marrow in C57BL/6 mice. Mice carrying huTfR<sup>+/-</sup> fetuses showed a strong signal for VHH188 in the placenta, indicative of trans-endothelial transport of the imaging agent. Except for the TfR on syncytiotrophoblast-I, at 14 days of gestation no other embryonic tissues showed any accumulation of label.</p>
<p>The combination of human and mouse-specific anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs with mice that were engineered to express a TfR with the human TfR ectodomain constitute a congenic pair of mice ideally suited for a variety of transplant experiments. The growth of tumors of mouse origin, when transplanted into huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mice, can be followed non-invasively, for example in response to various treatments. Conversely, human patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX models) can be followed upon transplantation into mice without a requirement for genetic modification of the transplant, even if no tumor-specific antibodies are available. The lack of an obvious PET signal in the CNS when imaging mice may be due to the fact that proteins that traverse the BBB, such as the TfR nanobody conjugates, accumulate in the CNS at a concentration far lower (around 1-5%) than that in blood plasma <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Even so, gamma ray spectrometry on various organs from mice that received <sup>89</sup>Zr-conjugated anti-TfR tracers confirmed accumulation of both nanobodies in the CNS of the appropriate genotype compared to control conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4H</xref>).</p>
<p>Release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr and <sup>64</sup>Cu by the nanobody conjugates was a surprising observation, unique to the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs. For no other <sup>89</sup>Zr labeled, PEGylated V<sub>H</sub>H have we seen such a striking and rapid release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr. The osteophilic properties of <sup>89</sup>Zr have been well-documented <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> and confirmed in our hands (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Suppl. Fig. 8</xref>). The signal generated by free <sup>89</sup>Zr should therefore not be confused with the localization of anti-TfR nanobody to the spinal cord, bone marrow or skeletal elements more generally. Careful interpretation is required when examining accumulation of tracer in bone marrow when using anti-TfR-<sup>89</sup>Zr conjugates or any other internalizing <sup>89</sup>Zr-labeled tracer. The fact that the observed release was unique to the anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs, seen only in the presence of the appropriate target, may also be consistent with a mechanism that specifically targets the DFO-<sup>89</sup>Zr chelate in compartments to which the TfR localizes. Perhaps release of Fe<sup>+++</sup> from Tf requires not only acidic pH but also the presence of some as yet unidentified co-factor that can act on the <sup>89</sup>Zr-DFO chelate as well. Imaging experiments performed on pregnant C57B/6 mice that carry huTfR<sup>+/-</sup> embryos may shed further light on this question. Notwithstanding the very strong accumulation of label seen in the placenta, which we ascribe to the presence of the huTfR at the surface of the embryonic syncytiotrophoblast-I, we did not see any sign of release of free <sup>89</sup>Zr. Either the TfR upon internalization into the syncytiotrophoblast-I is never exposed to the low pH responsible for <sup>89</sup>Zr release in other tissues, but still sufficiently low to allow release of Fe<sup>+++</sup> from transferrin, or the hypothesized co-factor that mediates release of <sup>89</sup>Zr from the DFO chelator is absent from the syncytiotrophoblast-I. We favor the former explanation, because it would allow delivery of Fe<sup>+++</sup> to embryonic tissues and satisfy their demand for iron. Another possibility is that <sup>89</sup>Zr is indeed released at the level of syncytiotrophoblasts-I, but would remain trapped at the interface between syncytiotrophoblasts-I and -II as it would then not be able to penetrate the fetal circulation via ferroportins <sub>23.</sub></p>
<p>The issue of the ‘free <sup>89</sup>Zr signal pattern’, defined as an intense signal originating from long bone extremities, vertebrae and coxal bone, induced by <sup>89</sup>Zr release may be traded for an increased signal in the liver by shifting to the use of <sup>64</sup>Cu as a PET isotope, which can also be attributed to the release of <sup>64</sup>Cu upon anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>H internalization. The use of <sup>18</sup>F-labeled anti-TfR V<sub>H</sub>Hs conjugated through click-chemistry avoids the complications of isotope release. However, <sup>18</sup>F comes with its own drawbacks, such as its short half-life, necessitating less convenient synthetic routes for tracer production, and the typical accumulation of label seen in organs of elimination such as the gall bladder and gastro-intestinal tract when using TCO-tetrazine click-chemistry <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the ubiquitously expressed TfR may be used as a cell marker to track virtually any cell-type of choice <italic>in vivo</italic>, provided they are transferred to a mouse model that expresses a different isoform of TfR. The huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> mouse model has been deposited at the Jackson Laboratories and is therefore easily accessible (strain number 038212). Production and sortagging of nanobodies to generate PET tracers is a relatively simple process. These nanobodies and the huTfR<sup>+/+</sup> model may thus benefit the field of <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging.</p>

<title>Radioactive conjugate preparation</title>
<p>Conjugation to <sup>89</sup>Zr was based on previously published methods <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. V<sub>H</sub>Hs were conjugated to GGG-Deferoxamine (DFO)-Azide by Sortase A transpeptidation (see above). The V<sub>H</sub>H-DFO-Azide conjugate was then incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of polyethylene-glycol<sub>20kDa</sub>-dibenzylcyclooctyne (PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>-DBCO) overnight at 4°C on a shaker in PBS (pre-treated with Chelex beads in order to remove divalent cations) in order to generate V<sub>H</sub>H-PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>-DFO through click-chemistry. Completion of the reaction was assessed by SDS-PAGE. For radio-labelling, a stock solution of 129.5 MBq (3.5 mCi) of <sup>89</sup>Zr<sup>4+</sup> in a 1M oxalate solution (purchased from the Madison-Wisconsin University Cyclotron Lab) was adjusted to a pH of 6.8-7.5 with a 75% (vol/vol) of 2M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and 400 % (vol/vol) of 0.5M HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. 37 MBq (1mCi) of pH-adjusted <sup>89</sup>Zr was then mixed with 100µg of V<sub>H</sub>H-PEG<sub>20kDa</sub>-DFO for 1h at room temperature, followed by removal of unbound <sup>89</sup>Zr using a PD-10 gravity desalting column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with Chelex-treated PBS. The column was eluted in fractions of 600µL, the activity of which was measured using a dose calibrator (AtomLab 500, Biodex). The fraction corresponding to the peak activity (typically fraction 6 with an activity of typically 37 kBq/µL (1µCi/µL)) was used for injection. The free <sup>89</sup>Zr remaining in the desalting column was typically &lt; 10% of input: 37 kBq (100 µCi) suggesting a radioelement chelation efficiency of ∼90%.For conjugation of <sup>64</sup>Cu, GGG-NOTA-Azide was conjugated to the V<sub>H</sub>H through sortase A transpeptidation (NOTA: 2,2′,2”-(1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic acid).

Progress of click reactions was monitored by spotting iTLC-SG strip (Agilent, SGI0001) with 0.5 μL of reaction mixture at 5 and 10 min until about 20% of clicked product was detected in the mixture (10 min). For purification, 200 μL of the TCO-agarose slurry was added to the top of a pre-equilibrated PD-10 column. The column was then washed with 30 mL of sterile 1x PBS. Each <sup>18</sup>F-TCO-tetrazine-V<sub>H</sub>H click reaction mixture was loaded to a column. When the solution reached bed level, 1.6 mL of 1x PBS was added and the <sup>18</sup>F-radiolabeled V<sub>H</sub>H was then eluted with 2×x1 mL fractions of PBS.

<caption><p>185 MBq (5mCi) of <sup>89</sup>Zr-oxalate stock solution was obtained from the Cyclotron Lab at UW Madison, USA.

V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO was conjugated to <sup>89</sup>Zr at a neutral pH of 7.4 by adding 44.4 MBq (1.2mCi) of pH neutralized <sup>89</sup>Zr to 120µg of V<sub>H</sub>H123-PEG-DFO in chelexed PBS, put in a microcentrifuge tube for 1 hour at room temperature on an agitator. The mixture was then split into 6 tubes (200 µCi each), and diluted 1/15 (v/v) in citrate-sodium phosphate buffer of varying pH: 7.4, 6.6, 5.6, 4.6, 3.6 and 2.6. The conjugation mixture was then immediately passed onto a PD-10 gravity size exclusion chromatography column (Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with citrate-sodium phosphate buffer of same pH used to dilute the VHH conjugate. Fractions of 600µL were collected by addition of citrate-sodium phosphate buffer of same pH and each fraction was measured for radioactivity using a dosimeter (AtomLab 500, Biodex). Shown is a heat map of measured radioactivity from each fraction collected. ‘column loading’: flowthrough from column displaced by application of the reaction mixture to the column. ‘remain in column’: residual radioactivity measured from the whole column post-elution. Brackets on the left indicate the typical elution fraction range of a VHH-radiometal conjugate post successful conjugation.</p></caption>

<p>In this innovative study, Carpenet C et al explore the use of nanobody-based PET imaging to track proliferative cells after in vivo transplantation in mice, in a fully immunocompetent setting. The development of a unique set of PET tracers and mouse strains to track genetically-unmodified transplanted cells in vivo is an <bold>important</bold> novel asset that could potentially facilitate cell tracking. The evidence provided is <bold>compelling</bold> as the new method proposed might facilitate overcoming certain limitations of alternative approaches, such as full sized immunoglobulins and small molecules, while the specific claims would gain further support by additional experimentation and methodological details.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The topic of nanobody-based PET imaging is important and holds great potential for real-world applications since nanobodies have many advantages over full sized immunoglobulins and small molecules.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The submitted manuscript contains quite a bit of interesting data from a collaborative team of well-respected researchers. The authors are to be congratulated for presenting results that may not have turned out the way they had hoped, and doing so in a transparent fashion.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the manuscript could be considered to be a collection of exploratory findings rather than a complete and mature scientific exposition. Most of the sample sizes were 3 per group, which is fine for exploratory work, but insufficient to draw strong statistically robust conclusions for definitive results.</p>

<p>We thank reviewer #1 for the  review of our work. We appreciate reviewer’s #1 comment on our intent to publish our results in the most transparent fashion, which is the case. We would point out that due to the technical challenges and cost of generating all the different nanobody-radiometal tracer conjugates, we included 3 repeats per group, which is the minimum required  to perform statistical comparisons. We plan to add additional controls to the manuscript that were not initially included to limit the length of the manuscript. These additional controls  will lend more weight to our conclusions.</p>

We support reviewer’s 2 view on the strength of being able to track transplanted cells in vivo without the need of any sort of manipulation of the transferred cells.  We plan to add additional controls to the manuscript that were not initially included to limit the length of the manuscript. These additional controls will lend more weight to our conclusions. We emphasize that although no clear clinical applications immediately derive  from our studies, this work  still offers better-suited tools for pre-clinical studies that require the ability to track transplanted cells in <italic>in vivo</italic> . We will resubmit a revised version shortly.</p>
