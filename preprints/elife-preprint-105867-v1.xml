<title>Abstract</title><p>Selector transcription factors control choices of alternative cellular fates during development. The ventral rhombomere 1 of the embryonic brainstem produces neuronal precursors that can differentiate into either inhibitory GABAergic or excitatory glutamatergic neurons important for the control of behaviour. Transcription factors (TFs) <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> are required for adopting the GABAergic neuronal identity and inhibiting the glutamatergic identity. Here, we asked how these selector TFs are activated and how they control the identity of the developing brainstem neurons. We addressed these questions by analysing chromatin accessibility at putative gene regulatory elements active during GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron lineage bifurcation, combined with studies of transcription factor expression and DNA-binding. Our results show that the <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> genes are activated by highly similar mechanisms, with connections to regional patterning, neurogenic cell cycle exit and general course of neuronal differentiation. After activation, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> are linked by auto- and cross-regulation as well as regulatory interactions with transcription factors of the glutamatergic branch. Predicted targets of these selector TFs include genes expressed in GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons, or both. Unlike genes specific to the glutamatergic branch, the genes expressed in GABAergic neurons appear to be under combinatorial control of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>. Understanding gene regulatory interactions affecting the anterior brainstem GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron differentiation may give genetic and mechanistic insights into neurodevelopmental traits and disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The anterior brainstem is a complex neuronal mosaic controlling mood, motivation and movement. These neurons include diverse inhibitory GABAergic and excitatory glutamatergic neurons, some of which are associated with the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems.</p>
<p>An important source of these neurons is the ventrolateral rhombomere 1 (r1), where GABA- and glutamatergic neuron precursors are generated from a neuroepithelial region expressing a homeodomain TF <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Waite et al., 2012</xref>). We here refer to these precursors as rhombencephalic V2 domain (rV2), reflecting its molecular similarity to the V2 domain in the developing spinal cord. The rV2 derived precursors give rise to GABAergic neurons in the posterior Substantia Nigra pars reticulata, Ventral Tegmental Area, Rostromedial Tegmental Nucleus and Ventral Tegmental Nucleus, all important for various aspects of behavioural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>). A failure in the differentiation of the rV2 GABAergic neurons in the embryonic mouse brain, caused by mutation of the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene, results in robust behavioral changes in postnatal mice, including hyperactivity, impulsivity, hypersensitivity to reward, and learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Morello et al., 2020b</xref>).</p>
<p>The <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> positive proliferative progenitors of rV2 give rise to postmitotic V2b-like GABAergic precursors expressing selector genes <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, and V2a-like glutamatergic precursors expressing <italic>Vsx1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Achim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Muroyama et al., 2005</xref>). In the absence of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> function, differentiation of all the rV2 precursors is directed to glutamatergic neuron types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> also retain their expression in the mature GABAergic neurons. Thus, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> TFs operate as fate-selectors, responsible for the induction and maintenance of the GABAergic identity in the anterior ventrolateral brainstem.</p>
<p>It has remained unclear how the selector TFs are activated during development and how they guide neuronal differentiation in the anterior brainstem. To address these questions, we have characterized the accessibility and TF binding in putative gene regulatory elements and correlated these events with changes in gene expression during differentiation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the anterior brainstem. Our results suggest that the GABAergic selector TF genes are activated by interconnected mechanisms reflecting developmental regionalization and timing, and that their functions converge to promote GABAergic and suppress glutamatergic neuron differentiation.</p>

<title>Processing of scRNAseq data</title>
<p>scRNAseq data processing per brain region is described in detail in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ComputationalNeurogenetics/rV2_bifurcation">https://github.com/ComputationalNeurogenetics/rV2_bifurcation</ext-link>) with main steps outlined below.</p>
<p>scRNAseq data was read into <italic>Seurat</italic> objects from 10x <italic>filtered_feature_bc</italic> matrix by using Ensembl gene IDs as features. Replicates per each brain region, or all replicates in the later analysis steps were merged as <italic>Seurat</italic> objects. After merging, quality control (QC) was performed by calculating <italic>mt-percentage and filtering based on nFeature_RNA</italic> and <italic>percent.mt</italic>. Data was then log-normalized, top 3000 most variable features were detected, finally data was scaled and <italic>mt-percentage</italic>, <italic>nFeature_RNA</italic>, <italic>nCount_RNA</italic> were set to be regressed out.</p>
<p>Data was then run through PCA using n variable features, and <italic>Seurat RunUMAP</italic> with selected top PCA dimensions was used to generate Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for further analysis. <italic>Seurat</italic> functions <italic>FindNeighbors</italic> and <italic>FindClusters</italic> were applied for neighborhood and community detection-based clustering.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>scATACseq samples</title>
<p>Embryonic brains were isolated from E12.5 wildtype mouse embryos (n=2), and ventral R1 pieces (E12.5) were separated. Nuclei were isolated using the 10X Genomics Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin Nuclei Extraction from fresh tissues protocol CG000212. Chromium Single Cell Next GEM ATAC Solution (10X Genomics, 1000162) was used for the capture of nuclei and the accessible chromatin capture. In chip loading, the nuclei yield was set at 5000 nuclei per sample. Chromium Single Cell Next GEM ATAC Reagent chemistry v1.1 was used for the DNA library preparation. Sample libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system using read lengths: 50bp (Read 1N), 8bp (i7 Index), 16bp (i5 Index) and 50bp (Read 2N). The reads were quality filtered and mapped against the <italic>Mus musculus</italic> genome <italic>mm10</italic> using Cell Ranger ATAC v1.2.0 pipeline.</p>

<sec id="s2e">
<title>Processing scATACseq data</title>
<p>In this study we defined feature space as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kilpinen et al., 2023</xref>), except that we used both E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kilpinen et al., 2023</xref>) and E12.5 scATACseq samples to further increase resolution to detect features from rare cell population and cellular clade cut height was defined based on smallest clade so that none of the clades contained less than 100 cells (h=8).</p>
<p>These jointly defined features were then used to process the E12.5 rhombomere 1 scATACseq data. Data was subjected to QC, binarization and LSA, steps described in more detail in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ComputationalNeurogenetics/rV2_bifurcation">https://github.com/ComputationalNeurogenetics/rV2_bifurcation</ext-link>) largely following steps previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stuart et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">2019</xref>). Similarly, scATACseq data was integrated with scRNAseq using an approach already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The UMAP projection based on scATACseq data was done with <italic>Seurat</italic> using SVD components 2-30 for cells with a reliability score from scRNAseq integration &gt;0.5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). The first SVD component was omitted due to the association with read depth. Neighborhood and community detection were made with Seurat functions <italic>FindNeighbors</italic>(dims=2:30) and <italic>FindClusters</italic>(resolution=1, algorithm=4).</p>

<sec id="s2f">
<title>Subsetting and subclustering the rV2 lineage</title>
<p>The rV2 lineage was subset from clustered E12.5 R1 scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>) as well as from E12.5 R1 scATACseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Subsetting was based on the expression levels of known marker genes (Ccnb1, Nkx6-1, Vsx2, Slc17a6, Tal1, Gad1). scATACseq clusters 1, 6, 8, 12, 13, 19, 20, 24 and 26 were considered to consist of rV2 lineage. Clusters 13 and 19 were considered to be progenitors and were named PRO1 and PRO2, respectively. Cluster 26 was considered to consist of common precursors and was named CO. Clusters tentatively belonging to common precursors, the GABAergic (branches 1, 6, 20 and 24), and the glutamatergic branches (8 and 12) were further subjected to Seurat <italic>FindSubClusters</italic> to reveal higher resolution cell types. This resulted in the splitting of CO into clusters CO1 and CO2, the GABAergic branch into six clusters named GA1 – GA6, and the glutamatergic branch into five clusters GL1 – GL5.</p>

<p>The scRNAseq and scATACseq cluster markers were filtered with adj. p-value &lt; 0.05 and top 25 based on log2FC. An intersection of unique gene names was identified between scRNAseq and scATACseq objects and its size, N, was used as the total gene pool for the hypergeometric test.</p>

<title>VIA pseudotime analysis</title>
<p>For VIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stassen et al., 2021</xref>) based pseudotime analysis rV2-lineage embeddings coordinates from dimensions 2:30, as well as cluster identities as colors, were passed from Seurat object to Python based VIA. Calculations in both for scRNAseq and for scATACseq, gene expression levels were used to calculate the pseudotime value. In the case of scATACseq, these were the interpolated values from integration with the scRNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of scATACseq PRO1 was chosen as the root cell population, and for scRNAseq cluster 22 was chosen as root cell population.</p>

<title>Sequence conservation</title>
<p>Conservation data is derived from UCSC database at (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/phastCons60way/">https://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm10/phastCons60way/</ext-link><underline>)</underline>, which contains compressed phastCons scores for multiple alignments of 59 vertebrate genomes to the mouse mm10 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>). Nucleotide was considered conserved if phast-score was at least 0.5 (range 0-1).</p>
<p>The scATACseq features and other selected regions of study were examined for conservation level in comparison to the whole genome, using Fisher’s exact test. Conservation was also calculated for exon and intron regions within all chromosomes to demonstrate the accuracy of this method.</p>
<p>For sequence conservation at the TFBS-motif locations, positional weight matrix (PWM) of the motif was used to define weight of each nucleotide based on max probability at that nucleotide location in PWM and that weight was used in calculation of the weighted mean of conservation score over the nucleotides at TFBS locations.</p>

<title>TAD</title>
<p>Topologically associated domains (TADs) of the chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Singh and Berger, 2021</xref>) were used to limit the search for cCREs. We used <italic>tadmap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Singh and Berger, 2021</xref>) for TAD definition.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">
<title>Feature accessibility over pseudotime</title>
<p>Features within TAD of the selector gene were considered to be candidate cis-regulatory element (cCRE) if they had linkage correlation with expression of the gene with abs(zscore)&gt;2 and p-value &lt;0.05. Accessibility changes of cCREs were visualized as spline smoothed heatmaps over the pseudotime. Spline smoothing was calculated over entire rV2 cell groups in order of (PRO1-2, CO1-2, GA1-2, GA3-4, GA5-6, GL1-2, GL3-4, GL5).</p>

<title>TF-footprinting from scATACseq reads</title>
<p>TF-footprinting of scATACseq data was performed by using TOBIAS-framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bentsen et al., 2020</xref>) with Snakemake pipeline. As motif collection we used Hocomoco version 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vorontsov et al., 2023</xref>). The motif for INSM1 was added to the Hocomoco v12 collection from Hocomoco v11 collection as it was seen relevant in earlier research. Suitability of mixing motifs from the two versions of the Hocomoco was checked in correspondence with Hocomoco team.</p>
<p>For the purpose of TF-footprinting we combined cell groups as follows to increase signal to noise ratio: PRO1 and PRO2 (PRO1-2), CO1 and CO2 (CO1-2), GA1 and GA2 (GA1-2), GA3 and GA4 (GA3-4), GA5 and GA6 (GA5-6), GL1 and GL2 (GL1-2), GL3 and GL4 (GL3-4). GL5 was kept as is. E12R1 BAM files were merged, and PCR duplicates removed with Picard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). BAM file was then split into BAM file per combined cell group with Sinto (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://timoast.github.io/sinto/">https://timoast.github.io/sinto/</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Footprinting data was visualized through R ggplot based dotplots per selected features, with filtering for TFBS-motifs having &gt;0.5 weighted average conservation value, accessibility of the feature &gt; 0.06 and expression of the TF in question &gt; 1.2 (log1p) in any of the PRO1-2, CO1-2, GA1-2 or GL1-2 groups.</p>

<title>RNAscope® <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title>
<p>E12.5 wildtype mouse embryos were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#P6148) in 1× PBS for 36 hours at room temperature. The fixed brains were embedded in paraffin (Histosec™ Pastilles (without DMSO, Cat#115161)), and sectioned on Leica microtome (Leica RM2255) at 5 µm.

The paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene and ethanol series, treated with RNAscope® Hydrogen Peroxide (ACD, Cat#322381) for 10 minutes, and subjected to antigen retrieval in 1× Target Retrieval Solution (ACD, Cat#322000) for 15 minutes at 99–102°C. After rinsing and dehydration, hydrophobic barriers were drawn using an ImmEdge Pen (ACD, Cat#310018), and slides were dried for 30 minutes or overnight. Protease Plus (ACD, Cat#322381) was applied for 30 minutes at 40°C, followed by hybridization of probes at 40°C for 2 hours. Probes included mouse Ebf1 (ACD, Cat#433411, C2), E2f1 (ACD, Cat#431971, C1), Insm1 (ACD, Cat#43062, C1), Sox4 (ACD, Cat#471381, C2), Tal1 (ACD, Cat#428221, C4), and Tead2 (ACD, Cat#42028, C3). Positive (ACD, Cat#320881) and negative (ACD, Cat#320871) control probes were included. C1 probes were used undiluted; C2, C3, and C4 probes were diluted 1:50 in C1 probe or Probe Diluent (ACD, Cat#300041). Slides were washed in Wash Buffer (ACD, Cat#310091) and stored in 5× saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer overnight. Amplification was conducted using AMP1, AMP2, and AMP3 reagents (30 min, 30 min, 15 min) at 40°C. Signal detection was performed with HRP channels (C1, C2, C3) and TSA Vivid Fluorophores: TSA 520 (ACD, Cat#323271),TSA 570 (ACD, Cat#323272), and TSA 650 (ACD, Cat#323273), diluted 1:1500 in RNAscope® Multiplex TSA Buffer (ACD, Cat#322809). Each HRP step included blocking and washing. Slides were counterstained with DAPI (30 seconds), mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent (Thermo Fisher, Cat#P36934), and imaged using a Zeiss AxioImager 2 microscope with Apotome 2 structured illumination. Images were processed in ImageJ, and figures prepared in Adobe Illustrator CC 2020. Slides were stored at 4°C and imaged within two weeks.</p>

Fluorescence signals were quantified for three channels in each image. The boundary of the ventricular zone (VZ) was defined manually using three points, and calculating circle boundary passing these points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>), and the distances of individual cells from the VZ were calculated in units of average cell diameter (avg. across all images). Fluorescence signals were filtered to remove background noise using a quantile threshold of 0.25. Raw fluorescence intensity was measured as the number of fluorescence dots per cell. To analyze patterns across biological replicates, fluorescence data from three independent experiments were included in the same aggregate analysis. Fluorescence intensities were normalized across replicates for each channel to account for variations in signal strength and aligned to ensure uniform spatial scaling.

<title>Analysis of the TFs interacting with the selector gene cCREs</title>
<p>To search for the regulators of selector genes, we first searched for TFs per each selector gene per cell group with conditions as follows:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The TF has a footprint in any of the cCREs linked to the selector gene with LinkPeaks abs(z-score)&gt;2 and p-value&lt;0.05, and</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>The TF is expressed &gt; 1.2 (log1p) on average in the cell group in question.</p></list-item>
</list>
Defining the common regulators between the selector genes was done by comparison of the regulators found for individual selectors based on their intersects. Statistical significance levels reported for individual regulators are defined as minimum p-value for cCRE to gene linkage for each regulator per each selector gene and maximum p-value over all selectors in the intersect. To assess whether the observed overlap in regulators among the three selector genes was greater than expected by chance, we performed a permutation-based test. First, we determined the actual set of regulators for each of the three selector genes and calculated the size of their intersection. Next, to construct a null model, we repeatedly and randomly selected three sets of regulators (of the same sizes as the original sets) from the complete universe of candidate regulators, recalculating the intersection size each time. With 1 000 000 iterations we obtained a distribution of intersection sizes expected under random selection. The empirical p-value was then estimated as the proportion of these randomized trials in which the intersection size was equal to or larger than the observed intersection. If no randomized trial matched or exceeded the observed intersection size, we reported the p-value as less than an upper bound (e.g., &lt;1/(N+1)), reflecting the rarity of the observed overlap under the assumed null hypothesis.</p>

<p>Target genes were defined according to following conditions:

As our GSEA axis should be considered relevant from both ends, one end signifying targets overexpressed in GA1-2 and another in GL1-2, we additionally looked for leading edge (traditionally called leading and trailing edges in GSEA analysis) genes from both ends. We defined GA1-2 leading edge genes to be the ones before the GSEA enrichment score gains its maximum, and GL1-2 leading edge genes to be ones after the GSEA enrichment score gains its minimum.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic dynamics and chromatin accessibility in differentiating rV2 GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons</title>
<p>To understand the sequence of gene expression changes that correlate with the bifurcation of the rV2 GABAergic and glutamatergic cell lineages, we first studied the transcriptome and the genome accessibility in developing rV2 neurons. We used data from the scRNAseq of the ventral r1 region of E12.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>), where the rV2 lineages were identified based on the expression of markers of common proliferative progenitors (<italic>Ccnb1</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>) and post-mitotic precursor branches of the rV2 by markers of GABAergic (<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gad1</italic>) and glutamatergic neurons (<italic>Nkx6-1</italic>, <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Slc17a6</italic>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">C</xref>, Supplementary Table S1). Using pseudotime method VIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Stassen et al., 2021</xref>), we found that the rV2 cells were arranged on a pseudotemporal axes representing differentiating GABAergic or glutamatergic lineages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). The GABAergic and glutamatergic selector TF genes (<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic>, <italic>Vsx1</italic>, <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Lhx4</italic>) were strongly expressed in the post-mitotic precursors at lineage bifurcation point and at the start of the lineage branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>To find the gene regulatory elements in the rV2 cell types, we applied scATACseq in E12.5 ventral r1 cells. We then clustered the r1 scATACseq cells based on their open chromatin regions (called features below; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>), followed by integration with the E12.5 scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) that provides an estimate of the transcript levels for scATACseq measured cells. From the scATACseq data, we readily identified the cell clusters of the rV2 lineage, expressing TFs specific for GABAergic and glutamatergic cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We identified two progenitor cell groups (PRO1, PRO2), rV2 common precursors (CO), GABAergic neuron branch consisting of 4 cell groups and glutamatergic branch of 2 cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>). Further clustering of the isolated rV2 cell groups yielded two groups of common precursors (CO1, CO2), six cell groups in the GABAergic branch (GA1-GA6), and five cell groups in the glutamatergic branch (GL1-GL5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref>,). The placement of the scATACseq r1 cells in the pseudotemporal axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) shows that, as expected, the early state in pseudotime is assigned to cells expressing markers of proliferative progenitors and early post-mitotic common precursors, while late pseudotime state cells express markers of differentiating GABAergic and glutamatergic precursors. Cell clusters have consistently increasing average pseudotime from PRO1 to the end of both GABAergic and glutamatergic branches (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We next compared the scRNAseq and scATACseq cell cluster markers across the rV2 lineages (top 25 marker genes per cluster, similarity testing using hypergeometric distribution) (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Table 2, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). The similarity scores indicate discrete matches between the scATACseq and scRNAseq clusters, with the exception of PRO1 and PRO2 largely missing a counterpart in the scRNAseq clusters, as the rV2 progenitor cells did not clearly segregate in the scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>, progenitor markers <italic>Nes</italic> and <italic>Phgdh</italic>) and were therefore excluded from the rV2 lineage analyses. In conclusion, open chromatin features largely reflected the gene expression in the ventral r1 and allowed placing the developing rV2 neurons in cell groups and in a pseudotemporal order.</p>

<title>Chromatin accessibility profiles in genomic regions around selector genes in rV2-lineage subclusters</title>
<p>Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 are required for GABAergic fate selection in rV2 and their expression is activated in the GABAergic post-mitotic precursors, whereas Vsx2 is expressed in the glutamatergic precursors soon after rV2 lineage bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Achim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>). To understand the mechanisms behind activation of the expression of these lineage-specific TFs, we analysed the accessibility of chromatin features in <italic>Tal1, Gata2, Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> loci in the rV2 cell groups. To find selector gene-associated chromatin features, we tested all features within the topologically associating domains (TAD) around the transcription start sites (TSS) of the selector TF genes for the correlation between the feature accessibility and the target gene expression. We defined the features linked to the target gene with LinkPeaks z-score below -2 or above 2 and p-value &lt;0.05 as candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCRE) of the gene (Supplementary Table 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Stuart et al., 2021</xref>)).</p>
<p>The <italic>Tal1</italic> locus, +/-50 kb of the TSS, contains five genes (<italic>Cmpk1, Stil, Tal1, Pdzk1ip1</italic> and <italic>Cyp4×1</italic>) and 20 scATAC features (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Tal1</italic> TAD contains 107 features. Some of the features at the <italic>Tal1</italic> locus were accessible in all the cell groups, including the progenitors (PRO1, PRO2, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). These include features at the promoter regions of <italic>Cmpk1</italic> and <italic>Stil</italic> (Supplementary Table 3). Other features become accessible in both GABAergic and glutamatergic precursors after the bifurcation of the lineages, like the <italic>Tal1</italic> +77.4 kb cCRE located at the promoter region of the neuronally expressed <italic>Cyp4×1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bylund et al., 2002</xref>). Accessibility of 15 out of the 107 features in the TAD containing the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene were linked to the <italic>Tal1</italic> expression (p-value &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary Table 3, <italic>Tal1</italic>). Notably, the accessibility of <italic>Tal1</italic> cCREs at +0.7 and +40 kb correlated closely with the expression level of <italic>Tal1</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>), strongly increasing in the earliest GABAergic precursors (GA1) and maintained at a lower level in the more mature GABAergic precursor groups (GA2-GA6), as well as <italic>Pdzk1ip1</italic>, which is activated transiently in the earliest GABAergic precursors (GA1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, RNA expression). Other features within the <italic>Tal1</italic> gene (+7 kb) as well as in more distal intergenic area (+15.1, +16, +16.4 and +23 kb cCREs) were also found to correlate with the activation of the <italic>Tal1</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Remarkably, the identified <italic>Tal1</italic> promoter feature (<italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7kb cCRE) contains <italic>Tal1</italic> midbrain and hindbrain-spinal cord enhancers characterized earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bockamp et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sinclair et al., 1999</xref>).

</fig>
<p>Similarly to <italic>Tal1</italic> locus, the TADs of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> genes contained features where accessibility increased specifically in the GABAergic precursors, correlating with the activation of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> mRNA expression (Supplementary Table 3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Two <italic>Gata2</italic> cCREs, at -3.7 kb and +0 kb, are located in the proximal and promoter regions, which have been earlier shown to function as <italic>Gata2</italic> mid- and hindbrain expression enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Nozawa et al., 2009</xref>), as well as critical <italic>Gata2</italic> autoregulation elements in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kobayashi-Osaki et al., 2005</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>). We also identified an intronic <italic>Gata2</italic> cCRE at +11.6 kb that may mediate the regulation of <italic>Gata2</italic> expression in the spinal cord V2 interneurons by Gata2:Tal1 co-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>). Four additional previously uncharacterized <italic>Gata2</italic> cCREs were identified downstream of the <italic>Gata2</italic> gene (+22, +25.3, +32.8 and 47.5 kb cCREs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5A-B</xref>) and five more further downstream within the TAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4B</xref>, Supplementary Table 3).</p>
<p>At the <italic>Gata3</italic> locus, the GABAergic precursor –specific features included several intragenic features (<italic>Gata3</italic> +11.1 kb, +17.2 kb, +18.8 kb cCREs), and five features upstream the gene at -2.7 kb to -7.7 kb of <italic>Gata3</italic> TSS (Supplementary Table 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5C-D</xref>). The Gata3 +0.6 kb, +2.2 kb and the five upstream cCREs locate within the previously identified Gata3 CNS enhancer region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Lakshmanan et al., 1999</xref>), and two of those also match Gata3 lens expression enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Martynova et al., 2018</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). The <italic>Gata3</italic> +11.1 kb cCRE corresponds to the <italic>Gata3</italic> proximal enhancer driving expression in PNS regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lieuw et al., 1997</xref>). The <italic>Gata3</italic> +17.2 kb cCRE is located in the intron 3-4 of <italic>Gata3</italic> gene and may have enhancer activity in spinal cord V2b interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Joshi et al., 2009</xref>) (Supplementary Table 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>Importantly, accessibility of the cCREs of the GABAergic selector TF genes changed with different kinetics during neuronal differentiation. For example, the accessibility of <italic>Tal1</italic> +23 kb and <italic>Tal1</italic> +40 kb cCREs was robustly detected before and at the onset of GABAergic differentiation and declined thereafter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). The accessibility pattern of the <italic>Tal1</italic> +23 kb cCRE is particularly interesting. The feature is accessible at 3’ position early, and gains accessibility at 5’ positions concomitant with GABAergic differentiation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, accessibility). Detailed feature analysis later indicated the binding of Nkx6-1 and Ascl1 that are expressed in the rV2 neuronal progenitors, at 3’ positions, and binding of Insm1 and Tal1 TFs that are activated in early precursors, at 5’ positions (Described below, see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The accessibility of the Tal1 +0.7 kb cCRE largely reflected the <italic>Tal1</italic> mRNA expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Gata2</italic> +22 kb, +25.3 kb and +32.8 kb cCREs were accessible in the early precursors, before the opening of the <italic>Gata2</italic> -3.7 kb cCRE in GA1 and <italic>Gata2</italic> +0 kb cCRE in GA3-GA6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, distinct regulatory elements of the selector TFs may be responsible for the activation and for the maintenance of the lineage-specific expression of selector TF gene.</p>

<p><italic>Vsx2</italic> gene expression was detected in the common precursors CO1 and increased in CO2 and the glutamatergic precursors (GL1-GL5) after bifurcation of the rV2 lineages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, RNA expression). At the <italic>Vsx2</italic> locus, an intronic feature (<italic>Vsx2</italic> +20.5 kb) and the distal features at -61 kb and -21.3 kb of <italic>Vsx2</italic> TSS were robustly opened concomitant with its expression activation, whereas accessibility of the <italic>Vsx2</italic> promoter region (<italic>Vsx2</italic> +1.1 kb cCRE) and +27 kb cCRE increased later in the glutamatergic precursors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The information about the enhancers of Vsx2 brain expression is scarce, but we found that our <italic>Vsx2</italic> r1 CREs at -18.7 kb, -21.3 kb, +1.1 kb and +20.5 kb match previously characterized enhancers of <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in photoreceptor cells and retinal bipolar neurons, and contain putative autoregulatory Vsx2 biding sites occupied in developing spinal cord motor neuron and interneuron lineages (Supplementary Table 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Supplementary Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>Developmentally important gene regulatory elements are often conserved. We therefore asked if features detected by scATACseq could present more evolutionary conserved sequences than random sequences of mouse genome. To that aim, we analyzed nucleotide conservation in scATACseq features, using phastCons study data over 60 vertebrates from UCSC database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>). We calculated statistical enrichment of conserved nucleotides within exons, introns and our scATACseq features (Supplementary Table 5). Systematically, odds ratios per chromosome were highest for exons and lowest for introns, odds ratios for features were between these two. All of the odds ratios showed a significant difference from what one would expect if there were no relationship between the nucleotides within features and conservation (p=&lt; 2.43e-33, Fisher’s Exact test, Supplementary Table 5). The conservation of chromatin features is consistent with a putative role as regulatory sites.</p>
<p>In summary, we identified the genomic features that are linked to GABAergic and glutamatergic fate selector genes, and where chromatin accessibility changes specifically during rV2 neuron differentiation. Those features could represent regulatory elements of the selector genes. Furthermore, literature research revealed that the previously characterized enhancers, and especially the nervous system expression enhancers of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> mostly are found within the ATAC-features identified here (63.6 - 100% of gene enhancers overlapping ATAC-features, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcription factor activity at the putative regulatory elements of the rV2 cell fate selector genes</title>
<p>Next, we wanted to identify the TFs associated with the putative regulatory elements of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> genes. TF binding to chromatin affects its accessibility, leaving a footprint which can be detected in scATACseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bentsen et al., 2020</xref>). We applied the footprint analysis across the rV2 cell groups using the known TF binding sites (TFBS) from HOCOMOCO collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Vorontsov et al., 2023</xref>). As validation, we analyzed chromatin interactions of selected candidate TFs in E12.5 r1 using CUT&amp;Tag-sequencing (CUT&amp;Tag) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>). As a complementary method, we used ChromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schep et al., 2017</xref>) to calculate genome-wide accessibility score for each TFBS we used in the study. While ChromVAR is based on scATACseq data, this analysis is independent of the footprinting and thus provides a robust genome-wide validation of the most active TFBS.</p>
<p>Our TF footprinting analysis identified global TF activity patterns correlating with GABA- and glutamatergic neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Figure 7</xref>). To find the TFs that may regulate the expression of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic>, we identified the TFBSs at the conserved genomic locations (weighted average conservation at TFBS &gt; 0.5) within each selector gene cCRE. The results of the footprint analysis are shown for selected features of <italic>Tal1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>) and <italic>Vsx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8A</xref>,C-E), showing the TFs expressed (average RNA expression &gt; 1.2 (log1p)) in any of the four cell groups from PRO1-2, CO1-2, GA1-2 and GL1-2. We observed both common and distinct patterns of TF binding in the cCREs of <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> in the rV2 common precursors and early GABA- and glutamatergic cells. Both <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> cCREs contain conserved GC-rich areas, E-boxes, TCF class binding sites of TCF and Ebf TFs, regions of Sox TF binding elements 5’TTGT, NF I binding elements TGGCA and binding sites for various homeodomain (HD) TF-s (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8C-E</xref>). The analysis of TFBSs at the footprint regions suggested that each region may have affinity to several different TFs belonging to a TF class. For example, four Sox TFs are expressed in early rV2 lineage cells (<italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox3</italic>, <italic>Sox4</italic> and <italic>Sox11</italic>), which all may compete for the same binding sites in <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb cCRE or <italic>Vsx2</italic> -61 kb cCRE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8D</xref>).</p>
<p>To further understand the mechanisms of the activation of lineage-specific selector expression, we asked which TFs commonly and specifically regulate the three GABAergic selector TFs: <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Gata3</italic>. Search for the common regulators of GABAergic fate selectors revealed 21 TFs in CO1-2 and 22 TFs in the GA1-2 cell groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, the common regulators between the stages are overlapping partially, with the TFs associated with the neurogenic cell cycle exit predominant in the common precursors (CO) and the postmitotic differentiation and the autoregulation network TFs showing activity later, in the GABAergic precursors.</p>
<p>We next asked which upstream regulators are common to both rV2 GABAergic (<italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2, Gata3</italic>) and glutamatergic (<italic>Vsx1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2)</italic> fate selector genes. The analysis of common regulators revealed 12 TFs, including <italic>Ascl1</italic>, <italic>E2f1</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> and <italic>Vsx1</italic> may regulate both GABA- and glutamatergic selectors in the CO1-2 cell group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8F</xref>). The distinct regulators of GABA-and glutamatergic fate selectors, aside the lineage-specific autoregulatory functions of the selectors themselves, include <italic>Lhx1</italic> and <italic>En2</italic> in GABAergic sublineage (<italic>Lhx1</italic> binding <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb feature, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), and <italic>Lhx4</italic>, <italic>Shox2</italic> and <italic>Nhlh2</italic> regulating <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in the glutamatergic lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8C-E</xref>). Footprints at Nkx6-1 TFBS were detected in the cCREs of all selectors in common precursors, but after onset of differentiation become restricted to the cCREs of <italic>Vsx2</italic> and <italic>Vsx1</italic> in the glutamatergic cells. Interestingly, the <italic>Vsx2</italic> -68.8 kb cCRE contains conserved GATA TF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8E</xref>). Conversely, <italic>Vsx1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> binding sites were found in the cCREs of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, suggesting a mutual cross-regulation between the GABA-and glutamatergic selector genes. Putative <italic>Vsx1</italic> binding sites were detected in all three GABAergic fate selector genes, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, in the rV2 common precursors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, CO, CO1-2).</p>
<p>The proneural bHLH TFs appeared to contribute to the activation of the selector genes. Interestingly, <italic>Ascl1</italic> and <italic>Neurog2</italic> TFBS are found at the cCREs of both <italic>Tal1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>) and <italic>Vsx2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">D</xref>). In addition, <italic>Vsx2</italic> is regulated by <italic>Neurog1</italic> in the rV2 common precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">D</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, several cell cycle-associated TFs may contribute to the regulation of selector gene expression. Those include <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox21</italic>, <italic>Insm1, Ebf1, Ebf3, and E2f1. E2f1</italic> and <italic>Ebf1-3</italic> binding sites are located within the GC-rich areas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8C-E</xref>). The expression of <italic>E2f1</italic> declines after differentiation, while <italic>Ebf1-3</italic> are expressed in common precursors and maintained in differentiating neurons of both GABA- and glutamatergic sublineages (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Figure 8C-E</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to the footprint analysis, we analyzed the chromatin interactions of <italic>Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, Vsx2, Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic> in the E12.5 r1 by CUT&amp;Tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figure 9</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs11">Supplementary Figure 11</xref>). The binding of <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic>, as well as <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Gata3</italic> at the <italic>Tal1</italic>-linked features was confirmed by CUT&amp;Tag (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Figures 9-11</xref>), consistent with the autoregulatory activity of the GABAergic fate selector genes. Interestingly, in addition to the <italic>Tal1</italic> +0.7 kb and +40 kb cCREs, we detected <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> binding at the <italic>Tal1</italic> +23 kb cCRE, where scATACseq-footprinting did not indicate binding at conserved sites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">C</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, the regulatory feature analysis revealed several mechanisms that may contribute to the timing of activation and the maintenance of selector TF expression. Firstly, we found the binding sites of cell cycle progression or progenitor identity-associated TFs <italic>E2f1</italic> and Insm1, proneural TFs <italic>Ascl1, Neurog1, Neurog2, Neurod1</italic> and <italic>Neurod2</italic>, as well as TFs expressed after cell cycle exit, such as <italic>Sox4</italic> and <italic>Ebf3</italic> (<italic>Coe3</italic>) at the putative distal regulatory elements. Conserved binding sites for other <italic>Ebf</italic> TFs, <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Ebf2</italic> are also found in the cCREs of <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic>, but not <italic>Gata3</italic>. In addition, the proximal elements and the promoter regions of <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Tal1</italic> genes contained footprints at conserved GATA::TAL motif in the GABAergic neurons, indicating autoregulation of the selector TFs. Similarly, conserved <italic>Vsx1</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> motifs in <italic>Vsx2</italic> cCREs were associated with ATAC-footprints in the glutamatergic neurons.</p>

<sec id="s3d">
<title>Pattern of expression of the putative regulators of the selector TF expression</title>
<p>Our analysis of TFBSs in the selector gene cCREs indicated that GABAergic selector TF expression may be regulated by E2f1 and Ebf1, TFs involved in cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation. In addition, we found mediators of Hippo and Notch signalling pathways, <italic>Tead2</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic>, among the possible regulators of <italic>Tal1</italic>. To test whether the <italic>E2f1</italic>, <italic>Ebf1</italic>, <italic>Sox4</italic>, <italic>Insm1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> genes are expressed in the <italic>Tal1</italic>+ lineage precursors, we analysed their pattern of expression in the E12.5 mouse r1 by RNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation (RNAscope). In the embryonic brain, the progression of neuronal differentiation follows the apical-basal axis, as the newly born precursors exit the ventricular zone and migrate to intermediate and mantle zones. <italic>Tal1</italic> is expressed shortly after the cell cycle exit. The expression of <italic>Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> RNA overlapped with <italic>Tal1</italic> RNA expression in the intermediate zone of the ventrolateral r1 at E12.5 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">I-J</xref>). We quantified the fluorescence signal intensity along the apical-to-basal axis of the neuroepithelium, showing that the maximum intensity of <italic>Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> probe signal is reached slightly closer to the apical surface than that of <italic>Tal1</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">K</xref>). The expression of <italic>Sox4</italic> RNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-B</xref>) was detected in the neuronal cells at more basal position in the neuroepithelium, where the differentiated neurons reside. The expression patterns observed along the apical-basal axis in the E12.5 r1 neuroepithelium matched with the expression levels detected by scRNAseq in the respective cell groups (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">G-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">K-L</xref>).</p>

<p>In conclusion, <italic>Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> are expressed in the early rV2 precursors, including the <italic>Tal1</italic> expressing GABAergic cell lineage.

<title>Regulatory signature of developing rV2 GABAergic neurons</title>
<p>To shed light on the genome-wide activity of TFs in the differentiating rV2 neurons, we applied ChromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Schep et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the footprint analysis in cCREs, ChromVAR analysis indicated that accessible genomic regions in rV2 progenitor and precursor cells are enriched in <italic>Sox</italic>, <italic>NeuroD1</italic> and <italic>Nfia/b/x</italic> TF binding motifs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>).

Of these <italic>Tal1</italic> TFBSs, the activity pattern of the dual GATA:TAL binding motif (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, TAL1.H12CORE.0.P.B) was most specific to the GABAergic lineage, similar to the GATA2 and GATA3 TFBSs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). The other TFBSs of <italic>Tal1</italic> showed lower activity (TAL1.H12CORE.1.P.B) or an earlier peak of activity in common precursors with a decline after differentiation (TAL1.H12CORE.2.P.B) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Targets of the GABAergic fate selectors in the developing rhombomere 1</title>
<p>We next aimed to describe the roles of GABAergic fate selector genes in the determination of the GABA-vs glutamatergic phenotype in rV2 cell lineages in more detail. Using the combined evidence of TF footprints, TFBS conservation and <italic>in vivo</italic> CUT&amp;Tag experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>), we identified 3948 target genes of <italic>Tal1</italic>, 780 target genes of Gata2, and 721 target genes of <italic>Gata3</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). About half of the identified target genes are differentially expressed in GABA- or glutamatergic neurons (statistically significant differential expression between in GA1-2 and GL1-2 groups with p-value &lt;0.01 in Wilcoxon’s test). However, most of the identified target genes of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, and <italic>Gata3</italic> are lowly expressed in the GABA- and glutamatergic neurons, with only 30% of the genes being expressed above RNA avg(exp)&gt;0.5 (log1p) in GA1-2 or GL1-2 cell groups (Supplementary Table 6). GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) showed that <italic>Tal1</italic> target genes are expressed in both GABA- and glutamatergic neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>), while <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> target genes are overexpressed in GABAergic over glutamatergic precursors (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">M</xref>). To further characterize the identified targets, we compared the numbers of target features associated with the target gene by a positive or negative feature-to-gene expression link (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">N</xref>). The positive links outnumbered negative links by roughly factor of 2, which may reflect transcriptional activator function of the studied TFs, but also the complexity of gene regulation as there could be multiple, positive and negative links to each gene. We also calculated the amount of target genes considering their closest linked feature with distance bins of 0-5kb, 5-50kb and &gt;50kb (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">O</xref>). The results showed largely expected distribution where category of longest links contained most target genes. This is likely due to the category being limited by TAD which are often large, yielding considerable amounts of distal regulatory elements for many genes. We next calculated the expression variability of the target genes, stratified by the distance to closest selector-bound linked feature. The target genes with proximal selector-bound features (0-5 kb) show the most cell type-specific patterns (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">P</xref>). For example, the variability of proximal feature-linked <italic>Tal1</italic> target genes in rV2 cell groups was 0.509 - 0.423, and 0.282 - 0.191 for distal feature-linked genes. Thus, regardless of the large amounts of potential distal regulatory elements for many targets, the targets having a proximal selector-bound regulatory element show most drastic changes in expression over the rV2 lineage cell states. However, a few cell type-specific genes also appeared to be regulated by distal features at &gt;50 kb from TSS (<italic>St18</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>, <italic>Nhlh1</italic>) or 5-50 kb from TSS (<italic>Zfpm1</italic>, <italic>Lmo1</italic>) in the case of Tal1 targets (Supplementary Table 6). Finally, we also investigated cell type associations of the target genes (exp&gt;0.5 (log1p) in GA1-2 or GL1-2 cell groups) by calculating scores against CellMarker 2024 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hu et al., 2023</xref>), revealing clear enrichment of inhibitory interneuron markers among the Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 target genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6 G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Q</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, we analyzed the overlap of the cell type-specific target gene lists, aiming to find genes regulated by all the GABAergic fate selectors (common target genes) or by any selector TF specifically. No common target genes were found among the glutamatergic neuron specific genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6R</xref>). The genes commonly regulated by Tal1, Gata2 and Gata3 are exclusively overexpressed in the GABAergic lineage and contain genes comprising the autoregulatory and GATA co-factor networks (<italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Zfpm1</italic>, <italic>Lmo1</italic>). The GABAergic phenotype (<italic>Gad1</italic>, <italic>Gad2</italic>, <italic>Slc32a1</italic>) is regulated by Gata2 and Gata3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6S</xref>). Tal1 seems to be involved in the activation or modulation of Notch signaling pathway genes (<italic>Pdzk1ip1</italic>, <italic>Hes5</italic>). Interestingly, Tal1 also interacts with genes specific to rV2 glutamatergic cells (<italic>Lhx4</italic>, <italic>Nkx6-1</italic>), likely repressing their expression in the developing GABAergic precursors. However, as <italic>Tal1</italic> is expressed already in the common precursors of rV2 lineage, the possibility of the activation of <italic>Lhx4</italic> by Tal1 is not excluded. We also suggest the cross-regulation of GABA-and glutamatergic selector genes in the developing rV2 neuronal precursors: Gata3 may repress the <italic>Vsx2</italic> expression in the GABAergic cells, while Vsx2 may repress <italic>Lmo1</italic> in glutamatergic cells, establishing the initiated cell type-specific gene expression programs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6T</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Extensive studies during the past decades have identified several TFs instrumental for neuronal fate decisions in the embryonic brain. How these TFs are regulated and how they guide neuronal differentiation remains less understood. Differentiation of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons in the ventrolateral r1 is a good model system for TF guided cell differentiation, as in this region the activation of Tal and Gata TFs is both spatially and temporally controlled, and these TFs guide a binary selection between the two alternative cell fates. In this work, we integrated analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility and TF occupancy during bifurcation of GABAergic and glutamatergic lineages in the ventrolateral r1. Our results suggest shared mechanisms connecting selector TF activation to developmental processes and demonstrate combinatory functions of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic></p>

<title>TFs in the GABAergic fate selection</title>
<sec id="s4a1">
<title>Mechanisms behind selector TF activation</title>
<p>The homeodomain TF code, established by intercellular communication in the neuronal progenitors, defines the competence of differentiation into specific lineages. In the ventrolateral r1, the <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic>, <italic>Gata3</italic> and <italic>Vsx2</italic> TFs are activated in the region where the proliferative progenitor cells express the homeodomain TF <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Achim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Lahti et al., 2016</xref>). Our result suggests that <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> directly regulates the spatial expression pattern of the selector TFs important for acquisition of GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron phenotypes. <italic>Nkx6-1</italic> is not sufficient for selector TF expression, which is activated only when the proliferative progenitor cells exit the cell cycle and give rise to postmitotic precursors. Our results suggest that TFs <italic>E2f1</italic>, <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic> temporally control the selector TFs and connect their expression to cell-cycle exit. The expression of <italic>E2f1</italic>, <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic> is not spatially restricted, but is upregulated in early postmitotic precursors across the whole r1 neuroepithelium. Our results show that the expression of these TFs precedes activation of <italic>Tal1</italic>. <italic>E2f1</italic> is best known for its function as a positive regulator of cell cycle progression. However, there also is evidence suggesting a more complex role for <italic>E2f1</italic> in cell cycle regulation. It has been suggested that the effect of <italic>E2f1</italic> is dependent on its level of expression, low levels promoting cell cycle progression but elevated levels cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Radhakrishnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shats et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). Our results are consistent with this observation. <italic>E2f1</italic> is expressed at a low level in the proliferative progenitors, and its expression peaks concomitant to cell cycle exit. Also, <italic>Ebf1</italic> and <italic>Insm1</italic> have earlier been associated with cell cycle exit and delamination of neuronal progenitors, as well as differentiation and migration of post-mitotic precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Faedo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Garcia-Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Monaghan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Tavano et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms that guide cell cycle exit and other cell biological events of neurogenesis may also contribute to activation of neuronal selector TF expression and adoption of the neuronal phenotype.</p>

<title>Selector TFs directly autoregulate themselves and cross-regulate each other</title>
<p>Positive feedback loops are commonly found in the gene regulatory networks involving developmental selector TFs. The positive feedback loops can ensure stable cell fate decisions. Tal and Gata TFs have been shown to autoregulate their own gene expression in hematopoietic cells. Our results suggest that autoregulation also is a prominent feature of the control of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression in the developing brain. At maintaining their expression by positive feedback, these TFs appear to work together, potentially as a physical complex involving Lmo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ono et al., 1998</xref>), promoting the expression of its components. In addition to the positive cross-regulation of <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>, these TFs also interact with the genes of glutamatergic lineage-specific TFs, such as <italic>Vsx2</italic> and <italic>Lhx4</italic>, expressed in the glutamatergic precursors. We envision negative feedback allows cross-repression between the Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, Lmo1 network and Vsx2 in the cells where both alternative fate selectors are expressed. Auto- and cross-regulation would ensure robust patterns of selector TF expression, also after the initial inputs for their activation have ceased.</p>
<p>TFs often have context-dependent activating or repressive effects on their targets, and our data on chromatin occupancy cannot distinguish between the two possible outcomes. However, according to our scRNAseq and earlier studies in the developing spinal cord V2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Francius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Karunaratne et al., 2002</xref>), the time of co-expression of <italic>Gata2</italic>/<italic>3</italic> and <italic>Vsx1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> is short. In the rV2, <italic>Vsx1</italic> is expressed in the rV2 common precursors, where <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> expression is still low. Parsimonious explanations would be the negative cross-regulation and differential regulation of <italic>Lmo1</italic>. Furthermore, Vsx1 has been shown to repress the expression of <italic>Tal1</italic> in the zebrafish spinal cord V2a interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Targets of the selector TFs</title>
<p>In addition to establishing cell type-specific patterns of selector TF expression, the selector TFs are thought to be responsible for realization of neuronal identities. Our results show that a combinatory function of the selector TFs is important for adopting a GABAergic identity. This is supported by similar fate transformations observed in <italic>Tal1</italic> and <italic>Gata2</italic>/<italic>Gata3</italic> mutant embryos. Importantly, our results here highlight differences between <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> target genes. Most prominently, the activity of <italic>Tal1</italic> is not as clearly biased towards genes expressed in the GABAergic branch as are the genes regulated by <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic>. In general, the <italic>Tal1</italic>, <italic>Gata2</italic> and <italic>Gata3</italic> selector TFs appear to regulate not only GABAergic subtype–specific genes, but also genes expressed more broadly. This suggests that the function of the fate selectors is not restricted to regulation of the neuronal subtype properties such as the neurotransmitter phenotype, but they also participate in enabling the overall cellular function.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p>Our work provides insights into the complex gene regulatory networks regulating spatially and temporally controlled cell fate choices in the developing mouse brainstem. In addition to addressing principles of cell differentiation, our work may also contribute to understanding of neuropsychiatric traits and disorders. The anterior brainstem is an important center for behavioral control, and many of the behavioral disorders have a developmental basis. We have shown that, in mice, a failure in development of <italic>Tal1</italic>-dependent neurons results in severe ADHD-like behavioral changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Morello et al., 2020a</xref>). It is therefore possible that variants in the genomic regions important for gene regulation during brainstem neuron differentiation can lead to altered brain development and predisposition to neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

<title>Caveats of the study</title>
<p>Partly due to technical limitations, some of the TF – chromatin interactions are inferred only based on ATAC-footprint. Some of the footprints may signify the binding sites of several different TFs, although mostly of the same TF family, and the exact interacting TF may not be identified. In addition, chromatin interaction is only suggestive of a regulatory function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The objective of this research is to understand how the expression of key selector transcription factors, Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, involved in GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fate from a single anterior hindbrain progenitor domain is transcriptionally controlled. With suitable scRNAseq, scATAC-seq, CUT&amp;TAG, and footprinting datasets, the authors use an extensive set of computational approaches to identify putative regulatory elements and upstream transcription factors that may control selector TF expression. This data-rich study will be a valuable resource for future hypothesis testing, through perturbation approaches, of the many putative regulators identified in the study. The data are displayed in some of the main and supplemental figures in a way that makes it difficult to appreciate and understand the authors' presentation and interpretation of the data in the Results narrative. Primary images used for studying the timing and coexpression of putative upstream regulators, Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1, and Tead2 with Tal1 are difficult to interpret and do not convincingly support the authors' conclusions. There appears to be little overlap in the fluorescent labeling, and it is not clear whether the signals are located in the cell soma nucleus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength is that it is a data-rich compilation of putative upstream regulators of selector TFs that control GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fates in the brainstem. This resource now enables future perturbation-based hypothesis testing of the gene regulatory networks that help to build brain circuitry.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors seek to discover putative gene regulatory interactions underlying the lineage bifurcation process of neural progenitor cells in the embryonic mouse anterior brainstem into GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal subtypes. The authors analyze single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets derived from the ventral rhombomere 1 of embryonic mouse brainstems to annotate cell types and make predictions or where TFs bind upstream and downstream of the effector TFs using computational methods. They add data on the genomic distributions of some of the key transcription factors and layer these onto the single-cell data to get a sense of the transcriptional dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a well-defined fate decision point from brainstem progenitors that can make two very different kinds of neurons. They already know the key TFs for selecting the neuronal type from genetic studies, so they focus their gene regulatory analysis squarely on the mechanisms that are immediately upstream and downstream of these key factors. The authors use a combination of single-cell and bulk sequencing data, prediction and validation, and computation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study generates a lot of data about transcription factor binding sites, both predicted and validated, but the data are substantially descriptive. It remains challenging to understand how the integration of all these different TFs works together to switch terminal programs on and off.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The objective of this research is to understand how the expression of key selector transcription factors, Tal1, Gata2, Gata3, involved in GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fate from a single anterior hindbrain progenitor domain is transcriptionally controlled. With suitable scRNAseq, scATAC-seq, CUT&amp;TAG, and footprinting datasets, the authors use an extensive set of computational approaches to identify putative regulatory elements and upstream transcription factors that may control selector TF expression. This data-rich study will be a valuable resource for future hypothesis testing, through perturbation approaches, of the many putative regulators identified in the study. The data are displayed in some of the main and supplemental figures in a way that makes it difficult to appreciate and understand the authors' presentation and interpretation of the data in the Results narrative. Primary images used for studying the timing and coexpression of putative upstream regulators, Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1, and Tead2 with Tal1 are difficult to interpret and do not convincingly support the authors' conclusions. There appears to be little overlap in the fluorescent labeling, and it is not clear whether the signals are located in the cell soma nucleus.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength is that it is a data-rich compilation of putative upstream regulators of selector TFs that control GABAergic vs glutamatergic neuron fates in the brainstem. This resource now enables future perturbation-based hypothesis testing of the gene regulatory networks that help to build brain circuitry.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for the thoughtful assessment and recognition of the extensive datasets and computational approaches employed in our study. We appreciate the acknowledgment that our efforts in compiling data-rich resources for identifying putative regulators of key selector transcription factors (TFs)—Tal1, Gata2, and Gata3—are valuable for future hypothesis-driven research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some of the findings could be better displayed and discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the concerns raised regarding the clarity and interpretability of certain figures, particularly those related to expression analyses of candidate upstream regulators such as Insm1, E2f1, Ebf1, and Tead2 in relation to Tal1. We agree that clearer visualization and improved annotation of fluorescence signals are crucial to accurately support our conclusions. In our revised manuscript, we will enhance image clarity and clearly indicate sites of co-expression for Tal1 and its putative regulators, ensuring the results are more readily interpretable. Additionally, we will expand explanatory narratives within the figure legends to better align the figures with the results section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the authors seek to discover putative gene regulatory interactions underlying the lineage bifurcation process of neural progenitor cells in the embryonic mouse anterior brainstem into GABAergic and glutamatergic neuronal subtypes. The authors analyze single-cell RNA-seq and single-cell ATAC-seq datasets derived from the ventral rhombomere 1 of embryonic mouse brainstems to annotate cell types and make predictions or where TFs bind upstream and downstream of the effector TFs using computational methods. They add data on the genomic distributions of some of the key transcription factors and layer these onto the single-cell data to get a sense of the transcriptional dynamics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a well-defined fate decision point from brainstem progenitors that can make two very different kinds of neurons. They already know the key TFs for selecting the neuronal type from genetic studies, so they focus their gene regulatory analysis squarely on the mechanisms that are immediately upstream and downstream of these key factors. The authors use a combination of single-cell and bulk sequencing data, prediction and validation, and computation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We also appreciate the thoughtful comments from Reviewer #2, highlighting the strengths of our approach in elucidating gene regulatory interactions that govern neuronal fate decisions in the embryonic mouse brainstem. We are pleased that our focus on a critical cell-fate decision point and the integration of diverse data modalities, combined with computational analyses, has been recognized as a key strength.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study generates a lot of data about transcription factor binding sites, both predicted and validated, but the data are substantially descriptive. It remains challenging to understand how the integration of all these different TFs works together to switch terminal programs on and off.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer #2 correctly points out that while our study provides extensive data on predicted and validated transcription factor binding sites, clearly illustrating how these factors collectively interact to regulate terminal neuronal differentiation programs remains challenging. We acknowledge the inherently descriptive nature of the current interpretation of our combined datasets.</p>
<p>In our revision, we will clarify how the different data types support and corroborate one another, highlighting what we consider the most reliable observations of TF activity. Additionally, we will revise the discussion to address the challenges associated with interpreting the highly complex networks of interactions within the gene regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank both reviewers for their constructive feedback, which we believe will significantly enhance the quality and accessibility of our manuscript.</p>
