<title>Abstract</title><p>Chemokine receptors are GPCRs that regulate chemotactic migration of a wide variety of cells including immune and cancer cells. Most chemokine receptors contain features associated with the ability to stimulate G protein signaling during β-arrestin-mediated receptor internalization into endosomes. As endosomal signaling of certain non-GPCR receptors plays a major role in cell migration, we chose to investigate the potential role of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling on mechanisms governing this function. Applying a combination of pharmacological and cell biological approaches, we demonstrate that the model chemokine receptor CCR7 recruits G protein and β-arrestin simultaneously upon chemokine stimulation, which enables internalized receptors to activate G protein from endosomes. Furthermore, spatiotemporal-resolved APEX2 proteome profiling shows that endosomal CCR7 uniquely enriches specific Rho GTPase regulators as compared to plasma membrane CCR7, which is directly associated with enhanced activity of the Rho GTPase Rac1 and chemotaxis of immune T cells. As Rac1 drives the formation of membrane protrusions during chemotaxis, our findings suggest an important integrated function of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling in cell migration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chemokines are small proteins secreted from locations of physiological damage such as infection and inflammation. From these locations a gradient of chemokines is generated that attracts immune cells by activating their cell surface chemokine receptors, triggering cell migration and differentiation to combat the pathophysiological state. The chemokine system is also taken advantage of by certain cancer cells including melanoma, glioblastoma, prostate, gastric, pancreatic, esophageal, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and breast cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In malignant cells, upregulation of chemokine receptors allows them to invade and metastasize to locations distinct from their origin and from where specific chemokines are secreted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There exist 23 chemokine receptors that belong to the highly druggable superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Canonically, GPCRs activate heterotrimeric G proteins (Gαβγ) at the cell surface, causing downstream signaling throughout the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. This initial phase of G protein signaling is terminated via a specialized desensitization mechanism that includes phosphorylation of receptors by GPCR kinases and subsequent recruitment of β-arrestins (βarrs) to the phosphorylated receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. βarrs engage receptors at an overlapping transmembrane core region to where G proteins bind, and thus βarr recruitment to the receptor sterically blocks further G protein activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, βarrs promote internalization of GPCRs into endosomes, thereby removing them from the source of the activating ligand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent work has shown that some GPCRs continue to activate G proteins following βarr-mediated internalization into endosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. As G protein and βarr association to GPCRs have historically been considered mutually exclusive events, endosomal G protein signaling is difficult to reconcile within the general understanding of GPCR signaling. However, our recent work showed that certain GPCRs containing serine/threonine phosphorylation site clusters in their carboxy-terminal tail bind to βarrs in a specific conformation termed “tail conformation”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. In this conformation, βarr only interacts with the receptor carboxy-terminal tail thereby permitting the receptor transmembrane core to bind to G proteins simultaneously to form a GPCR–G protein– βarr complex or ‘megaplex’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The formation of these megaplexes highlights how certain receptors that form strong association with βarrs can continue to stimulate G protein signaling over prolonged periods of time after they have been internalized into endosomes by βarrs. Despite having established a mechanistic understanding underlying endosomal G protein signaling by internalized GPCRs, knowledge about its functional role remains minimal.</p>
<p>Most chemokine receptors couple to similar G protein subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> and contain serine/threonine clusters in their carboxy-terminal tail (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which raises the possibility that formation of megaplexes and endosomal G protein signaling are general mechanisms applied by these receptors to influence physiological responses such as cell migration. Interestingly, endosomal signaling by other non-GPCR receptor systems such as receptor tyrosine kinases have a profound role in cell migration and control transport of various signaling complexes and other proteins between the cell surface and endosomal compartments during this process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Therefore, our work here tests the hypothesis that chemokine receptors can stimulate G proteins from endosomes to regulate common signaling networks or ‘signalosomes’ that direct cell migration.</p>

<title>CCR7-induced G protein signaling is unaffected by βarr recruitment and βarr-mediated receptor endocytosis</title>
<p>To study the potential role of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling we used the model receptor CCR7. This receptor is an ideal model receptor to study endosomal signaling as it is activated by two endogenous chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 equally effective at 100 nM<sup>22</sup>; compared with the full agonist CCL19 that robustly stimulates G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling, receptor phosphorylation, βarr recruitment, and CCR7 internalization, the agonist CCL21 promotes full G<sub>i/o</sub> protein activation but only partial receptor phosphorylation, βarr recruitment, and internalization of CCR7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Using the enhanced bystander bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (EbBRET)-based biosensors RlucII-βarr1/2 and cell surface-anchored rGFP-CAAX to monitor βarr1/2 recruitment to plasma membrane upon chemokine-stimulation in CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, we confirmed that activating CCR7 by CCL19 leads to robust βarr1/2-recruitment, whereas CCL21 only promotes partial βarr1/2-recruitment responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). Co-expressing RlucII-βarr1/2 and the endosomally-located rGFP-Rab5 in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, CCL19 stimulation leads to similar strong βarr1/2 trafficking to endosomes whereas CCL21 stimulation of CCR7 only causes a minor translocation of βarr1/2 to the endosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B-C</xref>). No enhanced EbBRET between RlucII-βarr1/2 and rGFP-CAAX/Rab5 was detected upon chemokine stimulation in HEK293 cells that do not express CCR7 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A-B</xref>). These results suggest that CCR7 recruits and is internalized by βarrs robustly when stimulated with CCL19, but only to a modest degree by CCL21. Similar results were found when using β-galactosidase enzyme complementation-based DiscoverX assay to monitor direct βarr2 recruitment to CCR7 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C-D</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, to investigate how CCL19/CCL21-stimulated βarrs-recruitment affects CCR7 internalization in real time, we applied a split NanoLuc (or NanoBiT) approach in which the small-BiT (SmBiT) is fused the carboxy-terminal of CCR7 and the large-BiT (LgBiT) is fused to the cell surface anchor CAAX. In resting state, the CCR7-SmBiT and LgBiT-CAAX are in subcellular proximity at the plasma membrane and form functional nanoluciferase enzymes, which catalyzes the conversion of coelenterazine h resulting in emission of a bright luminescence signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Upon activation and internalization of CCR7, the CCR7-SmBiT is removed from the cell surface-located LgBiT-CAAX which results in a decrease in the luminescence signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Strong and immediate reduction in this signal was observed when the cells were stimulated with CCL19 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). In contrast, CCL21-stimulated CCR7 only led to a modest decrease in signal suggesting that CCL19-stimulation leads to robust CCR7 internalization whereas most CCR7 stays at the plasma membrane upon CCL21 activation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). In addition to this approach, we also measured chemokine-stimulated trafficking of CCR7-SmBiT to the early endosomal FYVE-LgBiT marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). In this case, CCL19 stimulation led to a robust increase in luminescence whereas CCL21 activation only led to a partial increase in the signal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-H</xref>). Interestingly, the kinetic patterns of the signals indicate that the trafficking of CCR7 to endosomes was slower and more transient as compared to its removal from the cell surface, which could be a result of further trafficking of the receptor to late or recycling endosomes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-H</xref>). Moreover, CCL19/CCL21-stimulation of receptor internalization to endosomes is specific to CCR7 as none of the chemokines promote internalization or trafficking to endosomes of the vasopressin type 2 receptor (V<sub>2</sub>R)-SmBiT construct (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E-F</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, to investigate how βarrs recruitment and receptor internalization affect G protein signaling in real-time, we applied the cAMP sensor CAMYEL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> to monitor G<sub>i/o</sub> activity in HEK293-CCR7 cells. In contrast to βarrs recruitment and receptor internalization, CCL19 and CCL21 challenge inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production to a similar extent in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I-J</xref>), but had no effect on the cAMP response in mock transfected HEK293 cells (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1G-H</xref>). This supports previous observations, which suggest that both CCL19 and CCL21 act as full agonists in stimulating G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Interestingly, this G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling was sustained throughout the experiment and not acutely desensitized by βarrs recruitment and/or receptor internalization as other receptor systems (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I-J</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>CCR7 engages with βarr1 and Gi protein simultaneously upon chemokine stimulation</title>
<p>Surprisingly, neither the degree of βarr recruitment nor receptor internalization appear to affect CCR7-mediated G protein signaling as expected for most GPCRs. As we recently found a correlation between the presence of phosphorylation site clusters in GPCRs and their ability to form GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, here we hypothesized that CCL19-CCR7 stimulates G<sub>i/o</sub> while being internalized into endosomes by βarrs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). As numerous G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled GPCRs recently were demonstrated to co-couple with G protein and βarrs, this hypothesis seems plausible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast, since CCL21 challenge only leads to minor CCR7 internalization, most of the CCL21-CCR7-mediated G<sub>i/o</sub> activation take place at the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Schematic illustration of the working hypothesis. CCR7-mediated G protein signaling does not appear to be affected by βarr recruitment or receptor internalization. Therefore, we hypothesized that CCR7 associates and internalizes with βarr in the ‘tail’ conformation where βarr does not block the G protein-binding site within CCR7. As this site is available, CCR7 can interact simultaneously with G protein and βarr to form a CCR7–G<sub>i/o</sub>–βarr megaplex, which enables the receptor to stimulate G proteins while being internalized into endosomes.

<p>Simultaneous GPCR association with G protein and βarr is facilitated by βarrs complexing exclusively through the phosphorylated receptor carboxy-terminal tail. We have previously demonstrated that other GPCRs with carboxy-terminal phosphorylation site clusters bind to βarrs in this tail conformation, and thus, it seemed likely that CCR7 could form them as well. To test this, we used a βarr1 mutant where the region of βarr1 that interacts with GPCR transmembrane cores, the fingerloop (FL), is deleted (βarr1-ΔFL). We showed previously using negative stain electron microscopy and single-particle averaging that βarr1-ΔFL almost entirely forms tail conformation complexes with GPCRs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Using the EbBRET pair RlucII-βarr1-ΔFL and rGFP-CAAX (plasma membrane-anchored rGFP) in CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells, we probed the degree of βarr1-ΔFL recruitment to CCR7 in response to CCL19, CCL21, or vehicle. In addition, we tested how well βarr1-ΔFL internalizes with CCR7 into endosomes using the EbBRET pair RlucII-βarr1-ΔFL and rGFP-Rab5 (early endosome-anchored rGFP). Interestingly, both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation led to recruitment of βarr1-ΔFL to CCR7 at the membrane although CCL19 promoted this recruitment to a significantly higher degree than CCL21 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Furthermore, CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation promote βarr1-ΔFL translocation to endosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). No response to chemokine stimulation was observed in mock transfected HEK293 cells that do not express CCR7 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref>). These results indicate that CCR7 can form tail conformation complexes with βarr1 in cells and that the stability of this complex is sufficiently strong for βarr1 to internalize the receptor into endosomes.</p>
<p>Since CCR7 forms tail conformation complexes with βarr1 upon agonist stimulation where the G protein binding site is available, we next sought to interrogate whether the receptor binds to βarrs and G<sub>i/o</sub> simultaneously (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). To do this, we used a NanoBiT approach where SmBiT is fused to βarr1 and LgBiT is fused to the Gα subunit. If CCR7 recruits G protein and βarr1 simultaneously, the SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-G will come into close proximity resulting in a luminescence signal. Instead of using the full-length Gα subunit for this approach as done previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, we used a truncated surrogate version commonly referred to as miniGi. MiniG proteins are engineered Gα subunits that have been developed for the major Gα subunit families (G<sub>s</sub>, G<sub>i/o</sub>, G<sub>q/11</sub>, and G<sub>12/13</sub>). Key modifications of these Gα subunits include: 1) a truncated N-terminal that deletes membrane anchors and Gβγ-binding surface; 2) deletion of the α-helical domain; 3) mutations that improve protein stability <italic>in vitro</italic>; and 4) a mutation in the C-terminal α5 helix that uncouples GPCR binding from nucleotide release, therefore stabilizing receptor– miniG protein complexes in the presence of guanine nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. These alterations also enable miniG proteins to report receptor activation in living cells by measuring their recruitment from the cytosol to GPCRs at different membrane compartments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Such properties are also beneficial when monitoring simultaneous recruitment of SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniG to GPCRs. Since both probes are expressed in the cytosol where they randomly collide, simultaneous translocation to the receptor in the cell membrane will lead to a very specific increase in luminescence (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). In contrast, using a wild-type full length Gα subunit and βarr NanoBiT probes, which are located at the plasma membrane and cytosol, respectively, recruitment of βarrs to the receptor could lead to potential bystander effects as a result of βarrs-translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>In HEK293-CCR7 cells expressing SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniGi, CCL19-stimulation leads to a robust increase in luminescence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B-C</xref>). This signal was specific for miniGi as stimulation of CCR7 in cells expressing SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniGs led to a small decrease in luminescence (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B-C</xref>). This reduction in basal luminescence might be caused by a reduction of random collision between SmBiT-βarr1 and LgBiT-miniGs upon CCR7 stimulation where SmBiT-βarr1, but not LgBiT-miniGs, translocates to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that CCL19-stimulated CCR7 recruits G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs simultaneously. Next, we compared the ability of CCL19 and CCL21 to provoke co-coupling of G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs to CCR7. Interestingly, both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulated co-coupling of G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs to CCR7, although CCL19 promoted formation of these complexes to a significantly larger degree than CCL21 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D-E</xref>). The response to chemokine stimulation was not observed in mock transfected HEK293 cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>
<p>GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes have been described as a mechanism by which GPCRs that bind βarrs exceptionally well via the phosphorylated C-terminal tail can promote endosomal G protein signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, we investigated whether G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarrs are recruited simultaneously to internalized CCR7 in endosomes using confocal microscopy. For this purpose, CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells co-expressing βarr2-Strawberry and Halo-miniGi were stimulated with either CCL19 or CCL21 for 30 min whereafter the subcellular location of these two probes was assessed by confocal microscopy. In this setup, CCL19-CCR7 recruited βarr2-Strawberry and Halo-miniGi to endosomal-shaped intracellular locations whereas this co-localization was minor for CCL21-CCR7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that CCL19 stimulation leads to robust endosomal and CCR7-mediated recruitment of G<sub>i/o</sub> and βarr1.</p>

<title>Stimulation of CCR7 by CCL19 leads to robust activation of Gi/o signaling from endosomes</title>
<p>To test whether the internalized CCR7 stimulates G<sub>i/o</sub> from endosomal compartments, we used the NanoBiT biosensor pair Rap1GAP-SmBiT and LgBiT-FYVE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Rap1GAP is an effector protein that specifically binds to active G<sub>i/o</sub>, but not to inactive G<sub>i/o</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and thus, endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> activation can be detected by measuring the recruitment of Rap1GAP-SmBiT to the endosomal marker LgBiT-FYVE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Using this approach, we observed that both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulate recruitment of Rap1GAP-SmBiT to LgBiT-FYVE in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). Similar to CCR7 internalization, CCL19 facilitated this response to a significant higher degree as compared to CCL21 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-C</xref>). In addition, the recruitment of Rap1GAP-SmBiT to LgBiT-FYVE was blunted by the G<sub>i/o</sub> inhibitor pertussis toxin (PTX), and was not observed in mock transfected HEK293 (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-C</xref>). These results indicate that internalized CCR7 promotes endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> activation.</p>

<p>To further validate if CCR7 activates G<sub>i/o</sub> at endosomes, we measured translocation of RlucII-miniGi protein to the early endosomal marker rGFP-Rab5a by EbBRET in response to CCR7 challenge (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Using this approach, CCL19 stimulation led to a strong and significant increase in EbBRET signaling between RlucII-miniGi and rGFP-Rab5a indicating that CCL19-bound CCR7 indeed activates G<sub>i/o</sub> robustly from endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). In contrast, CCL21 stimulation provoked a small yet significant increase of EbBRET response, demonstrating that G<sub>i/o</sub> protein is activated from endosomes by CCL21-bound CCR7 to a minor extent (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar trend was also observed by confocal microscopy visualization of CCR7-expressing HEK293 cells co-expressing Halo-miniGi and either the plasma membrane marker RFP-Lck or the early endosomal marker RFP-EEA1. In cells expressing RFP-Lck, CCR7 activation with either CCL19 or CCL21 leads to recruitment of Halo-miniGi to the cell surface (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-G</xref>). As expected, no significant difference between CCL19-and CCL21-stimulated translocation of Halo-miniGi to the plasma membrane was detected. However, in cells expressing RFP-EEA1, activation by CCL19, and to a minor degree CCL21, resulted in co-localization of Halo-miniGi and RFP-EEA1 at endosomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H-I</xref>). Together these results suggest that CCL19-CCR7 promotes robust G protein activation from endosomes whereas CCL21-CCR7 predominantly activates G<sub>i/o</sub> at the cell surface and to a modest degree from endosomes.</p>

<title>CCR7 assembles distinct signalosomes upon stimulation with either CCL19 or CCL21</title>
<p>Limited knowledge exists regarding functional outcomes of endosomal G protein signaling by internalized GPCRs, particularly chemokine receptors. Thus, to examine the impact of compartmentalized CCR7 signaling on downstream effectors, we performed unbiased mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteome profiling using APEX2. APEX2 is an engineered ascorbate peroxidase enzyme that we fused to the CCR7 carboxy-terminal and uses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant to catalyze a one electron oxidation of various small molecule substrates including biotin-tyramide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Oxidation of biotin-tyramide leads to generation of a highly reactive and short-lived (&lt;1 ms) biotin-phenoxyl radical that conjugates to endogenous proteins that are in close proximity to the APEX2 enzyme (∼20 nm, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Thus, the APEX2 application allows for spatiotemporal control of the biotinylation process with high precision. The resulting biotinylated proteins are then enriched with pull-down experiments using neutravidin beads, and their identities analyzed by MS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Schematic illustration of the workflow behind CCR7-APEX2-mediated biotinylation created with BioRender.com. First, the cells are loaded with biotin-tyramide (biotin-T) followed by stimulation of CCR7 by 100 nM CCL19 or CCL21 for 0 min, 2 min, 10 min, or 25 min. For the last 1 min of chemokine-stimulation hydrogen peroxide is added, which initiates the APEX2-mediated oxidation of biotin-tyramide into highly reactive and short-lived radicals. These radicals bind to proteins within close proximity to the APEX2 enzyme (∼20nm), and thus, label proteins that are in complex with or in close proximity chemokine-stimulated CCR7. Next, the cells are lysed and the resulting biotinylated proteins are captured on neutravidin (Neu) beads followed by extensive washing. Finally, all biotin-labeled proteins are eluted, identified, and analyzed by LC-MS. (B) Western blot analysis of HEK293-CCR7-APEX2 cell lysates, which shows that the biotinylation only takes place in the presence of both biotin-tyramide and hydrogen peroxide. Biotinylated proteins were detected using streptavidin-alexa488. (C) Silver staining of the pull-down experiments demonstrating that the enrichment of biotinylated proteins using neutravidin-coated beads is highly specific. In the control sample, the bound fraction only displays neutravidin band on the SDS-PAGE, whereas the labeled sample shows multiples bands of biotinylated proteins.</p></caption>

<p>Receptor functionality of the CCR7-APEX2 construct was confirmed by assessing its ability to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP production in response to CCL19 stimulation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4</xref>). In addition, we verified that the APEX2 portion of fusion proteins only biotinylates proteins in the presence of both biotin-tyramide and hydrogen peroxide as expected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Using neutravidin beads, we demonstrated that proteins were pulled-down from HEK293-CCR7-APEX2 cell lysates where the biotinylation process had been initiated, whereas only negligible proteins were pulled-down in untreated cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). Together these results indicate that both receptor and APEX2’s enzyme functions of the CCR7-APEX2 fusion are intact.</p>
<p>Using our experimental setup, we stimulated HEK293-CCR7-APEX2 cells pretreated with biotin-tyramide with either CCL19 or CCL21 for 0 minute, 2 minutes, 10 minutes or 25 minutes. Hereafter, the biotinylation reaction was initiated by addition of hydrogen peroxide for exactly 1 min, followed by extensive washing, cell lysis, enrichment of biotinylated proteins, and MS profiling.</p>
<p>From the MS profiling we identified a total of 579 proteins, whose enrichment was changed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and change in intensity of log<sub>2</sub> &gt; 1) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-B</xref>). Among robustly enriched proteins by CCR7 activation, several are involved in functions related to vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, cytoskeletal dynamics, and cell migration among others (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Furthermore, as CCR7 is trafficked from the plasma membrane to endosomes within the first minutes of stimulation, we also included functionally validated APEX2-fused spatial references, PM-APEX2, ENDO-APEX2, and CYTO-APEX2 to control for the potential increase in random collisions between CCR7 and endosomal proteins that might occur upon receptor internalization (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5B</xref>-D and S6)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Proteins enriched by both ENDO-APEX2 (as compared to both CYTO-APEX2 and PM-APEX2) and chemokine-stimulated CCR7-APEX2 include SNX3, RAB9A, ARH, and CCD93 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>). Thus, these proteins might be enriched by CCR7-APEX2 due to chemokine-stimulated translocation from the plasma membrane to endosomes rather than participating in multiprotein functional complexes or signalosomes forming at CCR7.</p>

<p>As expected, proteins involved in receptor and vesicular trafficking including RIC, SNX17, VA0D1, ARRB2, and DYN3, among others, were enriched over the entire time course of CCR7 activation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Most of these proteins were more enriched by CCL19 stimulation as compared to CCL21 challenge. In addition, we observed enrichment of endosomal proteins such as STX7, STX12, and VTI1B for both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Interestingly, the lysosomal marker LAMP1 was enriched by CCL19 and to a lesser degree by CCL21 after 25 minutes of stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Proteins involved in receptor recycling such as SNX6, RAB7L, and GGA3 were also enriched at the later stages of CCR7 activation particularly when stimulated with CCL21 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). These results indicate that the trafficking pattern of CCR7 upon chemokine stimulation is tightly regulated between lysosomal degradation and endosomal recycling.</p>
<p>Among enriched signaling proteins, we observed robust enrichment of proteins regulating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate signaling (ERLN1/2, IP3KA), diacyl glycerol signaling (DGKQ), calcium mobilization at the endoplasmic reticulum (TMCO1), and activity of the Rho GTPases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>-G). These are all involved in signaling events downstream of heterotrimeric G protein activation. Another interesting signaling protein enriched by CCR7 activation includes a member of the eyes absent (EYA) subfamily of protein, EYA2.

<title>Endosomal Gi/o signaling is important for Rac1 activation and chemotaxis</title>
<p>Rho GTPases such as RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 regulate important aspects of chemotactic cell migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Activity of these effectors are regulated by other proteins such as Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and Rho GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Our APEX2-based proteomics results demonstrate that a number of these Rho GTPase regulators are enriched by chemokine-stimulation of CCR7, and thus, potentially form part of larger CCR7 signalosomes that control downstream Rho GTPase activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-G</xref>). Interestingly, some of these regulators, including RHG26, ARG28, RHG29, ACK1, and BORG5, were differentially enriched upon CCL19 or CCL21 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that CCR7 signaling modulates activity of cell migratory Rho GTPases specifically at distinct cellular locations. To test this hypothesis, we focused on RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Upon activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, recruit protein kinase N1 (PKN1), p21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein 1 (WAS1), respectively. We assessed the proximity of these biosensor pairs in real-time upon chemokine stimulation by the NanoBiT approach in HEK293-CCR7 cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Using this setup, we found that both CCL19 and CCL21 stimulated RhoA and Cdc42 activation to a similar extent, which indicates that the spatial aspect of G protein activation does not appear to influence RhoA and Cdc42 signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B-C</xref> and 6F-G). In contrast, CCL19 promoted Rac1 signaling to a significantly greater extent than CCL21 stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D-E</xref>). No change in RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 activity upon chemokine challenge was detected HEK293 cells that do not express CCR7 (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7A-C</xref>). Pre-incubating the HEK293-CCR7 cells with the G<sub>i/o</sub> inhibitor PTX, virtually eliminated the chemokine-induced activation of Rac1, indicating that CCR7-stimulateted Rac1 signaling is mediated via a G<sub>i/o</sub>-dependent mechanism (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H-I</xref>). Interestingly, pre-treatment of the HEK293-CCR7 cells with the endocytosis inhibitor Dyngo-4a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> reduced chemokine-stimulated CCR7 internalization and Rac1 activation robustly (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6J-K</xref> and S7D-E). This reduction was significantly smaller as compared to cells pre-incubated with an inactive Dyngo compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6J-K</xref> and S7D-E). Furthermore, overexpression of the hemagglutinin-tagged dominant negative dynamin 1 K44A mutant (HA-Dyn-K44A) diminished chemokine-activated CCR7 internalization and Rac1 activity suggesting that CCR7-mediated Rac1 activation depends on receptor internalization (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6L-M</xref> and S7F-H). Also, pre-incubating the cells with the endocytosis inhibitor PitStop2, which acts on clathrin rather than dynamin, led to a severe reduction in chemokine-stimulated CCR7 internalization and Rac1 activity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6N-O</xref> and S7I-J). Finally, we mutated all potential serine/threonine phosphorylation sites in the carboxy-terminal tail of CCR7 and found that this CCR7-ΔST construct expresses well at the cell surface, but does not internalize upon CCL19 stimulation (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7K-M</xref>). When expressed in HEK293 cells, the ability of CCR7-ΔST to activate Rac1 in response to chemokine-stimulation is severely reduced as compared to wild-type CCR7 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6P-Q</xref>). Together, these results provide a strong basis for endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling by internalized CCR7 as a mechanism to activate Rac1.</p>

<p>As Rac1 is a key regulator of chemotaxis, we next tested the ability of CCL19 and CCL21 to promote cell migration of endogenously CCR7-expressing Jurkat T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> towards either CCL19 or CCL21. As in HEK293-CCR7 cells, CCL19 and CCL21 stimulation led to similar inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in Jurkat T cells confirming that CCR7 activation by either chemokine results in comparable stimulation of G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). Interestingly, Jurkat T cells migrated more efficiently towards a gradient of CCL19 as compared with CCL21, which was assessed by the transwell chemotaxis assay (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). These findings raised the possibility that endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling plays a major role in chemotaxis. To test this hypothesis, we pre-treated the Jurkat T cells with the G<sub>i/o</sub> inhibitor PTX, which almost completely abolished the ability of the cells to migrate towards both CCL19 and CCL21 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Interestingly, pre-incubation with the endocytosis inhibitors Dyngo-4a or PitStop2 led to a significant reduction in chemotaxis of both CCL19 and CCL21-stimulated cells as compared to the inactive Dyngo or PitNot compounds, respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D-E</xref>). Finally, as CCR7-mediated endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling was shown to enhance Rac1 activity, we pre-treated Jurkat T-cells with the Rac1 inhibitor EHT1864. As expected, EHT1864 reduced Jurkat T-cell chemotaxis towards both CCL19 and CCL21 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>). Collectively, these finding suggest that endosomal G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling by internalized CCR7 promote chemotaxis of Jurkat T cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Historically, GPCRs have been thought to activate heterotrimeric G proteins exclusively from the cell surface, which leads to downstream signaling events that regulate cell physiological responses. This G protein signaling has been characterized as short-lived due to a specialized desensitization mechanism that includes receptor phosphorylation by GPCR kinases and subsequent recruitment of βarrs to the phosphorylated receptor. The GPCR–βarr interaction both uncouples G protein from the receptor and promotes receptor endocytosis, which are hallmarks of receptor desensitization.</p>
<p>This paradigm, however, has been challenged by multiple observations, which show GPCRs that continue to activate G proteins from internalized compartments, such as from endosomes. Paradoxically, GPCRs that promote endosomal G protein signaling most substantially include receptors such as the V<sub>2</sub>R, parathyroid hormone receptor 1, protease-activated receptor type 2, and neurokinin 1 receptor that all associate strongly with βarrs via phosphorylation site clusters located at their carboxy-terminal tail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Recently, we demonstrated that GPCRs with these carboxy-terminal clusters associate with βarrs exclusively through this region to form tail conformation GPCR–βarr complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Since βarrs do not block the G protein-binding site in this tail conformation, the receptor can associate with βarrs and G proteins simultaneously to form GPCR–G protein–βarr megaplexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The assembly of these megaplexes allows the receptor to continue to stimulate G protein signaling while being internalized into endosomes by βarrs.</p>
<p>The chemokine receptor CCR7 contains serine/threonine phosphorylation site clusters on its carboxy-terminal tail (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which have been shown to be fully phosphorylated upon CCL19 stimulation, but not CCL21 stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. In the present study, we also found a correlation between this reported CCR7 phosphorylation pattern, formation of tail conformation CCR7–βarr1 complexes, simultaneous recruitment of G protein and βarr to CCR7, robust endosomal G protein signaling, Rac1 signaling, and cell migration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 6D-E, 6H-Q, and 7A-F). As most chemokine receptors also contain serine/threonine clusters in their carboxy-terminal tails similar to CCR7, it not only raises the possibility that these receptors can promote endosomal G protein signaling, but also that this mode of signaling regulates important aspects of the physiological functions associated with these receptors (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In fact, removing the carboxy-terminal tail or mutating its phosphorylation sites in the chemokine receptors CXCR1-4 reduces their ability to internalize and promote cellular chemotaxis towards a chemokine-gradient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Similar reduction in Akt signaling and chemotaxis of immune cells towards gradients of different chemokines were observed upon pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Additionally, removal of intracellular loops in CXCR4 reduces G protein activation and is associated with decreased capacity of CXCR4 to promote cell migration indicating a co-dependency of G protein signaling and receptor internalization on this cell physiological function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Notably, the chemokine receptor CCR1 displays constitutive G protein activation and internalization in HEK293 cells by a mechanism where Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and βarr complex with the receptor simultaneously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>. This constitutive CCR1-mediated G protein activation from internalized compartment was reported to stimulate cell migration. Finally, sustained G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling by internalized sphingosine-1-phophate type 1 receptor has been shown to promote cell migration in human umbilical vein endothelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, previous observations together with our results are supportive of certain aspects of cell migration being regulated by internalized chemokine receptor signaling.<disp-quote><p>To obtain a greater understanding of the impact of endosomal chemokine receptor signaling on cell physiological responses, we applied an unbiased MS-based proteome profiling approach using CCR7-APEX2 expressing HEK293 cells. We found that CCR7 activation leads to enrichment of multiple proteins of key functions including vesicle trafficking, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal dynamics/cell migratory, among others (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). The proteins GRIP2 and EI24 were among the most enriched following CCR7 activation. GRIP2 and EI24 have not previously been reported as having roles in GPCR biology. GRIP2 has been shown to bind AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptors via PDZ-domains to regulate their intracellular trafficking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Whether GRIP2 plays similar role in the trafficking of chemokine receptors remains to be tested. EI24 is a protein whose expression is enhanced by p53 activation, and plays a role in in growth suppression and apoptosis as well as in autophagy through formation of degradative autolysosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. As with GRIP2, the potential role of EI24 in chemokine receptor biology is unknown. Another highly enriched protein was cytosolic EYA2, which interacts with members of the <italic>Sine oculis</italic> (Six) family of homeodomain transcription factors. This interaction facilitates the translocation of EYA proteins into the nucleus, where the EYA/Six complex regulates transcription of a number of genes involved in development and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Interestingly, EYA2 can interact directly with Gα<sub>i/o</sub> and Gαz subunits and regulate their activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. This interaction prevents their translocation to the nucleus, and thus, block their role as transcription co-factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Coincidently, EYA4 was recently identified in a similar APEX2-based study of the μ-opioid receptor, and thus, might be more involved in downstream signaling responses of G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptors such as chemokine receptors than currently appreciated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another protein that was robustly enriched upon CCR7-APEX2 activation was the Rho GTPase GAP RHG26. Notably, this enrichment was exclusively observed when HEK293-CCR7-APEX2 cells were stimulated by CCL19, but much less by CCL21 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>). Other regulators of Rho GTPases were also enriched by CCR7 activation and some of them were differentially enriched by either CCL19 or CCL21 stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). These results raise the possibility that CCR7 assembles compartment-specific signalosomes that could play an important role in downstream Rho GTPase activity. In fact, we discovered that the Rho GTPase Rac1 was specifically activated by G protein signaling by internalized CCR7 whereas the Rho GTPases RhoA and Cdc42 were stimulated equally by plasma membrane and endosomal CCR7 signaling (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Rac1 plays a key role in cell migration, which we further demonstrated in this study (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>), and can be activated in endosomes by RhoGEFs such as Tiam1 and Vav1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. This activation leads to Rac1 translocation to the cell surface via recycling endosomes, a process reported to occur in response to stimulation of CCR7 as well as several receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. From this subcellular region, Rac1 activates the major effector PAK1, which phosphorylates LIM kinase and cortactin, among others, to coordinate actin polymerization at the plasma membrane region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. This polymerization leads to formation of cytoskeletal actin filaments that serve as underlying stabilizing structures of newly formed filopodia and lamellipodia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. As these membrane protrusions constitute a major mechanistic step during cell migration, endosomal Rac1 activation plays a central role in this cell physiological process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. To this end, we found that CCL19 triggers chemotaxis of Jurkat T cells more robustly as compared to CCL21 despite both chemokines activating CCR7-mediated G protein signaling to the same extent (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). Similar findings that demonstrate CCL19’s superior ability to promote chemotaxis of other CCR7-expressing cells as compared to CCL21 have previously been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Furthermore, using pharmacological intervention we demonstrated that G<sub>i/o</sub> signaling from internalized compartments play a significant role in the chemotaxis response to CCR7 activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C-E</xref>). Thus, the findings from our study highlight endosomal G protein signaling by chemokine receptors as a potential general mechanism that regulates key aspects of cell migration.</p>

<title>Co-localization analysis</title>
<p>Co-localization was performed using Imaris software version 9.9.1 (Bitplane, Oxford instruments, Switzerland). Cells were selected using the “surfaces” module and cells containing regions of interest were selected. Channels for each fluorophore within the selected cells were masked to exclude all other cells or noise within the image. The Coloc module was then used to calculate co-localized voxels between the different channels. Thresholds were selected based on levels of intensity. Data are reported as percentage of red volume (red voxels) above the threshold that is co-localized with green volume (green voxels) above the threshold. No blinding from the different conditions was done.</p>

<title>Cell migration</title>
<p>Jurkat T cells suspended in culture medium were transferred into Costar® Transwell® polycarbonate membrane inserts with 5 μm pore size (Millipore Sigma). Each insert was fitted into</p>
<p>a well in a 24 well plate containing culture media with either vehicle control solution, 100 nM CCL19, or 100 nM CCL21. Cells were allowed to migrate from the top insert to the lower well chamber of the plate for 2 hours at 37 °C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. At the end of the experiment, all migrated cells from the lower chamber were collected and transferred to a Countess™ Cell Counting Chamber Slide (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and counted using a Countess™ 3 Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells used for assessment of G<sub>i/o</sub> protein involvement in CCR7-stimulated migration, were pretreated with 100 ng/ml PTX or vehicle control for 16 hours prior to the experiment. Cells used for assessment of the dependency of receptor internalization in CCR7-stimulated chemotaxis, were pretreated with 30 μM Dyngo-4a or inactive Dyngo control compound for 30 minutes prior to the experiment. In additional experiments the cells were pre-incubated with 10 μM PitStop2 or inactive PitNot control compound for 30 minutes prior to the experiment. Cells used for assessment of Rac1’s role in CCR7-stimulated chemotaxis were pretreated with 10 μM EHT1864 or DMSO control for 30 minutes prior to the experiment.

<title>APEX2 labeling</title>
<p>CCR7-APEX2 transfected HEK293 cells were preincubated with 500 μM biotin-tyramide for 1 hour at 37 °C. 100 nM CCL19, 100 nM CCL21 or vehicle were added to stimulate cells for 0, 2, 10, or 25 minutes. The proximity labeling was initiated by addition of freshly diluted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from a 30% (v/v) stock solution to a final concentration of 1 mM. The culture media was removed exactly 1 minute later, and the cells were washed three times with ice cold quenching buffer (PBS supplemented with 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 10 mM sodium azide, and 5 mM Trolox). The cells were detached by adding 5 mL of the quenching buffer supplemented with 5 mM EDTA and incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes with agitation. Detached cells were transferred to a 15-mL conical tube and centrifuged at 1,000×g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove the supernatant. The pellet was stored at-80°C until cell lysis.</p>
<p>The frozen cell pellet was lysed with 1 mL RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) supplemented with 1 mM PMSF for 30 minutes at room temperature with agitation. The cell lysate was further solubilized by brief sonication and centrifuged at 12,000×g at 4°C for 10 minutes to remove any insoluble cell debris. NeutrAvidin™ agarose beads were pre-washed three times with 20 bed volumes of the RIPA buffer and incubated with the supernatant overnight at 4°C with agitation. After the incubation, the beads were washed by incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes each with 40 bed volumes of buffer A (2% SDS), buffer B (50 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4), then buffer C (10 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0) with agitation. The beads were further washed twice with 20 bed volumes of 100 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and once with PBS (pH 7.4) to remove trace amount of detergent.

<title>Mass spectrometry and data acquisition</title>
<p>Proteins on the NeutrAvidin™ agarose beads were eluted by incubating with 50 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5% SDS, 10 mM TCEP, 20 mM CAA (pH 7.4) at 90°C for 20 minutes. Eluted proteins were purified and digested on magnetic beads following SP3 workflow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. Eluates were transferred into clean Eppendorf tubes and mixed with SP3 magnetic beads. Proteins were precipitated by mixing with equal volume of ethanol and SP3 beads were washed three times with 200 μL of 85% ethanol to remove any traces of SDS from the elution buffer. The SP3 beads were suspended in 50 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and the proteins on the beads were digested with trypsin (4 ng/μL) at 37°C overnight. Trypsin digestion was quenched by adding TFA to a final concentration of 0.5%. Peptide digests were transferred from the magnetic beads into the clean tubes. SP3 beads were washed with 50 uL of 5% ACN 0.2% TFA. The peptides were loaded on Evotips C18 (Evosep) for subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis using Evosep One LC system coupled to Q Exactive™ HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ MS instrument (Thermo Scientific) operating in data-independent acquisition mode (DIA). Peptides were separated online utilizing 15SPD method (88 min LC gradient length). High resolution full MS1 spectra were acquired with a resolution of 120,000, automatic gain control (AGC) target at 3,000,000 and maximum ion injection time at 60 ms, with a scan range of 350–1,650 m/z. Following each full MS1 scan, 22 data-independent high energy collisional dissociation (HCD) MS/MS scans were acquired at the resolution of 30,000, AGC target of 3,000,000 with stepped normalized collision energy (NCE) of 22.5, 25, and 27.5 Collected DIA data were analyzed using Spectronaut software (Biognosis; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://biognosys.com/shop/spectronaut">https://biognosys.com/shop/spectronaut</ext-link>) and searched in directDIA mode against the SwissProt subset of the human UniProt database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org/">http://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link>). Database search was performed in integrated search engine Pulsar (Biognosis). For the database search, the enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with the maximum number of missed cleavages allowed set to two. Oxidation of methionine was searched as variable modification, whereas carbamidomethylation of cysteines was searched as a fixed modification. The false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide, protein, and site identification was set to 1%. Protein quantification was performed on MS2 level using 3 most intense fragment ions per precursor. Proteins identified with a single peptide was removed from further analysis.

<title>Statistical analysis of the MS data</title>
<p>For spatiotemporal characterization of CCR7 upon agonist stimulation, global median normalization was performed for dataset from each time points (0, 2, 10, and 25 minutes after agonist stimulation). Pairwise differential expression analysis was performed by comparing the stimulated datasets (2, 10, and 25 minutes) to the unstimulated (0 minute) dataset using t-test model, assuming equal variance for each protein being compared. For each stimulated time point, proteins with <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &gt; 1 were considered significant. Significance score for the proteins were calculated by taking the absolute value of the log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) and adding-log<sub>10</sub>(<italic>p</italic> value)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Proteins with relevance to Rho, Rac, or CDC42 were selected manually from the list and subjected to further analysis for the role of CCR7 in cell motility. These proteins were searched on the STRING database to build a network functional relevance.</p>
<p>For spatial references PM-APEX2, ENDO-APEX2, and CYTO-APEX2, global median normalization was also performed. Pairwise differential expression analysis between each pair (ENDO against PM, ENDO against CYTO, and PM against CYTO) were performed as above. For each comparison pair, proteins with <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 and log<sub>2</sub>(fold-change) &gt; 1 were considered significant. Then, proteins commonly appear significant for ENDO and PM from the <italic>t</italic>-tests were chosen as spatial references.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> study that provides CCR7-APEX2 proximity labelling mass spectrometry data that is expected to provide new insights into CCR7 signalling partners and pathways. The study is technically <bold>solid</bold> and easy to follow, however, there are some concerns that many of the highlighted findings are repetitive of prior work and that this is not clearly acknowledged. It would increase the impact of the study if the confirmatory nature of some findings were acknowledged. This is of value to the community, and there are likely multiple opportunities to use the APEX2 data set to extend these findings, strengthen some claims, and even explore a new pathway identified in the APEX2 data set.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hahn et al use bystander BRET, NanoBiT assays, and APEX2 proteomics to investigate endosomal signaling of CCR7 by two agonists, CCL19 and CCL21. The authors suggest that CCR7 signals from early endosomes following internalisation. They use spatial proteomics to try to identify novel interacting partners that may facilitate this signaling and use this data to specifically enhance a Rac1 signaling pathway. Many of the results in the first few figures showing simultaneous recruitment of Barr and G proteins by CCR7 have been shown previously (Laufer et al, 2019, Cell Reports), as has signaling from endomembranes, and Rac1 activation at intracellular sites. The new findings are the APEX2 proteomics studies, which could be useful to the scientific community. Unfortunately, the authors only follow up on a single finding, and the expansion of this section would improve the manuscript.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The APEX2 resource will be valuable to the GPCR and immunology community. It offers many opportunities to follow up on findings and discover new biology. The resource could also be used to validate earlier findings in the current manuscript and in previous manuscripts. Was there enrichment of early endosomal markers, Barr and Gi as this would provide further evidence for their earlier claims regarding endosomal signaling? Previous studies have suggested signaling from the TGN, so it is possible that the different ligands also direct to different sites. This could easily be investigated using the APEX2 data.</p>
<p>(2) The results section is well written and can be followed very easily by the reader.</p>
<p>(3) Some findings verify previous studies (e.g. endomembrane signalling). This should be acknowledged as this shows the validity of the findings of both studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The findings are interesting although the studies are almost all performed in HEK293 cells. I understand that these are commonly used in GPCR biology and are easy to transfect and don't express many GPCRs at high concentrations, but their use is still odd when there are many cell-lines available that express CCR7 and are more reflective of the endogenous state (e.g. they are polarised, they can perform chemotaxis/ migration). Some of the findings within the study should also be verified in more physiologically relevant cells. At the moment only the final figure looks at this, but findings need to be verified elsewhere.</p>
<p>(2) The authors acknowledge that the kinetic patterns of the signals at the early endosome are not consistent with the rates of internalisation. They mention that this could be due to trafficking elsewhere. This could be easily looked at in their APEX2 data. Is there evidence of proximity to markers of other membranes? Perhaps this could be added to the discussion. Similarly, previous studies have shown that CCR7 signaling may involve the TGN. Was there enrichment of these markers? If not, this could also be an interesting finding and should be discussed. It is also possible that the Rab5 reporter is just not as efficient as the trafficking one, especially as in later figures the very convincing differences in the two ligands are not as robust as the differences in trafficking.</p>
<p>(3) In the final sentence of paragraph 2 of the results the authors state that the internalisation is specific to CCR7 as there isn't recruitment to V2R. I'm not sure this is the best control. The authors can only really say it doesn't recruit to unrelated receptors. The authors could have used a different chemokine receptor which does not respond to these ligands to show this.</p>
<p>(4) The miniGi-Barr1 and imaging showing co-localisation could be more convincing if it was also repeated in a more physiological cell line as in the final figure. Imaging of CCR7, miniGi, and Barr1 would also provide further evidence that the receptor is also present within the complex.</p>
<p>(5) The findings regarding Rac1 are interesting, although an earlier paper found similar results (Laufer et al, 2019, Cell Reports), so perhaps following up on another APEX2-identified protein pathway would have been more interesting. The authors' statement that Rac1 is specifically activated, and RhoA and Cdc42 are not, is unconvincing from the current data. Only a single NanoBiT assay was used, and as raw values are not reported it is difficult for the reader to glean some essential information. The authors should show evidence that these reporters work well for other receptors (or cite previous studies) and also need evidence from an independent (i.e. non-NanoBiT or BRET) assay.</p>
<p>(6) At present, the studies in Figure 7 do not go beyond those in the previous Laufer et al study in which they showed blocking endocytosis affected Rac1 signalling. The authors could show that Rac1 signalling is from early endosomes to improve this, otherwise, it could be from the TGN as previously reported.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript describes a comprehensive analysis of signalling downstream of the chemokine receptor CCR7. A comprehensive dataset supports the authors' hypothesis that G protein and beta-arrestin signalling can occur simultaneously at CCR7 with implications for continued signalling following receptor endocytosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are well controlled and executed, employing a wide range of assays using - in the main - CCR7 transfectants. Data are well presented, with the authors' claims supported by the data. The paper also has an excellent narrative which makes it relatively easy to follow. I think this would certainly be of interest to the readership of the journal.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Since the authors show a differential enrichment of RhoGTPases by CCR7 stimulation with CCL19 versus CCL21, I think that they also need to show that the Gi/o coupling of HEK-292-CCR7-APEX2 cells to both CCL19 and CCL21 is not perturbed by the modification. Currently, the authors only show data for CCL19 signalling, which leaves the potential for a false negative finding in terms of CCL21 signalling being selectively impaired. This should be relatively easy to do and should strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>The authors conclude the discussion by suggesting that their findings highlight endosomal signalling as a general mechanism for chemokine receptors in cell migration. I think this is an overreach. The authors chose several studies of CXC chemokine receptors to support their argument that C-terminal truncation or mutation of the C-terminal phosphorylation sites impairs endocytosis and chemotaxis (refs 40-42). However, in some instances e.g. at the related chemokine receptor CCR4, C-terminal removal of these sites impairs endocytosis but promotes chemotaxis (Nakagawa et al, 2014); Anderson et al, 2020). I therefore think that either the final statement needs to be tempered down or the counterargument discussed a little.</p>
