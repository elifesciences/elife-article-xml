<title>Introduction</title>
<p>There exists a historical and rich curiosity in understanding the role of the cerebellum in movement, dating back to the pioneering work of Flourens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>), with an equally long interest in investigating how it alters movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). From these earlier studies it was clear that a defective cerebellum causes a range of devastating problems in the ability to control voluntary, intentional actions including coordination, posture, and balance. Accordingly, in humans, the equivalent defects had clear pathophysiological consequences. Patients with various cerebellar lesions showed loss of precise motor coordination, which, as the consequence of disease, is referred to as ataxia, whereas some subjects displayed overt and sometimes exaggerated oscillatory movements, consistent with tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). In other cases, the examiner would report uncontrolled muscle contractions, which is now a contributing feature of dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). These classic observations underscored the heterogeneity of motor disturbances caused by cerebellar dysfunction. But, even then, the question of how the cerebellum creates such behavioral diversity was already imminent. Despite major advances in understanding the basic anatomy and circuitry of the cerebellum, it is still unclear how disease behaviors emerge of these circuits. In this regard, the specific substrates that underlie each disorder could hold the key for improving the design of therapies and treatments.</p>
<p>Consistent with the outcomes of removing or lesioning the cerebellum in pigeons, dogs, monkeys, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>), the heterogeneity of cerebellar movement disturbances was later confirmed in genetic mouse models. Much of the current excitement about the cerebellum spawned from these initial genetic models because of the overt motor disturbances that were caused by spontaneous mutations in genes that are now known to be associated with cerebellar development or cerebellar degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Prior to genetic sequencing though, mutant mice such as <italic>hot-foot</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>), <italic>weaver</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>), <italic>trembler</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>), <italic>waddles</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>), <italic>staggerer</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), <italic>stumbler</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), <italic>tottering</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>), and <italic>lurcher</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>) were named according to phenotype of their abnormal movements, which are as diverse as their names imply. Modern techniques and approaches now aim at determining the mechanisms and roles of the cerebellum as they relate to driving different behaviors in these classic models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Together, data generated from these different mouse models have cultivated an interest in identifying whether discrete functional features in the cerebellar circuit are the root cause of disease-related behaviors. In this regard, more than half a century since the first descriptions of cerebellar mutants, a core question remains unanswered but hotly debated: how does cerebellar circuit dysfunction lead to unique motor disturbances?</p>
<p>To begin addressing how cerebellar circuits generate behavioral diversity in disease, we used an intersectional genetics approach to mark, map, and manipulate specific types of synapses in the cerebellum. Our approach silences genetically defined populations of synapses by selectively deleting the genes that encode the vesicular GABA transporter, <italic>Vgat</italic>, or the type 2 vesicular glutamate transporter, <italic>Vglut2</italic>, from genetically targeted populations of cells. Loss of GABAergic neurotransmission from Purkinje cells, which provide the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, caused uncoordinated movements and disequilibrium that were indicative of ataxia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In contrast, eliminating glutamatergic neurotransmission from climbing fibers, which synapse onto Purkinje cells, caused twisting postures and hyperextended limbs that is consistent with dystonia (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). In addition, systemic injection of the beta-carboline alkaloid drug harmaline caused hyperactivation of climbing fibers and rhythmic bursting spike activity in Purkinje cells as well as a severe tremor. Optogenetically modulating Purkinje cell to cerebellar nuclei projections in a bursting pattern induced oscillatory tremor movements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Together, these studies established that different manipulations of Purkinje cell inputs or outputs, and consequently Purkinje cell and nuclei neuron spike signals, can cause diverse behavioral deficits as they relate to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Given the heterogeneity and even comorbidity of these behaviors in a single disease model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>), the main question that arises is, do these cerebellar neural signals represent unique pathophysiological signatures that can drive the predominant behavioral defects used to characterize different motor diseases? Here, we aim to resolve this question to provide insight into the origin of cerebellar movement disorder presentation.</p>

<title>Spike signatures are different between archetypal ataxia, dystonia, and tremor models</title>
<p>We first compared the spike train activity between mouse models for ataxia (<italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>)), dystonia (<italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>)), and tremor (harmaline injection, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We identified these three mouse models as archetypal representations of their respective cerebellar motor disease phenotypes because their overt behavioral motor abnormalities are caused by cerebellum-specific manipulations that do not cause changes in the gross anatomy, cell morphology, or cell survival of the adult cerebellum. These models also exhibit remarkably reliable, severe, and penetrant ataxic, dystonic, and tremor symptoms within each respective group. Video 1 provides examples of the varied and overt motor abnormalities of the mouse models used. <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplemental table 1</xref> summarizes the reported behavioral impairments from prior characterization of these archetypal mouse models.</p>
<p>We hypothesized that these differences in behavioral abnormalities were accompanied by specific changes in the spike train patterns in the cerebellum. We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology recordings of the spike activity in cerebellar nuclei neurons of the interposed nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>), in awake, head-fixed mice with overt motor phenotypes and control animals. We focused our recordings on the interposed nucleus based on the hypothesis that the cerebellum communicates ongoing motor signals to other brain regions through this nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) of this region successfully reduces motor impairments in mouse models of ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>), dystonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and tremor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). We described the spike train firing features using twelve parameters that summarized the spike train rate (Supp. Figure 1A-C), irregularity (Supp. Figure 1D-F), pauses (Supp. Figure 1G-I), and rhythmicity (Supp. Figure 1J-L). In agreement with our hypothesis, we found a significant difference between at least two archetypal groups for each of the twelve spike train parameters. However, none of the twelve parameters showed a statistical difference between all four groups (control, ataxia, dystonia, and tremor), suggesting that the difference between spike train signatures relied on a combination of multiple spike train parameters.</p>
<p>We therefore set out to find a set of parameters and specific threshold values that best differentiated the spike train parameters between the archetypal groups. We trained a supervised classification learning model based on the spike train parameters of each mouse model (Supp. Figure 1A-L). The classifier model identified the coefficient of variance (CV, Supp. Figure 1D) of interspike intervals (ISI) as the best differentiator of neurons recorded in ataxic and control mice (lower CV) from neurons recorded in dystonic and tremoring mice (higher CV). CV is a measure of variability that increases due to pauses between spikes or fluctuations in the firing rate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and is unusually elevated in our dystonic and tremor mouse models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>”). Next, the classifier model identified CV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) (Supp. Figure 1E) as the best differentiator of neurons recorded in ataxic mice (lower CV2) from control mice (higher CV2). CV2 measures the irregularity of interspike intervals with less influence from the overall firing rate. It is extraordinarily low in the highly regular spike activity observed in our ataxia model (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>’’). Last, the classifier model identified that the median ISI<sup>-1</sup> (Supp. Figure 1C), which measures the median instantaneous firing rate, as the best differentiator of neurons from the dystonic mice (lower median ISI<sup>-1</sup>) compared to those recorded in mice with tremor (higher median ISI<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that changes in a combination of three parameters (CV, CV2, and median ISI<sup>-1</sup>) may explain the difference in the behavioral presentation of mouse models of cerebellar disease.</p>
<p>We then validated whether this classifier model could reliably predict the behavioral phenotypes of the archetypal mouse models based solely on the spiking activity of single cerebellar nuclei neurons. We tested this by predicting the behavioral phenotype based on CV, CV2, and median ISI<sup>-1</sup> values calculated based on a different set of recordings. We found that the classifier model indeed predicted the different predominant phenotypes of each archetypal mouse model correctly for the majority of neurons in the validation data set (control: 80% of neurons recorded in a control mouse had a control signature; ataxia: 78%; dystonia: 65%; tremor: 56%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Our analyses also showed that most neurons of a specific signature were recorded from the mouse model with that phenotype (control: 59% of neurons with a control signature were recorded in a control mouse; ataxia: 89%; dystonia: 65%; tremor: 73%) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-G</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that spike signatures are reliably different between archetypal mouse models of distinct motor behaviors that mimic human disease symptoms.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Multiple spike train signatures can lead to ataxic motor impairments</title>
<p>Next, we set out to identify whether the spike train signatures for the archetypal mouse models are shared across mouse models with different manipulations but similar phenotypes. We started by classifying the spike train parameters in a mouse model of ataxia caused by a poly-glutamate expansion in the Atxn1 gene, <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> mice, that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1). We measured the spike train patterns early in the disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>). Despite the presence of an ataxic phenotype at this age (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supp. Table 1</xref>), we observed that most <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>neurons exhibited a control signature (14/24) and that the second most numerous spike train signature was a dystonia signature (8/24).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="539767v2_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>We reasoned that the high proportion of cells exhibiting a control signature in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> mice might be because the disease-causing genetic abnormality affects the whole body and, consequently, the ataxic symptoms may result from dysfunction in multiple nodes in the motor circuit. We therefore also investigated a mouse model with a cerebellum-specific loss of the gene <italic>Ank1</italic> (10-12 month old <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ank1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), which causes an adult-onset degenerative ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). In this mouse model, we found that more than half of the neurons exhibited an abnormal spike train signature, with the majority classified with the dystonia spike train signature (7/14).</p>
<p>Our classifier model differentiates the control and dystonia signatures from each other based on the CV parameter. Previous studies have suggested that the difference between ataxia and dystonia symptoms may be caused by the relative difference in CV value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Indeed, the distribution of CV values appeared to be lower in the ataxic <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> (0.59 ± 0.04 (mean ± SEM)) and <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ank1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>(0.61 ± 0.07) mouse models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>) than in our archetypal dystonia model (1.15 ± 0.11) (<italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-G</xref>). We used a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-hoc analyses and found that the difference in CV between the ataxia models and the dystonia models was statistically significant (<italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>vs. <italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>: p&lt;0.0001; <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ank1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>vs. <italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>: p&lt;0.0001), but we did not observe a difference in CV between the two ataxia models (<italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>vs <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ank1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>: p=0.9739). Together, these findings suggest that there are multiple cerebellar spike train signatures that can lead to ataxic symptoms that both differ from the dystonia signature in their relative level of regularity; unusually regular spike train patterns are seen in <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and intermediate irregular spike train patterns are observed in <italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic> and <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ank1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mouse models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Dystonic spike train signatures are shared across etiologically distinct dystonia models</title>
<p>Next, we set out to identify whether the dystonia signature was shared across mice with overt dystonic phenotypes. We included two dystonia models in our analyses; <italic>Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice exhibit mild dystonic symptoms only in response to a stressful event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>), whereas mice that receive ouabain applied to the surface of the cerebellum exhibit continuous severe dystonic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B</xref>). We found that the proportion of neurons that exhibited the control signature was greater in <italic>Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice than in ouabain infusion mice (11/21 vs. 7/20) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, the proportion of neurons with a dystonia signature was lower in <italic>Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice than in ouabain infusion mice (9/21 vs. 11/20) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Therefore, the mice with a more severe dystonia phenotype had a smaller proportion of cells matching the control signature and a greater proportion of cells matching the dystonia signature. In addition to the proportional differences in cells with a control and dystonia signature, we found that the distribution of CV values differed between the <italic>Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> (0.61 ± 0.07) and ouabain infusion mice (1.00 ± 0.15) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D-E</xref>). We quantified this difference by comparing these two mouse models to each other and the archetypal dystonic model (<italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-hoc analysis. We found that the CV was lower in <italic>Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice with mild dystonic features compared to the ouabain infusion mice (p=0.0482) and <italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice (p=0.0037) with severe dystonic features. There was no significant difference between the two models with severe dystonic features (p=0.5940). These findings show that the dystonia signature is shared across etiologically distinct dystonia models and that the relative severity of symptoms may be explained by the proportion of neurons with a dystonia and control signature (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Tremor spike train signatures are shared across etiologically distinct tremor models</title>
<p>Next, we set out to identify whether the tremor signature is shared across mice that exhibit severe oscillatory tremors. To test this, we used <italic>Car8<sup>wdl/wdl</sup></italic> mice. We previously showed that <italic>Car8<sup>wdl/wdl</sup></italic>mice exhibit a severe oscillatory tremor that can be reduced to control levels by treatment with the beta blocker drug propranolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), which is used to treat tremor in human patients. <italic>Car8<sup>wdl/wdl</sup></italic> mice also exhibit ataxia and dystonia, which are not normalized by propranolol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).

<title>Different spike signatures can be generated by the same canonical cerebellar circuit</title>
<p>Next, we investigated whether the different spike signatures could be generated by the same canonical cerebellar circuit. We reasoned that the observed spike train signatures were not dependent on developmental changes in circuit connectivity (<italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre/+</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>; <italic>Pdx1<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), neurodegeneration (<italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup>; L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ank1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), the effects of transgene expression (<italic>Atxn1<sup>154Q/+</sup></italic>) or frameshifting (<italic>Car8<sup>wdl/wdl</sup></italic>), or drug effects on the nervous system outside of the cerebellum (harmaline, ouabain, propranolol). We expressed a light-sensitive cation channel opsin, channelrhodopsin (ChR2), in Purkinje cells (<italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;ROSA26<sup>loxP-STOP-loxP-EYFP-ChR2</sup></italic> mice, hereon referred to as <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;R26<sup>ChR2</sup></italic> mice). Upon light activation, Purkinje cell firing rate increases (Supplemental Figure 2A-B) and nuclei neurons are inhibited via the GABAergic neurotransmission from Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-C</xref>). We leveraged this circuit connectivity and optogenetic strategy to induce distinct spike signatures in cerebellar neurons. We chose three stimulation paradigms. The ataxia stimulation was a continuous 50 Hz square pulse stimulation (mimicking the lack of modulation by Purkinje cells in our degenerative and genetically silenced ataxia models); the dystonia stimulation was a 50 Hz square pulse stimulation that was on for at least 500 ms with a 75% chance of a 250 ms pause between periods of stimulation (to induce the slow and irregular spike train features of our defined dystonia signature); and the tremor stimulation was a 10 Hz sinusoidal stimulation (to induce the fast, irregular, and rhythmic spike train features of our defined tremor signature). We performed <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings in awake, head-fixed mice, and confirmed that each of the optogenetic stimulation paradigms caused distinct changes in Purkinje cell spiking activity (Supplemental Figure 2). The different stimulation paradigms also induced distinct changes in the spike train features of cerebellar nuclei neurons (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). We then compared the resultant spike train features to the defined thresholds of our classifier model. We found that the ataxia stimulation paradigm induced cells to behave within the parameters of a variety of our defined spike train signatures, including ataxia (2/9), dystonia (2/9), and tremor (2/9). This is in line with our findings that the ataxia signature is more variable across ataxia mouse models (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Importantly, we found that fewer than half of the cells recorded with the ataxia stimulation exhibited a control signature (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>), similar to the proportional distribution of cells in other mouse models with severe motor phenotypes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, 3C, 4C). Additionally, we found that the dystonia and tremor stimulation reliably induced spike signatures that our classifier model defined as dystonic (7/7 cells) or as tremor signatures (9/9 cells), respectively (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). These data indicate that no anatomical changes are required to induce disease-associated spike signatures in the cerebellum and that spike signatures associated with ataxia, dystonia, and tremor can be generated by the same, otherwise healthy, cerebellar circuit.</p>

<title>Spike signatures can induce distinct motor phenotypes that mimic disease-related behaviors</title>
<p>During the head-fixed stimulation experiments, we observed subtle behavioral responses during unilateral cell-targeted optogenetic stimulation that suggested the different spike signatures might drive unique motor behaviors (Video 2). To explore this further in freely moving mice, we investigated whether the different spike signatures directly drive unique motor disturbances when a population of cells are induced to produce our defined spike signatures. To this end, <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;R26<sup>ChR2</sup></italic>mice were implanted with optical fibers that were bilaterally targeted to the interposed cerebellar nuclei (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A-C</xref>). This allowed for the targeting of Purkinje cell terminals in the cerebellar nuclei, as was done during our <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, but with a larger population of cells affected by the stimulation. This also allowed the mice to move freely during stimulation, making a series of behavioral assays during stimulation possible (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Changes in behavior were immediate and severe as soon as the stimulation began. Each stimulation paradigm resulted in a different constellation of behaviors with the ataxia stimulation paradigm resulting in imprecise movements, the dystonia stimulation paradigm resulting in prominent dystonic posturing, and the tremor stimulation paradigm resulting in severe tremor (Video 3). Therefore, we assessed the mice for changes in gait, presence of dystonic movements, and severity of tremor. No single measurement can perfectly encapsulate the complexity of ataxia, dystonia, and tremor – all of which can appear in combination with the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Additionally, each phenotype may affect the measurement of others. This was particularly apparent with measurements of gait. We found that all stimulation paradigms affected gait, resulting in visibly different foot placement (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E-F</xref>) and movement down the footprinting corridor (Video 4). Quantitatively, this was evident in shorter steps and less precision of fore and hindpaw placement (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I-K</xref>). We also considered the behavior of the mice in an open, flat, plexiglass arena for signs of dystonic movements (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6L</xref>, Video 3). The dystonia stimulation paradigm resulted in the most frequent and strongest dystonic movements, while we also observed dystonic movements with the ataxia paradigm and abnormal movement – namely severe tremor – was noted with the tremor stimulation paradigm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6M</xref>). Mice were also placed in a custom-made tremor monitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>) where they could freely ambulate during stimulation while an accelerometer mounted under the arena detected changes in acceleration (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). While the ataxia stimulation paradigm did not significantly increase tremor from baseline, both the dystonia and tremor stimulation paradigms resulted in a significantly increased tremor at 10 Hz (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6N-P</xref>). Though dystonia is often observed with tremor, it is possible that the detection of tremor in these animals was due to the jerkiness of their dystonic movements rather than an increase in smooth, rhythmic tremor that is more often associated with tremor disorders. Indeed, the tremor paradigm resulted in the most severe tremor of all stimulation conditions, producing a tremor severity that was more than ten-fold greater than that of the dystonia stimulation paradigm. Together, these measurements produced a complex representation of the underlying phenotypes. All three stimulation parameters resulted in a behavioral repertoire that was significantly different from baseline and, while there was some overlap of features, each stimulation paradigm produced the distinct and predicted respective motor phenotype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6Q-T</xref>). Together these data suggest that our classifier model’s defined spike signatures of disease-associated cerebellar nuclei spike trains are sufficient to produce the predicted corresponding abnormal motor phenotypes in mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we tested whether distinct spike train signatures in the interposed cerebellar nuclei explain why cerebellar dysfunction can cause multiple distinct motor impairments associated with movement disorders. By comparing spike activity across multiple mouse models of cerebellar disease, we found that the cerebellum can generate a range of dysfunctional spiking patterns. We found disease-specific spike train signatures using a classifier learner model, which allowed us to discover specific spike train parameters and their corresponding cutoff values that could distinguish the activity associated with these different disease states. When investigating whether these spike signatures are shared across mouse models with similar phenotypes due to different etiologies, we found that two types of spike train activity can cause ataxia, whereas specific spike train signatures are strongly associated with dystonia and tremor. We then tested whether we could optogenetically induce these signatures in an otherwise normal circuit. We found that the same neurons can generate healthy spike activity as well as a spectrum of disease-like spike activities. We then tested whether these optogenetically-induced disease-associated spike signatures could elicit similar behavioral abnormalities in the absence of any other primary genetic or circuit defects in awake and freely moving mice. The predominant behaviors that characterize each disease condition were successfully recapitulated. These data provide compelling evidence for the reliance of neurological phenotype presentation on the pattern of cerebellar circuit misfiring.</p>
<p>Several previous studies have proposed that distinct spike train patterns may correspond to distinct presentations of cerebellar disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). Our work builds on these studies by quantitatively comparing spike train properties across, rather than within, mouse models. We demonstrate what aspects of the spike train patterns are distinct and shared across mouse models with different and similar disease phenotypes, respectively. We confirm prior research indicating the importance of spike train irregularity in disease presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). We also show that spike train irregularity is insufficient to differentiate the spike train properties of dystonic and tremoring mice, which are differentiated from each other based on the instantaneous spike rate rather than pattern. Additionally, we confirm that the spike train signatures associated with different disorders can cause distinct disease phenotypes, thereby showing for the first time that distinct cerebellar spike train signatures are sufficient to drive a variety of motor impairments. Together, these data provide strong evidence that different spike train signatures do not only result from sensory feedback towards the cerebellum and that they may be a primary cause for motor impairments associated with cerebellar disease.</p>
<p>Our work suggests that there is a healthy range within the characteristics of cerebellar nuclei spiking activity and that cerebellar movement disorders are associated with a shift from this range in one or multiple features of spike train activity. We find some overlap and shared spike features between the different disease phenotypes and show that healthy cerebellar neurons can adapt multiple disease-associated spike train signatures. These findings suggest that pathophysiological spike train signatures are driven by a shift in neural function towards a disease state that can be independent of plasticity or circuit rewiring. Despite the dramatically different behavioral outcomes, the potential overlap and shared spike features, such as the irregular spike pattern found in the dystonia and tremor signatures, raise the strong possibility that co-expression or comorbidity of different motor disease behaviors may arise due to a spectrum of spike signal defects. This indicates that it is possible for neural signals to shift back and forth between healthy and disease states, potentially resulting in the transientness of behavioral impairments in certain cerebellar disorders. These findings also suggest that the most successful therapeutic avenues for cerebellar movement disorders should maintain cerebellar spiking activity within the healthy range without inadvertently inducing a different pathophysiological signature.</p>
<p>There has been (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>), and there still remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>), a great interest in understanding how altered cerebellar signals influence human behavior and disease. A pressing need to better define the architecture of these spiking abnomalities has arisen because of the success in using deep brain stimulation (DBS) and the potential for better tuning of the stimulation parameters for greater efficacy in treating different cerebellar-related disorders (ataxia: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>); dystonia: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>); tremor: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>); ataxia, dystonia, tremor: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>)). Recordings in human patients during DBS implantation have previously found physiological differences in the spike train patterns of basal ganglia neurons between dystonia and other movement disorders (for example; etiologically distinct dystonia: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>); dystonia with and without head tremor: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>); dystonia versus Parkinson’s disease: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>)). Our electrophysiological data confirm that differences in spike train properties are also found in the cerebellum and our optogenetic experiments suggest that these spike trains are not merely biomarkers that correlate with the disease state but are sufficient to cause motor impairments. Therefore, cerebellar-targeted DBS may be highly beneficial in normalizing the disease-causing spike train patterns.</p>
<p>A parallel motivation has fueled rodent studies to define the anatomical targets, stimulation parameters, and outcome efficiacy in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Although the exact mechanism(s) of DBS remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), there is strong support that at least one target of DBS is the actual neuronal signal itself (which the DBS may modify, enhance, dampen, and perhaps even interfere with the given neural spike defects). Indeed, the ability to alter cerebellar spike activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>) has driven the investigation of the signal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Evidently, neurotransmission of the faulty activity patterns is required for the expression of disease behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Recent works strongly support the hypothesis that changes in activity (rate, pattern, or both) could instigate a range of movement abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). However, the current work defines the individual potential of these altered cerebellar signals to initiate specific motor changes. Dystonia can be reliably associated with irregular activity and tremor with highly rhthmic oscillations in the cerebellar nuclei neurons. Ataxia may be caused by a variety of changes that are different from the dystonia and tremor signatures in the severity of misfiring or proportion of neurons affected. Together, these data unveil a critical role for the cerebellum in triggering disease behaviors, with cauasative signals likely originating locally in its circuitry. Each disease may therefore arise as a result of a change in the balance and representaion of neural signatures.</p>

<title>Headplate and craniotomy surgery for electrophysiology recordings</title>
<p>Prior to all recordings, we performed a surgery to attach a headplate over bregma and make a craniotomy over the interposed nucleus. This allowed us to collect stable recordings of cerebellar neuron activity while the mouse was awake and with or without a severe motor phenotype. This surgery was detailed in our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>). In short, mice were given preemptive analgesics including a subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine and meloxicam. Anesthesia was induced using inhaled isoflurane. During the surgery, the mice were kept on a heating blanket to maintain body temperature. Fur was removed from the surgery site using depilatory cream (Nair) and a small incision in the skin was made over the skull. Next, we used a dental drill to make a ∼2 mm diameter craniotomy over the interposed nucleus (6.4 mm posterior and 1.3 mm lateral to Bregma). The craniotomy was surrounded by a round chamber and filled with antibiotic ointment until the day of the recording. The recording chamber was closed with a screw top or silicone cap. We also placed a headplate with a hole over Bregma. A small piece of wire was placed vertically over Bregma to identify this anatomical marker on the day of recording. The recording chamber and headplate were attached to the skull using a combination of C and B Metabond Adhesive Luting Cement (Parkell) and methyl methacrylate dental cement (A-M Systems).

We measured the coordinates of Bregma to determine the coordinates where the electrode would penetrate the surface of the cerebellum. We used tungsten electrodes (2-8 MΩ, Thomas Recording) attached to a preamplifier head stage (NPI Electronic instruments) for our recordings. The position of the recording electrode was controlled using a motorized micromanipulator (MP-255; Sutter Instrument Co.). Neural signals were amplified and bandpass filtered (0.3-13 kHz) using an ELC-03XS amplifier (NPI Electronics) before being digitized using a CED board. All signals were recorded using Spike2 software (CED). We only included neurons recorded between 2.5 and 3.5 mm from the surface that did not exhibit complex spikes (characteristic for Purkinje cell firing) in our analyses of cerebellar nuclei neuron firing patterns. This paper includes reanalyzed data from previously reported studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>).</p>

<title>Spike sorting and analyses</title>
<p>We previously showed that recording duration influences the estimation of neural firing parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Therefore, all parameter estimates in this paper are based on 30 seconds (s)-long recordings. We used Spike2 software to sort out spikes from electrophysiological recordings. Information about spike timing were imported and saved in MATLAB databases using custom written code. We described the spike analyses using twelve parameters investigating the properties of interspike intervals (ISI) within the recording; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>) <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="539767v2_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; (2) <italic>mean instantaneous firing rate = mean (ISI<sup>−1</sup>)</italic>; (3) <italic>median instantaeous firing rate = median (ISI<sup>−1</sup>)</italic>; (4) <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="539767v2_inline2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; (5) <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="539767v2_inline3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; (6) <italic>skewness = median instantaneous firing rate - firing rate</italic>; (7) <italic>ISI<sub>25</sub> = % ISI &gt; 25 ms</italic>; (8) <italic>ISI<sub>100</sub> = % ISI &gt; 100 ms</italic>; (9) <italic>inter burst pause = mean (ISI &gt; (5 * mean (ISI))</italic>; (10) <italic>kurtosis = % ISI at model(ISI)</italic>; (11) <inline-formula><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:href="539767v2_inline4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>; (12) <italic>oscillation pearks = number of peaks ″a″</italic>. For the calculation of 11 and 12, we performed an autocorrelation analysis for all spikes in the 30 s recording, calculated the rhythmicity index, and found oscillation peaks as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>). We used a bin width of 5 ms. The first oscillation peak was determined as the highest bin between 10 ms and 1.5 times the mean ISI for a given neuron. The difference between the baseline level and the height of the peak was denoted as a<sub>1</sub>, the difference between baseline and the depth of the trough was denoted as b<sub>1</sub>, and z was the difference between baseline and the total number of spikes included in the analyses. Each subsequent peak was determined as the highest bin between the delay-time of the previous trough and a<sub>n</sub>+a<sub>1</sub>+10 ms, where a<sub>n</sub> is the time of the previous peak. The first trough was determined as the lowest bin between the first peak (a<sub>1</sub>) and a<sub>n</sub> + a<sub>1</sub>. Peaks and troughs were only accepted if their sum was higher than four times the standard deviation of autocorrelation between 0.96 and 1 s lag-time, or if the peak was higher than baseline plus two times the standard deviation and the trough was lower than baseline minus two times the standard deviation.</p>

<title>Supervised classifier learner</title>
<p>We trained our classifier learner using cerebellar nuclei neuron recordings from mixed background control mice (control), <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Vgat<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (ataxia), <italic>Ptf1a<sup>Cre</sup>;Vglut2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>mice (dystonia), and harmaline-injected mice (tremor). We have previously tested these models and consider them as reliable archetypical models for cerebellar movement disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). For the analyses, we reanalyzed previous recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>) in addition to newly acquired ones. We only included recordings with a duration of 30 s or longer and calculated parameter estimates as described above. If recordings were longer than 60 s, we also calculated parameter estimates for the second 30 s period. We randomly assigned the parameter estimates calculated from the first 30 s of the recording to the training or validation data set and, when available, we assigned the parameter estimates from the second 30 s of the recording to the remaining data set. This resulted in a training set comprised of 29 neurons from 9 control mice, 19 neurons from 5 ataxic mice, 19 neurons from 8 dystonic mice, and 21 neurons from 6 tremoring mice. The validation set contained 30 neurons from 9 control mice, 18 neurons from 5 ataxic mice, 17 neurons from 7 dystonic mice, and 18 neurons from 5 tremoring mice.</p>
<p>We used the built-in supervised machine learning, MATLAB Classification Learner APP (The Mathworks Inc, version R2021a) to define spike signature parameter value cutoffs. We imported the parameters describing the spiking activity from an Excel (Microsoft) worksheet. We used “Group” (control, ataxia, dystonia, or tremor) as the “Response Variable” and the 12 parameters described above as the “Predictor Variables.” We trained a “Coarse Tree” with maximum number of splits = 3, split criterion = Gini’s diversity index, and surrogate decision splits = off. We exported the trained model to the workspace to validate the classifier learner. We assigned signature identity to recordings based on the trained classifier tree.</p>

<title>Optopatcher in vivo electrophysiology recordings in awake mice</title>
<p>Optopatcher experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>). We prepared the mice for recording by performing a headplate and craniotomy surgery as described above. The electrophysiology rig and setup were the same as described above with the following differences: We used an optopatcher device (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc) that allows for the placement of a custom-made optical fiber (Thorlabs, #FT200UMT) within a glass recording electrode (Harvard Apparatus, #30-0057). The tip of the optical fiber was placed near the tip of the recording electrode and was illuminated via a 465 nm LED light source (ALA Scientific Instruments Inc). On the day of the recording, we pulled glass electrodes (Sutter Instruments, #P-1000), filled the electrodes with physiological saline, and measured their impedance using an ELC-03XS amplifier (NPI Electronics) before recording. Only electrodes with 2-15 MΩ impedance were used. Light stimulation was triggered using custom Spike2 scripts paired with a CED board (CED). All optopatcher recordings were performed in <italic>L7<sup>Cre</sup>;Ai32</italic> mice that express channelrhodopsin in Purkinje cells. Nuclei neurons included in our analyses were cell recordings between 2.5-3.5 mm from the surface of the cerebellum and were inhibited by brief light stimulation at 465 nm. After we found and isolated a cell, we slowly ramped up the brightness of this brief stimulation until we found the minimal light power that modulated the spiking activity. This minimal power was then used to stimulate the cell with the various test parameters during the recording session.</p>

<title>Optogenetic light stimulation paradigms for optopatcher recordings and behavioral assays</title>
<p>We used the following stimulation parameters to measure signature-specific responses; ataxia: 50 Hz (10 ms light on/ 10 ms light off) square pulses; dystonia: at least 500 ms of 50 Hz (10 ms light on/ 10 ms light off) square pulses interspersed with at 75% chance of 250 ms pauses in stimulation; tremor: 100 Hz pulses (5 ms light on/ 5 ms light off) overlaid with a 10 Hz sinusoid (50 ms parabolic increase and decrease of light power followed by 50 ms light off).</p>

<title>Bilateral optic fiber implant surgery for in vivo behavioral assays</title>
<p>We implanted mice with optical fibers (ThorLabs, #FT200UMT) targeted bilaterally to the interposed cerebellar nuclei to assess the motor phenotypes that result from our stimulation parameters. We previously described this surgical procedure (Brown et al., 2020). Briefly, the mice were given subcutaneous injections of sustained-release buprenorphine and meloxicam as preemptive analgesics. Anesthesia was induced with 3% isoflurane gas and the anesthetic plane was maintained with 2% isoflurane gas. The mice were placed on a heating blanket and the head was stabilized in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments). Fur was removed from the top of the head using depilatory cream (Nair). The surgical site was cleaned using alternating applications of betadine scrub and alcohol. An incision was made in the skin to expose the skull from anterior to bregma to the posterior aspect of the occipital plate. The fascia was removed from the top of the skull and a scalpel was used to etch fine grooves into the top of the skull. A small craniotomy was made in the parietal plate with a dental drill in order to attach a skull screw (00-90 x 1/16 flat point stainless steel machine screw) to anchor the implant to the skull. The skull screw was advanced only until the point that it was stable in the skull and care was taken to ensure it did not contact the brain. The implant sites were determined by measuring 6.4 mm posterior and ±1.5 mm lateral to bregma. Small craniotomies were made at these sites using a dental drill. The base of the fibers were placed on the surface of the cerebellum and were advanced ventrally for 2 mm. A small amount of antibiotic ointment was placed around each fiber to prevent Metabond or dental cement from entering the craniotomy. Metabond was applied over the entire exposed area of skull and around the skull screw and fibers. Two short segments of wire were embedded in the Metabond to allow the experimenter to hold the mouse’s head while attaching and removing the fiber patch cables from the implant. Dental cement was placed over the Metabond. The mice were allowed to recover for at least 3 days before any behavioral assessments were made. Subcutaneous injections of meloxicam were provided every 24 h during the recovery period. Eight mice (number of mice, N) were implanted and tested with all three behavioral assays.</p>

<title>Gait analysis</title>
<p>Measurements of gait were made for all mice both before (baseline) and during each stimulation parameter. To do this, the mice were briefly scruffed and then contrasting colored non-toxic paints were applied to the soles of their forepaws and hindpaws (blue paint for forepaws and red paint for hindpaws). The mice were then gently set down on a piece of blank white paper positioned between two parallel plexiglass barriers with a dark enclosed area at the end of the corridor. Adult mice are naturally inclined to walk towards the dark enclosed area, meanwhile depositing paint on the paper with each footstep. The stimulation, if present, was extinguished once the mice entered the enclosed area. The mice were allowed to rest for at least 2 min between each trial. A trial was considered successful if there were at least four hind and forepaw prints for both the left and right feet that were visible, steady (the mouse was neither running or stopping midway through the series of footsteps), and in as straight of a line as possible (the mouse was not actively turning during the trial). Optic patch cables were connected to the implant during every trial (including baseline runs when stimulation was not present). At least two successful trails were collected per stimulation parameter. For analysis, measurements from two trials of the same type were averaged to determine the values for each mouse. These measurements were stride, the distance from one footprint to the next from the same foot and hind to fore distance, and hind-to-fore distance, the distance from one hindpaw placement from a corresponding forepaw placement on the same side of the body. Three of each measurement were made per footprint and were averaged to determine the measurements per foot, per trial. These trials were then averaged to determine the final measurements for each mouse. A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with a Tukey multiple comparison adjustment was performed to determine significance. Significance values were indicated as not significant (ns) if p &gt; 0.05, * = p ≤ 0.05. ** = p ≤ 0.01.</p>

<title>Dystonia rating scale</title>
<p>Mice were placed in a rectangular plexiglass arena in order to phenotypically rate the frequency and severity of dystonic behavior as described previously (Jinnah et al., 2000; Pizoli et al., 2002). The videos were captured to include the animals’ behavior before (baseline) and during each stimulation paradigm (ataxia, dystonia, and tremor). Each stimulation period lasted 2 min, during which the mouse was allowed to ambulate freely as well as in response to disturbance by the experimenter. The rating period excluded the first 10 s after stimulation was initiated to avoid including behavior in response to the sudden application of stimulation. Mice were given a score of 0 if no motor abnormalities were identified, 1 if there was abnormal motor behavior that was not obviously dystonic (such as severe tremor), 2 if there was a mild motor phenotype that included dystonic behaviors that may occur only in response to being disturbed by the experimenter or unprovoked (such as brief hyperextension of the limbs or extension of the neck and/or back), 3 if there was moderate severity or frequent unprovoked dystonic behaviors, 4 if there were severe unprovoked dystonic behaviors, and 5 if there were severe unprovoked dystonic behaviors that made goal-directed ambulation extremely difficult or impossible for an extended time. A detailed description of dystonic phenotypes in mice can be found in Brown et al. 2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests were performed with a post-hoc Holm-Sidak method for p-value adjustment in order to determine significance. Significance values were indicated as not significant (ns) if p &gt; 0.05, * = p ≤ 0.05. ** = p ≤ 0.01.</p>

<title>Tremor analysis</title>
<p>The amplitude and frequency of tremor before (baseline) and during optogenetic stimulation was measured using a custom-made tremor monitor as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>)The mice were implanted with optical fibers targeted to the interposed nucleus as described above. LED drivers were connected to the implant via optical patch cables and placed above the tremor monitor chamber. The tremor monitor chamber is a clear plexiglass box that is suspended by elastic cords that are connected to each corner of the box. An accelerometer is securely mounted to the bottom of the box to detect the tremor of the mouse within the box. The mice were placed in the chamber and were able to freely ambulate while in the box. They were given 2 min to acclimate to the novel tremor monitor environment before 2 min duration baseline recordings were made. The mice were then stimulated with the ataxia, dystonia, and tremor stimulation parameters for 2 min per stimulation period. At least 2 min were allowed to elapse between stimulation periods. Mice were encouraged to ambulate a similar amount during all recording periods. The output from the tremor monitor was amplified and lowpass filtered at 5 kHz (Brownlee Precision, Model 410) before being digitized by a CED board and analyzed using Spike2 scripts. Tremor monitor recordings were centered on zero and downsampled using the Spike2 interpolate function. A power spectrum analysis with a Hanning window was performed on each recording period. The peak power was calculated as the maximum power between 0 and 30 Hz, which is consistent with the range that we typically observe for physiological and pathological tremor in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA with a Tukey multiple comparison adjustment was performed to determine significance. Significance values were indicated as not significant (ns) if p &gt; 0.05, * = p ≤ 0.05. ** = p ≤ 0.01.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>After electrophysiology and behavior experimentation, mice were heavily anesthetized with avertin (2,2,2-tribromoethanol, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; #T48402) and transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 1x) followed by ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). The implants were removed, and then the brains were dissected out of the skull. The brains were post-fixed in PFA at 4°C for at least 24 hours. They were then cryoprotected via a sucrose gradient, starting at 15% sucrose in PBS followed by 30% sucrose in PBS. The brains were imbedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. Compound (Sakura, Torrance, CA, USA), frozen, and then sliced on a cryostat to produce 40 µm thickness sections. The tissue sections were washed in PBS, mounted onto slides, and allowed to dry on the slide for at least 2 hours. The sections were put in a xylene and ethanol series with ∼2 min per submersion in the following order: 100% xylene, 100% xylene, 100% ethanol, 100% ethanol, 90% ethanol, 70% ethanol. The sections were then placed in water for ∼2 min and then submerged in cresyl violet solution until the stain was sufficiently dark. They were then dehydrated by reversing the series with ∼30 s per submersion. Finally, Cytoseal XYL mounting media (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, #22-050-262) and a cover slip were placed on the slides. The slides were allowed to dry in a fume hood before imaging. Photomicrographs were obtained using a Leica DM4000 B LED microscope equipped with a Leica DMC 2900 camera and Leica Application Suite X (LAS X) software. Images were corrected for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA, USA). Figure panels were made using Adobe Illustrator software.</p>

<p><bold>Video 2. Optogenetically-induced behavioral responses in head-fixed mice.</bold> Subtle features of ataxia, dystonia, and tremor can be induced in head-fixed mice by initiating each specific spike signature. In this experiment, the optopatcher recording and stimulation allowed for tracking the inductions of spike signatures in single-units and the subsequent presentation of the disease-associated behaviors. In this video, we show an example of a single trace of multiunit activity recorded from the cerebellar cortex (putative Purkinje cell activity) with the voltage of the trace played as audio in response to all stimulation paradigms and a video of the mouse’s behavioral response to each paradigm during the recording.</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study because it provides evidence that specific neuronal firing patterns in deep cerebellar nuclei map onto specific behavioral movement disorder phenotypes. The optogenetic manipulations and resulting neuronal and behavioral outcomes are highly <bold>compelling</bold>, but the development of the classifier tool was <bold>incomplete</bold>. This study contributes to the fields of cerebellar physiology and movement disorders because it puts forth a map of relationships between neuronal firing patterns and multiple distinct movement phenomena, providing a comprehensive view that goes beyond most studies which typically examine one phenomenon in isolation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Van der Heijden et al perform an ambitious analysis of single-unit activity in the interposed nuclei of multiple mouse models of cerebellar dysfunction. Based on these recordings, they develop a classifier to predict the behavioral phenotype (ataxic, dystonic, or tremor) of each model, suggesting that highly regular spiking is associated with ataxia, irregular spiking is associated with dystonia and rhythmic spiking is associated with tremor. After developing this classifier, they show that activating Purkinje neurons in different patterns that evoke interposed nuclear activity similar to their &quot;ataxic&quot;, &quot;dystonic&quot;, and &quot;tremor&quot; firing patterns induce similar behaviors in healthy mice. These results show convincingly that specific patterns of cerebellar output are sufficient to cause specific movement abnormalities. The extent to which cerebellar nuclear firing patterns are solely responsible for phenotypes in human disease remains to be established, however.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Major strengths are the recordings across multiple phenotypic models including genetic and pharmacologic manipulations, and the robust phenotypes elicited by Purkinje neuron stimulation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The number of units recorded was small for each model (on the order of 20), limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the recording/classifier experiments.</p>

<p>Cerebellar diseases can manifest as various behavioral phenotypes, such as ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. In this study, Heijden and colleagues aim to understand whether these differing behavioral phenotypes are associated with disease-specific changes in the firing patterns of cerebellar output neurons in the cerebellar nuclei (CN). The authors effectively demonstrate that across different mouse models of cerebellar disease, there are distinct changes in the firing properties of CN neurons. They take a crucial step further by attempting to replicate disease-specific firing patterns in the cerebellar output neurons of healthy (control) mice using optogenetics. When Purkinje cells are stimulated in a manner that results in similar firing properties in CN neurons, the authors observe a variety of atypical behavioral responses, many of which align with the behavioral phenotypes observed in mouse models of the respective diseases.</p>
<p>Overall, the primary results are quite convincing. Specifically, they show that (1) different mouse models of cerebellar disease exhibit different statistics of firing in CN neurons, and (2) driving CN neurons in a time-varying manner that mimics the statistics measured in disease models results in behavioral phenomena reminiscent of the disease states. These findings suggest that aberrant activity in the CN can originate from various sources (e.g., developmental circuit deficits, abnormal plasticity, insult), but ultimately, these changes are funneled through the CN neurons, whose firing rates are affected, and this, in turn, drives aberrant behavior. This is a noteworthy observation that underscores the potential of targeting these output neurons in the treatment of cerebellar disease. Moreover, this manuscript provides valuable insights into the firing patterns associated with the most common cerebellar-dependent disease phenotypes.</p>
<p>However, the paper falls short in terms of the classifier model itself. The current implementation of this classifier appears to be rather weak. For instance, the cross-validated performance on the same disease line mouse model for tremor is only 56%. While I understand that the classifier aims to simplify a high-dimensional dataset into a more manageable decision tree, its rather poor performance undermines the authors' main objectives. In a similar vein, although focusing on three primary features of spiking statistics identified by the decision tree model (CV, CV2, and median ISI) is useful for understanding the primary differences between the firing statistics of different mouse models, it results in an overly simplistic view of this complex data. The classifier and its reliance on the reduced feature set are the weakest points of the paper and could benefit from further analysis and a different classification architecture. Nevertheless, it is commendable that the authors have collected high-quality data to validate their classifier. Particularly impressive is their inclusion of data from multiple mouse models of ataxia, dystonia, and tremor, enabling a true test of the classifier's generalizability.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This manuscript looks at the single-cell spike signatures taken from in vivo cerebellar nuclear neurons from awake mice suffering from 3 distinct diseases and uses a sophisticated classifier model to predict disease based on a number of different parameters about the spiking patterns, rather than just one or two. Single read-outs of spike firing patterns did not show significant differences between all 4 groups meaning that you need to analyze multiple parameters of the spike trains to get this information. The results are really satisfying and intriguing, with some diseases separating very well, and others having more overlap. It also represents a significant advancement for the rigor and creativity used for analyzing cerebellar output spike patterns. I really like this paper, it's a clever idea and has been done very well.</p>
<p>The authors examine multiple distinct forms of different diseases, including different types of ataxia, dystonia, and tremor. While some of the interpretation of this work remains unclear to this reviewer (in particular Figure 2, with ataxia models), I applaud the rigor and sharing of complex data that is not always straightforward to understand.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work is technically impressive and the analysis pushes the envelope of how cerebellar dysfunction is classified, which makes it an important paper for the field. It's well written. The approach it is taking is clever. The analysis is thorough, and the authors examine a wide array of different disease models, which is time-consuming, costly, and very challenging to do. It's a very strong manuscript.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Weaknesses are few and quite minor. Some rewriting could be done to make certain sections clearer.</p>

<p><bold>Update, January 11, 2024:</bold></p>
<p>During the course of our careful revising of the paper, we discovered an inconsistency in the way we presented data for figures 5 and 6. Specifically, we used optogenetics to induce ataxia in mice. However, &quot;ataxia&quot;, as a phenotype, can be initiated by a spectrum of cell dysfunctions as revealed by previous studies. We systematically explored this with optogenetics in this current work. Our error is that we presented one stimulation paradigm to show ataxic cell firing (2 ms on / 11 ms off square wave) and then presented a slightly different paradigm to show ataxic animal behavior (10 ms on / 10 ms off square wave). We note that our ataxia paradigms do not affect the outcomes of the dystonia and tremor stimulations. Importantly, the choice of ataxia paradigm does not change the conclusions of the paper. Regardless, for clarity we are actively working to make the stimulation parameters that we present consistent between figures 5 and 6.</p>
<p><bold>October 10, 2023:</bold></p>
<p>We would like to thank all three reviewers for providing excellent suggestions that will enable us to strengthen our manuscript and enhance the impact of our findings. We plan on addressing the comments by altering the text, providing additional data, revising the figures as requested, and most importantly by providing an improved classifier model. Where relevant, we will also provide the reviewers with a response to specific questions that they raised. We will respond to the reviewer’s comments in a point-by-point manner when we submit a revised manuscript. Below, we include an outline of the main points that we intend to address.</p>
<p>Although we will respond in full to all comments and suggestions in the revised documents, here we outline only the major areas in order provide context for our revisions. 1) The major point of concern raised by the reviewers is the strength of the classifier model. We agree with the reviewers that we should put forward the strongest model possible as this forms a core component of our paper. We are planning on retraining our model using the suggestions put forward by the reviewers in the public and author-directed comments. Importantly, given the healthy discussion about our model, our revised manuscript will now also include additional clarification about the choice of the model architecture and limitations of our data structure. Based on the reviewers’ comments, we will include a brief discussion about possible future ways of improving the model. 2) We will provide additional figures and updated figure panels to reflect the new data analyses. Ultimately, we agree that the major strength of our manuscript lies within the many mouse models tested and validation of the classification in different genetic, pharmacological, and optogenetic mouse models, a point raised by all three reviewers. We are confident that the revised images will reflect these strengths. 3) In addition to improving our classifier model, we are planning on making textual changes to clarify several parts of the text and propose a new title that better reflects the data put forth in our manuscript. 4) There are several minor but important comments that were raised by all three reviewers. We will also incorporate these changes as suggested.</p>
