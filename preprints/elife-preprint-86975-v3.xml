<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> accounts for the majority of over 600’000 malaria-associated deaths annually. Parasites resistant to nearly all antimalarials have emerged and the need for drugs with alternative modes of action is thus undoubted. The FK506-binding protein <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 has gained attention as a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506 (tacrolimus). Whilst there is considerable interest in targeting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with small molecules, a genetic validation of this factor as a drug target is missing and its function in parasite biology remains elusive. Here, we show that limiting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels are lethal to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and result in a delayed death-like phenotype that is characterized by defective ribosome homeostasis and stalled protein synthesis. Our data furthermore suggest that FK506, unlike the action of this drug in model organisms, exerts its anti-proliferative activity in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-independent manner and, using cellular thermal shift assays, we identify putative FK506-targets beyond <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. In addition to revealing first insights into the function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, our results show that FKBP-binding drugs can adopt non-canonical modes of action – with major implications for the development of FK506-derived molecules active against <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites and other eukaryotic pathogens.</p>

<label>1</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite considerable progress in recent years, malaria remains one of the major global health threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). The apicomplexan parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for the vast majority of the over 600’000 malaria deaths in 2020. Most of this burden is carried by infants and children under the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria deaths increased by 12% compared to 2019, which can at least in part be explained by the COVID-19 related suspension of malaria control and treatment measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). In addition, the emergence of parasites resistant to most antimalarials, including artemisinin-based combination therapies, endangers current and future disease elimination efforts and underscores the need for developing drugs with alternative modes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>).</p>
<p>FK506 (tacrolimus), a well-characterized immunosuppressant, shows considerable activity against asexual blood stage parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes a single FK506-binding protein (FKBP) dubbed <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (PF3D7_1247400), which is considered to be a promising drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). FKBPs belong to the immunophilin family and are conserved throughout the eukaryotic kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). In contrast to the malaria parasite, most other eukaryotes encode several FKBPs that, besides showing high affinity for the FK506 drug, exert peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity. The PPIase moiety catalyzes cis-trans isomerization of proline residues – an event thought to be rate-limiting for the folding of many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Independent of their PPIase activity, FKBPs act as chaperones to prevent protein aggregation under stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Furthermore, some FKBP variants play a role in cellular signaling or gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). Human FKBP12 for instance is best-known for its ability to form a complex with the immunosuppressant drugs FK506 and rapamycin. These complexes inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin and the kinase activity of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Amongst many other effects, this inhibition results in decreased T-cell activation. Of note, the regulatory role of <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP12 depends on the presence of rapamycin or FK506. In absence of drugs, this immunophilin neither interacts with mTOR nor with calcineurin and does hence not affect activity of these key components of eukaryotic cells. Due to the conserved nature of FKBPs, rapamycin and FK506 have also gained attention as potential antimicrobial drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to its homologs in model organisms, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 harbors PPIase and chaperoning activity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Despite sharing key features with FKBPs of other eukaryotes, its role in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> remains elusive. <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is believed to interact with heat shock proteins (HSPs) and co-immunoprecipitates with cytoskeletal factors of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). While <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is inhibiting the phosphatase activity of recombinant calcineurin in a FK506-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), it does not co-localize with calcineurin <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The protein is expressed throughout the 48-hour intra-erythrocytic development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and is found within the cytosol of ring stage parasites. In the older trophozoite and the replicating schizont stages, the protein was reported to also localize to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). While a transposon-based mutagenesis screen suggests that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is essential for intra-erythrocytic replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), neither its cellular function nor its essentiality was confirmed experimentally in live parasites. The unknown role in parasite biology notwithstanding, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is considered to be a viable drug target and, given the fact that <italic>P. vivax</italic> and <italic>P. knowlesi</italic> encode FKBP homologs that exhibit comparable PPIase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), future FKBP-targeted therapies may be effective across different <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species.</p>
<p>Crystal structures of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in complex with FK506 and rapamycin revealed high affinity interactions with the FK506-binding domain of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Consistent with these observations, <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme activity assays showed that FK506 inhibits the PPIase activity of recombinant <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Previous research aimed at exploiting structural differences between human and parasite-encoded FKBPs to circumvent the immunosuppressive activity of drug-bound <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). These efforts include investigation of non-covalent FKBP inhibitors such as adamantyl derivatives, macrocycles, the small molecule D44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) and the synthetic ligand for FKBP (SLF) as well as derivatives thereof designed to covalently bind <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). While D44 shows promising antimalarial activity, it fails to alter thermostability of the FK506-binding domains of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP12 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>), suggesting that this compound does not directly interact with <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. Up until now, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 has not been validated as a drug target using reverse genetics, and the link between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-interacting drugs and their antimalarial activity remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we generated inducible <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 knock-out, knock-down as well as over-expression cell lines and demonstrate that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is essential for asexual replication of blood forms. We show that the knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 results in reduced levels of ribosomal proteins and stalled protein synthesis. However, these effects are not reflected in the parasite transcriptome, indicating a vital role at the post-transcriptional level. While the mechanistic link between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and ribosome homeostasis remains elusive, our data underpins the potential of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 as a drug target and, using cellular thermal shift assays (CETSA), we corroborate the high affinity binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. Importantly, however, our data does not support scenarios in which FK506 inhibits the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, suggesting that it exerts its antimalarial activity in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-independent manner, which has major implications for the development of future FK506-based antimalarials and/or <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35- inhibiting drugs.</p>

<p>Next, we generated a cell line allowing for the conditional knock-out of the endogenous coding sequence using a dimerizable Cre recombinase (DiCre)-based system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Specifically, we introduced two <italic>loxP</italic> sites – one within a synthetic intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>) downstream of the start codon and one after the stop codon of the <italic>fkbp35</italic> coding region – and added a <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> (<italic>gfp</italic>) sequence downstream of this expression cassette (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). As a result, these NF54/iKO-FKBP35 parasites express tag-free, wild-type (WT) <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 protein under control conditions (FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold>). Upon DiCre activation, the <italic>loxP</italic> sites are recombined and the <italic>fkbp35</italic> locus is excised from the parasite genome (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2B</xref>). Under these knock-out conditions (FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold>), parasites express cytosolic GFP under control of the endogenous <italic>fkbp35</italic> promoter. This setup allows monitoring knock-out efficiency at the single cell level and revealed that DiCre successfully deleted <italic>fkbp35</italic> in the vast majority of parasites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>In a first attempt, we induced the <italic>fkbp35</italic> knock-out in synchronous ring stage NF54/iKO-FKBP35 parasites at 0-6 hours post erythrocyte invasion (hpi), i.e. prior to the expected peak transcription of <italic>fkbp35</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). These FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites showed a delayed death-like phenotype. In the first generation (G1), parasites completed intra-erythrocytic development without noticeable effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>) and entered the next generation (G2) with a multiplication rate similar to that of the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control population (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). In G2, however, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites arrested at the late trophozoite/early schizont stage (approximately 30-36 hpi) with many cells failing to enter DNA replication in the S-phase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). To investigate this phenomenon in more detail, we induced the <italic>fkbp35</italic> knock-out at three different time points during the IDC. Similar to DiCre activation at 0-6 hpi, knocking out <italic>fkbp35</italic> at 12-18 hpi resulted in parasite death at the trophozoite/schizont stage of the subsequent generation. However, when induced at 24-30 hpi or 34-40 hpi in G1, parasites did not only complete the current IDC but also successfully passed through G2 before they eventually arrested in G3 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Considering that low <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels are sufficient to maintain the essential function of the protein, as observed with the NF54/iKD-FKBP35 parasites (see <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C-D</xref>), it is conceivable that proteins expressed between 0 and 24hpi, i.e. prior to deleting <italic>fkbp35</italic> from the genome, allow parasites to enter G3.</p>
<p>The delayed death of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> is reminiscent of a phenotype observed in apicoplast-deficient parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). We therefore tested if <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is involved in apicoplast biology, i.e. the synthesis and/or export of isoprenoid precursors, but did not find evidence for an association with this organelle (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). Furthermore, given the reported interaction of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with heat shock proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>), we also tested the parasitès response to heat stress, but could not detect altered heat-susceptibility between FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> cells (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further elucidate the function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, we induced the <italic>fkbp35</italic> knock-out in early ring stages (0-6 hpi) and compared the proteomes of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites at the schizont stage of G1 (36-42 hpi) and at the trophozoite stage of the following generation (G2, 24-30 hpi) using a quantitative proteomics approach.</p>

<label>2.2.1</label><title>The knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 causes accumulation of pre-ribosome components in G1</title>
<p>Consistent with the efficient deletion of <italic>fkbp35</italic> on the genomic level, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> schizonts of G1 showed a 19-fold (18.9 +/-5.7 s.d.) reduction of FKBP35 and GFP levels were increased by 84-fold (83.7 +/-38.5 s.d.) when compared to the control population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, Table S1). Besides <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and GFP, 50 parasite proteins were significantly deregulated in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> schizonts and 34 of them found at elevated levels compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control conditions. A gene ontology analysis using PANTHER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) indicated enrichment of the “<italic>pre-ribosome</italic>” (fold enrichment = 30.4, p-value = 1.46E-5, 4/34 proteins) and “<italic>nucleolus</italic>” (fold enrichment = 6.77, p-value = 8.85E-4, 5/34 proteins) terms among these factors. While the pre-ribosome is a large subunit precursor of mature ribosomes, the nucleolus represents the primary site for the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). In contrast to factors being more abundant in knock-out parasites, none of the 16 factors with lower abundance in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells were associated with ribosome-related processes (Table S1). Despite being phenotypically silent in G1, the accumulation of pre-ribosome and nucleolar components hints at perturbed ribosome maturation in these cells. Specifically, it is conceivable that the observed buildup of ribosome intermediates results from reduced anabolic activity, i.e. the stalling of nucleolar pre-ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these effects, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells were equally sensitive to the translation inhibitor cycloheximide compared to their FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), indicating that ribosome function is not compromised at this point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).

<label>2.2.2</label><title><italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is essential for maintaining normal levels of functional ribosomes in G2</title>
<p>In the following generation (G2, 24-30 hpi), the proteome of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> trophozoites showed substantial differences. Despite the absence of morphological changes at this point in time, 216 proteins were significantly deregulated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Among these, 50 proteins were found at higher abundance compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> and their gene ontology terms point towards an effect on processes involved in energy metabolism (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of deregulated factors (166 of 216) in G2, however, were less abundant in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control cells. Very prominently, 20 of the top 50 hit molecules are ribosomal proteins that, on average, show a two-fold reduction (2.0 +/- 0.4 s.d.) in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites (Table S1). It is therefore not surprising that PANTHER identified the knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 to mainly affect ribosome-related processes, such as “<italic>cytoplasmic translation”</italic>, “<italic>ribosome assembly”</italic>, and “<italic>ribosomal large subunit biogenesis”</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess if the reduced levels of ribosomal proteins result in lower protein synthesis rates, we employed the “surface sensing of translation” (SUnSET) technique. SUnSET is based on incorporation of the tyrosyl-tRNA analogue puromycin into nascent peptide chains and thereby allows monitoring newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). As expected, we found that FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> trophozoites in G2 (24-30 hpi) showed reduced translation rates compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control population (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), while protein synthesis was not affected under control conditions (rapamycin-induced DiCre activation in the NF54/DiCre parental line (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2E</xref>)).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results indicate that, under knock-out conditions, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels become limiting for ribosome maturation late during schizogony of G1, without having immediate effects on the steady-state levels of mature ribosomes. The knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is thus phenotypically silent in G1. In absence of a continuous supply of mature ribosomes under FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> conditions, however, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites fail at maintaining translation at a level that would support normal parasite development in the next generation (G2).</p>

<p>As expected, the transcriptome of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> showed a prominent reduction of steady-state <italic>fkbp35</italic> transcripts already in TP1 (11.3-fold +/-2.0 s.d.) compared to the FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> control population (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B</xref>, Table S2). During peak transcription at 30-36 hpi (TP2), this difference increased to 240-fold (238.4 +/-20.0 s.d.) and, consistent with the efficient recombination at the <italic>fkbp35</italic> locus, these cells started transcribing <italic>gfp</italic>. Notwithstanding the prominent depletion of <italic>fkbp35</italic> transcripts, the transcriptome of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> is only marginally affected up to and including 24-30 hpi in G2 (TP6). By contrast, at 30-36 hpi (TP7) the transcription of knock-out parasites shows major changes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Considering the appearance of morphological changes in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> at this time point, effects on the transcriptome are unlikely to represent specific activities of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in gene regulation. Indeed, mapping the transcriptome of individual time points to a high resolution reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>), revealed a significant slow-down of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites at TP7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3C</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">S3C</xref>). This indicates aborted cell cycle progression in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites during a phase that is characterized by a rapid increase in biomass – possibly due to a translation and/or size-dependent cell cycle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>). At earlier time points (TP1-TP6), the transcriptomes of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> are highly comparable and the differences observed on the level of individual genes clearly fail at explaining the proteomic changes observed in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites at 24-30 hpi in G2 (TP6), reiterating that the essential activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is linked to transcription-independent processes.</p>

<p><italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 emerged as a promising antimalarial drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>) and considerable efforts were made to define interactions of this immunophilin with small molecules in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Several studies conclusively demonstrated that FK506 – the most well-known ligand of mammalian FKBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>) – binds to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>) and kills asexual blood stage parasites with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in the low micromolar range at 1.9 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>).</p>

<label>2.4.1</label><title>CETSA identifies targets of FK506</title>
<p>In a first step, we performed CETSA in combination with drug-exposed protein extracts. Since proteins lose their physiological context during the process of protein extraction, this variant of the CETSA approach is designed to identify direct protein-drug interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Not surprisingly, we found <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 to be stabilized by FK506 in a dose-dependent manner when challenged at 60 °C with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 152.0 nM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). The fact that FK506 exhibits its stabilizing activity already in the low nanomolar concentration range indicates high affinity interactions between the protein-drug pair.</p>
<p>Besides <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, FK506 stabilizes a number of other proteins in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4C</xref> and S6). A few of these factors show pronounced sigmoidal stabilization profiles and are predicted to be essential (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Amongst others, N6-methyl transferase MT-A70 (PF3D7_0729500), histone deacetylase HDA2 (PF3D7_1008000), pre-mRNA-splicing factor CEF1 (PF3D7_1033600), FeS cluster assembly protein SufD (PF3D7_1103400) and the H/ACA ribonucleoprotein complex subunit 1 (PF3D7_1309500) showed most pronounced stabilization profiles (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref> and Table S3). In contrast to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, most of these likely essential candidates are stabilized at FK506 concentrations close to the drug`s IC50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It can therefore not be excluded that the binding of FK506 to at least one of these factors is contributes to the antimalarial activity of the drug.</p>

<label>2.4.2</label><title>The <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35/FK506 pair interferes with ribosomal complexes</title>
<p>Given the high-affinity interaction of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 with FK506 and its association with ribosomal proteins, we set out to describe the native context of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 using the “live cell variant” of CETSA. In contrast to focusing exclusively on direct protein-drug interactions, live cell CETSA allows capturing drug-induced shifts in protein stability beyond those of direct binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) and amongst others allows identifying factors present in the same protein complex as the target protein. To do so, CETSA takes advantage of the fact that factors within complexes have similar denaturation temperatures due to their co-aggregation upon heat-induced denaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). As a consequence, this CETSA variant generally identifies more factors compared to the protein extract-based CETSA approach (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).</p>
<p>As expected, and confirming the results above, live cell CETSA shows that FK506 alters the thermal stability of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 already at very low drug concentrations when challenged at 60 °C with an EC50 of 286.7 nM (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Interestingly, and in contrast to the protein lysate-based approach, live cell CETSA revealed that more than 50 ribosomal proteins are stabilized in presence of FK506 when challenged at 55 °C, with a median EC50 of 45.9 nM (25<sup>th</sup> percentile = 34.2, 75<sup>th</sup> percentile = 58.9). Of note, these ribosomal proteins were stabilized at virtually identical FK506 concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D</xref>, and <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>), indicating that the drug – directly or indirectly – interacts with ribosomal complexes. This is in further agreement with the fact that these ribosomal factors were not identified by protein lysate-based CETSA (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">S6</xref>).</p>
<p>Worth mentioning, we observed a drug dose-dependent increase in soluble protein abundance of ribosomal proteins also under non-denaturing conditions, i.e. at 37 °C, with a median EC50 of 1.94 µM (25<sup>th</sup> percentile = 1.85, 75<sup>th</sup> percentile = 2.1) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4D</xref>, <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">S7</xref>). Generally, due to the absence of a denaturing heat challenge, such a drug-dependent enrichment in soluble protein levels does not indicate binding-induced thermal stabilization of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Instead, this can be the result of increased protein synthesis, altered protein conformation or, alternatively, occur in response to factors disengaging from larger protein complexes. The fact that FK506 solubilizes a high number of ribosomal proteins within a very narrow concentration window also at 37 °C, implies that these factors are liberated from the same ribosomal complex or from complexes that interact with each other and shows that FK506 negatively affects stability of ribosomal structures in live cells. However, these effects are limited to high, presumably saturating FK506 concentrations. Importantly, the vast majority of ribosomal proteins identified in live cell CETSA are shared with those de-regulated in <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 knock out cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>), pointing towards a shared localization of FK506 and its <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 target in live parasites.</p>
<p>Together with the above-described importance of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in ribosome homeostasis, these results strongly suggest that FK506 is recruited to the activity site of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 – most probably the nucleolar maturation sites of ribosomes – where it interacts with ribosomal complexes.</p>

<label>2.1</label><title>FKBP-targeting drugs fail at inhibiting the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35</title>
<p>Considering the proposed direct interaction between FK506 and FKBP35 in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we expected that FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites show altered sensitivity to the drug. Consistent with published data, FK506 killed FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> cells with an IC50 of 1942 nM (+/-193 nM s.d.) when administered at 4-10 hpi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Surprisingly however, and despite the prominent depletion of the protein under knock-out conditions, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites were equally sensitive to FK506 (IC50 = 1741 nM +/- 187 s.d.) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). Similarly, neither the efficient knock-down of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in NF54/iKD-FKBP35 parasites (compare <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref>), nor its over-expression (OE) in NF54/iOE-FKBP35 cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A-C</xref>), resulted in the expected sensitivity change to FK506 treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). In addition to this apparent independence of the drug to varying <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels, and in agreement with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>), FK506 unfolds its antimalarial activity within the same cycle after treatment. Standing in stark contrast to the delayed death-like phenotype of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites (compare <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-G</xref>), this immediate activity on parasite survival substantiates the notion that FK506 must target essential parasite factors other than <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35.</p>
<p>To rule out that the timing of drug exposure is masking expected links between FK506 and <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, we tested whether administering FK506 at 30-36 hpi and 36-42 hpi (instead of 4- 10 hpi) affects parasite survival in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-dependent manner. However, we did not observe a change compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref>), ruling out the possibility that FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites were killed by FK506 before <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels were different in the two populations. Further, to account for a scenario in which the activity of FK506 on <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is masked by a temporal delay between drug exposure and parasite killing, we induced the knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 at 34-40 hpi (instead of 0-6 hpi) and allowed FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites to proceed to G2, before exposing them to different FK506 concentrations. Despite these efforts, FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites were equally sensitive to FK506 (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref>, <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">S5C</xref>) and the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D-E</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to FK506, we evaluated the <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-specific inhibitor D44 (N-(2-Ethylphenyl)- 2-(3h-Imidazo[4,5-B]pyridin-2-Ylsulfanyl)acetamide) but, surprisingly, we failed to reproduce the previously reported dose-response effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We tested D44 from two suppliers using NF54/iKO-FKBP35, NF54 wild type and K1 parasite strains using different assay setups, including the gold standard method that is based on the incorporation of tritium labeled hypoxanthine into DNA of replicating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Still, we could not detect any activity of D44 on asexual replication of blood stage parasites (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figs. S5F-G</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results are in clear conflict with the perception that FK506 and D44 target the essential activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35.</p>

<label>3</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Members of the FKBP family are involved in regulating diverse cellular processes in eukaryotic as well as in prokaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). In contrast to most other eukaryotes, the human malaria parasite <italic>P. falciparum</italic> encodes a single FKBP only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). The enzymatic activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, as well as the interactions of the protein with FKBP-targeting drugs, was subject to considerable drug-focused research <italic>in vitro</italic>. Besides demonstrating the drug`s affinity to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 by co-crystallization, these efforts uncovered that FK506 inhibits enzymatic activity of the protein`s PPIase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Together with the anti-malarial activity of FK506, these data offered compelling evidence for an essential but yet uncharacterized role of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 during blood stage development of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p>
<p>Here, we set out to investigate the role of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in parasite biology. Using an inducible knock-out approach, we show that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is indeed essential for intra-erythrocytic development of asexually replicating <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites and CETSA experiments confirmed high affinity binding of FK506 to its <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 target. While the knock-out of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 does not markedly affect transcription, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells show reduced levels of ribosomal proteins and impaired protein synthesis on the global scale. Surprisingly however, these effects, as well as the consequent death during the late trophozoite/early schizont stage, only manifest in the cycle following knock-out induction without affecting cell cycle progression in the first generation (G1) or multiplication rates from G1 to G2. In contrast to the delayed death-like phenotype of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells, FK506 unfolds its parasiticidal activity without a lag phase, i.e. within the IDC of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>), and the dose-response relationship between FK506 and parasite death is irresponsive to altered <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels. Taken together, our data strongly indicate that the parasite-killing activity of FK506 is <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-independent.</p>
<p>Knocking out <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 early during intra-erythrocytic development has only minor effects on the parasite proteome in G1. Being relatively subtle, these changes may still point towards an important function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35: Factors associated with the nucleolus – the site of ribosome biogenesis – are found at higher abundance in knock-out cells. In the next cycle, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites show a dramatic decrease of factors associated with ribosome-and translation-related processes and, likely a consequence thereof, globally reduced protein synthesis during trophozoite development (G2, 24-30 hpi). Importantly, at this point in time, FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells still show ordinary morphology and their transcriptional activity remains largely unaffected. The observed changes in the abundance of ribosomal factors must therefore result from transcription-independent activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. While ribosomal components are present at higher levels in G1, they are drastically reduced in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells in G2. These opposing effects likely result from <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 activity in a shared cellular process. Specifically, it is conceivable that low <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels inhibit ribosome maturation in G1, explaining the accumulation of (pre-) ribosomal factors. While the levels of functional ribosomes are sufficient to support continued translation in G1, ribosomes likely become limiting in the next generation (G2), which eventually results in stalled translation activity and concomitant parasite death at the onset of schizogony.</p>
<p>In contrast to the significant effects on the protein levels in G2, the transcription of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> remains largely unaffected by the loss of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and becomes apparent only during late trophozoite/early schizont development in G2 (30-36 hpi); i.e. at a time during which cell cycle progression is slowed down in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites. In fact, at this stage the transcriptional signature of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites is dominated by the slowed progression through intra-erythrocytic development, rather than resulting from specific gene regulatory events. While this stalling is consistent with the observed effects on ribosome homeostasis and protein synthesis, it demonstrates that, in contrast to certain FKBP family members in other organisms, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 does not have apparent roles in transcriptional control.</p>
<p>Regarding the well-characterized and fast-acting parasiticidal activity of FK506 on <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, it was somewhat surprising to observe a delayed death-like phenotype for <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 knock-out parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). We hence set out to investigate unifying explanations. The delayed death of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites is most easily be explained by residual activity of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 proteins synthesized prior to inducing the genomic knock-out of <italic>fkbp35</italic>. In such a scenario, low <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> would be sufficient to allow completion of the IDC, before eventually dropping below a level that is required for supporting parasite survival in the next cycle. Despite intense efforts, we failed at confirming this hypothesis and our data strongly favors an alternative scenario in which FK506 kills parasites in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-idenpendent manner. Aside from the fact that FK506 exerts its parasiticidal activity within the same IDC, neither the conditional knock-out, knock-down nor the overexpression of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 altered the parasite’s sensitivity to FK506; and this irrespective of the profoundly deregulated <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels in the respective mutant lines (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). For instance, administering FK506 36 hours post induction of the knock-out in early ring stages (36-42 hpi) – i.e. at a time point where FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> cells are only left with about 5% of the regular <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels (19-fold reduction compared to FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>) – does not affect the dose-response of parasites to the drug. Further, our attempts to demonstrate that the timing of drug exposure is masking the expected links between FK506 and its <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 drug target failed (compare <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A</xref> and S5A-C). Our data is thus incompatible with the notion that the parasite-killing activity of FK506 results from inhibiting the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35.</p>
<p>Since binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 alone cannot explain the drug’s antimalarial activity, we aimed identifying additional FK506 targets. CETSA performed on protein lysates identified a number of parasite factors binding to FK506. Compared to the <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35/FK506 pair, however, these interactions are of considerably lower affinity. The adenosine-methyltransferase MT-A70 (PF3D7_0729500) and the pre-mRNA-splicing factor CEF1 (PF3D7_1033600), for instance, were stabilized by FK506 with EC50 concentrations of 2.0 and 3.1 µM, respectively. While this affinity is relatively poor compared to the strong interaction formed between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and FK506, one should be cautious designating the binding of FK506 to these proteins as irrelevant “<italic>off-target</italic>” effects. In fact, their inhibition may hypothetically mask effects of FK506 on <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 – a possibility that shall briefly be discussed in the following section.</p>
<p>Assuming that FK506 is inhibiting the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, one would expect parasites to show a delayed death-like phenotype similar to that observed in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites. The presence and inhibition of other essential targets may, however, mask such an effect. Consistent with this possibility, FK506 kills <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites at 1.9 µM (+/-0.2 µM s.d.), i.e. at concentrations similar to those required for stabilizing MT-A70 and CEF1 under thermal challenge in CETSA. However, numerous attempts to prove that FK506 indeed inhibits essential <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 functions failed: Neither knocking out <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 at different time points nor adding FK506 to different stages of FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites could provide evidence for a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-dependent effect. This indicates that either the binding of FK506 does not interfere with the essential role of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, or that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is inhibited only at high FK506 concentrations that also inhibit other essential factors. In this context it is worth mentioning that parasites remain unaffected by a highly efficient knock-down of endogenous <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 (observed with NF54/iKD-FKBP35; compare <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figs. S1C-D</xref>), which demonstrates that very low protein levels are sufficient to maintain the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35. It is thus conceivable that high FK506 concentrations are required to fully inhibit <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 – a view that is further supported by data obtained with the live cell CETSA approach discussed hereafter.</p>
<p>Besides identifying direct binding of drugs to their target, live cell CETSA allows capturing indirect effects on factors that act in the same pathway or in the same protein complex as the drug-bound target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). While this approach confirmed the high affinity binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, it also revealed that more than 50 ribosomal proteins share a very prominent CETSA signature: First, they are thermally stabilized by FK506 within a narrow concentration window of the drug. Second, higher levels of FK506 increase the solubility of these ribosomal components also at 37 ℃. These results indicate that the FK506/<italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 pair interacts with ribosomal complexes and that FK506 is able to induce the dissociation of these ribosomal structures under physiological conditions. Importantly, and in contrast to the binding of FK506 to <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35, this effect on ribosomes is only observed at high concentrations of the drug. Together, these data likely explain the discrepancy observed between the high binding affinity of FK506 for <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and the low or even absent effect of the drug on <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 function in blood stage parasites.</p>
<p>In line with our data, previous biochemical approaches revealed potential links between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and ribosomes. Using co-immunoprecipitation, Leneghan and colleagues revealed that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is interacting with 480 proteins, of which 31 are ribosomal factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). Indeed, FKBP family members are essentially involved in controlling ribosomes in other systems. The human FKBP variant <italic>Hs</italic>FKBP25, for instance, is recruited to the pre-ribosome where its chaperone activity appears to be required for the assembly of the ribosomal large subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). While the FKBP variant of yeast, Fpr4, interacts with the ribosome biogenesis factor Nop53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> trigger factor (TF) is part of the ribosomal complex and crucial for the folding of nascent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Considering the marked reduction of ribosomal proteins in FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> parasites, it is tempting to speculate that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is chaperoning ribosome biogenesis similar to Fpr4 and FKBP25 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>humans</italic>, respectively.</p>
<p>The fact that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 localizes to distinct nuclear foci and its depletion causes dysregulation of ribosomes points towards a role within the nucleolus – the nuclear compartment driving ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Using IFAs, we found that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 does not co-localize with the nucleolar marker fibrillarin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>) (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8</xref>). However, its localization appears to be intertwined with that of this rRNA methyltransferase. Specifically, <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is mostly found in close vicinity to fibrillarin-rich regions. Nucleoli in eukaryotic cells generally consist of two or, in higher eukaryotes, three sub-compartments. Of those, the granular component (GC) represents the site of pre-ribosome assembly and encompasses fibrillarin-enriched central regions of nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). The spatial correlation observed between <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 and fibrillarin may thus indicate localization to different sub-nucleolar compartments, with <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 occupying the GC area of the nucleolus.</p>
<p>In summary, we demonstrate that limiting <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 levels are lethal to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and result in a delayed death-like phenotype that is characterized by perturbed ribosome homeostasis and defective protein synthesis, which is likely linked to the reduced biogenesis of functional ribosomes in the nucleolus. We further found no evidence that FKBP-binding drugs, including FK506, exert their parasiticidal activity in a <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35-dependent manner, urging strong caution for the future development of FKBP-targeting antimalarials, especially when based on FK506 and structural derivatives thereof. In addition to revealing first insights into the essential function of <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 in ribosome homeostasis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, we are convinced that the presented data offer valuable information for target-based efforts in malaria drug discovery.</p>

The membrane was probed using the primary antibodies mAb mouse α-GFP (1:1’000, Roche Diagnostics #11814460001), mAb mouse α-<italic>Pf</italic>GAPDH (1:20’000) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>), or mAb mouse α-puromycin (1:5’000, Sigma MABE343) diluted in blocking solution. After 2 h incubation, the membrane was washed 5 times in PBS-T before it was incubated with the secondary antibody goat α-mouse IgG (H&amp;L)-HRP (1:10’000, GE healthcare #NXA931). After 1 h incubation, the membrane was washed 5 times and the signal was detected using the chemiluminescent substrate SuperSignal West Pico Plus (Thermo Scientific, REF 34580) and the imaging system Vilber Fusion FX7 Edge 17.10 SN. Nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by incubating for 10 min in a stripping buffer (1 g/L SDS, 15 g/L glycine, 1% Tween-20, pH 2.2) and washed three times in PBS-T before blocking and re-probing.</p>

<p>Dose-response relationships were assessed by exposing synchronous ring stage parasites at 0.5% parasitaemia and 1.25% hematocrit to 12 drug concentrations using a two-step serial dilution in 96-well plates (Corning Incorporated, 96-well cell culture plate, flat bottom, REF 3596) in three independent biological replicates. The plates were gassed and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. FK506 (MedChemExpress HY-13756), D44 (ChemBridge 7934155 and ChemDiv 7286-2836) and cyclosporin A (Sigma 30024) stocks of 10 mM were prepared in DMSO and working solutions were prepared immediately before the experiment. To measure parasite survival using flow cytometry, cultures were stained in 1X SYBR Green 1 DNA stain (Invitrogen S7563) in a new 96-well plate (Corning Incorporated, 96-well cell culture plate, round bottom, REF 3788) and incubated in the dark for 20 min. The samples were washed once in PBS. Using a MACS Quant Analyzer 10, 50’000 events per condition were measured and analyzed using the FlowJo_v10.6.1 software. Infected RBCs were identified based on SYBR Green 1 DNA stain intensity. The gating strategy is shown in <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Fig. S9</xref>. To quantify parasite survival based on hypoxanthine incorporation into DNA, compounds were dissolved in DMSO (10 mM), diluted in hypoxanthine-free culture medium and titrated in duplicates over a 64-fold range (6 step twofold dilutions) in 96 well plates. 100 μl asexual parasite culture (prepared in hypoxanthine-free medium) were added to each well and mixed with the compound to obtain a final haematocrit of 1.25% and a final parasitemia of 0.3%. After incubation for 48 hrs, 0.25 μCi of [3H]-hypoxanthine was added per well and plates were incubated for an additional 24 hrs. Parasites were then harvested onto glass-fiber filters using a Microbeta FilterMate cell harvester (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, US) and radioactivity was counted using a MicroBeta2 liquid scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, US). The results were recorded and expressed as a percentage of the untreated controls. Curve fitting and IC50 calculations were performed using a non-linear, four-parameter regression model with variable slope (Graph Pad Prism, version 8.2.1).</p>

<p>Parasite cultures were split at 0-6 hpi in G1 and treated for 4 h with 100 nM rapamycin. Saponin lysis of paired FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> populations at 36-42 hpi in G1 and 24-30 hpi in G2 was performed as described above. Samples were collected in three independent biological replicates. The washed parasite pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, parasites were resuspended in 25 µL of lysis buffer (5% SDS, 100 mM tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB), 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphin (TCEP), pH 8.5) and sonicated (10 cycles, 30 sec on/off at 4 °C, Bioruptor, Diagnode). Lysates were subsequently reduced for 10 minutes at 95 °C. Samples were then cooled down to RT and 0.5 µL of 1M iodoacetamide was added to the samples. Cysteine residues were alkylated for 30 min at 25 °C in the dark. Digestion and peptide purification was performed using S-trap technology (Protifi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, samples were acidified by addition of 2.5 µL of 12% phosphoric acid (1:10) and then 165 µL of S-trap buffer (90% methanol, 100 mM TEAB pH 7.1) was added to the samples (6:1). Samples were briefly vortexed and loaded onto S-trap micro spin-columns (Protifi) and centrifuged for 1 min at 4000 g. Flow-through was discarded and spin-columns were then washed 3 times with 150 µL of S-trap buffer (each time samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 4000 g and flow-through was removed). S-trap columns were then moved to the clean tubes and 20 µL of digestion buffer (50 mM TEAB pH 8.0) and trypsin (at 1:25 enzyme to protein ratio) were added to the samples. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 1h at 47 °C. Then, 40 µL of digestion buffer were added to the samples and the peptides were collected by centrifugation at 4000 g for 1 minute. To increase the recovery, S-trap columns were washed with 40 µL of 0.2% formic acid in water (400g, 1 min) and 35 µL of 0.2% formic acid in 50% acetonitrile. Eluted peptides were dried under vacuum and stored at - 20 °C until further analysis.</p>
<p>Peptides were resuspended in 0.1% aqueous formic acid and peptide concentration was adjusted to 0.25 µg/µL. 1 µL of each sample was subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis using an Orbitrap Elicpse Tribrid Mass Spectrometer fitted with an Ultimate 3000 nano system (both from Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a custom-made column heater set to 60 °C. Peptides were resolved using a RP-HPLC column (75 μm × 30 cm) packed in-house with C18 resin (ReproSil-Pur C18–AQ, 1.9 μm resin; Dr. Maisch GmbH) at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min. The following gradient was used for peptide separation: from 2% buffer B to 12% B over 5 min, to 30% B over 40 min, to 50% B over 15 min, to 95% B over 2 min followed by 11 min at 95% B then back to 2% B. Buffer A was 0.1% formic acid in water and buffer B was 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water.</p>
<p>The mass spectrometer was operated in DDA mode with a cycle time of 3 seconds between master scans. Each master scan was acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 240,000 FWHM (at 200 m/z) and a scan range from 375 to 1600 m/z followed by MS2 scans of the most intense precursors in the linear ion trap at “Rapid” scan rate with isolation width of the quadrupole set to 1.4 m/z. Maximum ion injection time was set to 50 ms (MS1) and 35 ms (MS2) with an AGC target set to 1e6 and 1e4, respectively. Only peptides with charge state 2-5 were included in the analysis. Monoisotopic precursor selection (MIPS) was set to Peptide, and the Intensity Threshold was set to 5e3. Peptides were fragmented by HCD (Higher-energy collisional dissociation) with collision energy set to 35%, and one microscan was acquired for each spectrum. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The acquired raw-files were imported into the Progenesis QI software (v2.0, Nonlinear Dynamics Limited), which was used to extract peptide precursor ion intensities across all samples applying the default parameters. The generated mgf-file was searched using MASCOT against a <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (isolate 3D7) database (Uniprot, 11.2019) and 392 commonly observed contaminants using the following search criteria: full tryptic specificity was required (cleavage after lysine or arginine residues, unless followed by proline); 3 missed cleavages were allowed; carbamidomethylation (C) was set as fixed modification; oxidation (M) and acetyl (Protein N-term) were applied as variable modifications; mass tolerance of 10 ppm (precursor) and 0.6 Da (fragments). The database search results were filtered using the ion score to set the false discovery rate (FDR) to 1% on the peptide and protein level, respectively, based on the number of reverse protein sequence hits in the dataset. Quantitative analysis results from label-free quantification were processed using the SafeQuant R package v.2.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>) to obtain peptide relative abundances. This analysis included global data normalization by equalizing the total peak/reporter areas across all LC-MS runs, data imputation using the knn algorithm, summation of peak areas per protein and LC-MS/MS run, followed by calculation of peptide abundance ratios. Only isoform specific peptide ion signals were considered for quantification. To meet additional assumptions (normality and homoscedasticity) underlying the use of linear regression models and t-Tests, MS-intensity signals were transformed from the linear to the log-scale. The summarized peptide expression values were used for statistical testing of between condition differentially abundant peptides. Here, empirical Bayes moderated t-Tests were applied, as implemented in the R/Bioconductor limma package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). The resulting per protein and condition comparison <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>

Briefly, live parasites (10<sup>7</sup> MACS-purified trophozoites per condition) were exposed to a FK506 (MedChemExpress HY-13756) concentration gradient (100 µM to 1.5 nM) and a DMSO control for 1 h. Subsequently, the parasites were washed in PBS and exposed to the denaturing temperatures 50 °C, 55 °C and 60 °C as well as to a non-denaturing temperature 37 °C for 3 min, before they were cooled down to 4 °C for 3 min. Afterwards, the cells were lysed by resuspending in a lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM TCEP, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), three freeze/thaw cycles, and mechanical shearing using a syringe with a 31-gauge needle.

<caption><title>Characterization of NF54/iOE-FKBP35 parasites.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Schematic of the modified <italic>p230p</italic> locus (PF3D7_0208900) in NF54/iOE-FKBP35 parasites, in which the overexpression cassette was introduced. This cassette consists of a <italic>bip</italic> promoter upstream of coding sequences of <italic>fkbp35</italic>, green fluorescent protein (<italic>gfp</italic>) and destabilization domain (<italic>dd</italic>), followed by the <italic>cam 3’</italic> region. Names and binding sites of the primers used for diagnostic PCRs are indicated. The primer F_wt only binds the unmodified <italic>p230p</italic> sequence. <bold>(B)</bold> Diagnostic PCRs performed on gDNA of NF54/iOE-FKBP35 parasites to confirm correct editing of the locus. PCRs performed on NF54/WT gDNA served as control. Numbers at the bottom indicate the expected band sizes. <bold>(C)</bold> Expression levels of the FKBP35-GFP-DD fusion protein were assessed by Western blot. Parasite cultures were split at 0-6 hpi and treated with Shield or the vehicle control EtOH. Protein lysates were collected 40 h later. α-GAPDH served as loading control. The expected size of the FKBP35-GFP-DD fusion protein is 74.2 kDa.</p></caption>

<p><bold>(A)</bold> Dose-response effect of FK506 on FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi and parasites were exposed to FK506 at 30-36 hpi. Survival rates were measured by flow cytometry in G2. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(B)</bold> Dose-response effect of FK506 on FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. The knockout was induced at 34-40 hpi in G1. Ring stage parasites of G2 were exposed to FK506 for 48 hours and survival rates were measured by flow cytometry in G3. Data points represent survival rates measured in a single experiment performed in technical duplicates. <bold>(C)</bold> Dose-response effect of FK506 on FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites over two IDCs. Parasites at 0-6 hpi were exposed to FK506 and incubated for 96 hours. Parasitaemia was measured by flow cytometry after 48 hours and 96 hours. Medium containing the appropriate drug concentrations was changed after 48 hours. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(D)</bold> Dose-response effect of cyclosporin A on FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites. Cylocsporin A, a known inhibitor of calcineurin when complexed with FKBP in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>), did not alter drug susceptibility between FKBP35<bold><sup>KO</sup></bold> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold> parasites, suggesting that <italic>Pf</italic>FKBP35 is not involved in regulating calcineurin activity.

The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi. Parasites were subsequently exposed to cyclosporin A and 1.5 µM FK506 for 48 h. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(F)</bold> Dose-response effect of D44 on FKBP35<sup>KO</sup> and FKBP35<bold><sup>WT</sup></bold>. The knockout was induced at 0-6 hpi and parasites were exposed to D44 for 48 hours thereafter. Survival rates were determined using flow cytometry. n=3, error bars represent the standard error of the mean. <bold>(G)</bold> Dose-response effect of D44 on NF54 WT, K1 and NF54/iKO-FKBP35 parasites after 72 h exposure.

<p>FKBP35 is the only FK506-binding protein present in the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and has been considered a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506, an immunosuppressant with antiplasmodial activity. This study demonstrates the essentiality of FKBP35 in parasite growth, based on <bold>compelling</bold> genetic evidence. The data also suggest that FK506 may exert its antimalarial activity through FKBP35-independent mechanisms that have not yet been characterised. This <bold>important</bold> study will be of interest to scientists working on the parasite biology and antimalarial drug development.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigate the biological function of the FK506-binding protein FKBP35 in the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Like its homologs in other organisms, PfFKBP35 harbors peptidyl-prolyl isomerase and chaperoning activities, and has been considered a promising drug target due to its high affinity to the macrolide compound FK506. However, PfFKBP35 has not been validated as a drug target using reverse genetics, and the link between PfFKBP35-interacting drugs and their antimalarial activity remains elusive. The manuscript addresses the biological function of PfFKBP35 and the antimalarial activity of FK506.</p>
<p>The authors combine conditional genome editing, proteomics and transcriptomics analysis to investigate the effects of FKBP35 depletion in P. falciparum. The work is very well performed and clearly described. The data provide conclusive evidence that FKBP35 is essential for P. falciparum blood stage growth. Conditional knockout of PfFKBP35 leads to a delayed death-like phenotype, associated with defects in ribosome maturation as detected by quantitative proteomics and stalling of protein synthesis in the parasite. The authors clearly demonstrate that FKBP35 is essential for parasite growth and that ribosome biogenesis is disrupted, but further insights into the pathway itself would be more convincing that this is a direct consequence rather than a secondary feature of parasite death.</p>
<p>The knockdown of PfFKBP35 has no phenotypic consequence, showing that very low amounts of FKBP35 are sufficient for parasite survival and growth. In the absence of quantification of the protein during the course of the experiments, it remains unclear whether the delayed death-like phenotype in the knockout is due to the delayed depletion of the protein or to a delayed consequence of early protein depletion. This limitation also impacts the interpretation of the drug assays.</p>
<p>The authors investigate the activity of FK506 on P. falciparum, and conclude that FK506 exerts its antimalarial effects independently of FKBP35, based on the observation that FK506 has the same activity on FKBP35 wild type and knock-out parasites, indicating that FK506 activity is independent of FKBP35 levels. Using cellular thermal shift assays, the authors confirm the interaction between FK506 and FKBP35, and further identify candidate proteins bound by the compound, albeit at lower affinity. Further work is needed to validate whether these putative targets contribute to the FKBP35-independent antimalarial activity of FK506.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<p>We thank the Reviewers and Editors for the evaluation of our revised manuscript.</p>
<p>We especially value the careful assessment of Reviewer 1; at the same time, we clearly disagree with the reviewer’s statement that the revised manuscript “is essentially unchanged”. As appreciated by the other Reviewers, we performed a key experiment (in our opinion the only conclusive experiment) to further solidify that FK506-treatment kills parasites in a FK506-independent manner. Of note, however, Reviewer 1 made us aware of an error in the legend of Figure 4F, which likely contributed to the confusion regarding the antiplasmodial effect of FK506: Unfortunately, we missed updating this legend to appropriately imbed the new experiment. We therefore incorrectly stated that parasites were exposed to FK506 for 48 hours after FK506 treatment at 4-10 hpi and 36-42 hpi in G1. In contrast to the experiments described in the initial submission, parasite survival was not measured 48 h later, but in G2 ring stage parasites, i.e. at a time point during which parasitemia is not affected by the knockout of PfFKBP35. We have now corrected this. As pointed out correctly by Reviewer 1, it would otherwise not be possible to disentangle the effects of the gene knockout and the drug. The setup we now present in Figure 4F, however, is clearly able to do so.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inaccuracy and hope this resolves the ambiguities regarding the FKBP35-independent antimalarial effect of FK506. In line with the comments of Reviewers 2 and 3, we believe that our findings on FK506 activity are of particular importance for the malaria research community. We therefore hope that the final eLife assessment will reflect this.</p>
