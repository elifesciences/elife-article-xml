<title>Abstract</title><p>Critical Gram-negative pathogens, like <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, have become resistant to most antibiotics. Complex resistance profiles together with synergistic interactions between these organisms increase the likelihood of treatment failure in distinct infection settings, for example in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Here, we discover that cell envelope protein homeostasis pathways underpin both antibiotic resistance and cross-protection in CF-associated bacteria. We find that inhibition of oxidative protein folding inactivates multiple species-specific resistance proteins. Using this strategy, we sensitize multi-drug resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to β-lactam antibiotics and demonstrate promise of new treatment avenues for the recalcitrant pathogen <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic>. The same approach also inhibits cross-protection between resistant <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> and susceptible <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, allowing eradication of both commonly co-occurring CF-associated organisms. Our results provide the basis for the development of next-generation strategies that target antibiotic resistance, while also impairing specific interbacterial interactions that enhance the severity of polymicrobial infections.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most significant threats to health systems worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. Since the end of the “golden age” of antibiotic discovery in the 1970’s, very few new antimicrobial agents have entered the clinic, and most of those that have gained approval are derivatives of existing antibiotic classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Meanwhile, resistance to useful antibiotics is continuously rising, resulting in more than 1.3 million deaths annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. In addition to the undeniable surge of resistance, it is becoming apparent that intra- and inter-species interactions also play a role in AMR and its evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], posing additional challenges during antibiotic treatment. This necessitates not only the development of novel antimicrobials and strategies that will expand the lifespan of existing antibiotics, but also the implementation of approaches that will address the polymicrobial nature of most infections.</p>
<p>Antibiotic resistance is most commonly evaluated by testing bacterial strains in monoculture. Nonetheless, the majority of clinical infections contain multiple species whose coexistence in complex pathobionts often limits our treatment options. This is of particular importance for recalcitrant infections such as the polymicrobial communities found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CF lung infections have become a paradigm for chronic infectious diseases that result in poor quality of life and early patient mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Such infections are dominated by highly resistant opportunistic pathogens, including, but not limited to, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, species and strains belonging to the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> complex, and <italic>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Most of these organisms carry an array of resistance mechanisms, like efflux pumps, atypical lipopolysaccharide structures, and β-lactamase enzymes. Their co-occurrence in the CF lung leads to treatment challenges since common clinical care options for one pathogen are not necessarily compatible with the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of other species that are present. For example, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is the most prevalent organism in CF lung infections and its treatment, especially during pulmonary exacerbation episodes, relies heavily on β-lactam compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. Pulmonary exacerbations and severe disease states are also associated with the presence of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], a globally distributed opportunistic pathogen that causes serious nosocomial respiratory infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> is intrinsically resistant to almost all antibiotics, including β-lactams like penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems, as well as macrolides, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, tetracyclines and colistin. As a result, the standard treatment option, i.e., broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic therapy, constitutes a severe risk for CF patients carrying both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], creating an urgent need for antimicrobial approaches that will be effective in eliminating both pathogens.</p>
<p>The lack of suitably broad antibiotic regimes able to simultaneously eradicate all pathogens present in specific infection settings is not the only challenge when treating polymicrobial communities. Bacterial interactions can add to this problem by adversely affecting antibiotic drug sensitivity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. In particular, some antibiotic resistance proteins, like β-lactamases, which decrease the quantities of active drug present, function akin to common goods, since their benefits are not limited to the pathogen that produces them but can be shared with the rest of the bacterial community. This means that their activity enables pathogen cross-resistance when multiple species are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. For example, in the CF lung, highly drug-resistant <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains actively protect susceptible <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from β-lactam antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], and ultimately facilitate the evolution of β-lactam resistance in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. The basis of such interactions could be exploited during the design of novel therapeutic strategies, since targeting appropriate resistance enzymes will not only render their producers susceptible to existing drugs but should also impair their capacity to protect co-occurring antibiotic-susceptible strains.</p>
<p>Protein homeostasis in the Gram-negative cell envelope, and in particular the formation of disulfide bonds by the thiol oxidase DsbA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>], is essential for the function of many resistance proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Oxidative protein folding occurs post-translationally, after translocation of the nascent polypeptide to the periplasm through the general secretion (Sec) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. There, disulfide bond formation assists the assembly of 40% of the cell-envelope proteome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], promotes the biogenesis of virulence factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>], controls the awakening of bacterial persister cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>], and underpins the function of resistance determinants, including enzymes for which we do not currently have inhibitor compounds, such as metallo-β-lactamases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Here, we target proteostasis through inhibition of disulfide bond formation, to combat highly resistant polymicrobial infections. Using this approach, we incapacitate species-specific resistance proteins in CF-associated bacteria and simultaneously abrogate protective effects between pathogens that coexist in these infections. Our results demonstrate that such strategies generate compatible treatment options for recalcitrant CF pathogens and, at the same time, eradicate interspecific interactions, which increase the likelihood of treatment failure in complex infection settings.</p>

<title>Β-lactamase activity</title>
<p>To investigate the potential of targeting disulfide bond formation as a strategy to overcome resistance mechanisms in challenging pathogens, we chose to primarily explore β-lactamases that are produced by bacteria intimately associated with CF lung infections. DsbA dependence has been previously shown for a few such enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], like the chromosomally-encoded class B3 metallo-β-lactamase L1-1 from <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (Table S1), which contributes significantly to AMR in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], as well as β-lactamases from the GES and OXA families, which are broadly disseminated, but commonly found in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Here, we selected six clinically important β-lactamases from different Ambler classes (classes A, B and D) that are exclusively encoded either by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or by the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> complex. The <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> enzymes (BEL-1, CARB-2, AIM-1, and OXA-50) are all phylogenetically distinct, while the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> β-lactamases (BPS-1m and BPS-6) belong to the same phylogenetic class (File S1). Between them, the selected enzymes are diverse; they have different numbers of cysteines, display varied hydrolytic activities, and while some are resident in the chromosomes of their host bacteria or show classical inhibitor susceptibility, others are associated with mobile genetic elements or cannot be inhibited (Table S1).</p>
<p>We expressed all six β-lactamases in the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K-12 strain MC1000 and its isogenic <italic>dsbA</italic> deletion mutant, and recorded β-lactam minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for each enzyme in both strain backgrounds. We also performed a series of control experiments aiming to assess whether any obtained effect was due to the activity of DsbA rather than a result of a general inability of the <italic>dsbA</italic> mutant to resist antibiotic stress. We have previously shown that deletion of <italic>dsbA</italic> does not affect the aerobic growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1000, or the permeability of its outer and inner membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, here we observed no changes in MIC values for the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin, which is not degraded by β-lactamases, or between the parental <italic>E. coli</italic> strain and its <italic>dsbA</italic> mutant harboring only the empty vector (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and File S2A). In addition, <italic>E. coli</italic> strains expressing either of two disulfide-free enzymes, the class A β-lactamases L2-1 and LUT-1 from <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas luteola</italic>, respectively, did not exhibit decreased MICs in the absence of <italic>dsbA</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and File S2A). These proteins were selected because they both contain two or more cysteine residues, but lack disulfide bonds due to the fact that they are transported to the periplasm, pre-folded, by the Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway, rather than by the Sec system; in the case of L2-1, Tat-dependent transport has been experimentally confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], whilst LUT-1 contains a predicted Tat signal sequence (SignalP 5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>] likelihood scores: Sec/SPI = 0.0572, Tat/SPI = 0.9312, Sec/SPII (lipoprotein) = 0.0087, other = 0.0029). In contrast to our control experiments, expression of all test enzymes in the <italic>dsbA</italic> mutant background resulted in markedly reduced (&gt;2-fold) MICs for at least one β-lactam antibiotic (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and File S2A), compared to the MICs recorded in the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strain, indicating that the presence of DsbA is important for the function of these resistance proteins. The specific interaction between DsbA and our selected test enzymes was further supported by the fact that complementation of <italic>dsbA</italic> restores MICs to wild-type values for the latest generation β-lactam that each β-lactamase can hydrolyze (Fig. S1).</p>

<p>β-lactam MIC values for <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1000 expressing diverse disulfide-bond-containing β-lactamases (Ambler classes A, B and D) are substantially reduced in the absence of DsbA (MIC fold changes: &gt;2, fold change of 2 is indicated by the black dotted lines). No changes in MIC values are observed for the aminoglycoside antibiotic gentamicin (white bars) confirming that absence of DsbA does not compromise the general ability of this strain to resist antibiotic stress. No changes in MIC values are observed for strains harboring the empty vector control (pDM1) or those expressing the class A β-lactamases L2-1 and LUT-1, which contain two or more cysteines (Table S1), but no disulfide bonds (top row). Graphs show MIC fold changes for β-lactamase-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> MC1000 and its <italic>dsbA</italic> mutant from three biological experiments each conducted as a single technical repeat; the MIC values used to generate this figure are presented in File S2A (rows 2-7 and 9-20).</p></caption>

<p>Taken together, our data show that DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation is important for the function of all tested, species-specific β-lactamases. Of these, the most affected enzymes (largest MIC value decreases; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) are the class A extended-spectrum-β-lactamases (ESBLs) from <italic>Burkholderia</italic> (BPS-1m and BPS-6) and the class B3 metallo-β-lactamase AIM-1, which, like all other class B enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], is resistant to inhibition by classical β-lactamase inhibitor compounds (Table S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>].</p>

<sec id="s2a2">
<title>Β-lactamase abundance and folding</title>
<p>To gain insight into how impairment of disulfide bond formation impacts the production or activity of the tested enzymes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we first performed immunoblotting for all phylogenetically distinct β-lactamases (AIM-1, BEL-1, OXA-50, CARB-2, and BPS-1m) to assess their protein levels in the presence and absence of <italic>dsbA</italic>. For four of the five tested β-lactamases (AIM-1, BEL-1, OXA-50, and CARB-2) deletion of <italic>dsbA</italic> resulted in drastically reduced protein levels compared to the levels of the control enzyme L2-1, which remained unaffected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). This shows that without their disulfide bonds, these proteins are unstable and are ultimately degraded by other cell envelope proteostasis components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. This was further corroborated by the fact that lysates from <italic>dsbA</italic> mutants expressing these four enzymes showed significantly reduced hydrolytic activity towards the chromogenic β-lactamase substrate nitrocefin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). In the case of BPS-1m, enzyme levels were unchanged in the absence of <italic>dsbA</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). However, without its disulfide bond, this protein was significantly less able to hydrolyze nitrocefin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), suggesting a folding defect that results in loss of function. The latter is consistent with the reduced MICs conferred by BPS-1m (and its sister enzyme BPS-6) in the absence of <italic>dsbA</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The data presented so far (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) demonstrate that oxidative protein folding is essential for the biogenesis and activity of an expanded set of clinically important β-lactamases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), including enzymes that currently lack inhibitor options.</p>

An exception to this is the class A enzyme BPS-1m for which no decrease in abundance is observed in the <italic>dsbA</italic> mutant (compare lanes 11 and 12).

<caption><title>The biogenesis of numerous cysteine-containing β-lactamase enzymes is dependent on disulfide bond formation.</title>
<p>Cysteine-containing β-lactamase enzymes, which are translocated to the periplasm through the Sec system, rely on DsbA-mediated disulfide bond formation for their stability and folding. We have previously shown that disulfide bond formation is essential for the activity of clinically important broad-spectrum enzymes, usually carried on plasmids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Data presented here (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) demonstrate that oxidative protein folding is also critical for several species-specific β-lactamases from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia spp</italic>. After translocation to the periplasm and DsbA-assisted folding, these enzymes are active and can hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics, rendering bacteria resistant. However, in the absence of their disulfide bonds, DsbA-dependent β-lactamases either degrade or misfold, and thus can no longer confer resistance to β-lactam compounds. After each round of oxidative protein folding, DsbA is regenerated by the quinone (Q)-containing protein DsbB, which in turn transfers the reducing equivalents to the respiratory chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>].</p></caption>

<title>Sensitization of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa clinical isolates</title>
<p>The efficacy of commonly used treatment options against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in CF lung infections, namely piperacillin-tazobactam and cephalosporin-avibactam combinations, as well as more advanced drugs like aztreonam or carbapenems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], is increasingly threatened by an array of β-lactamases, encompassing both broadly disseminated enzymes and species-specific ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. To determine whether the effects on β-lactam MICs observed in our inducible system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]) can be reproduced in the presence of other resistance determinants in a natural context with endogenous enzyme expression levels, we deleted the principal <italic>dsbA</italic> gene, <italic>dsbA1</italic> (pathogenic bacteria often encode multiple DsbA analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]), in several multidrug-resistant (MDR) <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical strains (Table S2).</p>
<p>We first tested two clinical isolates (strains G4R7 and G6R7; Table S2) expressing the class B3 metallo-β-lactamase AIM-1, for which we recorded reduced activity in an <italic>E. coli dsbA</italic> background (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This enzyme confers high-level resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam and the third generation cephalosporin ceftazidime, both anti-pseudomonal β-lactams that are used in the treatment of critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Notably, while specific to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome, <italic>aim-1</italic> is flanked by two ISCR15 elements suggesting that it remains mobilizable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (Table S1). MICs for piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftazidime were determined for both AIM-1-positive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates and their <italic>dsbA1</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4AB</xref>). Deletion of <italic>dsbA1</italic> from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> G4R7 resulted in a substantial decrease in its piperacillin-tazobactam MIC value by 192 µg/mL and sensitization to ceftazidime (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), while the <italic>dsbA1</italic> mutant of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> G6R7 became susceptible to both antibiotic treatments (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). To further test our approach in an infection context, we performed <italic>in vivo</italic> survival assays using the wax moth model <italic>Galleria mellonella</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>), an informative non-vertebrate system for the study of new antimicrobial approaches against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Larvae were infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> G6R7 or its <italic>dsbA1</italic> mutant, and infections were treated once with piperacillin at a final concentration below the EUCAST breakpoint, as appropriate. No larvae survived beyond 20 hours post infection when infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> G6R7 or its <italic>dsbA1</italic> mutant without antibiotic treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>; blue and light blue survival curves). Despite this clinical strain being resistant to piperacillin <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), treatment with piperacillin <italic>in vivo</italic> increases larval survival (52.5% survival at 28 hours post infection) compared to the untreated conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>; blue and light blue survival curves) possibly due to the <italic>in vivo</italic> ceftazidime MIC values being discrepant to the value recorded <italic>in vitro</italic>.

<p>Next, we tested two <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates (strains CDC #769 and CDC #773; Table S2) each expressing two class A enzymes from the GES family (GES-19/GES-26 or GES-19/GES-20), for which we have previously demonstrated DsbA dependence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The GES family comprises 57 distinct ESBLs (File S1), which are globally disseminated and commonly found in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as well as other critical Gram-negative pathogens (for example <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Deletion of <italic>dsbA1</italic> in these clinical strains resulted in sensitization to piperacillin-tazobactam and aztreonam for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #769 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>), and to representative compounds of all classes of anti-pseudomonal β-lactam drugs (piperacillin-tazobactam, aztreonam, and ceftazidime) for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #773 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #773 and its <italic>dsbA1</italic> mutant were further tested in a <italic>G. mellonella</italic> infection model using ceftazidime treatment (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>). In this case, no larvae survived 24 hours post infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>; blue, light blue and red survival curves), except for insects infected with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #773 <italic>dsbA1</italic> and treated with ceftazidime at a final concentration below the EUCAST breakpoint, whereby 96.7% survival was recorded (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F</xref>; pink survival curves).</p>
<p>Our data on the sensitization of AIM- and GES-expressing <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> clinical isolates to most commonly used anti-pseudomonal β-lactam drugs, combined with previous results on strains producing β-lactamases from the OXA family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], show that our approach holds promise towards inactivating numerous clinically important <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-specific enzymes. These include resistance determinants that cannot be currently targeted by classical β-lactamase inhibitor compounds (for example enzymes from the OXA and AIM families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]) and, therefore, limit our treatment options.</p>

<title>New treatment options for extremely-drug-resistant S. maltophilia clinical isolates</title>
<p>We have previously used our inducible <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 experimental system to demonstrate that the function of the inhibitor-resistant class B3 metallo-β-lactamase L1-1 from <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> is dependent on DsbA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. By contrast, the second β-lactamase encoded on the chromosome of this species, L2-1, which we use as a negative control in this study (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), is not DsbA dependent. The hydrolytic spectra of these β-lactamases are exquisitely complementary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], making this bacterium entirely resistant to β-lactam compounds, which are commonly used for CF patients. Considering the contribution of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains to treatment failure in CF lung infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and the fact that L1 enzymes are the sole drivers of ceftazidime resistance, we wanted to investigate the DsbA dependency of L1-1 in its natural context to determine whether inhibition of oxidative protein folding potentiates the activity of complex cephalosporins.</p>
<p>We compromised disulfide bond formation in two clinical isolates of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (strains AMM and GUE; Table S2), by deleting the main <italic>dsbA</italic> gene cluster (directly adjacent <italic>dsbA</italic> and <italic>dsbL</italic> genes, with DsbL being a specialized DsbA analogue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]) and recorded a drastic decrease of ceftazidime MIC values for both mutant strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B</xref>). Since <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> cannot be treated with ceftazidime, there is no EUCAST breakpoint available for this organism. That said, for both tested <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic> mutant strains, the recorded ceftazidime MIC values were lower than the ceftazidime EUCAST breakpoint for the related major pathogen <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to being resistant to β-lactams, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> is usually intrinsically resistant to colistin, which precludes the use of yet another broad class of antibiotics. Bioinformatic analysis on 106 complete <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> genomes revealed that most strains of this organism carry two chromosomally-encoded MCR analogues that cluster with clinical MCR-5 and MCR-8 proteins (File S3). We have previously found the activity of all clinical MCR enzymes to be dependent on the presence of DsbA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], thus we compared the colistin MIC value of the <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic> strain to that of its parent. We found that impairment of disulfide bond formation in this strain resulted in a decrease of its colistin MIC value from 32 μg/mL to 0.5 μg/mL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Once more, there is no colistin EUCAST breakpoint available for <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>, but a comparison with the colistin breakpoint for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (4 μg/mL) demonstrates the magnitude of the effects that we observe.</p>
<p>The DSB proteins have been shown to play a central role in bacterial virulence, and in this context, they have been proposed as promising targets against bacterial pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. For this reason, several laboratory compounds against both DsbA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>] and its partner protein DsbB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], which maintains DsbA in a catalytically active state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), have been developed. We have successfully used one of these inhibitors, 4,5-dichloro-2-(2-chlorobenzyl)pyridazin-3-one, termed “compound 12” in (47), to achieve sensitization of clinical strains of Enterobacteria to β-lactam and colistin antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Here, we used a derivative compound, 4,5-dibromo-2-(2-chlorobenzyl)pyridazin-3(2H)-one, termed “compound 36” in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>], which is an improved analog of compound 12 and has been shown to target several DsbB proteins from Gram-negative pathogens that share between 20-80% in protein identity. Compound 36 was previously shown to inhibit disulfide bond formation in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Since <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> DsbB proteins share ∼28% protein sequence identity with analogues from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, we reasoned that this pathogen would be a good candidate for DSB system inhibition. Exposure of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM to the DSB inhibitor lowered its ceftazidime MIC value by 16 μg/mL and decreased its colistin MIC value from 32 μg/mL to 0.5 μg/mL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>); the latter drop is commensurate with the results we obtained with the <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Considering that this inhibitor has not been specifically optimized for <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains, the recorded drops in MIC values (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>) are encouraging and suggest that the DSB system proteins are tractable targets against species-specific resistance determinants in this pathogen.</p>
<p>Currently, the best clinical strategy against <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> is to reduce the likelihood of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] and, thus, novel treatment strategies against this organism are desperately needed. Overall, our results on targeting oxidative protein folding in this organism show promise for the generation of therapeutic avenues that are compatible with mainstream antibiotics (β-lactams and polymyxins), which are commonly used for the treatment of other co-occurring organisms in CF lung infections, like <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>

<title>Inhibition of cross-resistance in S. maltophilia - P. aeruginosa mixed communities</title>
<p>The antibiotic resistance mechanisms of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> impact the antibiotic tolerance profiles of other organisms that are found in the same infection environment. <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> hydrolyzes all β-lactam drugs through the action of its L1 and L2 β-lactamases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and, in doing so, protects other pathogens that are in principle, susceptible to treatment, such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. This protection, in turn, allows active growth of otherwise treatable <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the presence of complex β-lactams, like imipenem, and increases the rate of resistance evolution of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> against these antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>We wanted to investigate whether our approach would be useful in abrogating interspecies interactions that are relevant to CF infections. We posited that ceftazidime resistance in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> is largely driven by L1-1, an enzyme that we can incapacitate by targeting disulfide bond formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B,D</xref>). As such, impairment of oxidative protein folding in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> should allow treatment of this organism with ceftazidime, and at the same time eliminate any protective effects that benefit susceptible strains of co-occurring organisms. With ceftazidime being a standard anti-pseudomonal drug, and in view of the interactions reported between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>], we chose to test this hypothesis using <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM and a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain that is sensitive to β-lactam antibiotics, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14. We followed established co-culture protocols for these organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and monitored the survival and growth of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> under ceftazidime pressure in monoculture, or in the presence of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains.</p>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 monoculture cannot grow in the presence of more than 4 μg/mL of ceftazidime (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>; white bars). However, the same strain can actively grow in concentrations of ceftazidime up to 512 μg/mL in the presence of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>; dark pink bars), showing that the protective effects previously observed with imipenem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] are applicable to other clinically relevant β-lactam antibiotics. Cross-resistance effects are most striking at concentrations of ceftazidime above 64 μg/ml; for amounts between 16 and 64 μg/ml, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> survives in the presence of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>, but does not actively grow. This is in agreement with previous observations showing that the expression of L1-1 is highly induced by the presence of complex β-lactams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. In this case, increased expression of L1-1 in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> grown in concentrations of ceftazidime equal or higher than 128 μg/ml promotes ceftazidime hydrolysis and decrease of the active antibiotic concentration, in turn, shielding the susceptible <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain. By contrast, protective effects are almost entirely absent when <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 is co-cultured with <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic>, which cannot hydrolyze ceftazidime efficiently because L1-1 activity is impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B,D</xref>). In fact, in these conditions <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 only survives in concentrations of ceftazidime up to 8 μg/mL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>; light pink bars), 64-fold lower than what it can endure the presence of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>; dark pink bars).</p>
<p>The data presented here show that targeting protein homeostasis pathways in specific recalcitrant pathogens has the potential to not only alter their own antibiotic resistance profiles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A,B,C</xref>), but also to influence their interactions with other bacteria (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).

Here, we focus on the benefits of such an approach against pathogens encountered in challenging infection settings by studying organisms found in the CF lung. In particular, we show that incapacitation of oxidative protein folding compromises the function of diverse β-lactamases that are specific to CF-associated bacteria, like <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Burkholderia</italic> complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Furthermore, we find that the effects we observe at the enzyme level are applicable to multiple MDR <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and extremely-drug-resistant <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> clinical strains, both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A,B,D,E</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5A,B</xref>) and in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model of infection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C,F</xref>). Our findings, so far, concern β-lactamases encoded by Enterobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] or CF-associated organisms. Nonetheless, many other environmental bacteria are opportunistic human pathogens and encode β-lactamase genes that make them highly resistant to antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. The ubiquitous nature of disulfide bond formation systems across Gram-negative species guarantees that the same approach can be expanded. To provide some proof on this front, we investigated two additional class B3 metallo-β-lactamases, POM-1 produced by <italic>Pseudomonas otitidis</italic> and SMB-1 encoded on the chromosome of <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic> (Table S1). We tested these enzymes in our inducible <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 system and found that their activities are indeed DsbA dependent (Fig. S3A and S4), with SMB-1 degrading in the absence of DsbA and POM-1 suffering a folding defect (Fig. S3B,C). Since 57% of β-lactamase phylogenetic families that are found in pathogens and organisms capable of causing opportunistic infections contain members with two or more cysteines (File S1), we expect that thousands of enzymes rely on DsbA for their stability and function. Focusing solely on the β-lactamase families that we have investigated here and previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] (17 phylogenetic families), we estimate that upwards of 575 discrete proteins are DsbA dependent. This encompasses enzymes specific to pathogens with very limited treatment options, for example the <italic>Burkholderia</italic> complex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B,D</xref>), as well as 145 β-lactamases that cannot be inhibited by classical adjuvant approaches, like class B enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>] from the AIM, L1, POM, and SMB families (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A,B,C</xref> and S3).</p>
<p>Of the organisms studied in this work, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> deserves further discussion because of its unique intrinsic resistance profile. The therapeutic options against this pathogen are currently limited to one antibiotic-adjuvant combination, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, that is not always effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>]. As a result, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> infections have high case fatality rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. We find that targeting disulfide bond formation in this species allows its treatment with complex cephalosporins, like ceftazidime, (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A,B,D</xref>) and, at the same time, leads to colistin potentiation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C,D</xref>). This extends the usability of two invaluable broad-acting antibiotic classes against this challenging organism. Moreover, in CF, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> is more abundant during pulmonary exacerbation episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], whereby the use of β-lactams like ceftazidime or carbapenems is common practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. Being fully resistant to such antibiotics, its presence causes many problems during treatment, including issues that arise from protective interactions between the <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> and other, usually susceptible, bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Use of β-lactam drugs puts CF patients at severe risk of <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> dominance in the lungs, which practically leaves them without any effective treatment routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. At the same time, <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> has been shown to foster protection of sensitive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>], which can, in turn, promote evolution of resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], impeding effective antibiotic treatment. Here, we demonstrate that by compromising L1-1 through impairing protein homeostasis in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> (4A,B,D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], in addition to generating new treatment options (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-D</xref>), we abolish the capacity of this organism to protect other species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Since similar bacterial interactions are prevalent in most resistant infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], it can be expected that our approach will yield analogous results for other coexisting pathogens in the CF lung, for example <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] or <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>], which also produce DsbA-dependent β-lactamases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>
<p>More generally, our findings serve as proof of principle of the added benefits of strategies that aim to incapacitate resistance determinants like β-lactamases. These proteins threaten the most widely prescribed class of antibiotics worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>], and, at the same time, can promote cross-resistance between pathogens found in polymicrobial infections. It is therefore important to continue developing β-lactamase inhibitors, which, so far, have been one of the biggest successes in the battle against AMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>]. That said, the deployment of broad-acting small molecules with the capacity to bind and effectively inhibit thousands of clinically important β-lactamases (7233 distinct documented enzymes (File S1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]) is challenging and, eventually, leads to the emergence of β-lactamase variants that are resistant to combination therapy. As such, development of additional alternative strategies that can broadly incapacitate these resistance proteins, ideally without the need to bind to their active sites, is critical. This has been shown to be possible through metal chelation for class B metallo-β-lactamases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. Adding to this, our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] and the results presented here lay the groundwork for exploiting accessible cell envelope proteostasis processes to generate new resistance breakers. Inhibiting such systems has untapped potential for the design of broad-acting next-generation therapeutics, which simultaneously compromise multiple resistance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>], and also for the development of species-or infection-specific approaches that are well suited for the treatment of complex polymicrobial communities (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Construction of plasmids and bacterial strains</title>
<p>Bacterial strains, plasmids and oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in Tables S2, S3 and S4, respectively. DNA manipulations were conducted using standard methods. KOD Hot Start DNA polymerase (Merck) was used for all PCR reactions according to the manufacturer’s instructions, oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. All constructs were DNA sequenced and confirmed to be correct before use.</p>
<p>Genes for β-lactamase enzymes were amplified from genomic DNA extracted from clinical isolates (Table S5) with the exception of <italic>bps-1, bps-6, carb-2, ftu-1</italic> and <italic>smb-1</italic>, which were synthesized by GeneArt Gene Synthesis (ThermoFisher Scientific). β-lactamase genes were cloned into the IPTG-inducible plasmid pDM1 using primers P1-P16.

<p><italic>P. aeruginosa dsbA1</italic> mutants and <italic>S. maltophilia dsbA dsbL</italic> mutants were constructed by allelic exchange, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Briefly, the <italic>dsbA1</italic> gene area of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains (including the <italic>dsbA1</italic> gene and 600 bp on either side of this gene) was amplified (primers P24/P25) and the obtained DNA was sequenced to allow for accurate primer design for the ensuing cloning step. The pKNG101-<italic>dsbA1</italic> plasmid was then used for deletion of the <italic>dsbA1</italic> gene in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> G4R7 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> G4R7, as before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. For the deletion of <italic>dsbA1</italic> in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #769 and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #773, 500-bp DNA fragments upstream and downstream of the <italic>dsbA1</italic> gene were amplified using <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #769 or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CDC #773 genomic DNA (primers P28/P29 (upstream) and P30/P31 (downstream)). Fragments containing both regions were then obtained by overlapping PCR (primers P28/P31) and inserted into the XbaI/BamHI sites of pKNG102, resulting in plasmids pKNG102-<italic>dsbA1</italic>-769 and pKNG102-<italic>dsbA1</italic>-773. For <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains the <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic> gene area (including the <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic> genes and 1000 bp on either side of these genes) was amplified (primers P26/P27) and the obtained DNA was sequenced to allow for accurate primer design for the ensuing cloning step. Subsequently, 700-bp DNA fragments upstream and downstream of the <italic>dsbA dsbL</italic> genes were amplified using <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> AMM or <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> GUE genomic DNA (primers P32/P33 (upstream) and P34/P35 (downstream)). Fragments containing both of these regions were then obtained by overlapping PCR (primers P32/35) and inserted into the XbaI/BamHI sites of pKNG101, resulting in plasmids pKNG101-<italic>dsbA dsbL</italic>-AMM and pKNG101-<italic>dsbA dsbL</italic>-GUE. The suicide vector pKNG101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>] and its derivative pKNG102, are not replicative in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>S. maltophilia</italic>; both vectors are maintained in <italic>E. coli</italic> CC118λpir and mobilized into <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains by triparental and biparental conjugation, respectively.</p>
<p><italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14 was labelled with a gentamicin resistance marker using mini Tn<italic>7</italic> delivery transposon vector adapted from Zobel et al.

<title>Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays</title>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, antibiotic MIC assays were carried out in accordance with the EUCAST recommendations using ETEST strips (BioMérieux). Briefly, overnight cultures of each strain to be tested were standardized to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.063 in 0.85% NaCl (equivalent to McFarland standard 0.5) and distributed evenly across the surface of MH agar plates. E-test strips were placed on the surface of the plates, evenly spaced, and the plates were incubated for 18-24 hours at 37 °C. MICs were read according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MICs were also determined using the Broth Microdilution (BMD) method for specific β-lactams, as required, and for colistin sulphate (Acros Organics). Briefly, a series of antibiotic concentrations was prepared by two-fold serial dilution in MH broth in a clear-bottomed 96-well microtiter plate (Corning). The strain to be tested was added to the wells at approximately 5 x 10<sup>4</sup> colony forming units (CFU) per well and plates were incubated for 18-24 hours at 37 °C. The MIC was defined as the lowest antibiotic concentration with no visible bacterial growth in the wells. When used for MIC assays, tazobactam was included at a fixed concentration of 4 μg/mL, in accordance with the EUCAST guidelines. All <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> MICs were performed in synthetic CF sputum medium (SCF) as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>], using E-test strips (for β-lactam antibiotics) or the BMD method (for colistin). For <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> GUE, imipenem at a final concentration of 5 µg/mL was added to the overnight cultures to induce β-lactamase production.</p>
<p>The covalent DsbB inhibitor 4,5-dibromo-2-(2-chlorobenzyl)pyridazin-3(2H)-one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] was used to chemically impair the function of the DSB system in <italic>S. maltophilia</italic> strains. Inactivation of DsbB results in abrogation of DsbA function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>] only in media free of small-molecule oxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. Therefore, MIC assays involving chemical inhibition of the DSB system were performed using SCF media prepared as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>], except that L-cysteine was omitted. Either DMSO (vehicle control) or the covalent DsbB inhibitor 4,5-dibromo-2-(2-chlorobenzyl)pyridazin-3(2H)-one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] (Bioduro-Sundia; <sup>1</sup>H-NMR and LCMS spectra are provided in File S4), at a final concentration of 50 μM, were added to the cysteine-free SCF medium, as required.</p>

The following primary antibodies were used in this study: Strep-Tactin-HRP conjugate (Iba Lifesciences) (dilution 1:3,000 in 3 w/v % BSA/TBS-T), Strep-Tactin-AP conjugate (Iba Lifesciences) (dilution 1:3,000 in 3 w/v % BSA/TBS-T), and mouse anti-DnaK 8E2/2 antibody (Enzo Life Sciences) (dilution 1:10,000 in 5% w/v skimmed milk/TBS-T). The following secondary antibodies were used in this study: goat anti-mouse IgG-AP conjugate (Sigma Aldrich) (dilution 1:6,000 in 5% w/v skimmed milk/TBS-T) and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate (Sigma Aldrich) (dilution 1:6,000 in 5% w/v skimmed milk/TBS-T). Membranes were washed three times for 5 minutes with TBS-T prior to development.

<title>Bioinformatics</title>
<p>The following bioinformatics analyses were performed in this study. Short scripts and pipelines were written in Perl (version 5.18.2) and executed on macOS Sierra 10.12.5.</p>
<sec id="s4i1">
<title>β-lactamase enzymes</title>
<p>All available protein sequences of β-lactamases were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bldb.eu">http://www.bldb.eu</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] (30 March 2023). Sequences were clustered using the ucluster software with a 90% identity threshold and the cluster_fast option (USEARCH v.7.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]); the centroid of each cluster was used as a cluster identifier for every sequence. All sequences were searched for the presence of cysteine residues using a Perl script. Proteins with two or more cysteines after the first 30 amino acids of their primary sequence were considered potential substrates of the DSB system for organisms where oxidative protein folding is carried out by DsbA and provided that translocation of the β-lactamase outside the cytoplasm is performed by the Sec system. The first 30 amino acids of each sequence were excluded to avoid considering cysteines that are part of the signal sequence mediating the translocation of these enzymes outside the cytoplasm. The results of the analysis can be found in File S1.</p>

<sec id="s4i2">
<title>Stenotrophomonas MCR-like enzymes</title>
<p>Hidden Markov Models built with validated sequences of MCR-like and EptA-like proteins were used to identify MCR analogues in a total of 106 complete genomes of the <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic> genus, downloaded from the NCBI repository (30 March 2023). The analysis was performed with <italic>hmmsearch</italic> (HMMER v.3.1b2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] and only hits with evalues &lt; 1e-10 were considered. The 146 obtained sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>] and a phylogenetic tree was built from the alignment using FastTree 2.1.7 with the wag substitution matrix and the gamma option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>]. The assignment of each MCR-like protein sequence to a specific phylogenetic group was carried out based on the best fitting <italic>hmmscan</italic> model. The results of the analysis can be found in File S3.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates that disrupting a common protein-folding system restores sensitivity to antibiotics in drug-resistant clinical bacterial pathogens. Although some additional controls would be welcome, the work is overall <bold>convincing</bold> in showing that targeting protein folding can be used to combat multi-drug resistant pathogens, both by potentiating the efficacy of existing drugs and by therapeutic use of small-molecule inhibitors. This study is significant and timely as it furnishes a new strategy that is relevant to microbiologists and clinicians interested in combating antimicrobial resistance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this work the authors provide evidence that impairment of cell envelope protein homeostasis through blocking the machinery for disulfide bond formation restores the efficacy of antibiotics including beta-lactam drugs and colistin against AMR in Gram-negative bacteria.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors employ a thorough approach to showcase the restoration of antibiotic sensitivity through inhibition of the DSB machinery, including the evaluation of various antibiotics on both normal and Dsb-deficient pathogenic bacteria (i.e. Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas). The authors corroborate these findings by employing Dsb inhibitors in addition to delta dsbA strains. The methodology is appropriate and includes measuring MICs as well as validating their observations in vivo using the Galleria model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study would benefit from presenting raw data in some cases, such as MIC values and SDS-PAGE gels, by clarifying the number of independent experiments used, as well as further clarification on statistical significance for some of the data.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work by Kadeřábková et al. demonstrates the importance of a specific protein folding system to effectively folding β-lactamase proteins, which are responsible for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, and shows that inhibition of this system sensitize multidrug-resistant pathogens to β-lactam treatment. In addition, the authors extend these observations to a two-species co-culture model where β-lactamases provided by one pathogen can protect another, sensitive pathogen from β-lactam treatment. In this model, disrupting the protein folding system also disrupted protection of the sensitive pathogen from antibiotic killing. Overall, the data presented provide a solid foundation for subsequent investigations and development of inhibitors for β-lactamases and other resistance determinants. This and similar strategies may have particular application to polymicrobial contexts, but the present state of knowledge regarding the existence and clinical effects of microbial interactions in disease, both specifically regarding S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa as well as generally, is significantly overstated.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use clear and reliable molecular biology strategies to show that β-lactamase proteins from P. aeruginosa and Burkholderia species, expressed in E. coli in the absence of the dsbA protein folding system, are variably less capable of resisting the effects of different β-lactam antibiotics compared to the dsbA-competent parent strain (Figure 1). The appropriate control is included in the supplemental materials to demonstrate that this effect is specifically dependent on dsbA, since complementing the mutant with an intact dsbA gene restores antibiotic resistance (Figure S1). The authors subsequently show that this lack of activity can be explained by significantly reduced protein levels and loss-of-function protein misfolding in the dsbA mutant background (Figure 2). These data support the importance of this protein folding mechanism in the activity of multiple clinically relevant β-lactamases.</p>
<p>Native bacterial species are used for subsequent experiments, and the authors provide important context for their antibiotic choices and concentrations by referencing the breakpoints that guide clinical practice. In Figure 4, the authors show that loss of the DsbA system in P. aeruginosa significantly sensitizes clinical isolates expressing different classes of β-lactamases to clinically relevant antibiotics. The appropriate control showing that the dsbA1 mutation does not result in sensitivity to a non-β-lactam antibiotic is included in Figure S2. The authors further show, using an in vivo model for antibiotic treatment, that treatment of a dsbA1 mutant results in moderate and near-complete survival of the infected organisms. The importance of this system in S. maltophilia is then investigated similarly (Figure 5), showing that a dsbA dsbL mutant is also sensitive to β-lactams and colistin, another antibiotic whose resistance mechanism is dependent on the DsbA protein folding system. Importantly, the authors show that a small-molecule inhibitor that disrupts the DsbA system, rather than genetic mutations, is also capable of sensitizing S. maltophilia to these antibiotics. It should be noted that while the sensitization is less pronounced, this molecule has not been optimized for S. maltophilia and would be expected to increase in efficacy once this is done. Together, the data support that interference with the DsbA system in native hosts can sensitize otherwise resistant pathogens to clinically relevant antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors investigate the effects of co-culturing S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa (Figure 5E). These assays are performed in synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (SCFM), which provides a nutritional context similar to that in CF but without the presence of more complex components such as mucin. The authors show that while P. aeruginosa alone is sensitive to the antibiotic, it can survive moderate concentrations in the presence of S. maltophilia and even grow in higher concentrations where S. maltophilia appears to overproduce its β-lactamases. However, this protection is lost in S. maltophilia without the DsbA protein folding system, showing that the protective effect depends on functional production of β-lactamase. The data support a protective role for DsbA-dependent β-lactamase under these co-culture conditions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While Figure 5E demonstrates a protective effect of DsbA-dependent β-lactamase, the omission of CFU data for S. maltophilia makes it difficult to assess the applicability of the polymicrobial strategy. Since S. maltophilia is pre-cultured prior to the addition of P. aeruginosa and antibiotics, it is unclear whether the protective effect is dependent on high S. maltophilia CFU. It is also unclear what the fate of the S. maltophilia dsbA dsbL mutant is under these conditions. If DsbA-deficient S. maltophilia CFU is not impacted, then this treatment will result in the eradication of only one of the pathogens of interest. If the mutant is lost during treatment, then it is not clear whether the loss of protection is due specifically to the production of non-functional β-lactamase or simply the absence of S. maltophilia.</p>
<p>The alleged clinical relevance and immediate, theoretical application of this approach should be properly contextualized. At multiple junctures, the authors state or suggest that interactions between S. maltophilia and P. aeruginosa are known to occur in disease or have known clinical relevance related to treatment failure and disease states. For instance, the citations provided for S. maltophilia protection of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung environment both describe simplified laboratory experiments rather than clinical or in vivo observations. Similarly, the citations provided for both the role of S. maltophilia in treatment failure and CF disease severity do not support either claim. The role of S. maltophilia in CF is currently unsettled, with more recent work reporting conflicting results that support S. maltophilia as a marker, rather than cause, of severe disease. These citations also do not support the suggestion that S. maltophilia specifically contributes to treatment failure. While it is reasonable to pursue these ideas as a hypothesis or potential concern, there is no evidence provided that these specific interactions occur in vivo or that they have clinical relevance.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the face of emerging antibiotic resistance and slow pace of drug discovery, strategies that can enhance the efficacy of existing clinically used antibiotics are highly sought after. In this manuscript, through genetic manipulation of a model bacterium (Escherichia coli) and clinically isolated and antibiotic resistant strains of concern (Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas), an additional drug target to combat resistance and potentiate existing drugs is put forward. These observations were validated in both pure cultures, mixed bacterial cultures and in worm models. The drug target investigated in this study appears to be broadly relevant to the challenge posed by lactamases enzyme that render lactam antibiotics ineffective in the clinic. The compounds that target this enzyme are being developed already, some of which were tested in this study displaying promising results and potential for further optimization by medicinal chemists.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The work is well designed and well executed and targets an urgent area of research with the unprecedented increase in antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The impact of the work can be strengthened by demonstrating increased efficacy of antibiotics in mice models or wound models for Pseudomonas infections. Worm models are relevant, but still distant from investigations in animal models.</p>
