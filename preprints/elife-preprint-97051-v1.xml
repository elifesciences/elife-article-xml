<title>Abstract</title><p>HER2 overexpression significantly contributes to the aggressive nature and recurrent patterns observed in various solid tumors, notably gastric cancers. Trastuzumab, HER2-targeting monoclonal antibody drug, has shown considerable clinical success, however, readily emerging drug resistance emphasizes the pressing need for improved interventions in HER2-overexpressing cancers. To address this, we proposed targeting the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between ELF3 and MED23 as an alternative therapeutic approach to trastuzumab. In this study, we synthesized a total of 26 compounds consisting of 10 chalcones, 7 pyrazoline acetyl, and 9 pyrazoline propionyl derivatives, and evaluated their biological activity as potential ELF3-MED23 PPI inhibitors. Upon systematic analysis, candidate compound <bold>10</bold> was selected due to its potency in downregulating SEAP activity and its effect on HER2 protein and mRNA levels. Compound <bold>10</bold> effectively disrupted the binding interface between the ELF3 TAD domain and the 391-582 amino acid region of MED23, resulting in successful inhibition of the ELF3-MED23 PPI. This intervention led to a substantial reduction in HER2 levels and its downstream signals in the HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line. Subsequently, compound <bold>10</bold> induced significant apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects, demonstrating superior <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anticancer activity overall. We found that the anticancer activity of compound <bold>10</bold> was not only restricted to trastuzumab-sensitive cases, but was also valid for trastuzumab-refractory clones. This suggests its potential as a viable therapeutic option for trastuzumab-resistant gastric cancers. In summary, compound <bold>10</bold> could be a novel alternative therapeutic strategy for HER2-overexpressing cancers, overcoming the limitations of trastuzumab.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) belongs to the HER family, encompassing EGFR (HER1, erbB1), HER2 (HER2/neu, erbB2), HER3 (erbB3), and HER4 (erbB4). Known as a proto-oncogene, HER2 plays a pivotal role in various cancer-related processes, including cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Its activation occurs through homo– or hetero-dimerization with other members of the HER family, triggering downstream cellular signaling pathways like Ras-Raf-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Distinct from other HER family proteins, HER2 does not necessitate ligand-binding for dimer formation or downstream signal activation. Moreover, the structure of the HER2 extracellular domain adopts an open conformation, making it more prone to undergo homo– or heterodimerization. This predisposition of HER2 as a dimerization partner, coupled with its tendency for overexpression, contributes to uncontrolled cell proliferation and the progression of tumors.</p>
<p>Numerous studies have consistently identified HER2 overexpression across diverse cancer types including breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, bladder, lung, gastric, and gastroesophageal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. The frequency of HER2 overexpression varies: approximately 20% in breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], 5–30% in ovarian cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], 7–8% in colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], 0–82% in pancreatic cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], and 7.3–20.2% in gastric and gastroesophageal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. In these cases, HER2 status serves as an important prognostic marker, correlating positively with tumor size, invasiveness, and lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. The significance of HER2 is evident in the development of separate treatment guidelines tailored specifically for HER2-positive cases in several cancer subtypes such as breast, colorectal, and gastric cancers. This often involves employing trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody drug targeting the extracellular domain of HER2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Trastuzumab has significantly improved the clinical outcomes of numerous patients with HER2-positive cancers, but its therapeutic efficacy is considered limited due to readily developing resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. The emergence of this persistent refractoriness to trastuzumab has highlighted the need for the establishment of better therapeutic approaches that maintain effectiveness regardless of the development of resistance. While HER2 gene amplification is the primary mechanism responsible for HER2 overexpression, high transcription rates of HER2 per gene copy have also been observed to contribute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In breast cancer, it has been reported that radiation or endocrine therapy upregulates HER2 gene transcription in HER2-low or HER2-negative subtypes, leading to treatment resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Rather than targeting already overexpressed HER2 protein, our focus has shifted to reducing HER2 expression at the genetic level. This involves interrupting the interaction between E74-Like Factor 3 (ELF3) and mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 23 (MED23) – a transcription factor (TF) and a coactivator for HER2, respectively. As an essential TF for HER2 gene expression, ELF3 directly binds to the ETS transcriptional response element located in the HER2 promoter and interacts with MED23 to drive HER2 overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Natural and synthetic chalcones have been reported to show a variety of biological efficiency, including anti-proliferative, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or anti-infective activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. Chalcone derivatives have shown potential as lead compounds in the field of novel drug discovery due to their promising biological activities and have also been sourced as precursors of flavonoids in higher plants. Licochalcone derivatives, initially identified in <italic>licorice</italic> root, possess alkyl-substituted forms of the typical chalcone structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], exhibiting various biological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. Pyrazole, an organic heterocyclic compound, is characterized by a 5-membered ring comprising three carbon atoms and two adjacent nitrogen atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Pyrazoline, an unsaturated pyrazole derivative, contains a single endocyclic double bond on the N-2 position, distinguishing it from pyrazole. Numerous synthetic pyrazoline analogues have demonstrated notable anticancer activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>].</p>

<p>In our previous study, pyrazoline analogue YK-1 was developed as an effective inhibitor targeting the interaction between ELF3 and MED23. YK-1 exhibited remarkable efficacy, demonstrating significant <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anticancer activity specifically against HER2-overexpressing breast and gastric cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. As part of our ongoing efforts to discover a potent inhibitor of the ELF3-MED23 PPI for potential anticancer therapies, we designed and synthesized 26 novel compounds, including chalcones, pyrazoline acetyl, and pyrazoline propionyl analogs <bold>(<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. This exploration led us to elicit a highly potent compound <bold>10</bold> that exhibited excellent <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> anticancer activity against HER2-positive gastric cancer cells.</p>

<label>2.1.</label><title>Identification of compound 10 as potent ELF3-MED23 PPI inhibitor</title>
<p>We designed and synthesized 26 novel compounds, including chalcones, pyrazoline acetyl, and pyrazoline propionyl analogs based on the YK1 structure <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>)</bold>. To screen out compounds exhibiting superior inhibitory activity against ELF3-MED23 PPI, we first performed secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] using 26 synthesized compounds. As in our previous studies, gefitinib and CI-1033 (Canertinib) were used as positive controls for the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Cell viability tests were conducted in parallel with the SEAP assay under the same experimental condition, in order to confirm that the decrease in fluorescence observed in the SEAP assay was specifically due to ELF3-MED23 disruption, and not related to non-specific cytotoxicity of the compounds (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Overall, a total of 12 compounds displayed nearly 100% inhibition at 10 μM, showing the most excellent significant SEAP inhibitory activities among the entire series. Most of these have a chalcone moiety (compounds <bold>1-10</bold> in <bold>group 1</bold>), while compounds <bold>16</bold> and <bold>17</bold> have a pyrazoline acetyl moiety. Among the remaining pyrazoline acetyl derivatives in <bold>group 2</bold>, compounds <bold>11</bold>, <bold>13</bold>, <bold>14</bold>, and <bold>15</bold> also showed inhibitory effects, but their extent was relatively low (compounds <bold>11, 14,</bold> and <bold>15</bold>; below 30% inhibition, compound <bold>13</bold>; 68% inhibition). In case of the molecules of pyrazoline propionyl skeleton in <bold>group 3</bold>, only compound <bold>26</bold> displayed a moderate inhibitory rate of 63.8%, while majority of them did not show noticeable inhibitory effects (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). To select the compounds that can actually induce downregulation of HER2 in cancer cells, we applied the top 12 compounds with the highest SEAP inhibitory activity to NCI-N87, a well-known HER2-positive gastric cancer cell line, and evaluated changes in the HER2 protein expression level (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). Of the tested molecules, only compounds <bold>3</bold>, <bold>5</bold>, and <bold>10</bold> were found to significantly reduce the HER2 levels by more than 50%. However, unlike compound <bold>3</bold> and <bold>10</bold>, the downregulation of HER2 induced by compound <bold>5</bold> did not occur at the mRNA level. This indicates that only compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>10</bold> were capable of transcriptionally downregulating HER2 by disrupting the ELF3-MED23 interaction (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Since compound <bold>10</bold> remarkably decreased the HER2 level of NCI-N87 by more effectively disrupting the ELF3-MED23 PPI compared to compound <bold>3</bold> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>), we finally selected compound <bold>10</bold> as the candidate molecule and performed further experiments.</p>

<label>2.2.</label><title>Qualitative structure-activity relationship (SAR) of prepared compounds</title>
<p>Field-based approaches primarily focus on characterizing the molecular properties of compounds based on their interaction fields. By providing comprehensive 3D information regarding charge distribution, non-polar interactions, and shape properties of diverse molecules, this method allows detailed insights into how distinct electrostatic, hydrophobic, and steric fields of ligands contribute to their biological activity or inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Based on this concept, we utilized FieldTemplater™ software to 3-dimensionally align all 26 compounds according to their field points. We subsequently analyzed their configurations through Activity Atlas™ software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. We finally visualized the results in 3D activity cliff summary plots of positive/negative electrostatics and favorable/unfavorable hydrophobics <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>)</bold>. According to the electrostatic and hydrophobic plots, the positive/negative and hydrophobic field points of the compounds demonstrating relatively high HER2 inhibitory activity (as exemplified by compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>5</bold>) were found to be well-distributed within the favored areas. Especially, the negative field formed around the ketone moiety within the chalcone skeleton, and the hydrophobic field generated by 3-methyl-but-2-enyl side chain of compound <bold>10</bold> are assumed to be important for the HER2 inhibitory effect induced by interrupting ELF3-MED23 PPI. This assumption arises from the observation that the overall activity slightly decreased when both the negative and hydrophobic field point were less distributed in the mentioned regions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>; compounds <bold>3</bold> and <bold>5</bold>). For the compounds displaying low potency (represented by compounds <bold>12</bold>, <bold>15</bold>, <bold>20</bold> and <bold>24</bold>), their positive/negative electrostatic and hydrophobic potentials shared unfavorable distribution patterns. This suggests that conformation of these compounds is less likely to complementarily fit into the binding interface of ELF3-MED23 PPI (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref></bold>; compounds <bold>12</bold>, <bold>15</bold>, <bold>20</bold>, and <bold>24</bold>).</p>

<label>2.3.</label><title>Compound 10 as a transcriptional regulator of HER2 by inhibiting ELF3-MED23 PPI</title>
<p>Previously, we have verified that the TAD domain of ELF3 (129–145 residues; 17 amino acids) interacts with the 391–582 residues of MED23, thereby regulating HER2 at the transcriptional level. Specifically, within ELF3, residues S137 to E144 were identified as essential residues for this interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Based upon the results, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> fluorescence polarization (FP) assay by utilizing the (His)<sub>6</sub>-MED23<sub>391-582</sub> protein and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled ELF3<sub>129-145</sub> peptide (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref></bold>). Similar to the positive control, unlabeled ELF3<sub>137-144</sub> peptide, compound <bold>10</bold> significantly reduced the FP signal induced by the binding of FITC-ELF3<sub>129-145</sub> and (His)<sub>6</sub>-MED23<sub>391-582</sub>, demonstrating that compound <bold>10</bold> directly inhibits the ELF3-MED23 PPI.

Through GST-pull down assay, we then confirmed that ELF3-MED23 PPI inhibitory effect of compound <bold>10</bold> is also valid at the cell level (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref></bold>). To investigate whether intracellular compound <bold>10</bold> also acts on the binding interface of ELF3 and the 391-582 amino acid region of MED23 within the cell system, we performed split luciferase complementation assay using ELF3– and MED23<sub>391-582</sub>-ligated with N-terminal (Nluc) and C-terminal (Cluc) fragments of split luciferase, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></bold>). Without compound <bold>10</bold>, ELF3 and MED23<sub>391-582</sub> successfully interacted within the cell system, subsequently inducing the complementation of Nluc and Cluc to generate a significant amount of bioluminescence (32.7-fold change vs. control). However, compound <bold>10</bold> markedly reduced this luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. This result verified that compound <bold>10</bold> is also capable of disrupting the ELF3-MED23 PPI at the cellular level. In fact, the successful inhibition of the ELF3-MED23 PPI by compound <bold>10</bold> ultimately resulted in the attenuation of HER2 promoter activity (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref></bold>). This led to a significant downregulation of HER2 expression and its downstream signaling molecules such as pAKT and pMAPK in a concentration– and time-dependent manner (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref></bold>).</p>

<label>2.4.</label><title>Compound 10 as a potent anticancer agent for HER2-positive gastric cancer cells</title>
<p>Based upon the obtained results so far, we proceeded to evaluate whether compound <bold>10</bold>-mediated inhibition of ELF3-MED23 PPI could lead to significant anticancer activity against HER2-positive gastric cancer cells in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings. First, by treating NCI-N87 cells with varying concentrations of compound <bold>10</bold>, we found that apoptosis was significantly induced in a concentration-dependent manner (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref></bold>). This effect was further validated by the dose– and time-dependent increases in pro-apoptotic markers, cleaved PARP (c-PARP) and cleaved caspase 3 (c-Caspase 3) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref></bold>). Accordingly, compound <bold>10</bold> significantly decreased the cell proliferation of NCI-N87 in a concentration-dependent manner (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>), indicating its potent anticancer activity in the <italic>in vitro</italic> system. To evaluate its potency in the <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, we then established an NCI-N87 xenograft mouse model and administered compound <bold>10</bold> intravenously. Notably, the administration of 4 mg/kg of compound <bold>10</bold> resulted in significant retardation of tumor growth (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref></bold>), leading to a marked reduction in the final tumor volume, approximately 3.5-fold decrease compared to the control group (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref></bold>). Through Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis, we confirmed that the proliferation marker, Ki67, was remarkably downregulated (a 2.3-fold decrease compared to the control) in the tumor tissues administered with compound <bold>10</bold> (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, right panel</bold>). This reduction in Ki67 expression was accompanied by a significant decrease in HER2 levels in the tumor tissue (a 1.7-fold decrease compared to the control), suggesting that the overall anti-tumor activity of compound <bold>10</bold> is primarily due to its capacity to inhibit HER2 expression (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>, left panel</bold>).</p>

<label>2.5.</label><title>Compound 10 as a novel strategy to overcome trastuzumab resistance</title>
<p>As previously mentioned, trastuzumab has been a primary first-line therapy for various HER2-overexpressing cancer subtypes, including gastric cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]. However, one of the significant drawback of this drug is the development of resistance, which readily occurs within 1 year of medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. In our previous study, we demonstrated that inhibiting the ELF3-MED23 PPI to downregulate HER2 at the transcriptional level could serve as a potentially promising alternative therapeutic option to trastuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Consequently, we sought to determine whether compound <bold>10</bold> holds the capability to overcome trastuzumab resistance. For this assessment, we utilized the trastuzumab-refractory NCI-N87 (NCI-N87 TR) cell line, which exhibited a 5.3-fold lower response rate to 10 μg/mL trastuzumab compared to the parental NCI-N87 cells (Parent <italic>vs.</italic> TR; 50.1% <italic>vs.</italic> 9.5% growth inhibition) (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref></bold>). At a concentration of 10 μg/mL, trastuzumab exhibited no discernible impact on the level of HER2 or its downstream signaling molecules such as p-AKT and p-MAPK in NCI-N87 TR cells. In contrast, compound <bold>10</bold> effectively attenuated these pathways by inhibiting HER2 expression (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref></bold>). Accordingly, compound <bold>10</bold> markedly inhibited the long-term proliferation of NCI-N87 TR, unlike trastuzumab (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref></bold>). Moreover, the dose-dependent treatment of compound <bold>10</bold> significantly induced apoptosis in NCI-N87 TR cells (<bold><xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref></bold>). These findings collectively suggest that compound <bold>10</bold> demonstrates anticancer activity not only against parental HER2-positive cancer cells but also against their trastuzumab-refractory clones.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Discussion</title>
<p>As HER2-positivity is generally responsible for more aggressive behavior of diverse cancer subtypes, HER2 has long been regarded as a crucial biomarker and a primary therapeutic target. Consequently, numerous researchers have consistently sought to develop new HER2-targeting agents beyond trastuzumab, and indeed, several drugs such as Enhertu® (fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki) and Tukysa® (tucatinib) have been identified and approved by the FDA in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>].</p>
<p>To date, numerous HER2-targeting drugs are clinically available. Among them, trastuzumab, the first FDA-approved HER2-targeting drug, still remains the most commonly used drug of molecular targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer, improving the survival of patients with this molecular subtype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. However, despite initial responses to trastuzumab or trastuzumab conjugate regimens, approximately 70% of HER2-positivie breast cancer patients develop resistance within the first year of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. This high incidence of trastuzumab resistance highlights the persistent challenges of relapse and drug resistance in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.</p>
<p>As HER2 targeting primarily involves the already overexpressed HER2 and its downstream signaling pathways, typically driven by the gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], alternative approaches have been explored to downregulate HER2 signaling from the gene expression level. Specifically, strategies have been investigated to inhibit the interaction between transcription factor (TF), ELF3, and its coactivator, MED23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. ELF3, a critical regulator of HER2 gene expression, acts on the ETS transcriptional response element of HER2 promoter and interacts with MED23 to promote HER2 overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Our previous work has provided structural insights into the regulation of the ELF3-MED23 PPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Expanding on the findings that interrupting the ELF3-MED23 PPI can effectively serve as a viable alternative strategy for inhibiting HER2 compared to trastuzumab, we designed a series of potential ELF3-MED23 inhibitors incorporating chalcone and pyrazoline moieties.</p>
<p>This study primarily aims to identify novel small molecules that can inhibit HER2 with outstanding anticancer activity, which can be broadly applicable to diverse HER2-positive cancers, irrespective of their resistance to trastuzumab. Following a comprehensive biological evaluation, we successfully identified compound <bold>10,</bold> demonstrating a highly potent ELF3-MED23 inhibitory efficacy (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.68±0.08 μM). Based on these findings, we confirmed that this compound exhibits excellent anticancer activity in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> settings against HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cells and those exhibiting resistance to trastuzumab.</p>
<p>This study highlights that the chalcone moiety can efficiently bind to the ELF3-MED23 interface, suggesting that this structure can potentially serve as a useful scaffold in the development of PPI inhibitors, specifically for downregulating HER2 and its associated signaling cascade. The results also clearly demonstrates that inhibition of ELF3-MED23 PPI through the chalcone derivative can serve as a potential therapeutic strategy targeting HER2 in anticancer treatments. By combining our findings on the efficacy of chalcone derivatives with our understanding of the complexity of the ELF3-MED23 interaction and its role in HER2 regulation, this study makes a valuable contribution, paving the way for designing targeted therapies. Consequently, we anticipate that these insights will provide valuable contributions towards development of new agents, the progression of treatments, and the enhancement of the therapeutic landscape for HER2-positive cancers.</p>

FITC-Annexin V apoptosis detection kit 1 (BD Pharmingen<sup>TM</sup>) was used to evaluate compound-induced apoptosis. Pellets were washed with PBS and incubated with 100 μL of 1×Annexin V binding buffer containing propidium iodide and FITC-Annexin V for 20 min in the dark at room temperature. The samples were diluted by adding 400 μL of 1×Annexin V binding buffer and then analyzed using Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) (BD Biosciences, USA). At least 10,000 cells were measured for each sample.</p>

<label>4.11.</label><title>Clonogenic assay</title>
<p>Cells were seeded at a density of 1,000 cells per well in 6-well plates and incubated overnight. After the cells were treated with serum-free medium containing compounds at the indicated concentrations for 24 hours, the medium was replaced to growth medium without compounds. The media was changed every 3 days. The plates were incubated for 9 days to allow colony formation. The colonies were washed with PBS, fixed with 100% methanol for 3 min at room temperature, and then stained with crystal violet (0.5% in 100% Methanol) for 10 min. The images were obtained using ChemiDoc (bio-image analyzer, BR179-8280) and the number of colony was counted using the image J program.</p>

<label>4.12.</label><title>Tumor xenografts</title>
<p>NCI-N87 cells (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) were implanted into the flank of 5-week-old female athymic nude mice (Envigo, USA) using 100 μL of 1x PBS. The mice were then assigned randomly to different groups once the average tumor volume reached 90-100 mm<sup>3</sup>. Subsequently, the drug was administered intravenously to NCI-N87 xenografts, with six repetitions at 3-day intervals. Compound <bold>10</bold> was given at the concentration of 4 mg/kg, prepared in DMAC/Tween80/saline (5:10:85) mixture along with saline. Tumor size changes were monitored for additional days after the last drug injection until the average tumor size of the control group reached 2000-2500 mm<sup>3</sup>. Mice were sacrificed 25 days after the first drug injection, and tumors were immediately excised from each mouse. The relative tumor sizes were determined by measuring the tumor length (L) and width (W) with calipers and the formula (L × W<sup>2</sup>) / 2 was used for calculations.</p>

<label>4.13.</label><title>IHC Assay for Xenograft Mouse Model</title>
<p>Tumors excised from the xenograft mouse model were processed into paraffin-embedded block sections for IHC. The experiments were carried out following standard protocols. The specified HER2 and Ki67 primary antibodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight and then washed 3 times with 1x PBS. Subsequently, they were exposed to secondary antibodies, developed using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, USA), and stained with DAB solution (Dako, Carpinteria, USA), all in accordance with the manufacturers’ protocols. The IHC staining was further counterstained with hematoxylin (USA), and was evaluated under light microscopy at 200× magnification. A semi-quantitative IHC score was adopted for evaluation, where the final scores were calculated by multiplying the intensity and fraction score (percentage of samples counted at each scale), leading to a range from 0 to 300. All imaging and evaluation were conducted using an Axiophot 2 apparatus (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Inc., Thornwood, NY, USA), at the Drug Development Research Core Center. The details of the applied antibodies and dilution ratios can be found in Table S1.</p>

<p>For the qualitative SAR analysis Cresset’s Flare v7.1 software was utilized. All the prepared 28 compounds were primarily aligned in FieldTemplater™ to generate conformations and molecular fields for each compound. Using compound 10 as the reference molecule, qualitative Activity Atlas model was subsequently constructed under the default settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] to visualize the activity cliff summary of electrostatics and hydrophobics in 3D plots.</p>

<p>All experiments were performed at least three times and all results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistics were analyzed via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student’s t-test with Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). Differences between two values were considered statistically significant when the <italic>p-</italic>values (demonstrated as single, double or triple asterisks) were &lt;0.05, &lt;0.01, and &lt;0.001.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Soo-Yeon Hwang et al. synthesized and characterized a new set of small molecules targeting the interaction between ELF3-MED23, the transcription factor, and a coactivator for HER2 transcription, respectively. The authors used a combination of biochemical analysis, cell-based assays, and an in vivo xenograft model to prove that the lead compound 10 inhibits the HER2 transcription and protein expression levels, subsequently inducing anticancer activity in the gastric cancer cell line, the xenograft model, particularly in the trastuzumab-resistant cell line. The experiential data is solid and supports the model for the anticancer potency of the compound for the HER2+ gastric cancer model. Although the compound showed promising data for its potential antitumor activity for HER2+ cancers, it is a little bit narrow to the HER2+ cancer field since the most relevant HER2+ cancer model is HER2+ breast cancer and the Herceptin-resistance, indeed the author also discussed this point in the manuscript. Therefore, additional data with the breast cancer HER2+ cell model will help to impact the work in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The current manuscript proposed a potential alternative strategy targeting HER2 overexpression cancers by attenuating HER2 transcription levels. The study provides solid evidence that the lead compound 10 can interrupt the binding of ELF3 to MED23, leading to the inhibition of HER2 transcription. Remarkably, the following cell-based assays and xenograft model revealed the promising antitumor activity of the compound in the gastric cancer model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the novel compound showed a promising potency to the HER2-positive gastric cancer cells and xenograft model, it would be great to also to be evaluated with the HER2-positive breast cancer cell models. The author did not compare the current compounds with other therapeutic strategies targeting HER2 expression at the genetic level. It is unclear whether the EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and canertinib but not HER2-specific inhibitors (i.e. tucatinib) were used as a control in the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The findings highlight the importance of targeting the ELF3-MED23 protein-protein interaction (PPI) as a potential therapeutic strategy for HER2-overexpressing cancers, notably gastric cancers, as an alternative to trastuzumab. The evidence, including the strong potency of compound 10 in inhibiting ELF3-MED23 PPI, its capacity to lower HER2 levels, induce apoptosis, and impede proliferation both in laboratory settings and animal models, indicates that compound 10 holds promise as a novel therapeutic option, even for cases resistant to trastuzumab treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments conducted are robust and diverse enough to address the hypothesis posed.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The rationale behind the proposed structural modifications for the three groups of compounds is not clear.</p>
