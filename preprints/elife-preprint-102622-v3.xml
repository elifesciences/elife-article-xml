<title>Abstract</title><p>Mollusks are a major component of animal biodiversity and play a critical role in ecosystems and global food security. The Pacific oyster, <italic>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</italic>, is the most farmed bivalve mollusk in the world and is becoming a model species for invertebrate biology. Despite the extensive research on hemocytes, the immune cells of bivalves, their characterization remains elusive. Here we were able to extensively characterize the diverse hemocytes and identified at least seven functionally distinct cell types and three hematopoietic lineages. A combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative cytology, cell sorting, functional assays and pseudo-time analyses was used to deliver a comprehensive view of the distinct hemocyte types. This integrative analysis enabled us to reconcile molecular and cellular data and identify distinct cell types performing specialized immune functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study emphasized the need for more in depth studies of cellular immunity in mollusks and non-model invertebrates and set the ground for further comparative immunology studies at the cellular level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mollusca</italic> is the second largest invertebrate phylum, after Arthropoda, and the largest marine phylum, comprising approximately 23 % of all known marine organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Among them, bivalves exhibit a high diversity and a rich evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). The Pacific oyster <italic>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</italic> (<italic>C. gigas</italic> - Thunberg, 1793) (NCBI:txid29159) is a sessile filter-feeding bivalve that thrives in a variety of stressful environments ranging from intertidal to deep-sea conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). It is a key species for the aquaculture industry worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Several infectious diseases affect <italic>C. gigas</italic> at different life stages, which impacts its production. Given the significant socio-economic value of this species, there has been an increased focus on understanding and mitigating these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The causes of these mortalities can involve a variety of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria and parasites that can be responsible for the mortality events affecting <italic>C. gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). One of the most extensively researched infectious diseases is POMS (Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome), a polymicrobial disease responsible for mass mortalities of juvenile oysters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). The disease is triggered by the OsHV-1 μVar herpesvirus, which alters the immune defenses of oysters, allowing the colonization of opportunistic bacteria, including <italic>Vibrio</italic>, that cause hemocyte lysis and bacteremia, ultimately leading to animal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Other bacterial pathogens have also been identified as a contributing factor in mass mortalities of adult Pacific oysters in several countries. The most notable is <italic>Vibrio aestuarianus</italic> which affects adult oysters in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). To date, the majority of oyster pathogens or opportunistic pathogens that have been characterized in detail have been found to subvert hemocyte defenses for their own benefit. These include the OsHV-1 μVar herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>) and virulent <italic>Vibrio</italic> strains of the species <italic>Vibrio crassostreae</italic> and <italic>Vibrio tasmaniensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>), <italic>Vibrio aestuarianus</italic> and <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>), highlighting the critical role of hemocytes in oyster immunity. The development of immune-based prophylactic treatments, such as immune-priming and immune-shaping, represents a promising avenue for enhancing the natural defenses of oysters against pathogens and increasing their survival rate. Nevertheless, the advancement of such therapies is still constrained by a dearth of knowledge regarding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>).</p>
<p>The study of hemocytes has a long history, dating back to the 1970s (for review see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>)). Hemocytes are cellular effectors of the immune system. They engage in phagocytosis to engulf and destroy potential pathogens, neutralizing parasites by encapsulation, or preventing pathogen dissemination by cell aggregation and the release of extracellular DNA traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Furthermore, they engage in the humoral response by releasing cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which enable them to combat pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). In addition to their role in oyster immunity, hemocytes have been implicated in numerous physiological processes, including shell repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), wound healing, nutrient transport, and environmental contaminant removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Despite this acquired knowledge, hemocytes remain an under-characterized population of circulating immune cells. The lack of a unified classification and of molecular and functional genetic tools hinders our understanding of lineage ontogeny and functional specialization. Several studies have proposed different classifications of hemocytes in the <italic>Ostreidae</italic> family, with 3 to 4 hemocyte types reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These classifications are primarily based on either microscopic or flow cytometry analyses. In <italic>C. gigas</italic>, three primary hemocyte cell types have been classically identified : blast, hyalinocyte, and granulocyte cells. Blast-like cells are considered as undifferentiated hemocyte types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>), hyalinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>) seem to be more involved in wound repair, and granulocytes, more implicated in immune surveillance. The latter are considered as the main immunocompetent hemocyte types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). While the immune response of <italic>C. gigas</italic> has been extensively studied using classical transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) at the whole animal, tissue, or circulating hemocyte levels, these approaches have failed to consider the diversity of hemocyte cell types and lineages that underpin these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, it is still imperative to accurately describe the diversity of these cells, understand their ontogeny, and delineate cell lineages to comprehend their specific roles. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has enabled the monitoring of global gene expression at the single-cell level with thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. This provides a unique opportunity to overcome these limitations and deepen our understanding of hemocyte diversity and function in bivalves. Recently scRNA-seq was used to provide a first molecular description of a hemocyte population in the oyster <italic>Crassostrea hongkongensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). However, in the absence of morphological and/or functional characterization studies, the authors could not deduce the hemocyte cell types to be matched to the transcriptomic profiles generated by scRNA-seq.</p>
<p>While numerous transcriptomic analyses have been conducted on <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes, none have adopted a single-cell approach. In this study, we present an integrative analysis of the diversity of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes at the single-cell level. To this end, we combined scRNA-seq from a pathogen-free adult oyster combined with cytological, cell fractionation and functional assays. This approach allowed us to create a comprehensive transcriptomic, cytological and functional atlas of hemocyte cell types. Our scRNA-seq analyses identified 7 distinct transcriptomic populations and functional annotation revealed distinct populations with specific functions, including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, energetic metabolism, enhanced transcription, translation and cell division. Quantitative cytology enabled the identification of 7 morphologically distinct hemocyte cell types, which allowed us to reconcile molecular and cytological data. Density gradients were used to separate hemocyte cell types and qPCR or functional assay analyses were performed to validate cell type-specific markers. By employing this integrated approach, we could identify 1 type of hyalinocyte, 2 types of blasts and 4 types of granular cells. Furthermore, we identified cell types that perform antimicrobial functions through phagocytosis, ROS production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. Finally, trajectory analysis of scRNA-seq data combined with functional analysis revealed distinct differentiation pathways that may control hemocyte ontology and differentiation processes. Based on these findings, we propose a more comprehensive and up-to-date classification of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes, with a more accurate description of the different cell types, their potential ontology and a precise description of their sub-functionalization.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals 7 distinct transcriptomic clusters of circulating immune cells in oysters</title>
<p>Oysters are known to exhibit a high degree of individual genetic polymorphism, including Copy Number Variation (CNV) and Presence Absence Variation (PAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). To prevent misinterpretation of the single-cell transcriptomic data, and to characterize the hemocyte cell types and their heterogeneity, we sampled hemocytes from a unique known pathogen-free animal (Ifremer Standardized Animal, 18-month-old) and applied single-cell drop-seq technology. A total of 4,950 cells were loaded, with a target recovery of 3,000 single hemocytes for analysis. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). The scRNA-seq library was generated and sequenced, resulting in 127,959,215 high-quality filtered reads available for single-cell analysis (ENA project accession number PRJEB74031). Primary bioinformatics analysis was performed using the STAR solo aligner software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>) against the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome (Genbank reference GCA_902806645.1) from the Roslin Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Of the 127,959,215 reads, 97 % showed a valid barcode and 89.2 % were successfully mapped to the genome with a saturation of 75.6 %. A total of 2,937 cells were profiled, yielding a median of 1,578 genes and 4,412 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell among the 23,841 total genes detected, with a sequencing saturation of 75.6 % (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Table S1</xref>). Secondary bioinformatic data processing was conducted using the Seurat R package (version 4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The data set was filtered to remove data corresponding to empty droplets or cell doublets. Cells with a gene number between 750 and 4,000 and less than 5 % mitochondrial genes were retained. After quality control processing, 120 cells corresponding to empty droplets and cell doublets were removed, and 2,817 cells were processed for data normalization. Finally, we performed linear dimensional reduction and clustering on the 3,000 most variable genes from 2,817 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S1</xref>). Dimension reduction and clustering led to identifying 7 transcriptomic clusters, within which hemocytes were distributed. These 7 different clusters represented 27.6, 23.1, 17.8, 16.9, 7, 4.6 and 3 % of the total cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). For each transcriptomic cluster, the heatmap displays the top 10 positively enriched marker genes identified by Seurat’s differential expression analysis, highlighting cluster-specific overexpression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>KEGG pathways and GO-terms analyses reveal functional diversity in <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes</title>
<p>The ScRNA-seq data demonstrated that specific functions are carried out by the hemocyte cell types that comprise the seven transcriptomic clusters. A preliminary overview of the functions over-represented in each cluster was obtained through a KEGG pathway analysis on the overrepresented transcripts (Log2FC &gt; 0.25) using the <italic>C. gigas</italic> annotation provided by the DAVID consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), thereby identifying pathways specifically enriched in each cluster. Cluster 1 demonstrated enrichment in viral processing and endocytosis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). Additionally, it demonstrated enrichment in pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathways. Clusters 1 and 3 exhibited a distinctive enrichment in carbohydrate metabolism and endocytosis. In particular, cluster 3 exhibited enriched transcripts associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and TCA cycle activities. Cluster 4 was enriched in protein synthesis, including transcription (spliceosome, ribosome, nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA surveillance pathway) folding, sorting and degradation of protein pathways. Clusters 2, 5 and 6 exhibited a shared signature of enrichment in ribosome-related genes. Cluster 2 demonstrated a specific enrichment in motor protein-coding genes responsible for cell motility and xenobiotic metabolism. Remarkably, clusters 1, 3, 4 and 5 exhibited enriched oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, whereas the transcripts of cluster 7 were enriched in vesicular trafficking and endo-lysosomal pathways (endocytosis, endosome, phagosome, lysosome, auto and mitophagy). Cluster 7 displayed also the signature of Wnt pathway components.</p>

<p>For a more detailed functional characterization of each transcriptomic cluster, we performed a re-annotation of the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome using a combination of tools to enhance the GO term richness of the existing annotation prior to functional GO term analysis. The original annotation for <italic>C. gigas</italic>, based on the work of Penaloza et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>), provided GO annotations for 18,750 out of 30,724 genes (61%). In order to improve upon these baseline annotations, we used the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome (Genbank reference GCA_902806645.1) and the associated gff3 annotation file from the Roslin Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Using the Orson pipeline (see Materials and Methods), these files were used to extract and process the longest CDSs for GO-term annotation, and we then re-annotated each predicted protein by sequence homology, assigning putative functions and improving downstream GO-term analyses. Of the 30,724 extracted CDSs, 22,462 were annotated (GO-terms and sequence description), yielding an annotation percentage of 73.1 %. Of the 30,724 CDSs, 22,391 were annotated with Molecular Functions (MF), Biological Processes (BP), and Cellular Components (CC) GO-terms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata2">Supp. Data 2</xref>). Overall, this improved annotation coverage significantly enhances the resolution of our downstream functional analyses. Using the GO-term annotation and the Log2FC of genes calculated after scRNA-seq processing in each cluster, GO enrichment analysis was performed by rank-based gene ontology analysis (RBGOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>
<p>RBGOA analysis was performed on the GO-terms identified in each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Supp. Data 3</xref>). The results are presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>. The scRNA-seq-based analysis identified seven distinct transcriptomic profiles for each cell cluster, thereby shedding light on greater heterogeneity and functional diversity of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes than previously described. Cluster 1, comprising 27.6 % of cells, is characterized by GO-terms related to myosin complex, lamellipodium, membrane and actin cytoskeleton remodelling, as well as phosphotransferase activity. This is evidenced by an enrichment in actin nucleation, phosphorus metabolic process and signal transduction BP, actin filament binding and phosphotransferase activity MF and lamellipodium and actin-based cell projection CC. Cluster 2, comprising 23.1 % of cells, has an increased translation activity, as indicated by enrichment in BP, MF and CC terms related to rRNA binding, cytoplasmic translation, maturation of LSU-rRNA, and ribosomes respectively. Cluster 3, representing 17.8 % of cells, shows enrichment in cellular oxidation and actin nucleation, as evidenced by an enrichment in BP and MF related to oxidoreductase activities acting on metal ions, electron transfer and cellular oxidation, and CC related to cytochromes, oxidoreductase complex, and mitochondrial protein-containing complexes. Cluster 4, representing 16.9 % of cells, has transcriptomic signatures reminiscent of spliceosome assembly, RNA maturation, and macromolecules biosynthesis (BP related to biosynthetic process, macromolecules biosynthesis process, and spliceosome assembly, MF related to RNA and ssRNA binding and translation initiation, and CC related to ribosomes and ribonucleoprotein complexes). Cluster 5, comprising 7 % of cells, demonstrates enrichment in structural molecule activity, hydrolase regulation and ubiquitin-like protein transferase activity, as evidenced by its BP, MF, and CC related to ribosome and midbody localization. Cluster 6, comprising 4.6 % of cells, is characterized by a specific nucleosome organization, translation, and biosynthetic processes, with related BP, MF, and CC tied to nucleolus, ribosomes, ribonucleoprotein complex and rRNA binding. Cluster 7, representing a mere 3 % of cells, is characterized by multivesicular body sorting, vacuolar transport, vacuole organization, and positive regulation of proteolysis, with related BP, MF, and CC of the ESCRT machinery.</p>

<title>Seven morphologically distinct immune cell types are identified by quantitative cytology and transcriptomic markers</title>
<p>Cytological studies were conducted using MCDH staining to better characterize the diversity of circulating hemocytes in <italic>C. gigas</italic>. Seven distinct hemocyte morphotypes were identified: three non-granular (acidophilic blasts, basophilic blasts and hyalinocytes) and four granular (small granule cells, big granule cells, vesicular cells and macrophage-like) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S3</xref>). Hyalinocytes (30 % of total hemocytes) are large cells with an irregular spreading membrane. They contain an azurophilic cytoplasm without granulations and their irregular nucleus varies in size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A panel H</xref>). Basophilic blasts characterized by a basophil cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A panel BBL</xref>) and acidophilic blasts with acidophil cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A panel ABL</xref>) accounted for 17 % and 14 %, respectively, of the total hemocytes. They are rounded cells without granulation, with a uniform and regular dense nucleus and a high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio. Macrophage-like cells (20 % of the hemocytes) present an irregular membrane punctuated by rare pseudopodia with a polylobed nucleus and a basophilic cytoplasm where polychromatic inclusions of various sizes could be observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A. panel ML</xref>). Small granule cells (13 % of total hemocytes) have an irregular membrane punctuated by rare pseudopodia, an acidophilic cytoplasm, and numerous homogeneous purple granules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A panel SGC</xref>). Big granule cells (4 % of total hemocytes) are rounded cells with a basophilic cytoplasm containing large, slightly dark purple to black vesicles of heterogeneous size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A panel BGC</xref>). Vesicular cells (2 % of total hemocytes) are rounded cells with acidophilic cytoplasm, rich in homogeneous transparent and fluorescent to UV light vesicles with an irregular nucleus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A panel VC</xref>). Only blasts (BBL, ABL) have a nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio greater than 0.6, whereas the other hemocytes described have a nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio less than 0.3.</p>

<p>To gain further insight into the functional characterization of these diverse hemocyte morphotypes and to associate them with the transcriptomic clusters identified in the scRNA-seq, we enhanced an existing hemocyte fractionation approach using an isopycnic Percoll density gradient to sort the hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Cell sorting was performed using a discontinuous Percoll gradient with densities ranging from 1.0647 to 1.1049. Seven distinct density fractions were established (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the hemocyte composition was then characterized by cytological analysis of each fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S4</xref> for statistical significance). The uneven distribution of hemocyte morphotypes along the density gradient enabled a relative separation of the different cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig S4</xref>). In summary, hyalinocytes were significantly enriched in the first fraction, while macrophage-like cells were significantly enriched in fraction 3 and fraction 4. Acidophilic blasts were significantly enriched in fraction 2. Basophilic blasts were significantly enriched in fractions 2 and 3. Vesicular cells were enriched in fraction 5, big granule cells were enriched in fraction 4 and small granule cells in fractions 6 and 7 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S4</xref>).</p>
<p>To identify the transcriptomic cell clusters corresponding to the different hemocyte morphotypes, we used RT-qPCR to detect the expression of different cluster-specific marker genes in the different hemocytes in the Percoll density fractions. The marker genes were selected without any a priori assumptions based solely on their enrichment levels (Log2C) and their percentage of expression (Pct1 / Pct2 ratio)F in the cluster of interest relative to all other cell clusters (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

<p>RT-qPCR expression profiles in the hemocyte fractions obtained from the Percoll density gradient revealed distinct patterns according to the different transcriptomic cluster marker genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Cluster 1 markers (LACC24 and CLEC) were overexpressed in fractions 1, 2, 3 and underexpressed in the remaining fractions relative to total hemocytes. Cluster 2 markers (EGFL and LEVAR) showed a decreasing pattern of expression from fraction 1 to fraction 7. Cluster 3 markers (TGC and XBOX) showed a significant increase in expression in fractions 4 to 7. Cluster 4 markers (MLDP and HMGB1) showed a gradually decreasing expression pattern from fraction 2 to fraction 7. Cluster 5 marker genes (GAL and CUBN) were underexpressed in fractions 4 to 7, but not differentially expressed in fractions 1 to 3 compared to total hemocytes. Cluster 6 marker genes (CAV and NAT1) were overexpressed in fraction 3, expressed similarly to total hemocytes in fraction 2, and underexpressed in fractions 1, and 4 to 7. Finally, cluster 7 marker genes (MOX and GPROT) were overexpressed only in fractions 3 to 7. Correlation analysis and statistical validation demonstrated a clear association between hemocyte morphotypes and 14 gene markers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Table S4</xref>).

<p>By employing RT-qPCR, cell sorting on Percoll gradients, and scRNA-seq analysis, we could identify cell types corresponding to three transcriptomic clusters. Cluster 3 corresponds to small granule cells (SGC), cluster 2 to hyalinocytes (H), and cluster 7 to vesicular cells (VC). Cluster 3, cluster 2 and cluster 7 represent 17.8 %, 23 % and 3 % of the total cells analyzed by scRNA-seq, respectively. This is consistent with cytological data, which indicated the presence of 12.5 % +/-5 % Small Granule Cells, 30 % +/-9.3 % Hyalinocytes and 2.3 % +/-1.6 % Vesicular Cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>).

<title>Only macrophage-like and small granule cells behave as professional phagocytes</title>
<p>The hemocytes separated on the Percoll gradient were characterized functionally to gain further insight into their functional specialization. Two hemocyte functions, namely phagocytosis and production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), are known to carry out major cellular antimicrobial activities. Granular cells have been suggested to be the professional phagocytes specialized for these functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Phagocytosis and oxidative burst were studied using cell response toward zymosan particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>).</p>
<p>The phagocytic activity of hemocytes was first tested on a sample of total oyster hemolymph.

<title>Only macrophage-like cells produce Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
<p>The next step was to assess the capacity of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes in each Percoll fraction to produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) upon stimulation by zymosan, utilizing the Luminol oxidation assay. Luminol luminescence peaked 25 minutes after exposure of hemocytes (isolated from total hemolymph) to zymosan, indicating a robust oxidative burst (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The production of ROS was dependent on a NADPH oxidase, as it was completely inhibited by the NADPH oxidase-specific inhibitor apocynin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). To ascertain which hemocyte types were involved in ROS production we tested Percoll density-sorted hemocytes for oxidative burst activity. Fractions 2 and 3 displayed higher oxidative burst activity than the other fractions. The burst intensity of fraction 3 was twice that of total hemocytes, and fraction 2 also exhibited significantly increased burst activity. In contrast, fraction 4 showed a significant decrease in oxidative burst, and no activity was observed for fractions 1, 6 and 7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). These results indicate that NADPH-dependent oxidative burst activity is carried out by fractions enriched in macrophage-like (ML) cells and blast-like cells (ABL and BBL).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that granular cells can produce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). In contrast, we found that small granule cells collected in fraction 7 could not produce ROS through an oxidative burst. To identify which type of hemocyte from blast-like cells and macrophage-like cells produces ROS within a few minutes after exposure to zymosan, ROS production was investigated using NitroBlueTetrazolium (NBT) reduction to stain hemocytes directly. Correlative microscopic analysis using MCDH staining can then be conducted after the NBT reduction reaction. Macrophage-like cells were strongly and significantly stained by NBT reduction (33.2 %) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E, panels a &amp; d</xref>). In contrast, some small granule cells were lightly stained by NBT reduction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Blast-like cells, big granule cells, vesicular cells, and hyalinocytes were never NBT stained, confirming that these cell types were not involved in ROS production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S7</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that small granule cells and macrophage-like cells are the two professional phagocytes among hemocytes. However, only macrophage-like cells are capable of oxidative burst upon exposure to zymosan. In light of these new functional data, we further analyzed the expression level of NADPH-oxidase-related enzymes in the scRNA-seq dataset. The cells in cluster 1 predominantly expressed two NADPH oxidase isoforms (gene numbers G34908 and G23852) compared to other clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>). Furthermore, this cluster expresses macrophage-related genes, including the macrophage-expressed gene 1 protein (G30226) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Supp. Data S1</xref>), along with maturation factors for dual oxidase, an enzyme involved in peroxide formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S8</xref>), supporting its designation as macrophage-like based on functional characteristics. Collectively, these data indicated that cells of transcriptomic cluster 1 corresponded to macrophage-like cells.</p>

<title>Small granule cells and big granule cells accumulate intracellular copper</title>
<p>The effects of copper on oyster hemocytes have been studied extensively due to its abundance in polluted marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In addition, several studies have shown that <italic>Vibrio</italic> species pathogenic for <italic>C. gigas</italic> possess copper resistance genes, which are crucial for their survival within hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). This prompted us to investigate which hemocyte types are involved in copper metabolism. To this end, total hemocytes were isolated from naive oysters and stained with rhodanine to reveal copper storage in cells, and a total of 1,562 cells were examined across three independent experiments. Rhodanine staining revealed that 33 % +/-2 % of small granule cells and 30 % +/-10 % of big granule cells exhibited a specific reddish/brown staining indicative of a high concentration of copper in their granules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S9</xref>). These results provide functional evidence that small granule cells (SGCs) are specialized in metal homeostasis in addition to phagocytosis, as suggested by the scRNA-seq data identifying cluster 3.

<title>Antimicrobial peptides are expressed by agranular cells, blasts and hyalinocytes</title>

The aim was to ascertain whether different hemocyte cell types expressed distinct AMPs.

This limitation was addressed by investigating AMP expression through RT-qPCR on Percoll density-fractionated hemocytes.

<title>Tentative model of hemocyte lineages and differentiation pathways in <italic>C. gigas</italic></title>
<p>The ontogeny, lineage and differentiation pathways of bivalves remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). However, there are some indications of circulating and proliferating hemocyte progenitors in the hemolymph of <italic>C. gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). GO-terms analysis of the 7 transcriptomic clusters revealed different functional signatures, including the transcriptomic signature of cluster 4, which showed a high expression level of ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S1J</xref>) . This particularity has been observed in hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Furthermore, scRNA-seq approaches using bioinformatic tools like Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) can now be used to deduce differentiation pathways from trajectory inference using gene expression profiles analysis. This revealed an overrepresentation of functions involved in the splicing, transcription and translation continuum in the same fourth cluster (see cluster 4 in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), thereby supporting the hypothesis of a pool of quiescent or immature cells that can differentiate upon stimulation.</p>
<p>Cluster 4 was chosen to enroot the pseudotime analysis to deduce differentiation pathways and cell lineages using Monocle3. (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). By temporally ordering the 2817 cells analyzed by scRNA-seq, 6 cell lineages could be defined (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Differentiation pathway 1 leads to hyalinocytes (H) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). This transition is characterized by the downregulation of 11 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10A</xref>), two of which are transcription factors (G31522 and G7003). The hyalinocyte cluster was also characterized by the overexpression of genes involved in cell contractility (G11418, G22824, G153 and G718). Differentiation pathway 2 leads to cells of cluster 5 and is characterized by the upregulation of about 26 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10B</xref>), one gene related to metalloendopeptidase activity (G15477) was downregulated, a GTPase IMAP gene (G29323) and three transcription factors were upregulated (G7003, G11013 and G4646) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). Differentiation pathway 3 leads to cells of cluster 6 and is characterized by the upregulation of 22 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10C</xref>). Three fibrinogen-related protein genes (G20176, G20226 and G20227) and a GATA-binding factor (G31054) were up-regulated whereas a metalloendopeptidase gene (G15477) was downregulated. The severin gene displayed a transient increased expression (G28864) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). The pathways between clusters 4, 5 and 6 found by Monocle3 analysis were pseudo temporally short and few specific markers were identified, suggesting that they were transcriptionally close. Differentiation pathway 4 leads to vesicular cells (VC) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F</xref>) where a large number of genes were activated to give rise to these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10D</xref>). Four genes were specifically downexpressed in VC (G15477, G25512, G2213 and G29172). Interestingly, 6 genes encoding potential transcription factors were upregulated in this lineage (G30997, G10637, G1067, G13555, G2123 and G27827). Differentiation pathway 5 leads to macrophage-like cells (ML), and is characterized by the underexpression of 41 genes and the overexpression of 20 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10E</xref>). Among the 41 genes, 6 are putative transcription factors (G2123, G10637, G13555, G27827, G1067 and G11196) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7G</xref>). Finally, we can outline a lineage ending in small granule cells (SGC) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7H</xref>). This pathway involved cluster 4 (immature cells), VC, ML and SGC and was characterized by the downregulation of 27 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10F</xref>), including 5 potential transcription factors (G10637, G13555, G27827, G1067 and G2123). SGC showed a distinct transcriptomic signature with 61 overexpressed genes, including 3 transcription factors (G1708, G21091 and G30622). Based on these findings, we postulate that immature cluster 4 cells possess pluripotent potential and can give rise to four terminally differentiated cell types : cluster 5 and 6 cells, hyalinocytes and small granule cells, and two other transient hemocyte cell types : vesicular cells and macrophage-like cells. All data from the Monocle3 analyses are available as Supplementary Data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S10</xref>).</p>

<p>Differentiation pathway analysis thus revealed the over- or under-expression of various transcription factors in the identified pathways. Given the established role of transcription factors as master regulators of cell differentiation and their utility in delineating cell lineages, we investigated the combinatorial expression patterns of transcription factors among the different transcriptomic cell clusters. Based on GO-terms annotation, 28 different sequences corresponding to transcription factors were isolated from the scRNA-seq dataset. The transcription factor function was confirmed by manual annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Table S5</xref>) and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7I</xref> shows the average expression profiles of these factors in the different clusters. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref> illustrates their expression levels in single cells. Two transcription factors, CgATF5 and CgCRBL1, exhibited a contrasting expression profile with an increased average expression in macrophage-like cells, hyalinocytes and small granule cells versus a low expression profile in cells in clusters 4, 5, 6 and vesicular cells. We also identified transcription factors that were specifically expressed in the different transcriptomic clusters : CgSPDEF, CgSOCS3, CgFOS and CgTFEB were specific for vesicular cells, CgSOX8, CgXBOX and CgELF3 were specific for small granule cells, CgCR3L1 and CgTAL1 for hyalinocytes, and CgJUN, CgKLF5, CgKLF6 and CgCREM for macrophage-like cells. Eight additional transcription factors were specifically identified in cluster 6 (CgGATA3, CgPU.1 and CgELF2), cluster 5 (CgELF2, CgELK3 and CgIRF1) and cluster 4 (CgTAL1 and CgFOS1). These data potentially define four distinct hematopoietic lineages originating from one type of immature blast cells and give rise to hyalinocytes, SGC (via VC and ML), or two distinct differentiated blast-like cells. We also identified a combination of transcription factors specific to lineages and cell types that are potential master regulators of cell fate during hematopoiesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of our study represent a significant advancement in our understanding of the functional diversity and lineages of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes. Single-cell RNA-seq and cytology were combined to identify seven distinct hemocyte transcriptomic cell clusters and an equivalent number of morphotypes. These include four granular cell types (big granule cells, macrophage-like cells, small granule cells and vesicular cells), two distinct blast-like cells (basophilic and acidophilic blast-like cells), and one agranular epithelial-like cell type (hyalinocytes). A significant challenge was to identify correlations between transcriptomic and cytological data to fully define each cytological cell type. This challenge was overcome by combining multiple approaches, including isopycnic Percoll density gradient fractionation combined with the analysis of transcriptomic markers expression, and functional assays including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, copper accumulation, AMP expression and finally pseudotime analysis of gene expression. These results confirmed the historical classification of the 3 main cell groups : blasts, hyalinocytes, and granular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>) and deepened our understanding of the functional specificities of poorly characterized cell types. In particular, we identified distinct transcriptional and functional subtypes among blasts and granular cells with complementary immune specialization and lineage relationships between cells.</p>
<p>One significant outcome of the present study is the identification of cell types involved in antimicrobial activities, including phagocytosis, intracellular copper accumulation, an oxidative burst and antimicrobial peptide production. These cell types have been extensively studied for their role in antibacterial and antiparasitic defenses, as they are found in the large majority of invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Nevertheless, there has been considerable debate surrounding the cell types specialized for these critical immune functions in bivalves, particularly oysters. Moreover, the involvement of the different hemocyte subpopulations in immune functions is not yet fully understood.</p>
<p>Our findings reveal that the macrophage-like (ML) cells and small granule cells (SGC) are the sole hemocyte cell types that function as professional phagocytes, as demonstrated against Zymosan or <italic>Vibrio</italic>. These two distinct cell types could be distinguished functionally. First, two distinct transcriptomic clusters were identified for each cell type (Cluster 1 for ML / BGC and Cluster 3 for SGC). Secondly, only ML induced a measurable oxidative burst. Thirdly, only SGC accumulated intracellular copper in specific granules. Interestingly, our scRNA-seq analysis indicates that SGC (cluster 3) expresses the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) gene G3876, annotated as an Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein with a Log2 fold change (Log2FC) of 0.77 linking them to scavenger receptor-mediated pathogen recognition and clearance. This aligns with findings by Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>), who demonstrated significant expansion and dynamic regulation of SRCR genes in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The pseudotime trajectory linking macrophage-like (ML) and small granule-like (SGC) cells suggests a potential developmental relationship within the granular cell lineage; however, this hypothesis requires further validation. The notion that ML could serve as a precursor for SGC may seem counterintuitive. However, this is not an isolated phenomenon among invertebrate hemocytes. For instance, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>), some populations of professional phagocytes, the sessile plasmatocytes, give rise to crystal cells or lamellocytes that are morphologically and functionally distinct from plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Similarly, the existence of multiple professional phagocytes in the oyster is reminiscent of vertebrate macrophages, polynuclear neutrophils and dendritic cells, which possess distinct functional specializations, including efferocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), oxidative burst, NETosis, or antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>).</p>
<p>The characterization of professional phagocytes in oysters is of particular importance for a deeper understanding of oyster-<italic>Vibrio</italic> interactions during pathogenesis. Some of the most extensively studied oyster pathogens, including strains of <italic>V. tasmaniensis</italic> and <italic>V. aestuarianus francensis,</italic> harbor virulence traits that enable them to disrupt the phagocytic activity of hemocytes during pathogenesis. For instance, <italic>V. tasmaniensis</italic> behaves as a facultative intracellular pathogen with phagocytosis-dependent cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). Additionally, both <italic>V. tasmaniensis</italic> and <italic>V. aestuarianus</italic> display resistance to copper toxicity through CopA and CusA/B transporters. This trait is essential for the survival and virulence of these pathogens in oysters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Since SGCs have been demonstrated to be professional phagocytes with copper-rich granules, the cellular interactions between SGCs and these vibrios are likely to be critical during the antibacterial host response and pathogenesis. ML are phagocytes that possess a very potent NADPH-oxidase-dependent oxidative burst. The oxidative burst is a rapid and potent antimicrobial response observed in professional phagocytes, such as polynuclear neutrophils in mammals. It is worth noting that NADPH-dependent ETosis has been observed in <italic>C. gigas</italic> in a manner analogous to that observed in human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). This cell death is characterized by the projection of DNA extracellular traps that capture and kill some pathogens like <italic>Vibrio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ML may also be involved in ETosis.</p>
<p>The specialized functions of the two other types of granular cells, the BGCs and the VCs, remain unclear. Despite the difficulty in identifying a specific scRNAseq transcriptomic cluster for BGCs, the level of expression of laccase 24 was found to be higher in a particular subcluster among ML (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S8</xref>) and pseudo-time analysis highlighted the same subcluster as an alternative differentiation state among ML (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). The enrichment of transcripts involved in oxido-reduction pathways, particularly laccase 24, aligns with their potential role in melanization and response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). While melanin-like deposits have been observed in some cases of infestation by the parasites <italic>Martelia</italic> or B<italic>onamia</italic> in the Sydney rock oyster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>), this mechanism is not as robust as that described in arthropods, which perform melanization through a prophenoloxidase activation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>). In many marine invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), a type of hemocyte known as Brown Cells could be related to the BGCs described here. When observed without any staining (as in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), their big granules with a yellow to dark brown content appear to align with the historical description of brown cells that often infiltrate tissues (like gills) in animals exposed to polluted waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). It has therefore been theorized that these cells are involved in detoxification processes. Our pseudotime analysis indicates that they likely originate from ML, with limited phagocytosis activity and a specialized role in melanization and potentially heavy metal detoxification, as evidenced by rhodanine staining showing copper accumulation in some of their granules (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Further studies are recommended to clarify the role of BGCs, particularly in the context of parasitic infestation or exposure to toxic stresses. Lastly, VC are granular cells that remain to be functionally characterized. Their transcriptomic profile suggests strong intracellular vesicular trafficking and autophagy activity. However, our functional assays did not reveal any particular immune-related function. Their clear granules appear auto-fluorescent when illuminated with UV light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supp. Fig. S12</xref>) but the biochemical nature of the content of these granules remains to be characterized. As they also appear as cell intermediates along the granular cell differentiation pathway in pseudotime analysis, they could represent functionally immature precursors of the other three granular cell types, much like promyelocytes which possess specific azurophilic granules but are functionally immature precursors during granulocyte differentiation in humans. However, the enrichment of autophagy-related transcripts in VC calls for further investigation into a potential role in antiviral immunity, as autophagy has been suggested to play a role in the response to OsHV-1 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>).</p>
<p>Hyalinocytes are a homogenous cell type, with only one morphotype matching one transcriptomic cluster. It can be deduced from pseudotime analysis that they originate from a specific and very different differentiation pathway than the granular cells. According to the literature, hyalinocytes are involved in the early stages of inflammation and can infiltrate wounds and interact with foreign particles. In the flat oyster <italic>Ostrea edulis</italic>, they contribute to shell production and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). In the Sydney rock oyster they play a role in cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>), while in <italic>C. virginica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>) they contribute to encapsulation, reminiscent of lamellocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our results suggest an important role of AMP expression in the immune response. Indeed, <italic>Cg-</italic>BigDefs, which participate in the control of oyster microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>), were found to be expressed in both hyalinocytes and blast-like cells. Moreover, hyalinocytes from the oyster <italic>O. edulis</italic> have been shown to express the AMP Myticin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>), which lends further support to this immune function. Among the AMPs, we also found that Cg-BPI and <italic>Cg-</italic>Defh, are more expressed in BBL, ABL than in other cell types. These results are somewhat unexpected, given the prevailing assumption that AMPs are stored in granules of granular cells, rather than agranular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). These results highlight the necessity to reassess the role of specific agranular cell types in the active production of humoral immune effectors. Nevertheless, further staining approaches would be necessary to confirm these transcriptomic results. Our findings suggest that hyalinocytes and/or the blast-like cells may be a cellular target of the OsHV-1 virus, the causal agent of POMS, which dampens the expression of certain AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>), thereby inducing bacterial dysbiosis. It is still unclear whether this is due to a decreased expression of AMPs and/or inhibition of immature blast cell differentiation involved in the renewal of agranular cell types.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the complexity of blast-like cells could not be fully elucidated in this study, as 3 clusters and only 2 morphotypes were identified. Cell fractionation using Percoll gradient failed to yield pure blast-enriched fractions (ABL and BBL), preventing precise functional characterization. The enrichment in transcripts of the transcription synthesis degradation continuum aligns with the definition of undifferentiated blast-type cells and with the basophilic staining obtained in MCDH for BBL cells, as immature blast cells are characterized by a basophilic cytoplasmic staining in humans. However, our results show that certain blast populations can produce AMPs, suggesting that these cells may also play a role in the production of humoral effectors. Ultimately, it remains unclear whether these circulating immature cells are indeed the stem cells from which all hemocytes originate.</p>
<p>In the animal kingdom, the innate immune system relies on specialized cells derived from pluripotent precursors through hematopoiesis. Transcription factors in particular have been found to exhibit a high degree of conservation throughout the animal kingdom, from invertebrates to vertebrates. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional differentiation of bivalves are only partially available or understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). Recent research has indicated the potential existence of hemocyte progenitors, also known as blast-like cells in several bivalve species. These include clams, mussels, scallops, marine mussels, freshwater mussels, oysters, pearl oysters, and wing shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>). However, various models for hematopoiesis in bivalves have been proposed and extensively debated without a clear consensus or definitive proof. Single-cell RNA sequencing and pseudotime analysis have enabled us to propose a refined model of hematopoiesis at an unprecedented level of detail. In this model, the different types of hemocytes are likely produced through four differentiation pathways that originate from a common progenitor. One pathway results in the formation of agranular hyalinocytes, while another independent pathway gives rise to the granular cells, including VC, ML, BGC, and SGC. Furthermore, two additional differentiation pathways have been identified that may lead to terminally differentiated blast-like cells. The differentiation of mature hemocytes involves the establishment of lineage-specific gene expression profiles, which rely on transcription factors to modulate the expression of their target genes. Our study identified a combination of transcription factors that are differentially expressed during <italic>C. gigas</italic> hematopoiesis and are specific to differentiation stages and cell lineages, including many well-known hematopoietic transcription factors such as GATA, PU-1, TAL1 and SOX factors, which are positioned in this model of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Nevertheless, we did not detect any canonical stem or progenitor cell populations in our dataset, underscoring the need for future investigations - potentially involving immunological challenges and lineage-tracing assays - to clarify whether proliferative cells circulate in the hemolymph or instead reside primarily in tissue compartments.</p>

<p>The comparison of hemocyte populations in <italic>C. hongkongensis</italic> and <italic>C. gigas</italic> highlights a shared reliance on granulocytes as primary immune effectors, with <italic>C. hongkongensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Our study emphasizes functional specialization in <italic>C. gigas</italic>, focusing on phagocytosis, oxidative stress responses, and vesicular trafficking, likely reflecting differences in transcriptomic and functional characterization methodologies. Moreover, the identification of conserved transcription factors such as Tal1, Sox, Runx and GATA in both datasets underscores the evolutionary conservation of hematopoiesis pathways across metazoans. While direct comparisons between scRNA-seq datasets are hindered by differing annotation frameworks, parallels can still be drawn with studies in other invertebrates. For example, shrimp and crayfish scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>) describe hemocytes with immune-activated states and integrin-related markers, respectively, while <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>)exhibits clusters with high ribosomal activity and transcription factors such as bHLH and myc. These findings highlight both the shared molecular foundations and species-specific differences that define hemocyte diversity and specialization.</p>
<p>This study significantly advances our understanding of bivalve immunity, especially in comparison to arthropods. By introducing a standardized reference hemocytogram for oysters using MCDH staining, defining cell type-specific markers and key transcription factors likely involved in cell fate determination, as well as clarifying the functions of different hemocytes, we have paved the way for future in-depth studies. Moreover, the identified clusters represent functionally and transcriptionally distinct cell populations under the conditions studied, yet they may reflect dynamic states rather than fixed subtypes, thereby acknowledging the potential for hemocyte populations to transition between states in response to environmental or physiological changes—even under homeostatic conditions. This will facilitate further studies of the oyster’s immune response to various biotic and abiotic stress at the cellular level. Improved comprehension of antiviral and antibacterial responses in bivalves, along with an enhanced understanding of immune priming and immune memory at the cellular level in bivalves, will benefit health and population management practices for sustainable aquaculture production. These findings will also contribute to the broader field of evolutionary immunology by enabling comparative studies and elucidating the diversification of immune cells and immunity-related genes in a protostome.</p>

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis was performed using the R programming language (version 4.2.1) (R Core Team, 2018) and the Seurat package (version 4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>). The data were then pre-processed to remove unwanted sources of variation and to normalize gene expression. Cells with small library sizes and a high proportion of mitochondrial genes were excluded. Data normalization was performed using the SCTransform method. After normalization, highly variable genes were identified using the FindVariableFeatures function and the top variable genes were selected for downstream analyses. Dimensionality reduction was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize the data. Cell clustering was performed using the ‘FindClusters’ function, using the previously identified significant principal components (dims = 6) and a resolution parameter (r = 0.1) to define cluster granularity. Differential expression analysis was performed using the ‘FindAllMarkers’ function (pct.min = 0.25) to identify genes differentially expressed between clusters, with statistical significance determined using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (RBGOA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).</p>

<title>KEGG pathway analysis</title>
<p>KEGG analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (NIAID/NIH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). Gene lists of specifically overexpressed genes in each cluster were obtained after scRNA-seq processing (genes with Log2FC &gt; 0.25 and significant p-value &lt; 0.001) and used for KEGG annotation. The <italic>C. gigas</italic> reference genome from the DAVID bioinformatics resource was used for this analysis, with thresholds of 2 for counts and 0.05 for EASE value (p-value). KEGG annotation results were post-processed and presented as a heatmap showing the KEGG pathway, fold enrichment, p-value significance and number of positive terms.</p>

<title>Rank-Based Gene Ontology Analysis</title>
<p>RBGOA first clusters GOs according to their representative genes to identify the most significant GOs, and then ranks the identified biological processes according to their average expression levels (over all representative genes). Finally, biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components significantly enriched in DEGs are identified by a Mann-Whitney rank test with a strict FDR correction. The files generated by the GO-MWU scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU">https://github.com/z0on/GO_MWU</ext-link>) were post-processed to extract the category names and the fraction indicating the number of “good candidates” relative to the total number of genes belonging to that category. The “good candidates” were the genes that exceeded an arbitrary ‘absValue’ cutoff (defined as 0.001) in their significance measure. The results were presented as a heatmap.</p>

<title>Percoll Density Gradient Separation of Hemocytes10.3390/cells13242106</title>
<p>A concentration series of Percoll (Cytiva, Sweden) diluted in Alsever modified medium was prepared as follows: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 % (vol/vol). Discontinuous density gradients (from 10 % Percoll with a density of 1.0647 to 70 % Percoll with d=1.1049) were made using 1.5 mL of each concentration and loaded with 1 mL of the hemocyte suspension corresponding to approximately 2.10<sup>7</sup> cells. Centrifugation was performed (30 min, 800 g, 4 °C) in a swinging bucket on a Beckman Coulter JS-13.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter, USA). Hemocytes concentrated at each density interface were collected separately with a 70 mm long 20Gx2.75” needle mounted on a 1 mL syringe. The hemocytes were then washed from the Percoll by adding 10 mL of ice-cold Alsever modified medium, pelleted by centrifugation (10 min, 200 g, 4°C) and resuspended in Alsever modified medium or filtered seawater.</p>

<title>Cytological description of the hemocyte populations</title>
<p>200,000 fresh hemocytes were seeded onto a slide using a Cytospin 4 centrifuge (Thermo Scientific, USA). The samples were then stained using the panoptic MCDH (Micro Chromatic Detection for Hematology) (Cellavision, Sweden) staining protocol. This protocol produces purple hues typical of Romanowsky-Giemsa staining results. After staining, the samples were observed using a LEICA DMR (Leica AG, Germany) transmitted light microscope with a 40x magnification objective. Each slide was imaged and the hemocytes were counted and characterized based on their morphology.</p>

<title>Real Time-quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, the Netherlands) and cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg total RNA using the Superscript IV kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA) with oligo(dT) primers. RT-PCR was performed on LightCycler© 480 thermocycler using the SYBR Green 1 Master kit (Roche, Switzerland). Primers were used at 200 nM. Primer sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>. Expression was normalized to <italic>Cg-rps6</italic> reference gene. The standard cycling conditions were 95°C pre-incubation for 3 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds, 60°C for 20 seconds, and 72°C for 25 seconds. Each pair of primers was first tested and validated on a total hemocyte RNA preparation to control melting curves and establish calibration lines.</p>

<title>Oxidative Burst Assay</title>
<p>The production of reactive oxygen species was quantified by luminescence assay. Briefly, hemocytes from hemolymph puncture or Percoll density gradient were washed once with filtered sterile water. 50 µL of hemocytes were plated in triplicate on a 96-well plate (3.10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm²). 50 µL of 40 mM luminol (Merck and Co, USA) was added to each well. After 45 minutes of incubation at room temperature, the oxidative burst was induced by adding 100 µL of zymosan (Merck and Co, USA) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50:1. The plate was immediately placed in a Berthold Centro XS3 LB 960 luminescence microplate reader (Berthold GmbH, Germany) to measure luminescence emission every 2 minutes for 2 hours.</p>

<title>Phagocytosis assay</title>
<p>400 µL of filtered, sterile water-washed hemocytes were seeded in a 24-well plate at a concentration of 3.10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm². After 15 minutes, 50 µL of zymosan was added to the fractions at an MOI of 20:1. For LMG20012<sup>T</sup> Vibrio, 50 µL of bacteria was added to a total hemolymph at an MOI of 5:1. After 1 hour of contact at room temperature, the cells were resuspended and 200 µL of the suspension was applied to a microscope slide using a Cytospin centrifuge. The slides were then stained with MCDH and observed under a LEICA DMR transmitted light microscope with a 40x magnification objective (Leica AG, Germany) to count phagocytic cells. A total of 2,807 cells were examined in three independent experiments.</p>

<title>NitroBlueTetrazolium (NBT) staining</title>
<p>ROS production was measured using NitroBlue Tetrazolium reduction after zymosan stimulation. Briefly, 1 mL (1.10<sup>6</sup> cells) of hemocyte solution was mixed with 50 µL of filtered NBT solution (15 mg/mL in water). Zymosan was added at a 4:1 MOI and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes on a rocking shaker. Then, 50 µL of each sample was plated onto glass coverslips and observed under a transmitted light microscope LEICA DMR with a 40x magnification objective (Leica AG, Germany) to count NBT-positive cells. The positions of positive NBT cells were recorded prior to MCDH staining to identify hemocyte types.</p>

<title>Rhodanine copper staining of hemocytes</title>
<p>The storage of copper by hemocytes was examined by Rhodanine staining. Briefly, 1.10<sup>5</sup> hemocytes were plated on Superfrost slides using a cytospin and circled with a hydrophobic pen to retain the staining solution. The Copper Stain Kit (SkyTek, USA) was used to stain the hemocytes. As described by the kit manufacturer, one drop of Rhodanine solution was added to 9 drops of acetate to form the working solution. Five drops were placed on the cytospin cells and a 5 mL Eppendorf tube with the cap removed was placed over the cells to prevent evaporation of the working solution. The slide and the balanced Eppendorf tube were placed in a beaker of boiling distilled water for 20 minutes. The slide was then washed with 5 drops of acetate and 3 drops of hematoxylin were placed on the slide for 1 minute at room temperature. The slides were then washed a final time with acetate and observed under a LEICA DMR transmitted light microscope with a 40x magnification objective (Leica AG, Germany) to count rhodanine-positive cells. The positions of rhodanine-positive cells were recorded prior to MCDH staining to identify hemocyte types.</p>

<title>Pseudotemporal ordering of cells with Monocle3</title>
<p>Cells from the <italic>C. gigas</italic> dataset were analyzed using Monocle3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3">https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle3</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). The Monocle3 analysis was performed on the Seurat object following the aforementioned processing steps. Clustering information (features, genes, partitions, clusters and UMAP coordinates) was transferred to a CDS object. The cell trajectory was calculated using the <italic>learn_graph</italic> function. The <italic>choose_graph_segments</italic> function was used to select three lineages. The gene expression along pseudotime data was extracted from the result. Then, the data were used to plot genes along pseudotime in three lineages using ggplot2 v3.4.4 R package and the heatmap was generated using the pheatmap v1.0.12 R package.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>To evaluate differences between samples, a statistical analysis was performed using (version 4.2.1) (R Core Team, 2018) and appropriate packages. All data were examined for normality, and statistical tests were selected accordingly. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for normally distributed data. Seven different hemolymph samples were used for cytological analysis. Oysters were provided by our local supplier and approximately 300 hemocytes were counted per sample. Seven independent experiments were performed for Percoll density gradient separation. A Tukey test was used to evaluate the statistical difference between the proportions of hemocyte types. The phagocytic capacity of hemocytes was tested in three independent experiments and statistical differences were evaluated using the Tukey test for both the phagocytic capacity between hemocyte types and the number of particles per phagocyte. Finally, oxidative burst capacity was tested 3 times on Percoll-separated hemocytes. The Tukey test was also used to assess statistical differences between conditions. The null hypothesis was rejected at a significance level of p = 0.05.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>In this manuscript, De La Forest Divonne et al. build a repertory of hemocytes from adult Pacific oysters combining scRNAseq data with cytologic and biochemical analyses. Three categories of hemocytes were described previously in this species (i.e. blast, hyalinocyte and granulocytes). Based on scRNAseq data, the authors identified 7 hemocyte clusters presenting distinct transcriptional signatures. Using Kegg pathway enrichment and RBGOA, the authors determined the main molecular features of the clusters. In parallel, using cytologic markers, the authors classified 7 populations of hemocytes (i.e. ML, H, BBL, ABL, SGC, BGC, and VC) presenting distinct sizes, nucleus sizes, acidophilic/basophilic, presence of pseudopods, cytoplasm/nucleus ratio and presence of granules. Then, the authors compared the phenotypic features with potential transcriptional signatures seen in the scRNAseq. The hemocytes were separated in a density gradient to enrich for specific subpopulations. The cell composition of each cell fraction was determined using cytologic markers and the cell fractions were analysed by quantitative PCR targeting major cluster markers (two per cluster). With this approach, the authors could assign cluster 7 to VC, cluster 2 to H, and cluster 3 to SGC. The other clusters did not show a clear association with this experimental approach. Using phagocytic assays, ROS, and copper monitoring, the authors showed that ML and SGC are phagocytic, ML produces ROS, and SGC and BGC accumulate copper. Then with the density gradient/qPCR approach, the authors identified the populations expressing anti-microbial peptides (ABL, BBL, and H). At last, the authors used Monocle to predict differentiation trajectories for each subgroup of hemocytes using cluster 4 as the progenitor subpopulation.</p>
<p>The manuscript provides a comprehensive characterisation of the diversity of circulating immune cells found in Pacific oysters.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>The combination of scRNAseq, cytologic markers and gradient based hemocyte sorting offers an integrative view of the immune cell diversity.</p>
<p>
Hemocytes represent a very plastic cell population that has key roles in homeostatic and challenged conditions. Grasping the molecular features of these cells at the single-cell level will help understand their biology.</p>
<p>
This type of study may help elucidate the diversification of immune cells in comparative studies and evolutionary immunology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>Several figures show inconsistency leading to erroneous conclusions and some conclusions are poorly supported. Moreover, the manuscript remains highly descriptive with limited comparison with the available literature.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>Major comments</p>
<p>(1) Line 201: The threshold of 0.25 was maintained to select enriched genes, which minimize the value of the GO term enrichment analyses. It may notably explain why the term phagosome is enriched in cluster 7, while experimental data indicate that cluster 7 is not phagocytic. In addition, the authors mentioned in the 1st response to reviewer that they would include DotPlot to illustrate the specificity of the genes corresponding to the main GO terms. This should notably include the ribosomal genes found enriched in cluster 4, which constitute the basis used by the authors to call cluster 4 the progenitor cluster.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding our chosen log2FC threshold (0.25) for GO term enrichment. To assess the robustness of our approach, we tested more stringent thresholds (e.g., 0.5) and verified that our overall interpretations remain consistent. However, we acknowledge that certain GO terms, such as phagosome, may appear in clusters that are not primarily phagocytic. This is likely due to the fact that genes involved in vesicle trafficking, endo-lysosomal compartments and intracellular degradation processes overlap with those classically associated with phagocytosis.</p>
<p>Therefore, the KEGG-based enrichment of phagosome in cluster 7 does not necessarily imply active phagocytosis but could instead reflect these alternative vesicular processes. As we show, cluster 7 correspond to vesicular cells, and as seen in cytology we named these cells after their very high content of vesicular structures. As functional annotation based solely on transcriptomic data can sometimes lead to overinterpretations, we emphasize the importance of biological validation, which we have partially addressed through functional assays in this study.</p>
<p>Regarding the specificity of ribosomal gene expression in cluster 4, we analyzed the distribution of ribosomal genes expressed across all clusters, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1-J. This analysis demonstrates that cluster 4 is specifically enriched in ribosome-related genes, reinforcing its characterization as a transcriptionally active population. Given that ribosomal gene expression is a key feature often associated with proliferative or metabolically active cells, these findings support our initial interpretation that cluster 4 may represent an undifferentiated or progenitor-like population.</p>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s suggestion to include a DotPlot to further illustrate the specificity of these genes in cluster 4. However, we believe that Supplementary Figure S1-J already effectively demonstrates this enrichment by presenting the percentage of ribosomal genes per cluster. A DotPlot representation would primarily convey the same information in a different format, but without providing additional insight into the specificity of ribosomal gene expression within cluster 4.</p>

<p>(2) The lineage analysis is highly speculative and based on weak evidences. Initiating the hemocyte lineage to C4 is based on rRNA expression levels. C6 would constitute a better candidate, notably with the expression of PU-1, ELF2 and GATA3 that regulate progenitors differentiation in mammals (doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00228, doi:10.1128/microbiolspec.mchd-0024-2, doi: 10.1098/rsob.180152) while C4 do not display any specific transcription factors (Figure 7I). In addition, the representation and interpretation of the transcriptome dynamics in the different lineages are erroneous. There are major inconsistencies between the data shown in the heatmaps Fig7C-H, Fig S10 and the dotplot in Fig7I. For example, Gata3 (G31054) and CgTFEB (G30997) illustrate the inconsistency. Fig S10C show GATA3 going down from cluster 4 to cluster 6 while Fig 7I show an increase level of expression in 6 compared to 4. CgTFEB (G30997) decrease from C4 to VC in Fig 7F while it increases according to Fig 7I. At last, Figure 7D: the umap show transition from C4 to C5 while the heatmap mention C4 to C6 (I believe there is a mix up with Figure 7E.</p>

<p>We sincerely apologize for the inconsistencies noted between the different panels of Figure 7. These discrepancies resulted from using an incorrect matrix dataset during the initial representation. To address this issue, we have fully reprocessed the data and now provide a corrected and improved depiction of gene expression dynamics along the pseudotime trajectory. We are grateful to the reviewer for having help us to correct theses mistakes.</p>
<p>In the revised version, we offer a comprehensive and consistent representation of expression level variations for key genes identified by the Monocle3 algorithm. Supplementary Figure S10 now presents the average expression variation of these significant genes as a function of pseudotime. Based on this dataset, we carefully selected representative genes to construct panels C to H of Figure 7, ensuring coherence across all figures. These updated panels show both average expression levels and the percentage of expressing cells along the pseudotime trajectory, providing a clearer interpretation of transcriptomic dynamics.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s helpful feedback regarding our lineage analysis and the suggestion that cluster 6 might be a more appropriate progenitor based on the expression of mammalian-like transcription factors such as PU-1, ELF2, and GATA3. Below, we clarify our rationale for choosing cluster 4 as the root of the pseudotime and discuss the functional implications of the identified transcription factors.</p>
<p>We can hypothesize that clusters 4, 5, or 6 could each potentially represent early progenitor-like states, as these three clusters are transcriptionally close (Lines 539-541). These clusters have not yet been conclusively identified in terms of classical hemocyte morphology, and they appear to arise from ABL- or BBL-type cells. Our decision to root the pseudotime at cluster 4 was motivated by its strong expression of core transcription and translation genes, suggesting a particular stage of translation activity that was not observed for cluster 5 or cluster 6. Cluster 5 and 6 may correspond to a similar population of cells, most probably Blast-Like cells at different stages of cell cycle or differentiation engagement.</p>
<p>Although cluster 6 expresses PU-1, ELF2, and GATA3, which are known regulators of haematopoietic progenitor differentiation in vertebrates, it is essential to highlight that structural homology does not necessarily imply functional equivalence. Moreover, the expression of PU-1, ELF2, and GATA3 does not strictly characterize a population as “undifferentiated” or progenitor-like. Studies such as those by Buenrostro et al. (Cell, 2018) have demonstrated that these transcription factors can remain active in or reemerge during more lineage-committed stages. For instance, PU-1 is essential for myeloid and B-cell differentiation, GATA3 is involved in T-lymphocyte lineage commitment (though transiently expressed in early progenitors), and ELF2 participates in lineage-specific pathways. Thus, their presence does not imply a primitive state but rather highlights their broader functional roles in guiding and refining lineage decisions. Functional annotation of these transcription factors in invertebrate systems remains speculative, particularly as morphological or molecular markers specific to these early hemocyte lineages are not yet fully established. Further functional assays (e.g., knockdown/overexpression or lineage tracing using cells (ABL and BBL) from clusters 4, 5 and 6) will be necessary to determine which hemocyte population harbor progenitor properties and differentiation potential.</p>
<p>To further address the reviewer’s concern, we performed complementary pseudotime analyses by initiating Monocle 3 trajectories from clusters 4, 5, and 6 individually, as well as collectively (4/5/6). These analyses (see attached figure) confirm that the overall differentiation topology remains unchanged regardless of the selected root, consistently revealing two main pathways: one leading to hyalinocytes and the other to the granular lineage (ML, SGC, and VC). This consistency strongly suggests that clusters 4, 5, and 6 represent related pools of progenitor-like cells. Therefore, choosing cluster 4 based on its transcription/translation readiness does not alter the inferred branching architecture of hemocyte differentiation.</p>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions, which have helped us improve our manuscript and clarify our rationale.</p>

<p>(3) Concerning the AMP expression analysis in Figure 6: the qPCR data show that Cg-BPI and Cg-Defh are expressed broadly in all fractions including 6 and 7, which is in conflict with the statement Line 473 indicating that SGC (fractions 6 and 7) is not expressing AMP. In addition, this analysis should be combined with the expression profile of all AMP in the scRNAseq data (list available in 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.02.040).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We acknowledge that the qPCR data show expression of Cg-BPI and Cg-Defh across all fractions, including fractions 6 and 7 corresponding to SGC. However, our conclusion that SGCs do not express antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was based on a correlation analysis rather than direct detection of AMPs in granular cells. Specifically, the qPCR experiments were designed to measure AMP expression levels in fractionated hemocyte populations relative to a control sample of whole hemolymph. We then performed a correlation analysis between AMP expression levels and the proportion of each hemocyte type in the fractions. This approach allowed us to infer a lower expression of AMP in granular cells, as reflected in the heatmap presented in Figure 6.</p>
<p>Regarding the suggestion to integrate AMP expression profiles from scRNA-seq data, we wrote that the limited sequencing depth of our scRNA-seq analysis was insufficient to accurately detect AMP expression (Ligne 472-473 → “However, due to the limited sequencing depth, the scRNA-seq analysis was not sensitive enough to reveal AMP expression.”.  Additionally, many of the known AMPs of <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> are not annotated in the genome, further complicating their identification within the scRNA-seq dataset. As a result, we were unable to perform the requested integration of AMP expression profiles from scRNA-seq data.</p>

<p>(4) The transcription factor expression analysis is descriptive and the interpretation too partial. These data should be compared with other systems. Most transcription factors show functional conservation, notably in the inflammatory pathways, which can provide valuable information to understand the function of the clusters 5 and 6 for which limited data are available.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to compare the identified transcription factors with other systems. However, since we did not perform a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the transcription factors identified in our dataset, we refrain from making assumptions about their functional conservation across species. Our analysis aims to provide a descriptive overview of transcription factor expression patterns in hemocyte clusters, which serves as a foundation for future functional studies. While transcription factor profiles may provide insights into the potential roles of clusters 5 and 6, assigning precise functions based solely on bioinformatic predictions remains speculative. Further experimental validation, including functional assays and evolutionary analyses, would be necessary to confirm the roles of these transcription factors, which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p>

<p>Line 611: it would be nice to display the enrichment of the phagocytic receptor in cluster 3 (dotplot or feature plot) to illustrate the comment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful suggestion regarding a more comprehensive analysis of phagocytic receptors. While a full inventory is beyond the scope of this study, we acknowledge the value of such an approach and hope that our findings will serve as a foundation for future investigations in this direction.</p>
<p>Although we have highlighted certain phagocytic receptors (e.g., a scavenger receptor domain-containing gene) in our scRNA-seq dataset, it is beyond the scope of the current study to inventory all phagocytosisrelated receptors in the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome, which itself would be a substantial undertaking. Moreover, singlecell RNA sequencing captures only about 15–20% of each cell’s mRNA, so we inherently lose a significant portion of the transcriptome, further limiting our ability to pinpoint all relevant phagocytic receptor genes. Adding more figures to cover every candidate receptor would risk overloading this paper, thus we focus on the most prominent examples. A promising approach for more exhaustive analysis would involve efficiently isolating granulocytes (e.g., via Percoll gradient) and performing targeted RNA-seq on this cell population to thoroughly explore genes involved in phagocytosis.</p>

<p>Line 640-644: the authors mentioned that ML may be able to perform ETosis based on the oxidative burst.</p>
<p>This hypothesis requires further evidences. Are other markers of ETosis expressed in this cell type?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that additional experimental evidence (e.g., detection of histone citrullination, extracellular DNA networks) is necessary to confirm ETosis in molluscan immune cells. We present ML-mediated ETosis only as a speculative possibility based on oxidative burst capacity as it was shown in different pieces of work that ETosis is inhibited by NADPH inhibitors (Poirier et al. 2014). Nevertheless, the expression of histones in the macrophage-like cluster (cluster 1) reinforces this possibility, as histone modifications play a key role in chromatin decondensation during ETosis.</p>
