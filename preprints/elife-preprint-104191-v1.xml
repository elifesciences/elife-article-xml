<title>Abstract</title><p>Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein, that is induced in a large number of solid tumours. A single cysteine at position 328 in vimentin plays a crucial role in assembly, organisation and stability of IFs. However, its exact function during epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer progression has not been investigated. To investigate this, we have transduced wildtype (WT) and C328S vimentin separately in MCF-7 cells that lack endogenous vimentin. The expression of C328-VIM impacted vimentin-actin interactions and induced EMT-like features that include enhanced cell proliferation, migration, invasion accompanied by reduced cell adhesion when compared to the wildtype cells. Functional transcriptomic studies confirmed the upregulation of EMT and mesenchymal markers, downregulation of epithelial markers as well as acquisition of signatures associated with cancer stemness (<italic>CD56, Oct4, PROCR and CD49f</italic>) thus transforming MCF-7 cells from oestrogen positive to triple reduced (<italic>ESR1, PGR, and HER2</italic>) status. We also observed a stark increase in the expression of long non-coding RNA, <italic>XIST</italic> in MCF-7 cells expressing C328-VIM. Targeting the mutant vimentin or <italic>XIST</italic> by RNA interference partially reversed the phenotypes in C328-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, introduction of C328-VIM cells into nude mice promoted tumour growth by increasing cancer stemness in an oestrogen independent manner. Altogether, our studies provide insight into how cysteine 328 in vimentin dictates mechano-transduction signals to remodel actin cytoskeleton and protect against EMT and cancer growth via modulating lncRNA <italic>XIST</italic>. Therefore, targeting vimentin and/or <italic>XIST</italic> via RNA interference should be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein normally expressed in mesenchymal cells. Due to its diverse pathophysiological role(s), it is one of the most extensively studied IFs. It has been proposed to play a role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. It is a structurally dynamic protein active in cell mechanics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], normal positioning of cell organelles, nuclear and DNA integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>], stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], cell proliferation, migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], adhesion, invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>], signalling, angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>] and immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>]. The complete crystal structure of vimentin is still not available; however, crystal structures of small segments have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. Structurally, vimentin monomer has a central α-helical rod domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains on each side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]. Studies have described its polymerisation in which monomers assemble in parallel to form dimers, with two dimers assembling in antiparallel to form tetramers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Eight tetramers combine to form unit length filaments (ULFs) that further assemble head to tail into 10 nm compact mature filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. IFs lack polarity and in mature filaments subunits continue to assemble at both ends and they can be exchanged anywhere along the whole filament length, a process that requires ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. Vimentin directly interacts with actin through its tail domain to maintain mechanical integrity of cell and cytoskeletal crosstalk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>].</p>
<p>Vimentin has a single cysteine residue at position 328 in the rod domain, which is reported to be a stress sensor induced by oxidants and electrophiles, resulting in its zinc mediated modifications and consequently disassembly or rearrangement of filaments as a stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Different modifications of C328 that have been reported during cellular senescence, rheumatoid arthritis, cataract and atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Any mutation or modification in C328 can hamper the intracellular stress response of vimentin. As a result, multiple cellular functions can be disrupted due to inability of the cell to sense and respond to stress. Therefore, this residue has been reported to have a widespread pathophysiological implications and is considered a flash point for stress ignition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. Although the role of vimenetin C328 in response to cellular stress has been studied in some detail, its role in regulating EMT, tumour growth and progression has not been studied.</p>
<p>To investigate the functional implications of vimentin residue C328 in regulating EMT, cancer progression and stemness, we expressed C328S vimentin in MCF-7 cells, a vimentin deficient cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>] commonly employed to study EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Our findings reveal that C328S-VIM altered cell morphology with disorganized F-actin and induced EMT and cancer stem cell characeristics. A highly significant observation was the upregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), <italic>XIST,</italic> in C328S-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells, which are normally oestrogen-dependent for tumorogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], became oestrogen-independent by C328S-VIM in nude mice. We show that C328S-VIM can trigger an EMT program and enhance stemness in MCF-7 cells, in part via <italic>XIST</italic> upregulation. These findings have far reaching implications, particularly considering the numerous vimentin variants reported in the vicinity of C328 residue in several solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>].</p>

<p>MCF-7, A431, HFF cells were obtained from the cell bank of Cancer Research UK and characterised by the expression of key biomarkers using immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription (RT)/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). They were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), containing 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS), 50 units/mL penicillin and 50μg/mL streptomycin (complete medium) and maintained in the incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> + 95% air at 37°C.</p>

<title>In silico analysis</title>
<p>Using PyMOL, an in-silico analysis was conducted on wild type and mutant vimentin to assess their interactions with wildtype actin. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) file for the wildtype vimentin (PdB id: P08670) was acquired from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org">www.rcsb.org</ext-link>, and the mutation (C328S) was introduced by subsequent energy minimisation steps. Results from these structural simulations indicated that the conversion of cysteine to serine at 328 affected the interaction of vimentin with actin, implying a possibility of local conformational change in the mutant protein that may form the basis of its altered functional behaviour as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.</p>

<title>Transplantation assay</title>
<p>All transplantation experiments were carried out at Augusta University under Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocol number 2015-0736, in animal biosafety level 2 (ABSL2) conditions. Stably transduced MCF-7 cells (MCF-7CV, MCF-7WT, MCF-7C328S, MCF-7Y117L and MCF-7DMT) were cultured under standard growth conditions as outlined earlier, until they reached 80% confluence. Cells were trypsinized, counted, and resuspended in complete growth medium at a density of 1x10<sup>7</sup> cells per ml. Subsequently, cells were transplanted subcutaneously and bilaterally into the flanks of 6-week-old female athymic nu/nu mice (2.5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/0.25ml), 2 mice per cell line. Mice were monitored daily for general health and tumour formation. Once tumors became evident, caliper measurements were made weekly until the experimental endpoint. Tumour volume was determined for all groups using the formula: V = (W<sup>2</sup> × L)/2, where V is the tumour volume, W is the tumour width and L is the tumour length. Mice were euthanized by CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation followed by bilateral thoracotomy. Tumours were excised, fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, sectioned at 5μm, stained with haematoxylin and eosin, and imaged using a Keyence BZ-X700 microscope.</p>

<p>For the detection of stem cell markers in mouse tumors, 5 μm tissue sections were dewaxed in Safe-Clear (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), rehydrated, and antigen retrieval was performed by incubation in Retrievagen A (BD Biosciences, CA) at 95°C for 30 min. After cooling to ambient temperature, endogenous peroxidase was blocked by incubation in 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 15 min, slides were washed in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) pH8.0, and blocked in normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Sections were then incubated with anti-CD56 or anti-CD201 antibodies listed in <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref> or the equivalent concentration of normal rabbit or normal goat IgG as control, at 4°C for 16h.

<title>C328S mutant vimentin affects interaction with actin <italic>in silico</italic> and F-actin formation in cells</title>
<p>We selected MCF-7, a simple epithelial breast carcinoma cell line, which lacks endogenous vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], and transduced it with the full-length vimentin (wildtype, WT-VIM/pLPChygro-VIM) and the mutant vimentin (mutant, C328S-VIM/pLPChygro-C328S-VIM) retroviruses (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The expression of WT-VIM and C328S-VIM in MCF-7 cells was confirmed by qPCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that C328S mutant vimentin was able to form filaments, A431 cells which are devoid of endogenous vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>], were transduced with C328S-VIM. The immunostaining with mouse anti-vimentin V9 (referred as V9 from now on) followed by AF-488-labelled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody showed normal appearing polymerised IFs in A431 cells (<xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2A</xref>, compare a-c with d-f). This shows that C328S-VIM retains its ability to polymerise into filament both in A431 and MCF-7 cells, however in MCF-7 these filaments were drastically reorganised affecting the cell shape (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, to confirm that C328S-VIM does not disrupt pre-existing vimentin filaments (dominant negative), we transduced HFF-1 and MCF-7 cells expressing WT vimentin with either untagged C328S-VIM (<xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2B, g-l</xref>) or AcGFP fused with C328S-VIM at its N-terminus (AcGFP-C328S-VIM) (<xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S2C, m-r</xref>). Cells were immunostained with V9 antibody. Our data showed that both untagged and AcGFP-C328S-VIM constructs were not dominant negative as they did not disturb the pre-existing filaments and appear to integrate into the pre-existing network. However, the limitation of using the V9 antibody was that it detected both endogenous vimentin and C328S-VIM constructs.</p>
<p>Next, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis was performed on both the WT and mutant vimentin to evaluate their interactions with endogenous actin. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) file for the WT vimentin (PdB id: P08670) was acquired from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org">www.rcsb.org</ext-link>, and the mutation (C328S) was introduced through subsequent energy minimisation steps. The results of these structural simulations indicated that the substitution of cysteine with serine at position 328 influenced the interaction between vimentin and actin, suggesting the potential for local conformational changes in the mutant protein as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>. To test this we investigated C328S mutation mediated structural changes in the cytoskeleton by staining these cells with Phalloidin that selectively labels F-actin. Quantification of stress fiber formation/F-actin staining pattern as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] confirmed that actin morphology and organisation was altered with low level F-actin/stress fibre staining with aggregates/fragments at the cortical margins of the cells, no stress fibres were observed in the centres of the cells in C328S-VIM expressing cells compared with high level F-actin/stress fibre staining in WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1F-G</xref> and <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S3</xref>). These data show that C328S-VIM when expressed in MCF-7 cells alters cell morphology through remodelling of actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>C328S-VIM impacts cell adhesion, proliferation, migration by altering MCF-7 cell morphology</title>
<p>To compare the effect of C328S-VIM on the MCF-7 cell morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), cells were fixed and stained with CellMask<sup>TM</sup> Deep Red dye and counterstained nuclei with DAPI (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Different cell morphological features, such as nuclear perimeter, cell diameter, nucleus/cell area, cell major axis, cell major axis angle, and cell minor axis, were analysed. C328S-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells showed more cellular projections when compared to WT and analysis of nuclear area, nuclear form factor, nuclear major axis, nuclear minor axis, cell area, cell diameter, cell perimeter, cell minor axis, cell major axis, and cell form factor were significantly (p&lt;0.05) increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), while the nucleus/cell area ratio and cell compactness were significantly decreased in cells expressing C328S-VIM in comparison to WT-VIM expressing cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). These results indicate that expression of C328S-VIM significantly altered nuclear and cell perimeter as evident by more ruffled margins in MCF-7 cells. Next, we investigated the rate of proliferation between WT and C328S cells by colony formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, F</xref>), MTT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>) and CyQUANT proliferation assays (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). The analyses showed a highly significant increase in cell proliferation and mitochondrial activity in C328S as compared to WT cells. Furthermore, C328S-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells showed reduced adhesion without substrate coating on the culture vessel as determined by CyQUANT cell adhesion assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). However, when the tissue culture plates were coated with different substrates such as laminin, fibronectin and collagen, there was no significant difference in cell adhesion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). The chemotactic migration of the cells towards FCS through 8µm pore size culture inserts showed the number of cells migrating through the membrane was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in C328S compared with the WT cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K, L</xref>). Similarly, the invasive capacity of the two cell lines was compared by coating the 8µm pore size culture inserts with Matrigel. The results indicated a significantly higher number of cells invading through Matrigel in C328S-VIM (p&lt;0.05) compared with the WT-VIM (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M, N</xref>).</p>

<title>Upregulation of EMT and cancer stemness related signatures by C328S-VIM in MCF-7</title>
<p>As C328S-VIM significantly increased the proliferation of MCF-7, reduced their adhesion capacity and increased migration and invasion towards FCS, we investigated the transcriptome profile of C328S-VIM vs WT-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells using RNA-Seq in order to understand the underlying mechanism for the changes observed. The analysis showed that a total 3421 out of 22645 genes were significantly upregulated whereas 3940 genes were downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Functional gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that the significantly downregulated genes are involved in cell-cell adhesion, DNA packaging complex and keratinocyte differentiation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). The most upregulated cellular function was pattern specific processes, regionalisation and related to development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The most upregulated gene was <italic>XIST</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), a long noncoding oncogenic RNA (lncRNA) that is implicated in a large number of tumours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. The RNA-Seq data was validated using RT-qPCR and the regression analysis between two data sets showed significant Pearson correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77, p=0.003, Pearson r=0.88; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). The upregulated and downregulated DEGs are listed in <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S4 and Table S5</xref>, respectively. <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S6 and Table S7</xref> lists, respectively, the upregulated and downregulated lncRNAs. The widespread downregulation of keratin gene expression shown by RNA-Seq and qPCR was corroborated by immunostaining of K8 and K18 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>) and western blotting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). The quantification of the relative band intensity showed significant downregulation in K8, K18, K19 and upregulation of TWIST1 and CDH2/N-cadherin in C328S-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells compared with the WT-VIM expressing cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>
<p>The most upregulated and downregulated cellular functions in GO analyses are listed in <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S4 and S5</xref>, respectively. The KEGG pathway analysis is shown in <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S6</xref>. The RNA-Seq analysis shows that multiple epithelial markers were downregulated, and mesenchymal markers were upregulated among DEGs indicating acquisition of EMT-like characteristics by C328S cells (<xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S7</xref>). Taken together, the data from RNA-Seq experiments begin to provide a mechanistic explanation for the structural and functional properties that we found to be associated with the C328S mutation in vimentin.</p>
<p>The RNA-Seq data showed upregulation of EMT transcription factors including <italic>ZEB1, ZEB2, TWIST 1, TWIST 2, ETS1, LEF1, SNAI2</italic>, and <italic>FOXC2</italic>, although <italic>SNAI1</italic> was downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). The upregulated differentially expressed breast cancer stem cells markers included <italic>CD56/ NCAM1, OCT4, PROCR/CD201, ITGA6</italic>, and the downregulated were <italic>ESR1, PGR, HER2/ERBB2, ABCG2, CD44, CD24, EPCAM</italic> and <italic>CDH1</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Out of these presence or absence of three of them <italic>ESR1</italic> (estrogen receptor), <italic>PGR</italic> (progesterone receptor) and <italic>HER2/ERBB2</italic> (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/HER2) makes a breast cancer triple positive or triple negative. Our results show that MCF-7 which are triple positive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>] became triple reduced by the expression of C328S-VIM. Collectively these results imply that C328S-VIM in MCF-7 induces EMT-like characteristics and increases cancer stemness.</p>
<p>To confirm the expression of breast cancer stem cell markers identified as being differentially expressed in RNA-Seq analysis, FACS analysis was performed. Cells were stained for surface antigens with RY586–conjugated antibody specific for CD56/NCAM1, APC-conjugated antibody specific for CD201/PROCR and the viability stain FVS575V was used for detecting the live cells. Gates were applied for cells (SSC-A:FSC-A), single cells (SSC-W: FSC-A) and live cells (FVS575V::L/d:FSC-A) for WT and C328S cells (<xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S8</xref>). Data analysis using <italic>FlowJo v10</italic> confirmed significant upregulation of breast cancer stem cell markers CD56/NCAM1 and CD201/PROCR in C328S-VIM expressing MCF-7 cells. MFI of CD56 and CD201 in C328S-VIM cells was significantly higher (p&lt;0.0001) compared with WT-VIM cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L, M, N</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, to examine tumorigenic potential <italic>in vivo</italic>, we injected WT and C328S cells subcutaneously and bilaterally into the flanks of 6-week-old female athymic nu/nu mice. C328S cells were able to produce tumours without oestrogen however WT cells did not produce any tumour (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3O, P</xref>). These results confirm the tumorigenic potential of C328S-VIM that is oestrogen independent. Furthermore to investigate breast cancer stem cell markers expression, routine H &amp; E (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3R</xref>) was performed on the tumour tissue sections for CD56 and CD201 expression, respectively. Normal mouse IgG was used as staining control. Tumour sections from C328S injected mice showed significantly higher IOD for CD56 (p&lt;0.001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3S</xref>) and CD201 (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3T</xref>) as compared with IgG control. These results confirmed our <italic>in-vitro</italic> transcriptome and FACS analyses data.</p>
<p>To establish the specificity of tumour production by C328S-VIM we created another single substitution, Y117L, at the beginning of the rod domain and a double substitution containing C328S and Y117L in the same vimentin molecule. Y117L substitution has been reported to assembles into ULFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>] and does not form long filaments. Interestingly transplantation of MCF-7Y117L-VIM did not induce tumour formation in nude mice whereas MCF-7DMT-VIM did produce tumours. <bold>(Figure S8)</bold>. These experiments suggest that tumour progession by C328S was specific and in DMT it was dominant over Y117L.</p>

Morphological analysis of MCF-7C328S-shVIM cells showed that several features (not all, see <xref rid="d1e1381" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S10</xref>) including changes in cell area (p&lt;0.01), nuclear/cell area (p&lt;0.01), cell diameter (p&lt;0.01), cell perimeter (p&lt;0.01), cell major axis (p&lt;0.05) and cell minor axis (p&lt;0.05) were significantly reversed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4O</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Vimentin is a key player in several pathophysiological processes such as cell migration, proliferation, adhesion, stress response, EMT and cancer metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. It has a single cysteine residue at position 328 that is considered a preferred site for posttranslational modifications, and it is currently being intensely investigated due to its involvement in multiple cell functions, including filament assembly, cell polarity, elongation, and stress response to electrophiles and oxidants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. In spite of its likely importance in cellular physiology, the role of C328 in cancer progression and in determining the cancer stem cell phenotype has not been investigated before.</p>
<p>To investigate the significance of C328 in EMT and cancer, we made a mutant encoding a C328S substitution in vimentin (C328S-VIM) and transduced in MCF-7 cells, which are devoid of endogenous vimentin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], and are widely used as a model to study EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Structurally, the two amino acids, cysteine and serine, are similar except an electronegative sulphur atom (atomic radius 0.88 A°) in cysteine was replaced by another electronegative oxygen atom (atomic radius 0.48 A°) in serine. Although both atoms are electronegative, oxygen is slightly more electronegative (EN=3.44) than sulphur (EN=2.58). These seemingly minor differences were unlikely to cause major structural perturbations, so we were surprised when <italic>in silico</italic> simulations demonstrated that C328S substitution was likely to affect interactions between actin and vimentin. These computational predictions were confirmed by our immunofluorescence analyses of F-actin in C328S cells. Whereas WT vimentin-expressing cells showed normal stress fibres with no fragments or aggregates, in contrast C328S-VIM cells expressed aggregated and fragmented F-actin which was limited to the cortical margins of the cells with no stress fibre formation. These observations highlight the critical interactions of the rod domain of vimentin at C328 with actin that has never been reported, although earlier studies have demonstrated direct binding of the tail domain of vimentin with actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. It has recently been reported that C328 of vimentin modifies actin organisation in response to oxidants and electrophiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. Our data support these findings and suggest that a local perturbation at C328 (in this case by C328S substitution) can disrupt actin organisation even when cells are not exposed to oxidants and electrophiles. These observations have widespread implications including cytoskeletal crosstalk that regulates cell behaviour especially during cancer development, progression and spread.</p>
<p>Our data show that the C328S mutation in vimentin can change the overall morphology of MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Earlier studies have implicated vimentin filaments in the maintenance of cell shape and increasing vimentin levels are positively related to a mesenchymal elongated phenotype and EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. In contrast, we have recently shown that ectopic expression of the wildtype vimentin in MCF-7 can make them less elongated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. A possible explanation for these conflicting reports may be that cancer cells can express a wide spectrum of morphologies depending upon inducing factor and stage of EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. As the C328S substitution in vimentin has increased the nuclear size and made the MCF-7 cells more rounded compared to WT vimentin, it is possible that the C328 residue may be an active player in vimentin-linked cell phenotypic changes since downregulation of the mutant vimentin significantly reversed the morphological changes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>We have previously shown that expression of WT vimentin in MCF-7 induces cell migration without affecting proliferation or cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Here we show that C328S-VIM enhances cell proliferation, migration, invasion and reduces cell adhesion, which are features closely associated with EMT mediated cancer metastasis. Some of these changes could be reversed by RNAi mediated downregulation of vimentin establishing a direct link between residue 328 of vimentin, or perhaps the surrounding region, in cancer progression, which is a novel finding. The increase in malignant characteristics of C328S cells imply that the original cysteine residue in vimentin acts as tumour suppressor. In addition, our RNA-Seq, RT-qPCR and western blot analyses showed upregulation of EMT-associated transcription factors (ZEB1, SNAI2, LEF1, ZEB2, TWIST1, TWIST2) and mesenchymal markers (CDH2, MMP2, FOXC2, FNDC1), as well as downregulation of epithelial markers (cytokeratins, CDH1, CLDN1, EPCAM), indicating possible EMT induction in C328S cells. There are 3 major keratins including K8 (type II), K18 and K19 (both type I) that are expressed in MCF-7 and since all of them were downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), a central mechanism involved in the expression of all the three keratins is likely to be affected by C328-VIM. One such mechanism is the involvement of transcription factor AP-1, which participates in the regulation of most keratin genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. AP-1 is a complex of multiple different subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] but our transcriptomic analysis suggests that none of these are affected by C328S-VIM (DEGs lists provided in supplementary material). It is therefore conceivable that C328S-VIM could suppress AP-1 activity, thereby switching off keratin gene expression. Further investigations are required to test this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Multiple breast cancer stem cell markers such as <italic>OCT4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], <italic>CD56</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], <italic>CD49f</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>], and <italic>CD201/PROCR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>] were also upregulated by C328-VIM, demonstrating increased stemness characteristics in MCF-7 cells as judged by the RNA-Seq analysis. Higher expression of the two stem cell markers, CD56 and CD201, was further validated by flow cytometry, and also observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. RNA-Seq analysis also showed that MCF-7, which is a triple positive (expression of ESR1, PGR and HER2) cell line, became triple reduced in the presence of the C328S-VIM. Breast oncologists broadly stratify breast cancers into triple positive, borderline and triple negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] which is indicative of their susceptibility to metastasise and their clinical course. Triple positive breast cancers have a relatively good prognosis, followed by borderline and triple negative lesions have by far the worst prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. We have previously shown that wildtype vimentin does not affect expression of these receptors in MCF-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. In the present study, however, C328S-VIM makes MCF-7, a triple positive cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>], into triple reduced which has important clinical implications. It also suggests that a mechanism exists whereby disruption of molecular interactions between vimentin and actin caused by C328S, directly or indirectly, regulates expression of these receptors, cancer progression and metastasis.</p>
<p>The gene most upregulated by the C328S vimentin, as found in the RNA-Seq analysis, which is a long noncoding RNA <italic>XIST</italic> is known to induce proliferation, invasion and inhibit apoptosis in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. It is also reported to be upregulated in multiple solid tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. It therefore appears, based on our observations, that vimentin C328S mutation is inducing EMT-like changes via <italic>XIST</italic> upregulation, as downregulation of <italic>XIST</italic> in C328S cells, significantly reduced proliferation and invasion.</p>
<p>A highly significant and interesting observation was that presence of C328S-VIM in MCF-7, which are oestrogen-dependent tumorigenic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], made these cells oestrogen-independent in nude mice that further supports our <italic>in-vitro</italic> data that C328S substitution had enhanced cancer stemness in MCF-7 cells. Expression of breast cancer stem cell markers CD56 and CD201 was evident in mouse tumours. These data suggest that the C328 in vimentin is an important regulator of cancer cell behaviour and that alterations in this region of the protein promotes EMT-like changes and may induce metastasis.</p>
<p>Recently, wildtype vimentin has been shown to increase malignant progression in lung cancer. However, our data suggest that wildtype vimentin is non-tumorigenic in breast cancer, inferring that effect of vimentin in cancer may be tissue specific, which has never been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Previous studies have described the importance of C328 residue in filament assembly and organisation, stress response, aggresome formation, and lysosomal positioning only in SW13/cl.2 vimentin-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]. However, the use of SW13/cl.2 cell model may not be appropriate to study the role of C328-VIM in EMT because these cells do not express any IFs. For a cancer cell to undergo EMT it must be an epithelial cancer cell expressing keratins. In that respect use of MCF-7 in this study is most approaprite because it does not express endogenous vimentin. As mutations in vimentin have been reported in patients around the area of C328 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>], our hypothesis that this mutation induces conformational changes that activate the complex processes of EMT in breast cancer cells, would have clinical implications.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In summary, this study highlights that vimentin is no longer a mere marker of EMT and metastasis, but appears to be an active participant in cancer progression. The strong correlation between the single cysteine residue at position 328 in vimentin with actin organisation, <italic>XIST</italic> induction and hyperproliferation associated with breast oncogenesis is novel. This suggests that C328 in vimentin remodels actin cytoskeleton and protects against EMT and cancer growth via modulating lncRNA, <italic>XIST.</italic> Taken together, we propose that targeting vimentin via RNA interference should be considered a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding that C238 in vimentin regulates long non-coding RNA XIST to suppress EMT and thereby Xist may be a therapeutic target in breast cancer. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although the improvement of data visibility and presentation would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to scientists working in the field of BCs.</p>

<p>Summary, and Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors and their team have investigated the role of Vimentin Cysteine 328 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumorigenesis. Vimentin is a type III intermediate filament, and cysteine 328 is a crucial site for interactions between vimentin and actin. These interactions can significantly influence cell movement, proliferation, and invasion. The team has specifically examined how Vimentin Cysteine 328 affects cancer cell proliferation, the acquisition of stemness markers, and the upregulation of the non-coding RNA XIST. Additionally, functional assays were conducted using both wild-type (WT) and Vimentin Cysteine 328 mutant cells to demonstrate their effects on invasion, EMT, and cancer progression. Overall, the data supports the essential role of Vimentin Cysteine 328 in regulating EMT, cancer stemness, and tumor progression. Overall, the data and its interpretation are on point and support the hypothesis. I believe the manuscript has great potential.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Minor issues are related to the visibility and data representation in Figures 2E and 3 A-F.</p>

<p>The aim of the investigation was to find out more about the mechanism(s) by which the structural protein vimentin can facilitate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>The authors focussed on a key amino acid of vimentin, C238, its role in the interaction between vimentin and actin microfilaments, and the downstream molecular and cellular consequences. They model the binding between vimentin and actin in silico to demonstrate the potential involvement of C238, but the outcome is described vaguely. The phenotype of a non-metastatic breast cancer cell line MCF7, which doesn't express vimentin, could be changed to a metastatic phenotype when mutant C238S vimentin, but not wild-type vimentin, was expressed in the cells. Expression of vimentin was confirmed at the level of mRNA, protein, and microscopically. Patterns of expression of vimentin and actin reflected the distinct morphology of the two cell lines. Phenotypic changes were assessed through assay of cell adhesion, proliferation, migration, and morphology and were consistent with greater metastatic potential in the C238S MCF7 cells. Changes in the transcriptome of MCF7 cells expressing wild-type and C238S vimentins were compared and expression of Xist long ncRNA was found to be the transcript most markedly increased in the metastatic cells expressing C238S vimentin. Moreover changes in expression of many other genes in the C238S cells are consistent with an epithelial mesenchymal transition. Tumourigenic potential of MCF7 cells carrying C238S but not wild-type, vimentin was confirmed by inoculation of cells into nude mice. This assay is a measure of the stem-cell quality of the cells and not a measure of metastasis. It does demonstrate phenotypic changes that could be linked to metastasis.</p>
<p>shRNA was used to down-regulate vimentin or Xist in the MCF7 C238S cells. The description of the data is limited in parts and data sets require careful scrutiny to understand the full picture. Down-regulation of vimentin reversed the morphological changes to some degree, but down-regulation of Xist didn't. Conversely, down-regulation of Xist inhibited cell growth, a sign of reversing metastatic potential, but down-regulation of vimentin had no effect on growth. Down-regulation of either did inhibit cell migration, another sign of metastatic reversal. The interpretation of this type of experiment is handicapped when full reversal of expression is not achieved, as was the case in this study.</p>
<p>Overall the study describes an intriguing model of metastasis that is worthy of further investigation, especially at the molecular level to unravel the connection between vimentin and metastasis. The identification of a potential role for Xist in metastasis, beyond its normal role in female cells to inactivate one of the X chromosomes, corroborates the work of others demonstrating increased levels in a variety of tumours in women and even in some tumours in men. It would be of great interest to see where in metastatic cells Xist is expressed and what it binds to.</p>
