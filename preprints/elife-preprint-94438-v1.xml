<title>Abstract</title><p>Heterogeneity of tumor metabolism is an important, but still poorly understood aspect of tumor biology. Present work is focused on the visualization and quantification of cellular metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of metabolic cofactor NAD(P)H. FLIM-microscopy of NAD(P)H was performed in vitro in four cancer cell lines, in vivo in the four types of tumors in mice and ex vivo in patients’ tumor samples. The dispersion and bimodality of the decay parameters were evaluated to quantify the intercellular metabolic heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that patients’ tumors have significantly higher heterogeneity of metabolism compared with cultured cells and tumor xenografts. It was found that dispersion of a contribution of a free fraction of NAD(P)H is higher in the high-grade tumors, and the bimodality in a distribution of the free NAD(P)H fraction has associations with tumor metastasis. These results indicate that cell-level metabolic heterogeneity assessed from NAD(P)H FLIM has a potential to become a clinical prognostic factor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Reprogramming of energy metabolism is an established hallmark of malignant tumors. Tumor cells adjust their metabolism to sustain uncontrolled proliferation and tumor progression, even in the conditions of low nutrient supply and hypoxia. There are two main metabolic pathways for energy production in the form of ATP – glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). For a long time, enhanced glycolysis has been considered as a central feature of tumor metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">DeBerardinis and Chandel, 2016</xref>). Unlike most normal cells, tumor cells rely on glycolysis not only in hypoxia (anaerobic glycolysis), but also in normoxia (aerobic glycolysis, or the Warburg effect), which provides them with many metabolic intermediates and a high-speed production of ATP for fast growth. The glycolytic shift in the tumors traditionally correlates with negative prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). At the same time, mitochondrial OXPHOS is as important in malignant cells as glycolysis. Although defective mitochondria and lower OXPHOS capacity are often observed in cancer cells, this is not an absolute phenomenon – many tumors preserve functional mitochondria and normal OXPHOS rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Gentric et al., 2017</xref>). Along with glucose, tumors use glutamine and fatty acids as alternative substrates. Interestingly, tumor cells are capable of switching between different metabolic pathways depending on their own needs and local environment, thus demonstrating a high degree of metabolic plasticity.</p>
<p>Therefore, tumor metabolism is currently viewed as a dynamic, variable system with a diversity of cellular metabolic states. In this context, intratumor heterogeneity means that there are the cells with different metabolic profiles in a tumor concurrently, and intertumor heterogeneity means that tumors of the same type and stage are characterized by the different metabolic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kim and DeBerardinis, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Heterogeneity of tumor metabolism can be caused by various factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Shirmanova et al., 2023</xref>). Some of them («intrinsic») are related to tumor cells themselves: these are histogenesis of the tumor, mutation profile, (epi)genetics factors, differentiation state and proliferation activity, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pavlova and Thompson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sengupta and Pratx, 2016</xref>; Seth Nanda et al., 2020; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Farhadi et al., 2022</xref>). Other reasons («extrinsic») are associated with the nonuniform microenvironment, e.g., local hypoxia, nutrient distribution, heterogeneity of the vasculature network, interaction of tumor cells with the extracellular matrix and stromal cells, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Marusyk and Polyak, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Masson and Ratcliffe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Yoshida, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Stine et al., 2015</xref>). Collectively, these factors lead to variability of tumor metabolism in space and time. Metabolic heterogeneity as a part of general heterogeneity of tumors imposes some difficulties in patients’ diagnosis and treatment and is believed to have a prognostic value.</p>
<p>Although metabolic heterogeneity is a well-recognized feature of tumors, its characterization at the cellular level remains scarce. In part, this is associated with the lack of the highly sensitive and direct techniques for its observation. Clinical imaging modalities, such as metabolic PET with radiolabeled tracers (<sup>18</sup>F, <sup>11</sup>C) and MRI/MRS, allow to capture inter– and intratumor heterogeneity among patients with low (∼4.5 mm) spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Plathow and Weber, 2008</xref>). Recently evolved methods of single-cell sequencing deliver comprehensive information about the metabolic landscape of a tumor with a resolution up to 55–100 µm based on the expression of the metabolic genes, but these approaches are rather complex, laborious and not widely available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Evers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Huang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Interrogation of cellular metabolism is possible with the laser scanning fluorescence microscopy that enables the detection of autofluorescence of the redox cofactors, such as the reduced form of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) – NAD(P)H and oxidized flavins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Georgakoudi and Quinn, 2023</xref>). Recording of the fluorescence decay parameters using the option of the fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) allows the evaluation of the states of the cofactor molecules attributed to different metabolic pathways. Specifically, the unbound state of NAD(P)H has a short lifetime (∼0.4 ns) and is associated with glycolysis, while the protein-bound state has a long lifetime (∼1.7–3.0 ns) and is associated with OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lakowicz et al., 1992</xref>). FLIM of NAD(P)H is currently considered as a promising, label-free technique for the assessment of metabolic heterogeneity of tumors at the (sub)cellular scale. Several studies, including ours, demonstrate the possibilities of NAD(P)H FLIM to visualize metabolic heterogeneity in cultured cells, multicellular structures in vitro, tumor xenografts in vivo and patients’ tumors ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Skala et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lukina et al., 2019</xref>). However, quantifying the degree of tumor heterogeneity is lacking in most of these works.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present the results of assessment of cell-level metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer using FLIM-microscopy of NAD(P)H. The distributions of the fluorescence decay parameters have been analyzed in the four colorectal cancer cell lines (HT29, HCT116, CaCo2, CT26), in the mouse tumor models in vivo generated from these cell lines and in the post-operative samples of patients’ colon tumors. Quantification of heterogeneity has been performed with the dispersion and the bimodality index (BI) of the decay parameter a<sub>1</sub> (contribution of free NAD(P)H). Correlative analysis has been conducted to find associations of the heterogeneity degree with clinical prognosis.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Metabolic heterogeneity assessment in colorectal cancer cell lines</title>
<p>First, using FLIM of NAD(P)H, cellular metabolism was assessed in monolayer cultures of different colorectal cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Typical values of NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetimes were registered for all cell lines – short τ<sub>1</sub> ∼0.39 ns and long τ<sub>2</sub> ∼2.30–2.90 ns (Table S1). Due to specifics of cellular metabolism, the relative contributions of the free (a<sub>1</sub>) and bound (a<sub>2</sub>) forms of NAD(P)H and, consequently, the mean lifetimes τ<sub>m</sub> varied between the cell lines. The a<sub>1</sub> value decreased and τ<sub>m</sub> increased in the following order: CT26 (∼86%, 0.57 ns) &gt; HCT116 (∼84%, 0.71 ns) &gt; HT29 (∼80%, 0.80 ns) &gt; CaCo2 (∼73%, 0.94 ns) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Table S1). A high NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> (low τ<sub>m</sub>) is an indicator of glycolytic shift, which is typical for cells with intense proliferation in a monolayer culture, like CT26 and HCT116. CaCo2 cells with the lowest a<sub>1</sub> value had more OXPHOS-shifted metabolism, which can be associated with the expression of morphological and functional characteristics of mature enterocytes of normal small intestine by this cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lea, 2015</xref>). In all cell lines inter-cellular variations of the a<sub>1</sub> parameter were minor (&lt;3%).</p>

</fig>
<p>To quantify the metabolic heterogeneity, the BI was calculated for distributions of both a<sub>1</sub> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and τ<sub>m</sub> values (Figure S1). For all cell lines, except CaCo2, the BI of the a<sub>1</sub> distribution did not exceed 1.1 (the threshold of bimodality), justifying the uniformity of cell metabolism in a culture, which is consistent with the general view on standard cell lines as homogenous populations. CaCo2 cell culture appeared bimodal in a<sub>1</sub> parameter (BI-a<sub>1</sub>=1.12), which is rational because this cell line is known to be heterogeneous and contain cells of a colon carcinoma and differentiated cells with properties of mature enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lea, 2015</xref>). The BI-τ<sub>m</sub> was, however, rather high (&gt;1.0) in all cell lines except HCT116 (0.84). In the further experiments on tumors and tissue samples the BI-a<sub>1</sub> was used as more relevant.</p>
<p>Additionally, the dispersion of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> (D-a<sub>1</sub>) was evaluated for each cell line to describe the extent of distribution of the data around the median (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The D-a<sub>1</sub> value varied from 1.67% in CT26 cell culture to 3.5% in CaCo2.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="573874v1_fig2.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>Among the tumors, CT26 had the highest (∼83%), and CaCo2 had, on average, the lowest (∼76%) contribution of free NAD(P)H a<sub>1</sub>, similar to the cultured cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Table S1).</p>
<p>Most of the individual tumors showed larger (≥3%) inter-cellular variations of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> than corresponding cell lines, where the deviation from the median was ≤3%. The dispersion D-a<sub>1</sub> was in the range of 2.6–4.02%, and for each specific tumor type was higher than in the corresponding cell line (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At that, intertumor differences across each type of tumor were insignificant.</p>
<p>The BI-a<sub>1</sub> values in mouse tumors were generally higher than in monolayer cultures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In 4 of 12 tumors the BI-a<sub>1</sub> was ≥1.1, indicating the bimodal distribution of the a<sub>1</sub> parameter, i.e., the presence of two subpopulations of cells with different metabolism. Seven tumors had the BI-a<sub>1</sub> in the range of 0.7–1.0, which suggests that, while the distribution of the estimated parameter was unimodal, it was either wide or asymmetric, thus, also indicating some degree of heterogeneity. In 1 of 12 tumors the BI-a<sub>1</sub> was small (0.23), suggesting uniformity of cells’ metabolism. Given the genetic identity of cells in standard cell lines, we can assume that the nonuniform microenvironment in the tumors was a major source of their variable metabolism.</p>
<p>To ensure that the observed heterogeneity resulted from the diversity of cancer cells but not from the contribution of stromal cells, that cannot be reliably identified on NAD(P)H FLIM images, immunohistochemical staining for EpCam (epithelial marker) and vimentin (mesenchymal marker) was performed. It was found that in tumor xenografts the fraction of cells stained with vimentin was less than 10% (Figure S2).</p>

<p>NAD(P)H FLIM images were collected from 21 postoperative samples of patients’ colorectal adenocarcinomas, among which were the tumors of the I–IV stages, poorly and highly differentiated. The representative FLIM and histological images are presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A and B</xref> correspondingly. Patients’ tumors showed fluorescence lifetimes of τ<sub>1</sub> ∼0.45 ns and τ<sub>2</sub> ∼1.80–3.20 ns (Table S3), which were comparable with the values in human tumor xenografts (Table S1). The parameter NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> was in the range of ∼62–80% and NAD(P)H-τ<sub>m</sub> was in the range of 0.80–1.20 ns, indicating that patients’ tumors generally had larger variability of metabolic statuses than cancer cells in vitro and in xenografts in vivo.</p>

<p>A high degree of inter– and intratumor variability of cellular metabolism was detected in patients’ tumors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Half of the tumors (10 of 21) showed deviation of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> from the median &lt;10% across the cells, and for the rest (11 of 21) the variations were 10–25%. The dispersion D-a<sub>1</sub> varied significantly among the samples, from 2.19% to 11.99%.</p>
<p>According to the heterogeneity assessment using the bimodality index, 9 of 21 tumors were metabolically highly heterogeneous (BI-a<sub>1</sub>≥1.1) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In 11 tumors the BI-a<sub>1</sub> value was in the range of 0.59–1.0, which indicated the presence of metabolically different cells but not clearly separated into two clusters. Only one tumor sample (p16) was metabolically homogeneous (BI-a<sub>1</sub>=0.24).</p>
<p>Notably, the bimodality index showed no correlation with dispersion. That is, among the samples there were those with bimodal distribution, but small dispersion of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> in a cell population (e.g., p12, p13, p21), and vice versa (e.g., p3, p7, p8).</p>
<p>Therefore, using NAD(P)H FLIM we have observed and quantified metabolic heterogeneity of patients’ colorectal tumors. Unlike tumor xenografts obtained from the cell lines that are thought to be genetically stable and identical, patients’ tumors are genetically diverse, which could also contribute to their metabolic heterogeneity, in addition to microenvironmental factors.</p>

<label>4.</label><title>Interrelation between metabolic heterogeneity and clinicopathological characteristics of tumors</title>
<p>The relationships between the metrics of cellular heterogeneity BI-τ<sub>m</sub>, BI-a<sub>1</sub> and the D-a<sub>1</sub> NAD(P)H with the clinical parameters of the tumor, such as the stage according to the TNM system and the grade (G), were analyzed. Due to the small sample size, all tumors were divided into two groups by each parameter: T1+T2 and T3+T4; N0M0 and all the others with metastases; G1+G2 and G3.</p>
<p>The results showed that the high-grade tumors displayed a higher value of dispersion of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> than the low-grade ones, indicating their higher heterogeneity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). R point-biserial correlation coefficient between the grade and the dispersion a<sub>1</sub> was –0.49 (p-val = 0.03). Thus, the dispersion of free NAD(P)H fraction a<sub>1</sub> allowed differentiating between the low-grade and high-grade tumors with a high accuracy (p-val = 0.01).</p>

<p>Tumors of the advanced stages T3 and T4 were characterized by reduced dispersion of D-a<sub>1</sub> and increased bimodality index BI-a<sub>1</sub> compared with early stages T1 and T2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

<p>Importantly, if metastases were present (N and M were different from 0 in TNM), then those primary tumors showed higher values of the bimodality index BI-a<sub>1</sub> compared with tumors for which metastases were absent (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The altered energy metabolism is known to support tumor progression because tumor cells are critically in need of ATP for uncontrolled proliferation and growth. It has been established that tumor cells explore different metabolic programs and utilize multiple fuels even within one tumor, thus leading to metabolic heterogeneity. Until recently, direct observation of cell-level heterogeneity of tumor metabolism was a challenging task, but became possible with the evolution of advanced optical microscopic techniques, such as two-photon fluorescence lifetime microscopy, FLIM. In the present research, using FLIM of metabolic cofactor NAD(P)H, which possesses endogenous fluorescence, we compared metabolic features of colorectal cancer cells across in vitro and in vivo models and patients’ samples. For the first time, the heterogeneity of cellular metabolism quantified on the basis of FLIM data was correlated with clinical characteristics of the tumors.</p>
<p>A lot of studies, including the works of our group, demonstrate the possibilities of FLIM for assessment of the intra– and intertumor heterogeneity of metabolism in different models. Using NAD(P)H FLIM, metabolic heterogeneity was revealed in colorectal cancer cell cultures obtained from the patients’ tumors, whereas the cells of the standard cell lines were uniform in their metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shirshin et al., 2022</xref>). J. Chacko and K. Eliceiri observed intercellular heterogeneity of metabolism in the MCF10A human breast epithelial cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Chacko and Eliceiri, 2019</xref>). Several studies show metabolic heterogeneity of 3D multicellular structures. For example, tumor spheroids obtained from the cervical cancer cell line HeLa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lukina et al., 2018</xref>) or murine colorectal carcinoma cell line CT26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Shirmanova et al., 2021</xref>) displayed the differences in metabolism between the outer and the inner cell layers with the outer layers being more glycolytic (higher NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub>). The spheroids generated from the patients’ derived glioblastoma cultures did not show metabolic zonality, but generally had greater intercellular variations of NAD(P)H lifetime parameters than the spheroids from standard line U373 MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Yuzhakova et al., 2023</xref>). A spectrum of works by M. Skala’ group demonstrates an opportunity of the optical metabolic imaging for heterogeneity assessment in patient tumor-derived organoids on the example of a breast, pancreatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Sharick et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Walsh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Walsh et al., 2017</xref>), head and neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Shah et al., 2017</xref>), colorectal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Skala et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In the research in vivo, the heterogeneous structure of tumor and its microenvironment was shown on PyMT mammary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Burkel et al., 2022</xref>). Analysis of the optical metabolic parameters revealed heterogeneity of the B78 mouse melanoma model, caused by different microenvironments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heaton et al., 2023</xref>). The authors suggested that tumor heterogeneity could be induced by such factors as pH, nutrient and oxygen availability, or activation of immune cells. In the in vivo study on HeLa tumor xenografts, metabolically different cells were detected in the cellular and collagen-rich areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Shirmanova et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated a high variability of cellular metabolic statuses in CT26 tumors of large size compared with small tumors, which correlated with heterogeneous oxygen distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Parshina et al., 2022</xref>). A significant intertumor heterogeneity of metabolism was observed in patient-derived glioblastoma xenografts, which differed them from standard U87 glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Yuzhakova et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In our study, we compared metabolic FLIM parameters of colorectal cell lines, mouse tumor models and patients’ colorectal tumors. As expected, intercellular heterogeneity of metabolism was the highest in patients’ tumor samples as followed from a wide and often bimodal distribution of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub>. This result is consistent with the study by J. Auman and H. McLeod using genome-wide gene expression data; the authors concluded that colorectal cancer cell lines lack the molecular heterogeneity of clinical colorectal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Auman and McLeod, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Cell-level metabolic heterogeneity may be present in the cell population initially, as discussed above, or develop during the treatment. The heterogeneous metabolism after treatment was detected in tumor organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Walsh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Walsh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Gillette et al., 2021</xref>) and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heaster et al., 2019</xref>). In any case, the presence of metabolically distinct cells led to the varying drug responses.</p>
<p>An assessment of metabolic heterogeneity in patients’ tumors seems valuable from a clinical point of view. Previously, using NAD(P)H FLIM of postoperative samples, we observed a high degree of inter– and intratumor heterogeneity of T3 stage colorectal tumors in comparison with normal colon samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lukina et al., 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, most of the tumor types are inaccessible for microscopic investigation in patients using clinically approved techniques. The exception is the skin tumors that can be inspected with clinical systems, like MPTflex or MPTcompact (JenLab, Germany). At the same time, endoscopic FLIM-microscopy has been developing actively since the last ten years, which opens the prospects for in vivo examination of a wide spectrum of patients’ tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Farhadi et al., 2022</xref>). In principle, an assessment of tumor metabolism in biopsy samples is also possible, which widens the potential clinical applications of FLIM.</p>
<p>Although metabolic heterogeneity at the cellular level has been reported for different models and patient-derived cells, the comparisons between different samples and studies are hard to make as most of them lack any quantification of the heterogeneity.</p>
<p>Different approaches have been proposed to quantify the metabolic differences identified by FLIM. For example, in the papers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Sharick et al., 2019</xref>) a heterogeneity index and its modified form the weighted heterogeneity index (wH-index) were used for quantitative analysis of cellular heterogeneity. The wH-index is based on the Gaussian distribution models and is a modified form of the Shannon diversity index. Using this index the authors described the variations of a combination of parameters, such as NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime, FAD fluorescence lifetime and optical redox ratio, defined as the OMI-index. The methods developed in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Heaster et al., 2019</xref>) established the combination of optical metabolic imaging variables and spatial statistical analysis (spatial proximity analysis, spatial clustering, multivariate spatial analysis, spatial principal components analysis) to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of tumor cell metabolism. Recently, we have proposed a new quantitative criterion – the bimodality index (BI) – to accurately discriminate between metabolically diverse cellular subpopulations on the basis of NAD(P)H FLIM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shirshin et al., 2022</xref>). The BI provides dimensionless estimation on the inherent heterogeneity of a sample by checking the hypothesis about approximation of a fluorescence decay parameter distribution by two Gaussians. Using the BI, the metabolic heterogeneity has been identified in standard and primary cancer cells cultures after chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil. Here, we used the dispersion of NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> and BI-a<sub>1</sub> for quantifying metabolic heterogeneity of patient’s tumors and compared it with in vitro and in vivo models.</p>
<p>Metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer is also discussed in the literature. The focus of many of these studies is on the molecular classification of tumors by the analysis of their metabolic features. For example, Zhang et al. showed that colorectal tumors could be classified into three distinct metabolism-relevant subtypes and developed a metabolism-related signature consisting of 27 metabolic genes, which were expressed differentially among the three subtypes and correlated with patients’ overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Varshavi et al. performed metabolic characterization of colorectal cancer cells depending on KRAS mutation status using <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of the metabolites. They revealed that some mutations led to an increase of glucose consumption and lactate release, while others, on the contrary, decreased it (Varshavi et al., 2020). Liu et al. found a correlation between intratumor metabolic heterogeneity parameters of <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT and KRAS mutation status in colorectal cancer – KRAS mutant tumors had more <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake and heterogeneity than wild-type KRAS (Liu, Wang et al., 2022). In a different study they showed that intratumor metabolic heterogeneity assessed from <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT is an important prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer (Liu, Xiang et al., 2022). The value of intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT for prediction of recurrence in patients with locally advanced colorectal cancer was also demonstrated by Han et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Han et al., 2018</xref>). In the study by Zhang et al. intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity derived from <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT was higher in colorectal tumors with a high microsatellite instability (MSI) – an important prognostic biomarker, and predicted MSI in stage I–III colorectal cancer patients preoperatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Lin et al. identified two subtypes of colorectal cancer using a metabolic risk score based on genes that were mostly involved in lipid metabolism pathways; this criterion was applied for survival prediction – patients with a higher metabolic risk score had worse prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lin et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, these clinical studies consider intratumor metabolic heterogeneity as a useful prognostic factor. Our results on patients’ colorectal tumors revealed some associations between cell-level heterogeneity and tumor differentiation grade, a stage-independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer where the lower grade correlates with better the prognosis. The high-grade (G3) tumors had significantly higher heterogeneity, quantified by the dispersion parameter D NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub>, compared with low-grade ones.</p>
<p>Another important observation in our research is that bimodality in NAD(P)H-a<sub>1</sub> distribution in primary tumors was linked to the presence of metastases. Several studies report on the correlations of colon tumor heterogeneity with metastases status. For example, in Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Rajput et al., 2017</xref>), analysis of the mutational spectra of stage II and III colon cancer samples using next-generation sequencing approach revealed that there was a strong correlation between higher MATH (the Mutant-Allele Tumor Heterogeneity) score and a risk of metastases. Oh et al. observed a significant difference in progression-free survival according to heterogeneity assessment from targeted deep sequencing data, suggesting that tumor heterogeneity might be a determining factor for recurrence or metastasis in colorectal cancer patients with curative resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). Joung et al., using the whole-exome sequencing, determined that heterogeneity of primary colorectal tumors can predict the potential for liver metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Joung et al., 2017</xref>). Similar results were obtained for different types of tumors, including breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chung et al., 2017</xref>) and cervical cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kidd and Grigsby, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Pinho et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In the context of metabolic heterogeneity assay using NAD(P)H FLIM, some limitations should be mentioned. If the investigation of patients’ tumor metabolism is performed on ex vivo tissue samples, one should be careful to work with freshly excised tissue or store the sample in the appropriate conditions. As we found previously, FLIM parameters of autofluorescence change very quickly (within 15 min) on air, but can be preserved in 10% BSA on ice during 3 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lukina et al., 2019</xref>). A limitation of our study is that microscopic FLIM images of the tissues were processed manually to obtain information about each individual cell, which made the analysis time-consuming. The methods for segmentation of tissue images have been continuously developed in digital histopathology. As for FLIM, there are approaches to automatic segmentation of FLIM images of cell cultures on the basis of machine learning. So, in spite of the complex and heterogeneous tissue architecture, there are expectations that the task of identification of the individual cells in FLIM images of tissues will be solved in the nearest future. Finally, a small size of the microscopic field of view (typically less 300 µm) limits the inspected area within the tumor sample. Taking into account a high spatial heterogeneity of clinical tumors, there is no confidence whether the inspected area is sufficiently representative.</p>
<p>Owing to the high (sub)cellular resolution (∼200–500 nm), FLIM-microscopy provides unique information about metabolic heterogeneity, unavailable with any other methods, like <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET or spatial transcriptomics. Therefore, FLIM-microscopy of endogenous cofactors is not only a powerful research technique, which is capable of improving our understanding of cellular metabolic diversity, but also the tool with a great potential for clinical translation to predict disease outcome.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It is now evident that metabolic processes in cancer are highly variable, which make the tumor metabolism extremely heterogeneous. Metabolic heterogeneity of tumors complicates treatment efforts and is thought to be a negative prognostic factor. Due to the lack of methods for direct observation and quantification of metabolic heterogeneity at cellular level, it has been poorly characterized so far. Our assessments of cell-level heterogeneity from FLIM-microscopy of NAD(P)H clearly show that heterogeneous metabolic landscape of a patient’ tumor is hardly reproducible in in vitro and in vivo models, which underlie the importance of such investigations on clinical material. Although the present research included a limited number of patients (n=21), the obtained results showing the associations between metabolic heterogeneity and clinical features of tumors allow us to consider it as a potential prognostic marker. We plan to continue this study to collect more tumor samples and estimate the correlations between their metabolic heterogeneity and follow-up clinical outcomes.</p>

<title>Bimodality Index and Dispersity calculation</title>
<p>A continuous measure known as the «bimodality index» is utilized to gauge the degree of conformity of a set of univariate data to a two-component mixture model. The score is larger if the two components are balanced in size or if the separation between the two modes is larger. The BI≥1.1 is considered as a cutoff to reliably define a bimodal distribution in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Shirshin et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>BI was calculated according to the equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="573874v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where μ – the mean of each Gaussian, σ – the standard deviation of each Gaussian and n – the number of measurements of each Gaussian.</p>
<p>Dispersion was calculated as interquartile range: 75% quantile – 25% quantile (Q<sub>3</sub> – Q<sub>1</sub>).</p>
<p>The parameters τ<sub>m</sub> and a<sub>1</sub> obtained by FLIM microscopy were used to calculate the bimodality indices (BI) and the dispersion for cultured cells, mouse tumors and patients’ samples.</p>
<p>The resulting BI for τ<sub>m</sub> and a<sub>1</sub> and dispersion of a<sub>1</sub> were used to search for the relationships between them and the pathophysiological parameters of tumors: the TNM stage and the grade (G).</p>
<p>The fluorescence decay parameters were normalized using the z-normalization method to level out the numerical difference.</p>
<p>A random forest decision tree model was used to evaluate the importance of fluorescence decay parameters on clinicopathological characteristics. The outcome of the model was used for SHAP analysis. Finally, SHAP analysis allowed us to determine the most significant parameters that were investigated by the classic statistical methods (Mann–Whitney).</p>
<p>SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis is a method used to explain the output of any machine learning model. SHAP analysis portrays the relative impact of variables on the output of the model, and it can give insights into the most significant factors and the influence of variables on the result. SHAP values are a way to explain the contribution of each feature to the model’s output. They measure how much each feature contributes to the model’s prediction and can help identify which features are most important for the model and how they affect the outcome.</p>
<p>The T parameter from TNM was modified in a way that classes 1+2 became group 0, and 3+4 became group 1. The modification of the parameter G resulted in two classes: classes 1+2 became group 0 and class 3 became group 1. Parameters N and M were modified as NM, in which the class was distinguished: no metastases – 0, metastases – 1. Since the clinical parameters, in a modified form, are binary, a point-biserial correlation coefficient was chosen to assess the correlation.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding on the heterogeneity of tumour metabolism using fluorescence lifetime imaging, measured across 4 cell lines, 4 tumour types of in vivo mouse models, and 21 patient samples. The indication is that the level of heterogeneity of cellular metabolism increases with model complexity and demonstrates high heterogeneity at a clinical level. The evidence supporting the claims of the authors is <bold>solid</bold>, although the inclusion of a larger number of patient samples would have strengthened the study. The work will be of interest to medical biologists developing methods for quantifying metabolic heterogeneity.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Komarova et al. investigate the clinical prognostic ability of cell-level metabolic heterogeneity quantified via the fluorescence lifetime characteristics of NAD(P)H. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has been studied as a minimally invasive approach to measure cellular metabolism in live cell cultures, organoids, and animal models. Its clinical translation is spearheaded through macroscopic implementation approaches that are capable of large sampling areas and enable access to otherwise constrained spaces but lack cellular resolution for a one-to-one transition with traditional microscopy approaches, making the interpretation of the results a complicated task. The merit of this study primarily lies in its design by analyzing with the same instrumentation and approach colorectal samples in different research scenarios, namely in vitro cells, in vivo animal xenografts, and tumor tissue from human patients. These conform to a valuable dataset to explore the translational interpretation hurdles with samples of increasing levels of complexity. For human samples, the study specifically investigates the prediction ability of NAD(P)H fluorescence metrics for the binary classification of tumors of low and advanced stage, with and without metastasis, and low and high grade. They find that NAD(P)H fluorescence properties have a strong potential to distinguish between high- and low-grade tumors and a moderate ability to distinguish advanced-stage tumors from low-stage tumors. This study provides valuable results contributing to the deployment of minimally invasive optical imaging techniques to quantify tumor properties and potentially migrate into tools for human tumor characterization and clinical diagnosis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The investigation of colorectal samples under multiple imaging scenarios with the same instrument and approach conforms to a valuable dataset that can facilitate the interpretation of results across the spectrum of sample complexity.</p>
<p>The manuscript provides a strong discussion reviewing studies that investigated cellular metabolism with FLIM and the metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer in general.</p>
<p>The authors do a thorough acknowledgement of the experimental limitations of investigating human samples ex vivo, and the analytical limitation of manual segmentation, for which they provide a path forward for higher throughput analysis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>To substantiate the changes in fluorescence properties at the examined wavelength range (associated with NAD(P)H fluorescence) in relationship to metabolism, the study would strongly benefit from additional quantification of metabolic-associated metrics using currently established standard methods. This is especially interesting when discussing heterogeneity, which is presumably high within and between patients with colorectal cancer, and could help explain the particularities of each sample leading to a more in-depth analysis of the acquired valuable dataset. Additionally, NAD(P)H fluorescence does not provide a complete picture of the cell/tissue metabolic characteristics. Including, or discussing the implications of including fluorescence from flavins would comprise a more compelling dataset. These additional data would also enable the quantification of redox metrics, as briefly mentioned, which could positively contribute to the prognosis potential of metabolic heterogeneity.</p>
<p>In the current form of the manuscript, there is a diluted interpretation and discussion of the results obtained from the random forest and SHAP analysis regarding the ability of the FLIM parameters to predict clinicopathological outcomes. This is, not only the main point the authors are trying to convey given the title and the stated goals, but also a novel result given the scarce availability of these type of data, which could have a remarkable impact on colorectal cancer in situ diagnosis and therapy monitoring. These data merit a more in-depth analysis of the different factors involved. In this context, the authors should clarify how is the &quot;trend of association&quot; quantified (lines 194 and 199).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript &quot;Metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer as a prognostic factor: insights gained from fluorescence lifetime imaging&quot; by Komarova et al., the authors used fluorescence lifetime imaging and quantitative analysis to assess the metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer. Generally, this work is logically well-designed, including in vitro and in vivo animal models and ex vivo patient samples. However, since the key parameter presented in this study, the BI index, is already published in a previous paper by this group (Shirshin et al., 2022), and the quantification method of metabolic heterogeneity has already been well (and even better) described in previous studies (such as the one by Heaster et al., 2019), the novelty of this study is doubted. Moreover, I am afraid that the way of data analysis and presentation in this study is not well done, which will be mentioned in detail in the following sections.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Solid experiments are performed and well-organized, including in vitro and in vivo animal models and ex vivo patient samples.</p>
<p>(2) Attempt and efforts to build the association between the metabolic heterogeneity and prognosis for colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The human sample number (from 21 patients) is very limited. I wonder how the limited patient number could lead to reliable diagnosis and prognosis;.</p>
<p>(2) The BI index or similar optical metrics have been well established by this and other groups; therefore, the novelty of this study is doubted.</p>
