<title>Abstract</title><p>Episodic memories are temporally segmented around event boundaries that tend to coincide with moments of environmental change. During these times, the state of the brain should change rapidly, or reset, to ensure that the information encountered before and after an event boundary is encoded in different neuronal populations. Norepinephrine (NE) is thought to facilitate this network reorganization. However, it is unknown whether event boundaries drive NE release in the hippocampus and, if so, how NE release relates to changes in hippocampal firing patterns. The advent of the new GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor now allows for the measurement of NE binding with sub-second resolution. Using this tool in mice, we tested whether NE is released into the dorsal hippocampus during event boundaries defined by unexpected transitions between spatial contexts and presentations of novel objections. We found that NE binding dynamics were well explained by the time elapsed after each of these environmental changes, and were not related to conditioned behaviors, exploratory bouts of movement, or reward. Familiarity with a spatial context accelerated the rate in which phasic NE binding decayed to baseline. Knowing when NE is elevated, we tested how hippocampal coding of space differs during these moments. Immediately after context transitions we observed relatively unique patterns of neural spiking which settled into a modal state at a similar rate in which NE returned to baseline. These results are consistent with a model wherein NE release drives hippocampal representations away from a steady-state attractor. We hypothesize that the distinctive neural codes observed after each event boundary may facilitate long-term memory and contribute to the neural basis for the primacy effect.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Determining neurobiological mechanisms by which the hippocampus supports the formation of memories for distinct episodes remains a major outstanding challenge. Norepinephrine (NE) signaling is hypothesized to play a key role in organizing memory into episodes demarcated by event boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Yet, the situations in which NE is released in the hippocampus, and the effects of NE on hippocampal coding, are not well understood. Here, we use the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor and analysis of neuronal spiking dynamics to test the hypothesis that NE release occurs at event boundaries and aligns with changes in neural coding that promote long-term memory.</p>
<p>Prior work suggests that NE release from the locus coeruleus (LC) may facilitate event segmentation by modulating the induction threshold for synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, facilitating reorganization of which neurons are active before and after unexpected salient events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, and changing how neurons encode their environment at the time of transmitter release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. NE release from the LC causes immediate changes in the excitability and activity of neurons across the hippocampal formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Electrical stimulation of the LC acutely silences most hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> while simultaneously increasing firing in the subset of neurons that respond to salient stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, an observation that motivated the hypothesis that NE sets the gain of the neuronal input/output curve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Computational models predict that NE-induced changes in gain should promote network shifts by lowering the activation energy for transitioning between learned states/attractors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Hippocampal place fields remap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (change place field position), with learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and also after salient changes in an animalâs environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>, offering an attractive correlate to assess LC-induced reset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>NE also facilitates synaptic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Plasticity-related signaling is needed for the reactivation of waking spiking activity during subsequent sharp-wave ripples replay events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Neuronal replay is important for memory consolidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and variations in the content of replay may dictate which moments are remembered and which are forgotten<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Stimulation of dopaminergic terminals from the ventral midbrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, as well as natural reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, enhances synaptic plasticity and can promote reactivation. It is unknown whether moments of elevated noradrenergic release similarly bias subsequent replay, though such a relationship has been predicted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Micro-dialysis studies have revealed that NE is released in the hippocampus after exposure to novel environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, physical restraint/handling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, or after exposure to novel combinations of familiar objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. This method samples average NE concentration over a minutes-long period and therefore cannot resolve whether release is related to the experimental stimuli or the behaviors associated with those stimuli; for example, mice move more in novel spaces. The low sampling resolution of micro-dialysis also precludes relating moment-to-moment changes in neural coding with fluctuations in NE concentration. Using the recently developed GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, which can measure NE release with sub-second resolution, hippocampal NE levels were shown to increase immediately after delivering an electrical shock and decrease around freezing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. This pattern could indicate a relationship between NE around encoding and retrieval events, or alternatively, may arise due to a relationship between NE release and overall levels of movement or arousal, which in this case co-varied with different phases of the experiment. In support of this latter interpretation, a previous study found that the firing rate of LC neurons positively correlates with acceleration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. Others have reported that LC neurons fire in response to unexpected salient stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>, including reward prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. Such surprise-related activity of LC neurons may cause NE release at the moments when event boundaries are thought to occur, however, such a relationship is not guaranteed as NE release is also modulated at the level of the axon terminal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To better understand how hippocampal NE release dynamics relate to event boundaries and the associated neuronal response, we used the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor to examine how NE release is related to event boundaries imposed by unexpected transitions between testing environments and the introduction of novel objects. We also tested how these signals are affected by moment-to-moment fluctuations in behavior and reward availability, and how NE release dynamics change over the course of learning. Knowing when NE is expressed, we then assessed whether these moments are associated with changes in neural coding as predicted by prominent models of NE function. Our findings support a model in which NE release around event boundaries scales with the deviance between current and previously stored neural representations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamics of NE release and binding in the dorsal hippocampus, the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> genetically encoded fluorescent indicator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> was virally delivered to dorsal CA1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), and optic fibers were chronically implanted in C57BL6/J mice (N = 8 mice, N = 3 female) unilaterally targeting the injection site. The main dependent measure was the emission intensity of the NE-derived signal (experimental excitation Î» = 465-nm) with corrections for mechanical instability (isosbestic excitation Î» = 405-nm) and photobleaching, and normalized by the mean and standard deviation recorded during a 10-minute homecage baseline (see Methods); this measurement will be referred to as Signal<sub>NE</sub>. The Signal<sub>NE</sub> derived from the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor was validated in our hands by showing that the noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor desipramine caused a significant increase in Signal<sub>NE</sub> relative to vehicle injections (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). Likewise, noradrenergic Î±2 receptor antagonism with yohimbine (from which GRAB<sub>NE</sub> was derived) disrupted normally strong Signal<sub>NE</sub> (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>

<title>Signal<sub>NE</sub> exponentially decays after transfer to a novel arena</title>
<p>Moving between environments causes a large reorganization in which hippocampal neurons are active<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>. To test how NE release relates to this cause of network reorganization, Signal<sub>NE</sub> was measured as mice were transferred from their home cage to a novel testing arena that, over days, became more familiar to the subject (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Averaging across all exposures, Signal<sub>NE</sub> increased immediately upon entry to the testing arena and exponentially decayed to a steady state over minutes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The NE dynamics may be related to the transition itself, or the incidence of behaviors that occur immediately following exposure to an unfamiliar space. For example, in the moments after transition, mice tended to spend more time close to the edges of the environment (thigmotaxis) and tended to move more rapidly (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref>). We quantified how NE release relates to five potential behavioral covariates: time from arena entry, acceleration, velocity, distance from edge, and time from rearing. These five behavioral variables were themselves correlated (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>). Univariate analysis revealed strong, positive co-modulation of Signal<sub>NE</sub> with acceleration (<italic>t(7) = 4.54, p = 0.002</italic>) and modest positive correlation with velocity (<italic>t(7) = 2.32, p = 0.05</italic>)(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E</xref>). Signal<sub>NE</sub> also correlated with distance to the edge of the environment (<italic>t(7) = -2.37, p = 0.05</italic>)(<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E,F</xref>), and showed transient changes around rearing events in a subset of animals (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E,G</xref>). Such covariation in putative factors driving NE release complicates assessment of whether NE release dynamics relate to the contextual transition <italic>per se</italic>, or whether NE is more closely associated with novelty-related behaviors. The sub-second temporal resolution of the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensors allows disambiguation of these scenarios.</p>
<p>To identify the independent variable with the greatest explanatory power, we performed backward stepwise regression on a non-linear model defined by the five behavioral variables of interest. Time from transition was modeled with two terms: a positive term with a fast decay and a negative term with a slower decay to capture decreases in NE observed after some transitions. Cross-validated mean squared error (CVMSE) was calculated for the full, saturated model and for a reduced model in which one of the five variables (or the intercept) has been dropped. Significant decreases in model fit were only observed after dropping the time from context entry independent variable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Despite apparent modulation of Signal<sub>NE</sub> with movement, the critical factor in predicting Signal<sub>NE</sub> was the time from event transition.</p>

<title>Signal<sub>NE</sub> exponentially decays after transfer to a familiar linear track</title>
<p>LC activity and NE release have been related to reward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup> and acceleration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>. The physical dimensions of the testing arenas prohibited moments of high acceleration or velocity and the recording sessions lacked appetitive reward conditions. We therefore sought to test whether Signal<sub>NE</sub> was under the control of event boundary transitions even when mice engaged in a learned task in which subjects must run to receive water reward on a linear track, a standard apparatus for studying hippocampal physiology.</p>
<p>Here, we considered five independent variables: time from linear track entry, acceleration, velocity, distance from the edge of the track, and time from reward. As was observed in the novel arena experiments, NE increased rapidly upon entry to the linear track and decayed to a steady state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> A,B). Hippocampal NE was not modulated around reward delivery (signaled with an audible solenoid click) nor movement (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>). The stepwise regression analysis showed that removing time from entry, but no other term, significantly decreased our ability to predict fluctuations in Signal<sub>NE</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These results show that, even in the context of an appetitive task that requires conditioned responses, time from transition is the dominant factor in explaining hippocampal NE release.</p>

<title>Signal<sub>NE</sub> exponentially decays after introduction of a novel object</title>
<p>In experiments that have studied event boundaries in people, the modality of the information is often non-spatial (e.g. the color of a picture background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>) and LC firing has been related to object sampling in the rodent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested whether the introduction of a novel object could likewise signal an event boundary to the mouse that would be associated with a transient increase in Signal<sub>NE</sub>.</p>
<p>Five novel objects were consecutively introduced to the mouse, each for five minutes starting 10 minutes after the mouse was transferred to a familiar arena, a timeline designed to decouple event boundaries related to environmental transitions from those related to object introduction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Mice spontaneously move to explore novel objects, and this well-characterized behavior is used as a metric for intact memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that the event boundary would be defined by the objectâs introduction, and therefore predicted that NE release would be related to these moments rather than the behaviors associated with individual samples of the object.</p>

</fig>
<p>To address this question, a similar statistical modeling approach was adopted wherein Signal<sub>NE</sub> was modeled as a function of: time from object introduction, acceleration, velocity, distance from edge of the environment, and whether or not the mouse was sampling the object. Upon introduction, each of the five objects induced a phasic release of NE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> B,C); NE release dynamics were not systemically related to the ordinal position of the object in the sequence (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3 A-C</xref>). NE release was also not coordinated with individual object samples (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). Backward stepwise regression analysis revealed that the time from object introduction was the only term whose absence significantly decreased CVMSE (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). These results show that changes in spatial context and introduction of salient and novel objects increase Signal<sub>NE</sub>, thus suggesting that NE release around both types of event boundaries may organize hippocampal neural activity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Novel objects do not affect Signal<sub>NE</sub> around spatial context transitions</title>
<p>As Signal<sub>NE</sub> increases around novel objects and context transitions, we next tested how the combination of these conditions affects noradrenergic signaling in the dorsal hippocampus. In addition, mice typically initiate movement to explore novelty and we sought a scenario in which mice stop to inspect something new. To achieve these goals, mice were trained to run for water on a linear track and were then presented with a novel object placed midway down the track. In these sessions, there was a baseline linear track period without novel objects, then mice were returned to the home cage and a novel object was placed on the track (Control sessions in the same subjects were run on different days without novel objects), and finally, mice were returned to the linear track. Though mice reliably stopped to inspect the novel object, no difference in Signal<sub>NE</sub> was observed between the novel object and control conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, Signal<sub>NE</sub> related to the familiar context transition was not affected by the presence of novel objects.</p>

<title>Experience accelerates the decay of Signal<sub>NE</sub> after spatial context transitions</title>
<p>Prior studies have found that the effect of event boundaries on the organization of memory depends on stimulus familiarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup> and recordings from LC neurons show rapid habituation with repeated exposures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Therefore, we tested how the Signal<sub>NE</sub> changes as a novel environment becomes increasingly familiar after repeated exposure over 10 days. Comparing the first and second days of testing, mice tended to display higher levels of acceleration, rear more often, and spend more time close to the perimeter during first-time arena exposure (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
<p>We adopted the same regression analysis to decouple learning-related changes in behavior from learning-related changes in NE release. As before, Signal<sub>NE</sub> was estimated as a function of time from context entry, acceleration, velocity, distance from edge, and time from rearing. For each subject, for each day, we derived a point estimate of a positive Î²-weight associated with the gain in Signal<sub>NE</sub> due to the context transition as well as a term Ï that describes the rate of decay of Signal<sub>NE</sub> after the event boundary. The rate of Signal<sub>NE</sub> decay (Ï; mixed-effects linear model, t<italic>(73) = 2.31, p = 0.02</italic>), and not amplitude (Î²; mixed-effects linear model, <italic>t(73) = 1.16, p = 0.25</italic>), systematically changed as a function of the number of days of experience (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5 A-C</xref>). Returning the subject to their home cage was associated with an increase (Î²) in Signal<sub>NE</sub>, with a decay that was more rapid than that observed after 10 days of contextual habituation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings show that learning alters NE signaling dynamics, either by accelerating the rate of NE clearance or by decreasing the duration in which LC neurons continue to release NE after being moved into a different space.</p>

<p>Mice were highly familiar with the linear track, yet Signal<sub>NE</sub> showed a relatively slow delay.

For both linear track and novel context sessions, significant decreases in model fit were only observed after dropping the terms related to time from home cage entry (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5</xref>). Signal<sub>NE</sub> increased similarly around the transition to home cage after experience in the arena or linear track (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). However, in the linear track sessions, Signal<sub>NE</sub> rapidly decreased and was depressed relative to baseline for several minutes.

<title>CA1 spatial code takes minutes to settle after context transition</title>
<p>Knowing the dynamics of NE after context transfer allowed us to search for changes in neural activity that track this time course. Modeling studies have emphasized that NE binding should increase the rate at which neural patterns change over time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Using a large open-source database in which CA1 neurons were recorded as mice were transferred to novel and familiar tracks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, we found that in novel environments, the rate of decorrelation was indeed faster in the first minute after transfer as compared to later in the session (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6 A,B</xref>). Such a relationship was not observed in a familiar space (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure S6 C,D</xref>). Since we found strong NE release in both conditions, we doubt these changes are driven by NE.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the rate at which the spatial map settles after inducing remapping by shifting the subject from its home cage to a novel or familiar testing environment. Place fields can be observed immediately after transitioning to a new environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, though fields can also emerge and/or change throughout experience<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, and show other changes across repetition as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>. To gain an intuition for the dynamics immediately after transition, we embedded the high-dimensional population firing rate vectors (mean ensemble = 253.8 neurons, range = 191-363 neurons, bin size = 100-ms) into a 2D space. Color coding by position shows that the CA1 representational space maps the spatial layout of the environment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Color coding by time shows that moments immediately following the transition are associated with unusual representations, which can be seen at the periphery of the representational state space (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Recognizing that single locations may have a multitude of neural representations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>, we quantified the correlation of the instantaneous representation recorded at each moment relative to those recorded in the same location at any other moment throughout the session. This nearest-neighbor search revealed that early moments were associated with neural activity that poorly correlated with activity recorded in the same location later in the session (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> C,D). Representations settled into a steady state after several minutes and more rapidly in a familiar environment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7 E-G</xref>). Settling involved both an increase of activity within a neuronâs place field and a decrease in out-of-field firing (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7 A,B</xref>). To ensure this representational uniqueness did not arise due to unusual behaviors during the first minutes after transfer, we calculated the absolute difference in velocity (|Îvel|<sub>NN</sub>) and acceleration (|Îacc|<sub>NN</sub>) recorded at the moments captured by the nearest-neighbor (NN) search. When comparing pairs of moments with the highest representational similarity, there was no systematic relationship between time after transfer and |Îvel|<sub>NN</sub> or |Îacc|<sub>NN</sub> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7 C-F</xref>). To confirm this impression, we modeled the nearest-neighbor representational similarity as a function of time from transfer, |Îvel|<sub>NN</sub>, and |Îacc<sub>|NN</sub>. Only removing time from transition significantly decreased ability to predict nearest neighbor correlations (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7 E,F</xref>). Similar results were found when representational similarity was not conditioned on the mouseâs location (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure S7 G,H</xref>). These results show that changes in representational uniqueness are more driven by time from transfer than unusual movement statistics. The time course of representational stabilization qualitatively matched that of NE decay in both novel and familiar environments suggesting a potential link between NE release and atypical spiking behavior.</p>

These correlations were then compared to a bootstrap distribution (shuffling neural activity across ripples to break patterns of synchrony) to assess the likelihood that a particular firing rate vector would be observed more than expected if neurons fire independently of one another across ripples. Contrary to expectations, the pattern of activity observed towards the end of the session was more likely to be reactivated in the ripples that followed the experience (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> A,B).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Moment-to-moment changes in extracellular NE concentration were mainly driven by the time since a salient environmental change. NE release could not be explained by fluctuations in spontaneous or conditioned mouse behavior. Familiarity accelerated the rate at which NE decayed to baseline after transitioning between contexts, while the degree of phasic NE increase at the time of transition did not systematically change with learning. In opposition to predictions from models that place a central role of NE in gating the plasticity required to alter future neural dynamics, we did not find any enhancement in the reactivation of neural patterns observed in the moments immediately following context transition, and in fact, we observed the converse â greater reactivation of the neural patterns observed later in the recording session. Analyzing the dynamics of neural coding around environmental transitions, we observed that hippocampal representations of space took several minutes to stabilize into a modal steady state. This time course was faster in a familiar environment and qualitatively mirrored that of NE release. These results support a model in which the hippocampal NE release is proportional to the deviance between the current neural representation and the steady-state attractor.</p>

<title>Potential sources dictating NE dynamics</title>
<p>NE dynamics were well described by the sum of two exponentials, one reflecting an increase in NE release around the event boundary that decays to baseline over several minutes and another describing a decrease in NE release from baseline that recovers more slowly. This phenomenological model was able to capture complex interactions between NE release and clearance that dictate the available Signal<sub>NE</sub>. A temporally extended input driving NE release minutes after the event boundary is likely, since, in anesthetized preparations, the impulse response function of NE release after LC stimulation returns to baseline within tens of seconds, not minutes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. Moreover, large increases in Signal<sub>NE</sub> returned to baseline quickly after transitioning to the mouse home cage. Therefore, NE clearance can occur quickly. In the awake behaving subject, however, brief optogenetic stimulation of LC produces an increase in medial prefrontal NE concentration that takes minutes to decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. The mechanisms by which NE levels are maintained long after LC stimulation are unknown. The LC is the sole source of NE in the hippocampus and release dynamics are jointly dictated by changes in the firing of LC neurons and local modulation of the LC terminals. It is possible that the LC itself receives drive long after the event boundary that decreases systematically over time. Alternatively, electrotonic coupling between LC neurons may underlie phasic NE release<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref></sup>, and perhaps this electrical coupling slowly decays after event boundaries, or LC stimulation. This latter mechanism is motivated by the observation that phasic NE release is likely driven by changes in LC synchrony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. However, single unit recordings from the LC show no increase in firing rate when subjects are transferred to a familiar environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, in contrast to the NE signal observed in the current study. This dissociation suggests local control of NE release independent of somatic action potentials.</p>
<p>In a synaptosome preparation, in which LC terminals located in the hippocampus are dissociated from LC somata, NE is released by NMDA receptor stimulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>, which is modulated by somatostatin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and nicotinic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> receptors also located on the LC axon terminal. Somatostatinâs influence on NE release is independent of membrane depolarization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">88</xref></sup>, thus introducing the possibility that the terminal depolarization may differ from the signal arriving to the post-synaptic neuron. Induction of synaptic plasticity can alter the levels of spill-over glutamate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup> available to bind to NMDAR on LC terminals. One possible explanation for the acceleration of NE decay across days of arena exposure may relate to decreases in spill-over glutamate. If decay rates are dictated by glutamatergic stimulation of the LC terminal, future experiments should test whether these rates differ along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. We predict slower decay in the ventral hippocampus. A diversity of decay rates (perhaps averaged in the present study) may provide more precise information about the time since an event boundary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">94</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">96</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also observed significant and sustained decreases in NE release when mice were moved back to their homecage whose kinetics depended upon the recent history of the subject. NE release in the linear track was systematically elevated from baseline which likely creates decreased subsequent noradrenergic signaling resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. Future studies should test whether learning after transition differs in the high and low NE states.</p>

<title>NE release is enhanced around event boundaries</title>
<p>Event segmentation theory states that event boundaries occur at these prediction errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">97</xref></sup>, which coincide with an abrupt change, or reset, in ongoing activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">98</xref></sup>. Event boundaries have a profound influence on the organization of episodic memory. For example, memory is enhanced for the events immediately following an event boundary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">99</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">100</xref></sup>. This primacy effect exists across encoding modalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">101</xref></sup>, and in animal studies of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">103</xref></sup>. There are also fewer serial transitions across event boundaries during free recall<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, which suggests segregation of memories into discretized episodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">104</xref></sup>. This segregation is particularly evident when networks reorganization (reset) around the transition point, as inferred by decreased correlations in multi-voxel BOLD signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">105</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">107</xref></sup>. NE released from LC terminals is known to correlate with pupil diameter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">108</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">109</xref></sup>, thus providing an indirect (if imperfect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">110</xref></sup>) assessment of LC function in people. Around event boundaries, pupils tend to dilate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, suggesting NE release at these times.</p>
<p>Direct NE measurements in animals show enhanced release in the hippocampus around conditioned and noxious stimuli, as well as following exposure to novel contexts of even handling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">111</xref></sup>. Microdialysis studies lack the temporal resolution to dissociate whether NE release is related to specific stimuli or novelty <italic>per se</italic> versus the associated changes in animal behavior. Prior studies that have used GRAB<sub>NE</sub> in the hippocampus have not attempted to disambiguate these possibilities.</p>
<p>Other recording studies have found LC neuronal activity is related to movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, orienting behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>, and reward consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup> and NE recordings in other brain regions have found correlations with these variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>. We used two techniques to isolate NE signals related to event transitions from those related to reward, movement and overall arousal. First, our statistical modeling showed across a variety of testing conditions that the time elapsed after some environmental change predicted NE release; translational movement, reward, and bouts of exploratory behavior (rearing or object exploration) were poor predictors of Signal<sub>NE</sub>. Next, we developed different protocols in which exploratory behaviors either involved the initiation or the interruption of movement. In neither case did we observe time-locked NE release around bouts of exploration.</p>
<p>Arousal or attention also seem to be unsatisfactory explanatory cognitive constructs to explain the dynamics of hippocampal NE release observed in the present study. In as much as these mental states can exist or be measured in the rodent, situations in which mice systematically engage in more exploration did not change the time course of NE decay after context transition (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Instead, in all cases tested, the hippocampus NE release corresponded to the time elapsed from an unpredicted salient environmental change (context shift or object introduction). Notwithstanding, in a subset of subjects, we did observe transient changes in NE release around rearing events. Though this was not significant at the group level, we speculate that the degree of NE release may be related to the nature of the information acquired during the environmental sampling.</p>

Since stimulation of the midbrain enhances replay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, we hypothesized that NE may also enhance future reactivation. This prediction was not correct, as we did not find any evidence that the neural activity observed following context transition was preferentially reactivated. In fact, we saw that <italic>later</italic> moments were more likely to be reactivated in post-RUN ripples. This reactivation bias is likely due to the autocorrelation of the brain over time in which the neurons active at any given time are more likely to continue to be active due to consistencies in the external environment (or internal milieu) and the slow turn-over in proteins that affect intrinsic excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">125</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">127</xref></sup>. Though we did not quantify replay of the temporal sequences of cell assemblies, a prior report using the same data also failed to observe enhanced replay of moments following transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">128</xref></sup>. Therefore, if a primacy effect occurs after context transitions, it is unlikely to be mediated by, or reflected in, enhanced replay of these moments.

<title>Changes in neural coding around event boundaries</title>
<p>We observed that immediately after an environmental transition, the spatial representation was relatively unique, and settled into a steady-state spatial code over the course of minutes. In familiar spaces, the neural patterns observed in the early moments were more similar to the ultimate steady state. When subjects move between environments, hippocampal place fields remap which involves changes in which neurons express place fields, alterations in which subsets of neurons fire together, and reorganization in the distances between the place fields of simultaneously recorded neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>.

Place fields may be observed on the first trial in a novel environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>, but previous studies have found that extended exposure modifies the hippocampal representation of space in several ways: new fields may be added<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">133</xref></sup>, field asymmetry changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, and firing reliability is enhanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Other changes may occur in the presence of appetitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> or aversive stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The time course for reset around transition, in which neural activity reached its steady state, qualitatively matched that of NE release. It is possible that NE perturbed neural activity away from the stored attractor. The seminal work of Segal and Bloom showed that electrical LC stimulation acutely silenced most hippocampal neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> while enhancing the firing rate of those neurons that fire in response to various stimuli. In anesthetized rats, LC activation causes an increase in the excitability of CA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">134</xref></sup> and dentate gyrus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> neurons, as measured by the amplitude of the population spike after afferent bundle stimulation. <italic>Ex vivo</italic> low-frequency optogenetic stimulation of LC terminals likewise causes an increase in CA1 intrinsic excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. These acute effects are all blocked by Î²-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Therefore, NE-related changes in gain/excitability may cause deviations from a stored neural representation.</p>
<p>Alternatively, prominent models stipulate that area CA1 could be key in the generation of a memory-related surprise signal that redirects attention and drives the release of neuromodulators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In these models, an error signal originates from a âcomparatorâ structure in CA1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">135</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">136</xref></sup>. This hypothesis was motivated by the observation that CA1 neurons are activated by contextual novelty<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">137</xref></sup>, novel objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c138">138</xref></sup>, and novel configurations of familiar objects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c139">139</xref></sup>. Unexpected violations of a learned sequence also cause robust activation of CA1 neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c140">140</xref></sup>, an output that may be used to signal prediction error to arousal circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c141">141</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c142">142</xref></sup>. This error signal may drive NE release through local modulation of LC terminals, or through polysynaptic pathways (e.g. via the paraventricular hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c143">143</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c144">144</xref></sup>). We speculate that an error signal should be proportional to the difference between the instantaneous and steady-state neural representation.</p>
<p>We observed relatively unique neural patterns immediately following event boundaries. Computational models predict that âpattern separationâ yields enhanced memory by virtue of creating neural traces that are less susceptible to interference<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c145">145</xref></sup>. The hippocampal activity patterns observed soon after the transition provide a neural timestamp for those moments that may, in turn, underlie the enhanced subsequent recall that defines the primacy effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3e">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The main limitation of the present study is that NE and neural coding were not studied in the same subjects. Future studies should combine recording modalities and causally link the changes in neural activity and NE signaling through perturbation studies that up- and down-regulate NE and test for changes in hippocampal coding through the lens of representational uniqueness.</p>
<p>Another important limitation of the present study is the lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> calibration of the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor. First, all measurements here are relative to baseline. Future studies should estimate how emission intensities scale with NE concentration <italic>in vivo</italic>. Relatedly, the sensor is expressed everywhere on the neuron, thus providing a read-out of a signal that may not actually be available to the post-synaptic cells. Though most NE signaling occurs via âvolume transmissionâ, noradrenergic receptors do show laminar specificity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c146">146</xref></sup> that is not honored by the membrane insertion patterns of the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor. Finally, the sensor has fast onset (Ï<sub>on</sub> = 0.09 s) and slow offset kinetics (Ï<sub>off</sub> = 1.93 s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Additionally, we smoothed the Signal<sub>NE</sub> which, combined with limitations of the sensors, impose some limitations on the rate of behavioral fluctuations that may be captured in our analyses. The temporal resolution of the sensor has not been calibrated against amperometry or fast cyclic voltammetry, but once such experiments have been done, a deconvolution kernel may be developed to correct for binding kinetics.</p>
<p>Finally, the results have implications for a larger literature focusing on memory enhancement for the events that occur after an event boundary. We define a minutes-long time window in which a potential noradrenergic-dependent primacy effect may be expected, however, we did not quantify learning gains as a function of time from an event boundary. Relating the present observations to memory is an important future direction.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We found that the primary driver of NE release in the dorsal hippocampus is time from some salient environmental change. When NE is elevated, neural activity differs from its steady state, which may promote subsequent retrieval of these moments associated with relatively unique neural representations. Event segmentation disturbances have been observed in a variety of disorders, including: ADHD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c147">147</xref></sup>, schizophrenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c148">148</xref></sup>, and Alzheimerâs Disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup> (a disease in which the LC is particularly affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c150">150</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c151">151</xref></sup>); as well as in normal cognitive decline in aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c149">149</xref></sup>. Trauma can also affect noradrenergic signaling in the hippocampus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c152">152</xref></sup>, which affects how we respond to and cope with stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c153">153</xref></sup>. Future studies that relate NE release to hippocampal network remapping/reset will provide important insight into the comorbid attention and memory deficits associated with these disorders.</p>

<title>Subjects</title>
<p>C57BL/6J mice (N = 8 mice, N = 3 female) were implanted at 3-6 months-old. Data was acquired for up to a year after implantation with no change in signal quality across this extensive timeline. Two surgeries were performed at least two weeks apart, the first to deliver the GRAB<sub>NE</sub> sensor via AAV infusion and the second to implant a fiber optic stub. After viral injection, animals were housed individually on a regular 12:12 h light:dark schedule and tested during the light cycle. Following one week of recovery from the second surgery, mice were recorded at most 5 days/week for up to a year before being euthanized with a sodium pentobarbital cocktail (FatalPlusÂ®, 300 mg/kg I.P.) and transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p>

<title>Viral injections and fiber implant</title>
<p>Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (1.5-2%in pure oxygen) and GRAB<sub>NE</sub> was delivered by injecting AAV9-hSyn-NE2h (titer: â¥ 5Ã10Â¹Â² vg/mL, WZ Biosciences, MD USA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup> unilaterally into the left dorsal hippocampus. Two coordinates were used, both with reference from bregma: coordinate 1 (N = 2 mice) A/P: -2.3, M/L: -2.0 D/V: -1.4 and -1.2 from the brain surface; coordinate 2 (N = 6 mice) A/P: -2.0, M/L: -1.5 D/V: -1.3 and - 1.1 from the brain surface. Coordinate 1 yielded higher signal-to-noise; signals recorded from both coordinates showed the same qualitative dynamics around event boundaries. In all cases, the virus was injected at two depths each at a volume of 150-nL and a rate of 30 nL/min using a Nanoliter 2020 Injector (WPI). At least two weeks later, fiber optic stubs (10 mm borosilicate mono fiber-optic cannulas from Doric lenses; MFC_400/430-0.66_10.0mm_MF1.25_FLT) were implanted at the injection site. To secure the stubs to the subject, the surface of the exposed skull was covered with C&amp;B MetabondÂ® (Parkell, NY USA), and the sides of the exposed fiber-optic cannula were coated in Unifast LC dental acrylic (SourceOne Dental, Inc, AZ USA) for stability. Finally, clips (Neuralynx, AZ USA) were added to minimize motion artifact due to slippage at the mating sleeve. Postoperatively, animals received a single injection of 0.1-mg/kg of buprenorphine (S.C.) and again as needed for the next 1-3 days.</p>

<title>Fiber photometry recording procedures</title>
<p>Prior to the first recording session, we allowed a minimum of three weeks from the viral injection procedure to allow the virus sufficient time to transfect and express. Signals were captured with a LUX RZ10X processor running the Synapse software (Tucker-Davis Technologies, FL). Experimental (465 nm, carrier frequency = 330 Hz) and isosbestic (405 nm, carrier frequency = 210 Hz) wavelengths were combined using a fluorescent MiniCube (FMC4_IE(400-410)_E(460-490)_F(500-550)_S; Doric, QC Canada) and delivered to the subject with a 4-m low auto fluorescence mono fiber-optic patch cord (core = 400-Âµm; NA = 0.57; Doric, QC Canada). Excitation intensity of the isosbestic and experimental wavelengths was adjusted to equalize emission intensity, which was sampled at 1017.3 Hz.</p>

<title>Novel arena</title>
<p>On the first day, mice were transferred to three novel arenas (dimensions in <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). First, a 10-minute homecage (HC) baseline was captured, then mice were manually transferred to a novel arena (Context A) and back to their homecage for 10 minutes. This procedure was performed again for Contexts B and C (HC-Context A-HC-Context B-HC-Context C-HC). On following days, a 10-minute baseline period was run, followed by 10 minutes of exposure to Context A, and another 10 minutes in the home cage (HC-Context A-HC). On Day 10, the procedure from the first day was repeated.</p>

<title>Spontaneous Object Recognition</title>
<p>On Day 0, mice were allowed to acclimate to a clean and empty cage for 30 minutes. This cage had a hook-and-loop fastener for later object placement. On Day 1, we recorded a 10-minute baseline in the clean and empty cage. Then, five novel objects were sequentially affixed to the hook-and-loop fastener in the cage, each for five minutes with no interval between objects. After the fifth object was removed, the animal remained in the empty cage for another 10 minutes.</p>

<title>Linear track</title>
<p>Water-restricted mice were trained to run laps on a 1.2m linear track for water reward (15ÂµL) which was delivered at each end of the track after mice crossed an IR sensor to trigger a wall-mounted solenoid. Mice ran between 3-17 laps (mean = 8.1 laps) in 286-1500s (mean = 658s). In these sessions (N = 110), there was a 10-minute homecage period before mice were transferred to the linear track. Once mice stopped running for water for at least 30s, they were returned to the home cage for 10 minutes.

<title>Signal Analysis</title>
<sec id="s4a6a">
<title>Estimation of Signal<sub>NE</sub></title>
<p>The demuxed experimental and isosbestic signals both exhibited evidence of photobleaching, though with different decay rates. Therefore, we fit a double exponential to the first 10 minutes of each signal to estimate and extrapolate a mean signal which was subtracted from the observed emission intensities. Next, the isosbestic was scaled to the experimental signal using standard linear regression. The isosbestic was then subtracted from the experimental signal, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated over the first 10 minutes. These values were used to normalize Signal<sub>NE</sub> which is measured in terms of baseline standard deviations from the baseline mean. Finally, the signal was smoothed with a Gaussian kernel (1-s s.t.d.).</p>
<p>We opted against a sliding window dF/F calculation, as we did not want to impose a minutes-long timescale to our analysis and we opted against divisive normalization directly to the isosbestic as photobleaching dominated the fluctuations in the isosbestic signal and this rate differed from that experimental signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c154">154</xref></sup>. We adopted the mean and standard deviation from the baseline period (rather than the entire session), as some of our experimental conditions (e.g. desipramine infusions) dramatically changed the mean Signal<sub>NE</sub> values over long periods of time. We are aware that subtractive isosbestic correction (instead of divisive) may distort the relative amplitudes of signals recorded early versus late into the session<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c155">155</xref></sup>. These concerns are mitigated here as the main decreases in emission intensity due to photobleaching occurred within the 10-minute baseline period. Moreover, we observed stable responses across â¼1-hr of recording (e.g. see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and a reliable return to baseline Signal<sub>NE</sub> values in the final home cage recordings.</p>

<title>Statistical modeling of Signal<sub>NE</sub></title>
<p>Signal<sub>NE</sub> at each moment was estimated as a function of various behavioral variables which differed according to the testing paradigm.</p>
<p>In the novel arena experiments, Signal<sub>NE</sub> was estimated as a function of acceleration (<italic>acc</italic>), velocity (<italic>vel</italic>), normalized distance from the edge (<italic>distedg</italic>), time from context transfer (<italic>t1</italic>), and time from rearing onset (<italic>t2</italic>), see <xref rid="eqn1" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 1</xref>. Acceleration and velocity were calculated using a second-order Kalman filter of the head location (right and left ear locations estimated with DeepLabCut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c156">156</xref></sup>). Normalized distance to the edge was calculated as the distance to the nearest edge divided by the maximum distance to an edge possible. In some cases, the animal could extend its head beyond the wall of the arena and these values were coded as negative.
<disp-formula id="eqn1">

</disp-formula>
Time from transition/rearing was modeled with two terms: a positive term Î²<sub>4/6</sub> with a fast exponential decay Ï<sub>1/3</sub> and a negative term Î²<sub>5/7</sub> with a slower exponential decay Ï<sub>2/4</sub>. To avoid degeneracy, Ï<sub>1/3</sub> was bounded between 0.1-0.001 and Ï<sub>2/4</sub> was bounded between 0.001-0.0001. All Î² values were bound at Â±10 s.t.d. Point estimates for the 12 free parameters (Î²<sub>0-7</sub> and Ï<sub>1-4</sub>) were calculated with MATLAB R2021b using the fmincon non-linear optimizer against a regularized objective (<xref rid="eqn2" ref-type="disp-formula">Equation 2</xref>) defined by the mean squared error (MSE) with a penalty for model complexity (Î» = 0.001). Fits were robust to initial conditions.
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<graphic xlink:href="605900v2_eqn2.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
We performed 50/50 cross-validation, with the model trained on even days and tested on odd, or vice-versa. The cross-validate mean-squared error (CVMSE) was used to assess model fit (the regularization term is dropped here).</p>
<p>To assess the importance of each behavioral independent variable (and intercept), we excluded all terms related to those variables in a backwards stepwise regression analysis. For example, removing time from context transfer removed four terms: Î²<sub>4</sub>, Î²<sub>5</sub>,Ï<sub>1</sub>,Ï<sub>2</sub>. The cross-validation employed here ensures that model performance should not suffer more simply due to removing more free parameters, as demonstrated by the stability of the model after removing the four terms related to rearing (or reward in the case of the linear track). CVMSE for the saturated and reduced model was compared by computing the percent change in CVMSE.
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<graphic xlink:href="605900v2_eqn3.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>

A similar approach was adopted for modeling Signal<sub>NE</sub> during novel object exposure, except we included a binary indicator function for whether the mouse was sampling the object (snout touching the object) and the time from event boundary, <italic>t3</italic>, was the time from object introduction; we dropped the term related to rearing. Parameters were estimated for each subject and 50/50 cross-validation was done by splitting each session in half (first half training, second half test).

<graphic xlink:href="605900v2_eqn4.gif" mime-subtype="gif" mimetype="image"/>
</disp-formula>
For the linear track, we considered: velocity, acceleration, distance from edge, time from transfer to the track (<italic>t1</italic>), and time from reward (<italic>t4</italic>). Parameters were estimated for each subject and cross-validation was done by considering even training and odd testing days (or vice versa).

In all cases, to determine the significance of a parameterâs removal, we performed Student t-test on the CVMSE values (testing against <italic>h<sub>0</sub></italic> CVMSE = 0) with degrees of freedom defined by the number of subjects. To compare changes in parameters across days, we used a mixed-effects linear model, with days of exposure defined as a fixed effect and subject as a random effect.

<p>Data was downloaded from The Buzsaki Lab Databank (Project: Place field-memory field unity of hippocampal neurons)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c157">157</xref></sup>. As described in Huszar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, chronic recordings were performed from freely moving adult C57BL/6J mice (N = 3 mice; subjID: e13_26m1, e15_13f1, e16_3m2) using high-density ASSY Int64-P32-1D or ASSY Int128-P64-1D silicon probes (Diagnostic Biochips, MD USA). In these experiments, probes were implanted over the right dorsal hippocampus (A/P -2.0, M/L +1.7) and lowered to the deep neocortical layers, while the drive was cemented to the skull. A stainless-steel screw was placed over the cerebellum for grounding and reference. Neural signals were recorded in the homecage while probes were lowered into the CA1 pyramidal layer, which was identified physiologically via the sharp wave polarity reversal. Neural data were amplified and digitized at 30-kHz using Intan amplifier boards (RHD2132/RHD2000, Evaluation System, Intan Technologies, CA USA).

<p>Over weeks, mice were over-trained on a spatial alternation task in a figure-eight maze (see Huszar et al. 2022, for full details). Animals were water restricted before the start of experiments and familiarized with the figure-eight maze. Mice were trained to visit alternate arms between trials to receive a water reward in the first corner reached after making a correct left/right turn after which, a 5-s delay in the start area was introduced between trials. To explore the reorganization of place tuning across different environments, the same mice were introduced to novel environments after running in the familiar figure-8 maze. In the sessions analyzed here (N=8), animals underwent recording sessions consisting of a â¼120-min home cage period, running on the familiar figure-eight maze, â¼60-min home cage period, running in a novel environment, followed by a final â¼120-min home cage period. In some sessions, animals were exposed to two distinct novel environments, with a â¼60-min home cage period in between (only one transition to a novel environment was chosen per session to analyze here). We considered transitions to novel linear tracks (N = 3 sessions), novel figure-8 mazes (N = 3 sessions), and a novel arena (N = 1 session). Mazes were placed in distinct recording rooms, or in different corners of the same recording room, with distinct enclosures to ensure unique visual cues.

Next, these population firing rate vectors were correlated with those recorded on the track (in 100-ms bins). To assess whether the observed Pearson R was greater than expected by chance, a bootstrap null distribution was created by shifting each neuronâs activity observed on any given ripple to a random other ripple observed during the session, thus preserving the single-cell mean ripple recruitment rate, but destroying patterns of synchrony observed across the ensemble. This procedure was repeated 1000 times, so that we could ask, for each ripple, if the observed Pearson R greater than 99.9% of the shuffles.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of norepinephrine (NE) signaling in the hippocampus during event transitions, positing that NE release serves as a mechanism for marking event boundaries to facilitate episodic memory segmentation. The authors use a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator (GRABNE) to measure NE release with high temporal precision, correlating these signals with changes in hippocampal firing dynamics. By integrating photometry data, behavioral analyses, and analysis of neuronal activity from publicly available datasets, the work addresses fundamental questions about the relationship between neuromodulatory signals and memory encoding.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present a compelling framework linking NE signaling to event boundaries, offering insight into how episodic memory segmentation may occur in the brain. The writing is clear and the data are well-described. It is easy to follow. The pharmacological validation of the GRABNE sensor enhances confidence in their NE measurements, an important methodological strength given the potential limitations of fluorescence-based neuromodulatory indicators. Moreover, the authors carefully disentangle NE signals from confounding behavioral variables, providing evidence that NE release is time-locked to event boundaries rather than movement or arousal-related behaviors. This level of analytical rigor strengthens their central claims. Additionally, the observation of NE signal dynamics that decay over hundreds of seconds is interesting, as it aligns with timescales relevant to hippocampal plasticity reported in prior literature.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the authors establish correlations between NE signaling and hippocampal activity changes, causation is not demonstrated. Future studies using perturbative approaches (e.g., optogenetic or chemogenetic manipulation of NE release) would be necessary to establish a direct causal link. Furthermore, the persistence of NE signals over long timescales (hundreds of seconds) raises questions about its role in encoding rapid event boundaries, as it is unclear how this prolonged signaling might affect memory encoding for closely spaced events. The lack of a discussion about how NE dynamics would operate in such scenarios weakens the proposed framework. Finally, while the authors acknowledge the limitations of the GRABNE sensor, a more detailed exploration of how sensor sensitivity might influence their results would enhance the interpretation of their findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors use a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor, GRABNE, to measure NE dynamics in the dorsal hippocampus of mice in response to multiple behavioral manipulations. A non-linear model and regression were used to quantitatively assess the contribution of multiple behavioral covariates to changes in NE signaling, with the result that NE signal dynamics were best predicted by time from event transitions, with the signal exponentially decaying over a period of seconds to minutes after transitions. Event transitions were implemented as a transfer from a home cage to a novel arena, a transfer to a familiar linear track, and the introduction of novel objects. Additional experiments showed that spatial context transitions dominate NE signaling over novel object presentations, and experience accelerates the decay of the NE signal after spatial context transitions. Correspondingly, the hippocampal CA1 spatial code takes minutes to stabilize after context transition in both novel and familiar spaces.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A strength of the study is the use of the NE sensor with sub-second resolution, non-linear modeling, and regression to identify the prominent variable of interest as time from event transition, and multiple behavioral controls. The use of multiple behavioral designs to investigate the effect of familiarity, experience, and interaction of spatial context transitions and novel object introduction is a strength. Relating the dynamics of NE signal decay to the rate of CA1 spatial code changes is also a strength.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A minor weakness is that the concept of an event boundary needs to be more broadly discussed. The manuscript uses event transitions such as spatial context changes and novel object introduction to implement an event boundary. However, especially in episodic memory studies in humans, event structure and boundaries have also been shown to occur through the automatic segmentation of experiences into discrete events (Baldassano et al., Neuron, 2017; Radvansky and Zacks, Curr. Opi. Behav. Sci, 2017). The rodent experiments in the current manuscript explicitly introduce event boundaries through changes in context or objects, which can potentially be conflated with novelty. A discussion of these differences, and whether NE can also have a role in event boundary transitions based on automatic segmentation of experiences, will add to the impact of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The manuscript investigates the role of norepinephrine (NE) release in the rodent hippocampus during event boundaries, such as transitions between spatial contexts and the introduction of novel objects. It also explores how NE release is altered by experience and how novelty drives the amplitude and decay times of extracellular NE. By utilizing the GRABNE sensor for sub-second resolution measurement of NE, the authors demonstrate that NE release is driven primarily by the time elapsed since an event boundary and is independent of behaviors like movement or reward. The study further explores how hippocampal neural representations are altered over time, showing that these representations stabilize shortly after event transitions, potentially linking NE release to episodic memory encoding.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>Overall, the work provides novel insights into the interplay between NE signaling and hippocampal activity and presents an intriguing hypothesis on how NE release may help push hippocampal activity into unique attractor states to encode novel experiences. The experiments are well-controlled, and the analysis is well-presented, with a detailed and engaging discussion that points towards several new and exciting research directions. The use of several behavioral paradigms to demonstrate the strongest predictor of NE release is a strength, as well as the regression analysis to disambiguate the contribution of other correlated variables. The suggestion that NE does not select ensembles for subsequent replay is also an interesting result.</p>
<p>Weaknesses</p>
<p>The authors have not convincingly established a link between hippocampal neural activity and NE release, showing qualitative rather than quantitative correlations. Therefore, at this stage, the role of NE on hippocampal function remains speculative.</p>
<p>Another general concern is that the smoothing/ kinetics of the sensor impacts the regression analyses. Most of the other variables, such as speed, acceleration, and even reward time points are highly dynamic and it is possible that the limitations of the sensor decorrelate the signal from (potentially) causal variables, therefore resulting in the time since the event start having the most explanatory power for most of the analyses.</p>
<p>More broadly, the figure legends should be expanded to better describe error bounds, mean vs median, sample sizes, and averaging choices for plots.</p>
<p>There are also some concerns regarding the nearest neighbor analysis and the reported differences in the rate of reactivations after familiar and novel environments, as outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) Lines 657-658. How far away in time can the top three nearest neighbor time points be? Must they lie in different trials, or can they also be within the same trial? Is there a systematic difference in the average time lags for the nearest neighbors over the course of the session?</p>
<p>The authors should only allow nearest neighbors to be in a different lap because systematic changes in behavior (running fast initially) might force earlier time bins in a certain location to match with a different trial, while the later time bins can be from within the same trial if the mice are moving slower and stay in the same spatial bin location longer. The authors should also provide information on how the averaging is performed because there are several axes of variability - spatial bin locations, sessions, different environments, and animals.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 8: These results are very interesting. However, I am confused by the differences between Figure 8B and D because the significant reactivations in A and C are very similar. The 1-minute and 10-minute windows seem somewhat arbitrary and prone to noise and variability. Perhaps the authors should fit a slope for the curves on A and C and compare whether the slope/ intercept are significantly different between the novel and familiar environments.</p>
