<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Fluorescence microscopy is a fundamental tool in the life sciences, but the availability of sophisticated equipment required to yield high-quality, quantitative data is a major bottleneck in data production in many laboratories worldwide. This problem has long been recognized and the abundancy of low-cost electronics and the simplification of fabrication through 3D-printing have led to the emergence of open-source scientific hardware as a research field. Cost effective fluorescence microscopes can be assembled from cheaply mass-produced components, but lag behind commercial solutions in image quality. On the other hand, blueprints of sophisticated microscopes such as light-sheet or super-resolution systems, custom-assembled from high quality parts are available, but require a high level of expertise from the user.</p><p>Here we combine the UC2 microscopy toolbox with high-quality components and integrated electronics and software to assemble an automated high-resolution fluorescence microscope. Using this microscope, we demonstrate high resolution fluorescence imaging for fixed and live samples. When operated inside an incubator, long-term live-cell imaging over several days was possible. Our microscope reaches single molecule sensitivity, and we performed single particle tracking and SMLM super-resolution microscopy experiments in cells. Our setup costs a fraction of its commercially available counterparts but still provides a maximum of capabilities and image quality. We thus provide a proof of concept that high quality scientific data can be generated by lay users with a low-budget system and open-source software. Our system can be used for routine imaging in laboratories that do not have the means to acquire commercial systems and through its affordability can serve as teaching material to students.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fluorescence microscopy is, due to its excellent contrast, specificity and compatibility with live cell imaging, an essential tool in the life sciences. Digital imaging, quantitative analysis and ever higher throughput and resolution in new techniques make fluorescence microscopy more important than ever. Nevertheless, while the development of high-end instrumentation pushes forward our progress in understanding cellular processes, spatial and temporal resolution are not the only challenges impeding progress in scientific discovery. This is because necessarily, the access to cutting-edge instrumentation is reserved to a subset of scientists as a result of its cost and technical complexity, effectively limiting data production to laboratories with access to substantial resources. At the same time, cost of electronic or optical components, powerful processors and high-quality cameras are at an all-time low. Together with simple prototyping through 3D-printing, this has led to the emergence of open-source scientific hardware as a research field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wenzel, 2023</xref>). The open-source microscopy community has experienced the rapid development of different approaches aiming to make microscopy more available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alsamsam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Ambrose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Auer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Danial et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Diederich et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hohlbein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sharkey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Voigt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wenzel, 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>The first iterations of open-source microscopes came from microscopy laboratories that tried to provide similar quality data as commercial systems while being assembled from components for lower overall cost, however still requiring significant expertise. Solutions now exist for single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alsamsam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Auer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Holm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kwakwa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Martens et al., 2019</xref>), they include modular platforms (H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2020</xref>), light sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Berry et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Schröder et al., 2020</xref>) and even sophisticated special solutions such as light sheet microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Voigt et al., 2019</xref>), spinning disc microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Halpern et al., 2022</xref>) and high-throughput applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Walzik et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, another group of investigators tried to provide extremely cost-effective microscopy solutions that are accessible to everyone. The result are solutions that can be useful in detecting e.g. parasites in inaccessible regions of the world for simple diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2019</xref>), but are incompatible with quantitative scientific imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Chagas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cybulski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diederich et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sharkey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Vera et al., 2016</xref>). Most of these solutions lack excitation and emission for fluorescence imaging.</p>
<p>Here, we propose an instrument filling the gap between the low-cost open-source instruments for the general public and high-quality fluorescence imaging, as required for scientific research in molecular cell biology. We provide an automated high-resolution microscope with single molecule sensitivity that can be fully assembled and steered by lay users. Our system is based on the UC2 toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diederich et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) using common optical elements, affordable electronic components and 3D printed parts and is combined with a high NA objective, motorized stage and intuitive GUI-based operation.</p>
<p>The result is a cost efficient and user-friendly high-resolution fluorescence microscope that is compatible with long-term live-cell imaging, single particle tracking and single molecule localization microscopy. All designs for the 3D parts, software and electronics are open-source (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We here describe microscope assembly, benchmarking and a number of high-resolution microscopy assays performed with our microscope.</p>

<title>Assembly of a high-resolution UC2 microscope</title>
<p>We aimed to generate a cost-effective, high-resolution widefield fluorescence microscope that allows us to perform a variety of common cell biological imaging experiments. These include standard high-resolution diffraction limited immunofluorescence imaging, long-term live-cell imaging, single particle tracking and super-resolution microscopy. To fulfill these criteria, we reasoned that our system should have: i) excitation and detection powerful and sensitive enough for single molecule localization, thus requiring a laser and an appropriate detector. ii) capability to operate inside an incubator for long-term live-cell imaging, thus requiring small size and automation. iii) an intuitive and user-friendly GUI for maximal accessibility. Lastly, the entire system including the physical microscope, the electronics and the software must be open-source and be possible to assemble and operate with moderate technical know-how (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). We reasoned that the quality of the objective is paramount to image quality, while most other optical parts of a light microscope can be mass-produced components. Furthermore, such a high-quality objective allows for the swift diagnosis of problems in the assembly of the optical path due to its high resolution and minimal chromatic and spatial aberrations. We decided to use an Olympus 1.49 NA oil objective, but any high-quality objective can be incorporated in our system, by adapting the objective mount to the requirements of the objectives’ manufacturer.</p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the guidelines described above and to ensure adaptability and modularity, we decided to build our open-source automated microscope on the basis of the UC2 toolbox using its injection molded cubes for the structural assembly. For ease of usage, we used an inverted configuration and assembled the microscope in three layers to keep the size and design compact (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The high-precision x-y sample table and z-stage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref>) were low-cost commercial solutions that we motorized and implemented into the open-source, python-based microscope GUI as automated elements of the microscope. The emission pathway at the bottom of the microscope assembly is based on an Alvium 1800 U-158c CMOS camera from Allied Vision, which compared to conventional scientific cameras is more affordable by a factor of 30 to 60 times at the time of submission (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>), more compact and consumes less energy. One important point here is that the camera needs to be monochromatic as the Bayer pattern on a polychromatic camera would significantly reduce the sampling as well as the quantum efficiency of a camera chip, which is already lower compared to that of scientific cameras. The camera was connected to the computer via USB 3.0, allowing fast data transfer and maximal compatibility. Between the emission pathway and the sample stage, the excitation pathway contained a low-cost 635 nm diode laser with an optional beam expander (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref>), that depending on the illumination requirements could be inserted or removed, modulating the illumination density and homogeneity of the excitation field (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>). To trigger the laser, control laser power and to steer the x, y and z motors for focus and sample translation, we used a low-cost Arduino-coded board that can be connected via USB3.0 to any computer. Electronics on the board and the USB-camera are then directly controlled via an adapted GUI of the python-based open-source software ImSwitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moreno et al. 2021</xref>), resulting in a fully automated microscope. Additionally, ImSwitch includes the “ImScript” an automation feature, which allows to execute a sequence of written <italic>Python</italic> commands with user defined parameters e.g. overnight time-series imaging experiments.</p>

</fig>
<p>Furthermore, we took advantage of the open-source (OS) nature of ImSwitch and implemented the recently presented OS SMLM algorithms microEye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alsamsam et al., 2022</xref>) to realize an online-running localization framework that gives instant qualitative feedback if the sample preparation works as expected. In addition, the feedback of these online-running image processing algorithms can be looped back into the hardware control to eventually compensate possible drift (e.g. autofocus). A large variety of available napari plugins can be used to directly work on the data without moving them to a different computer.</p>
<p>All steerable electronics could alternatively be controlled with a PS4 controller for increased user-friendliness. The assembly can be housed with 3D printed walls to block ambient light and increase laser safety. In <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, a list of the different microscope and software elements and the repository addresses to the corresponding materials and methods is displayed. A comprehensive online repository provides the bill of materials (BOM), as well as a set of instructions on how to setup the soft- and hardware (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>While assembling and testing the microscope excitation and detection, we observed a recurrent pattern when we imaged a coverslip homogeneously covered with fluorescent molecules. Since we only used a dichromatic mirror (for separation of excitation and emission light), we first tested, whether a different emission (ET665lp) filter would remove the pattern. This was not the case. Spectrometric measurement of the excitation laser beam confirmed that our low-cost laser had minor bands in the wavelength range of 650 - 670 nm, which we could remove using an additional band pass excitation filter (ZET635/20X). Our finding encouraged us in our approach to mix low-budget components with high quality optics. Focusing and positioning of the sample is done with commercial low-budget stages that offer great long-term stability. To render all three axes of movement computer controlled, we first motorized an x-y stage via torque transmission form the motor to the micrometer screws of the stage via timing belts. Secondly, we incorporated a motorized lead screw-driven (NEMA11, 50mm, Amazon, 50€) z-stage holding the objective into the modular design of the microscope.</p>

<title>Imaging experiments</title>
<p>We first used our microscope to image a sample of fixed mammalian cells stained against tubulin via immunofluorescence using AF647. When we imaged these cells with moderate laser intensity, beam expander and 50 ms integration time, we found that cells were evenly illuminated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) and microtubules appeared as diffraction-limited lines inside cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). To quantify flatness of illumination, we made use of a red auto-fluorescent benchmarking slide (Chroma). The measured fluorescence intensity was quite homogenous across the field of view, with variations of up to 25% of the maximal fluorescence intensity towards the edges (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>).</p>
<p>These conditions are compatible with high quality fluorescence microscopy in life science research. To test the stability of our system, we then imaged sub-diffraction fluorescent beads repeatedly over time. When we then calculated the displacement of the beads over time, we consistently found drift of less than 1 μm over 2 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). We concluded that our microscope may be suitable for imaging experiments that require repeated measurements of the same field of view such as live-cell imaging. We thus mounted live cells at room temperature on the optical table on our microscope and stained them with SiR-actin (Spirochrome). When we then repeatedly illuminated the cells with moderate laser power to excite SiR-actin fluorescence and with white light in transmission mode to image the cells, we found that the cells tolerated acquisition conditions for several hours without damage visible in fluorescence or widefield image (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). As expected, drift was negligible. Importantly, we found similar stability against drift over time, when we performed this experiment not on an optical table, but a wetlab bench over a layer of foam material as a damping layer. This suggested that our microscope might be suitable for long-term imaging in an environment that does not provide vibration damping, such as a cell culture incubator. Given that our microscope assembly is of small size, and connected via two flexible USB cables, we then moved on to perform live-cell imaging over longer periods in a cell culture incubator.</p>

</fig>
<p>To do so, we used a standard 37 °C CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. The longer USB cables connecting the microscope to the exterior allowed for steering from the outside. When we plated live T98G cancer cells on coverslips and mounted them on the microscope sample holder in warm medium inside the incubator, they exhibited normal morphology and growth over many hours. When we performed a long-term imaging experiment using Syto deep-red fluorescence staining of the nucleus (Thermo Fisher), we found that cells kept dividing and moving on the coverslip for several days (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). We concluded that our setup was compatible with long-term live-cell imaging of cells.</p>

<p>Next, we aimed to further explore the single molecule capabilities of our microscope and performed single particle tracking (SPT) experiments on live CV-1 African green monkey cells stably expressing GPI-GFP. When we incubated these cells with streptavidin 655 nm quantum dots (QDs) coupled to biotin-tagged anti-GFP nanobodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>), we detected QDs readily as single diffraction limited entities on cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>). When we then localized emission centers and tracked the QDs over time, we could generate trajectories over many frames (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5c,d</xref>) and extract parameters describing particle movement such as the diffusion coefficient (D, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5e</xref>) and the moment scaling spectrum (MSS, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5f</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Ewers et al., 2005</xref>)). Our measurements were in agreement with our previous observations (J. H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<p>Since we were readily able to detect single quantum dots, which are single emitters of few nanometers in size, we reasoned, it might be possible to perform single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) experiments as well. We immuno-stained CV-1 cells against tubulin using AF647 coupled secondary antibodies and incubated coverslips in BME/GLOX buffer for effective pumping into the dark state. When we then illuminated our sample with high intensity laser light (in our case ∼ 1kW/cm<sup>2</sup>), we found that the intense staining quickly faded and gave way to the typically observed blinking in SMLM experiments. We took a timeseries of 30’000 frames and localized the detected emitters using <italic>Thunderstorm</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ovesný et al., 2014</xref>). Even though we were limited to widefield illumination, we achieved a drastic improvement in resolution in reconstructed SMLM micrographs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref>). When we measured the profile of individual microtubules, we could easily detect the typical “railroad track” pattern with a spacing of 38 – 43 nm, indicative of high quality SMLM imaging (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b,c</xref>). To quantify the achieved resolution, we used Fourier ring correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nieuwenhuizen et al., 2013</xref>) and found that the overall achieved resolution was 93 nm, clearly below the optical resolution limit (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6d</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we developed a cost effective, high-quality automated microscope that can be assembled by laypeople with minimal background knowledge in optics, electronics and informatics. The assembly guidelines including CAD files of the 3D printed parts, list of used components and software are openly accessible on the Github repositories (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), thus offering maximal availability.</p>
<p>Our microscope is based on a simple modular assembly system called UC2 (You.See.Too., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Diederich et al., 2019a</xref>)). This framework is based on modular cubes that can hold different optical components in place and allow for simplified alignment and assembly. This flexibility furthermore facilitates the replacement of any lens, filter, laser camera or other components, allowing the user to implement already available parts into their setup, or to further trim down the setup by removing unused parts. We made use of an improved version where the cubes are made through injection molding, which provides a significantly higher manufacturing precision than the same cubes fabricated using 3D-printing, resulting in greater mechanical stability and reproducibility, while being available at low cost through mass production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wang et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The hereby provided increased structural integrity makes the setup portable allows it to be reproducibly built and dismantled within hours. This facilitates its use in remote areas. Improved versions or updated parts could easily be shared digitally and printed locally, further promoting the advantage of digital manufacturing in the laboratory. The here created assembly can easily be replicated multiple times to increase imaging throughput still for a fraction of the cost of a single high-end microscope.</p>
<p>We present data in standard immunofluorescence microscopy, live-cell microscopy and long-term live-cell microscopy assays performed inside an incubator. Furthermore, we show single particle tracking data of semiconductor quantum dots on live cells and single molecule localization based super-resolution microscopy. In all cases, the quality of data we generated is comparable to those generated by systems orders of magnitude more expensive.</p>
<p>Our system thus allows for sophisticated imaging assays to be performed at a professional level with greatly reduced cost. At the same time, electronic control of components and remote steering of the microscope can be implemented without background knowledge in electronics. This makes the generation of high-quality image data accessible especially for life science research groups with limited monetary means also in lower income countries. The main limitation of our system in this direction is the requirement of a high-NA objective, the by far most expensive component of the setup. Since for scientific imaging, high quality data and thus high-NA and corrected objectives are essential, this component cannot be replaced. However, the quality of low-cost objectives has recently been improving, even with objectives allowing for effective single molecule detection. The reduced NA diminishes the localization precision and the signal to noise ratio, thus limiting the possible applications. Development of brighter dyes might also be an alternative to improve the imaging quality enough to account for low budget lasers and filters.</p>
<p>Due to its modular assembly, extensions may be easily implemented to our microscope. Depending on the specific research aim, multiple excitation and emission wavelengths may be desirable, but would require a redesign of the frame to incorporate motorized filter switching and more light sources. Alternatively, multiband filters in combination with fiber-coupled and thus combinable laser sources are also possible. In the future, the possibilities of this system could be significantly expanded by adding more modules specific for additional capabilities and we specifically invite the community to do so. Especially the combination with a low-budget spinning disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Halpern et al., 2022</xref>), TIRF illumination or light-sheet imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Diederich et al., 2020</xref>) are possible future applications.</p>
<p>Further steps towards user-friendliness include the replacement of the laser light-source by a high-power LED to reduce the requirement of laser safety. Another step would be to render the electronics assembly fully plugable, thus eliminating the soldering steps that are required in the current assembly.</p>
<p>Besides the application in basic research, this cheap and easy to assemble setup would be useful for teaching the next generation of scientists that more than ever have to be able to synthesize capabilities spanning several disciplines. We endorse making scientific instruments available for more scientists, students as well as the general public. Our system builds on efforts in open science regarding software (ImSwitch,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Moreno et al., 2021</xref>) and microscope hardware (UC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Diederich et al., 2019a</xref>)) while benefitting from a growing field of open-source microscopy and laboratory hardware in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Auer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hohlbein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Martens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Wenzel, 2023</xref>). Taken together with efforts in making fluorescent dyes available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lavis, 2021</xref>), fundamental obstacles to the free diffusion of capabilities and know-how in science are being removed. We hope that our live-cell high-resolution incubator microscope (U.C.STORM) will catalyze these efforts.</p>

<p>In the components list, a detailed table describes all the different pieces used for the microscope, including the price of each component. The CAD designs as well as further information about UC2 or setup building can be found on the Github repository (see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). XY and Z stages were commercially bought for their low price and convenient use but custom-made versions to print and build can be found on the UC2 repository (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In the slicing software Prusa slicer, the original Prusa i3 MK3S &amp; MK3S+ printer was set. The parts were printed with the 0.15 mm SPEED or 0.15 mm QUALITY settings. The two materials used in this project were the Prusament PLA (Polylactic Acid) and Prusament ABS (Acrylnitril-Butadien-Styrol) filaments (both from Prusa), which can both be selected in the slicing software ABS was used wherever heavy loads may deform the setup in the event of temperature gradients (e.g. objective mount).</p>
<p>Materials were printed with PLA infill (20 - 40%) (T<sub>print</sub>= 215 °C; T<sub>bed</sub>= 60 °C). Materials printed with ABS infill (20 - 40%) (T<sub>print</sub>= 255 °C; T<sub>bed</sub>= 100 °C).</p>

<title>UC2 setup assembly</title>
<p>In the UC2 system, optical components were mounted in standardized cubes. To make alignment possible over an optical excitation or emission path over several cubes distance, the components must experience a large enough degree of freedom within the cubes so they can be moved manually in angle and exact position, but low enough to keep components immobile over prolonged time periods. The challenge presented by tilted optics can on the one side be addressed during the design process; broader mounts/adapters are less prone to tilt due to higher contact surface with the cube. Once the optics were orthogonal to the light path, their position in relation to the optical axis was set manually with highest possible accuracy, using appropriate mounts.</p>
<p>The fine adjustment was done with tiltable mirrors, as using translational mounts for every optical element would be complex to produce or costly. A helpful tool for adjustment was to position an aperture in the excitation pathway. The maximum of the laser spot was set to be in the center of the aperture hole and was adjusted using the mirror. The emission path was adapted in the same way, as imaging a fluorescent surface allows to position the maximal laser intensity spot on the center of the detector field of view (also with a mirror).</p>
<p>The setup entails two imaging channels: the laser induced fluorescence (excitation path) and the LED top-light illumination (650 nm Star LED, Cree, 3W, brightfield). The top-light light source is mechanically detangled from the stages to remain unaltered by sample motion. As the filter cube in the microscope is immobile, the top-light illumination requires either a high-power white LED or an LED that emits light in a wavelength range that is not blocked by the dichromatic mirror or the emission filter (in our case 650-660 nm).</p>

<title>Image acquisition and control software</title>
<p>For the microscopy control, acquisition and reconstruction software, we chose ImSwitch because its modular design adapts very well to the inherently modular nature of the cube-based optics platform. A novel firmware “UC2-ESP32” was developed, which is fully integrated into the python-based ImSwitch structure. Using a unified REST API-like interface, lasers, motors, LEDs, LED arrays and readout sensors can be controlled serially via WiFi and USB. To ensure wide distribution of this device adapter, we used a readily available hardware module that can control multiple stepper motors and easily adapt other hardware components such as the LEDs and lasers. An online-based flash tool loads the latest firmware onto the Wemos ESP32 D1 R32 in combination with the CNC Shield to create a fully functional microscopy control unit. Detailed documentation can be found in the online documentation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://youseetoo.github.io/">https://youseetoo.github.io/</ext-link>). A Python library “UC2-REST” adapts the USB serial and integrates it into the ImSwitch software. In this project, the strengths of open-source were fully unleashed by extending the control and acquisition algorithm ImSwitch with an online SMLM reconstruction algorithm by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alsamsam et al., 2022</xref>). The user can select different parameters from the MicroEye framework to locate blinking events directly in the Napari viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sofroniew et al., 2022</xref>) to directly track possible reconstruction or sample artefacts.

<title>Illumination</title>
<p>When implementing the telescope and beam homogenizer, the illumination density reaches up to 90 <italic>W/cm</italic><sup>2</sup> but could be tuned to any required value below that. In the focal point between both lenses a rotating piece of cling film diffuses the beam. The variance in the laser density over the field of view was measured with a fluorescent slide and is reproducibly lower than 25%.</p>
<p>Additionally, for long term experiments, lacking fluorescence intensity can to an extent be compensated with longer detector exposure times. To perform SMLM i.e. <italic>d</italic>STORM in our case, the telescope is removed to have maximal laser density. The total available power at the sample plane is 83 mW thus a laser density of around 520 <italic>W/cm</italic><sup>2</sup>. But since the laser spot is smaller than the FOV, sufficient laser density can be reached when only using a subset of the FOV (approximately a third of the FOV) can be used with sufficient laser power (over 970 <italic>W/cm</italic><sup>2</sup>) and a variation in laser intensity of about 25% of the laser intensity maximum.</p>

<title>Objectives and pixel sizes</title>
<p>For the widefield imaging, the room temperature live cell imaging, the single particle tracking as well as the <italic>d</italic>STORM experiment, a 60x Olympus 1.49NA oil immersion objective (UPLAPO60XOHR) is used. The setup optics have accordingly been chosen for maximal resolution thus matching the Nyquist sampling rate on the camera. The pixel-size is determined with a calibrated grid and a value of 104.1 nm is extrapolated. For the incubator measurements, a 20x Olympus 0.6 NA air (MXPLFLN20X) is used. The optics in the setup are not adjusted to this objective, resulting in a pixel-size of 319.4 nm.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study provides <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that the low-cost, user-friendly, and open-hardware UC2 wide-field microscopy framework can be expanded to enable single-molecule localization microscopy. Because the approach offers a simple and cost-effective alternative to commercially available microscopes, which are often expensive, this setup will be <bold>important</bold> for anyone seeking affordable solutions for single molecule localization microscopy and single particle tracking. While the information and data are openly accessible, the documentation could be expanded and better structured to (further) facilitate implementation in practice.</p>

<p>The authors have developed an open-source high-resolution microscope that is easily accessible to scientists, students, and the general public. The microscope is specifically designed to work with incubators and can image cells in culture over long periods. The authors provide detailed instructions for building the microscope and the necessary software to run it using off-the-shelf components. The system has great potential for studying cell biology and various biological processes.</p>
<p>The authors' work will make scientific instruments more accessible and remove obstacles to the free diffusion of capabilities and know-how in science. This important contribution will enable more people to conduct scientific research.</p>

<p>Making state-of-the-art (super-resolution) microscopy widely available has been the subject of many publications in recent years as correctly referenced in the manuscript. By advocating the ideas of open-microscopy and trying to replace expensive, scientific-grade components such as lasers, cameras, objectives, and stages with cost-effective alternatives, interested researchers nowadays have a number of different frameworks to choose from. In the iteration of the theme presented here, the authors used the existing modular UC2 framework, which consists of 3D printable building blocks, and combined a cheapish laser, detector and x,y,(z) stage with expensive filters/dichroics and a very expensive high-end objective (&gt;15k Euros). This particular choice raises a first technical question, to which extent a standard NA 1.3 oil immersion objective available for &lt;1k would compare to the chosen NA 1.49 one.</p>
<p>The choice of using the UC2 framework has the advantage, that the individual building blocks can be 3D printed, although it should be mentioned that the authors used injection-molded blocks that will have a limited availability if not offered commercially by a third party. The strength of the manuscript is the tight integration of the hardware and the software (namely the implementations of imSwitch as a GUI to control data acquisition, OS SMLM algorithms for fast sub-pixel localisation and access to Napari).</p>
<p>The presented experimental data is convincing, demonstrating (1) extended live cell imaging both using bright-field and fluorescence in the incubator, (2) single-particle tracking of quantum dots, and (3) and STORM measurements in cells stained against tubulin.</p>
<p>In the following I will raise two aspects that currently limit the clarity and the potential impact of the manuscript.</p>
<p>First, the manuscript would benefit from further refinement. Elements in Figure 1d/e are not described properly. Figure 2c is not described in the caption. GPI-GFP is not introduced. MMS (moment scaling spectrum) could benefit from a one sentence description of what it actually is. In Figure 6, the size of the STORM and wide-field field of views are vastly different, the distances between the peaks on the tubuili are given in micrometers rather than nanometers. (more in the section on recommendations for the author)</p>
<p>Second, and this is the main criticism at this point, is that although all the information and data is openly available, it seems very difficult to actually build the setup due to a lack of proper documentation (as of early July 2023).</p>
<p>
1. The bill of materials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-STORM-and-Fluorescence#bill-of-material">https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-STORM-and-Fluorescence#bill-of-material</ext-link>) should provide a link to the commercially available items. Some items are named in German. Maybe split the BoM in commercially available and 3D printable parts (I first missed the option to scroll horizontally).</p>
<p>
2. The links to the XY and Z stage refer to the general overview site of the UC2 project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/openUC2/">https://github.com/openUC2/</ext-link>) requiring a deep dive to find the actual information.</p>
<p>
3. Detailed building instructions are unfortunately missing. How to assemble the cubes (pCad files showing exploded views, for example)? Trouble shooting?</p>
<p>
4. Some of the hardware details (e.g. which laser was being used, lenses, etc) should be mentioned in the manuscript (or SI)</p>
<p>I fully understand that providing such level of detail is very time consuming, but I hope that the authors will be able to address these shortcomings.</p>
