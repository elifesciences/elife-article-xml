<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homeodomain transcription factors (HD TFs) play a fundamental role in vertebrate development. Members of the HD TF family are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved 60 amino acid helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domain known as the homeodomain (HD). The HD is one of the most studied eukaryotic DNA-binding motifs since its discovery in <italic>Drosophila</italic> homeotic transformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Hundreds of HD TFs have subsequently been documented in regulating gene expression programs important for body plan specification, pattern formation and cell fate determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Mutations in HD TFs have been linked to many human diseases, including neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Although significant progress has been made in understanding HD-DNA interactions, uncovering the pathogenetic mechanisms of disease-causing missense mutations in HD have proven challenging.</p>
<p>The retina has long been used as a model system to study the role of HD TFs in normal central nervous system (CNS) development and in neurological diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. During retinogenesis, HD TFs play essential roles in the patterning of neuroepithelium, specification of retinal progenitors and differentiation of all retinal cell classes that derive from a common progenitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, many HD TFs are shared between the brain and the retina during development and mutations in these TFs can lead to disease manifestation in both tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. The accessibility and wealth of available molecular tools makes the retina a valuable tool to decipher the pathogenic mechanisms of HD TF mutations associated with neurological diseases.</p>
<p>Here, we study CRX, a HD TF essential for photoreceptor cells in the retina, as a model to understand how single amino acid substitutions in the HD impact TF functions and cause blinding diseases. Photoreceptors are the most numerous neurons in the retina and are specialized to sense light and initiate vision through a process called phototransduction. Animal studies have demonstrated that <italic>Crx</italic> is first expressed in post-mitotic photoreceptor precursors and maintained throughout life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Loss of CRX results in impaired photoreceptor gene expression, failure of maturation and rapid degeneration of immature, non-functional photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Protein-coding sequence variants in human <italic>CRX</italic> have been associated with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) that affect photoreceptors: Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), cone-rod dystrophy (CoRD), and retinitis pigmentosa (RP) (OMIM:602225). However, the recessive phenotype observed in <italic>Crx</italic> knockout mouse models fails to recapitulate many dominant human <italic>CRX</italic> mutations that arise <italic>de novo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>CRX contains two functional domains – the N-terminal HD and C-terminal activation domain (AD) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), both are required for proper activation of target genes and maintenance of normal <italic>Crx</italic> mRNA transcript abundance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. To understand how CRX HD mutations cause diseases, we have previously reported a mutation knock-in mouse model carrying a hypomorphic mutation <italic>p</italic>.<italic>R90W</italic> (R90W) in CRX HD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We found that R90W mutation produces a recessive loss-of-function phenotype very similar to that of <italic>Crx</italic> knockout mice.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, several missense mutations within the same HD recognition helix as R90W, including <italic>p</italic>.<italic>E80A</italic> (E80A) and <italic>p</italic>.<italic>K88N</italic> (K88N), are linked to severe dominant IRDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1B</xref>). Here, we utilized a multi-omics approach to investigate the functional consequences of the E80A and K88N mutations on CRX regulatory activities and photoreceptor development (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1</xref>). Comparison of the <italic>in vitro</italic> HD-DNA binding models of CRX and disease variants generated by Spec-seq revealed unique specificity changes of each mutant protein. Introduction of each mutation into the endogenous <italic>Crx</italic> locus generated knock-in mouse models <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> that reproduced dCoRD- and dLCA-like phenotypes. ChIP-seq analysis of CRX binding <italic>in vivo</italic> revealed mutation-specific changes in CRX targetome, consistent with mutation-specific DNA binding changes <italic>in vitro</italic>. Retinal RNA-seq analysis uncovered two distinct mechanisms by which the two HD missense mutations contribute to altered gene expression programs during photoreceptor differentiation and maturation. Our results highlight the importance of residues E80 and K88 in CRX-mediated transcriptional regulation during photoreceptor development and the diverse mechanisms by which HD missense mutations can affect TF functions and lead to severe dominant neurological diseases.</p>

<title>K88N but not E80A mutation alters CRX HD DNA-binding specificity <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>CRX belongs to the <italic>paired</italic>-like HD TF family that recognize a 6-bp DNA motif in a stereotypic way<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Extensive studies of the HD have revealed a canonical HD-DNA recognition model where recognition of the 3’ region (bases 4-6) of the HD DNA binding site is mediated by specificity determinants within the conserved HD recognition helix, corresponding to CRX residues 80-96<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, HD residue 50, equivalent to CRX K88 residue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>), is the specificity determinant in <italic>paired</italic>-like HD TF-DNA interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Since the three disease-associated HD missense mutations, E80A, K88N and R90W, are located within the CRX HD recognition helix, we wondered if these mutations change CRX HD DNA-binding specificity.</p>
<p>We adapted a high-throughput <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, Spec-seq, that determines protein-DNA-binding specificity by sequencing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Spec-seq was developed based on the traditional electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to measure protein-DNA interactions. Spec-seq allows us to measure the relative binding affinities (i.e., specificity) for a library of HD binding motifs in parallel and generate quantitative binding models for different CRX HDs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref>). Based on the HD-DNA interaction model, we designed and tested a Spec-seq library containing all possible monomeric HD motifs (TAANNN) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We first obtained the wild-type (WT) CRX HD DNA binding model with Spec-seq using bacterially-expressed and affinity-purified HD peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E-1G</xref>, STAR Methods). Relative binding energies of CRX WT HD from two experiments showed strong correlation (<italic>r</italic>: 0.984) and noise level (0.114 kT) within the expected range in typical Spec-seq data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). Binding energy model of WT HD was then generated by applying multiple linear regressions on the relative binding energies of all sequences within two base-pair mismatches to the WT CRX consensus (TAATCC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>, STAR Methods). A clear preference for CC bases at the 3’ end of the motif is consistent with known CRX binding preference <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We next sought to understand how disease mutations affect CRX DNA-binding specificity. We purified all mutant HD peptides following the same protocol as WT HD peptides and verified their DNA binding (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2A-S2D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Comparison of the relative binding energies between each pair of mutant and WT HD revealed distinct effects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H-1J</xref>). By definition, the consensus DNA binding motif of a testing peptide has a relative binding energy of 0kT. The relative binding energy difference between nucleotide variants and the consensus motif correlates with the DNA binding specificity of the testing peptide. We found that R90W HD and E80A HD both prefer the same consensus motif as WT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1L</xref>). R90W HD bound with slightly higher specificity than WT, as demonstrated by most data points falling above the diagonal line (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1K</xref>), suggesting that R90W HD is more sensitive than WT to binding sequence variations. In contrast, when comparing E80A HD with WT HD, many data points fell below the diagonal line and the relative binding energies regressed towards 0 on the E80A axis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1L</xref>). This suggests that E80A HD bound with lower specificity than WT HD and thus was more tolerant to base variations in the HD DNA motif. Different from R90W and E80A, K88N mutation dramatically altered CRX HD DNA-binding specificity (<italic>r</italic>: 0.160) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1M</xref>). The K88N preferred binding sequence (TAAT/ATT/A) is referred to as N88 HD motif hereafter. K88N HD also had the largest degree of discrimination from its preferred to the weakest binding motif, suggesting that it is most sensitive to variants in the HD DNA motif. As a control, we tested a second library with the TAANNN sites on the reverse strand and obtained similar results (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figures S2E-S2L</xref>). Together, these results indicate that while E80A mutation does not affect CRX HD DNA binding specificity, the K88N mutation dramatically alters the specificity <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>E80A protein binds to WT sites while K88N occupies novel genomic regions with N88 HD motifs <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Next, we asked if changes in DNA-binding specificity affected mutant CRX chromatin binding in developing photoreceptors. We first created two human mutation knock-in mouse models, <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup>, each carrying a single base substitution at the endogenous <italic>Crx</italic> locus (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figures S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS3">S3B</xref>, STAR Methods). We confirmed that <italic>Crx</italic> mRNA was expressed at comparable levels in WT and mutant retinas (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3C</xref>), and the full-length CRX proteins were readily detectable in the nuclear extracts from all samples (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3D</xref>). We then obtained genome-wide binding profiles for each CRX variant by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) on mouse retinas at P14, a time when all retinal cell types are born, photoreceptor specification is completed in <italic>WT</italic> animals, and prior to any observed cell death in other CRX mutants previously characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. To focus on changes specific to each mutant CRX protein, only homozygous animals were used for ChIP-seq profiling.</p>
<p>Unsupervised clustering of all CRX binding sites revealed two major clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, STAR Methods). Cluster 1 consisted of canonical WT CRX binding sites that are also occupied by CRX E80A protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Similar to WT CRX, CRX E80A binding <italic>in vivo</italic> was mostly enriched in intronic, followed by intergenic and TSS regions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast, CRX R90W, that also showed similar consensus preference to WT <italic>in vitro</italic>, failed to produce significant DNA binding <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-2C</xref>, STAR Methods). This suggests that the retinopathy phenotype of <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup> is likely due to loss of binding at canonical WT CRX binding sites. Intriguingly, while CRX K88N showed loss of binding at canonical CRX binding sites, it gained a small set of binding sites (Cluster 2, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-2C</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> motif searching with DREME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> under CRX peaks in each genotype revealed enrichment of monomeric HD motifs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) consistent with those found in Spec-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1K-1M</xref>), highlighted by a change in enriched HD motif from WT CRX HD type to N88 HD type in the <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/N</italic></sup> retinas. Consistency with <italic>in vitro</italic> binding models suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> changes in CRX chromatin binding were at least in part driven by the intrinsic changes in HD-DNA binding specificity by each individual mutation.</p>

<title>E80A and K88N mutations affected the expression of CRX-dependent activated genes in opposite directions in a critical time window of photoreceptor differentiation</title>
<p>To understand how different CRX mutations affected gene expression at canonical and <italic>de novo</italic> binding sites and how these changes impair photoreceptor differentiation, we turned to bulk RNA-seq analysis from the developing retinas at P10. At P10, photoreceptors have started to differentiate, and the expression of many photoreceptor genes undergo exponential increase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. To focus on the most relevant expression changes, we first defined a set of genes that most likely depend on CRX activity nearby for expression (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref>, STAR Methods). Briefly, we associated each CRX ChIP-seq peak to the nearest gene, filtered only genes with nearby CRX ChIP-seq peaks, and further narrowed the list of genes to those significantly down-regulated in the loss of function mutant <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup>. Gene ontology (GO) analysis confirmed that this putative CRX-dependent gene set is associated with biological processes related to photoreceptor development and functions (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>). This set of putative CRX-dependent genes also showed developmental dependent gain in expression, consistent with CRX’s primary function as a transcriptional activator (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). As a control, CRX-independent genes were constitutively expressed and largely involved in general cellular processes (<xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figures S4D-S4F</xref>). Therefore, the CRX-dependent gene set comprises genes important for photoreceptor differentiation and functional maturation and are dependent on CRX for activation. We denote these genes as “CRX-dependent activated genes” (<italic>CRX-DAGs</italic>).</p>
<p>Next, we sought to understand how each mutation affected photoreceptor differentiation. One way of measuring the progression of photoreceptor differentiation is to determine the similarity in <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> expression in a given sample with that of known developmental ages in <italic>WT</italic> control animals. We thus performed sample-wise correlation of <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> expression obtained in our P10 samples with a previously published RNA-seq dataset of normal mouse retinal development (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. As expected, our P10 <italic>WT</italic> sample showed strong correlations with all developmental ages in the published <italic>WT</italic> control dataset. A stronger correlation with early ages (P3, P7, P10) and a weaker correlation with later ages (P14, P21) is also an indication of ongoing photoreceptor differentiation at P10. Unlike the <italic>WT</italic> sample, <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/A</italic></sup> samples both showed a stronger correlation with later developmental ages (P14, P21) but a weaker correlation with earlier postnatal ages (P3, P7). Since the <italic>CRX-DAGs</italic> are normally developmentally upregulated, this shift toward correlation with later developmental ages suggested that these genes were prematurely upregulated in the P10 <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutant retinas. In contrast, <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/N</italic></sup> samples both showed a weaker correlation with all developmental ages when compared with <italic>WT</italic> samples in our dataset. This suggests that early photoreceptor differentiation was compromised in both <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutants, consistent with their association with early-onset LCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Importantly, <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup>, also associated with LCA-like phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, displayed strong correlation with earlier ages (P3, P7) similar to <italic>WT</italic>, but only showed moderate correlation with later ages (P14, P21). This suggests loss of CRX function at canonical binding sites does not affect the initiation of photoreceptor differentiation, but WT CRX activity at these sites is required to sustain differentiation. Since <italic>CRX-DAG</italic> expression was more severely affected in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutants than in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup>, the photoreceptor differentiation deficits seen in the <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutants cannot be explained solely by the loss of regulatory activity at canonical CRX binding sites. Overall, our sample-wise correlation analysis with normal retinal development dataset suggests that E80A and K88N mutations affected the expression CRX-dependent activated genes in opposite directions, implicating novel and distinct pathogenic mechanisms from the loss-of-function R90W mutation.</p>

<title><italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> retinas show up-regulation of rod genes but down-regulation of cone genes, underlying CoRD-like phenotype</title>
<p>Upon closer examination, we noted that not all <italic>CRX-DAGs</italic> were up-regulated in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of all <italic>CRX-DAGs</italic> using expression changes revealed two major groups (STAR Methods). In aggregate, when compared to <italic>WT</italic>, Group 1 genes were up-regulated in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants while Group 2 genes were down-regulated. We noted genes indicative of the two photoreceptor subtypes, rods and cones, could partially define the two groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>). For example, <italic>Esrrb</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> and <italic>Nrl</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> in Group 1 are important regulators of rod differentiation. Other genes in Group 1 are components of the phototransduction cascade in rods, including <italic>Rcvrn</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, <italic>Rho</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, <italic>Gnat1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, <italic>Pde6g</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>, <italic>Abca4</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>, <italic>Gnb1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, <italic>Rdh12</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>, <italic>Cngb1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, <italic>Rp1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Mis-regulations of many of these genes have been associated with diseases that affect rod development, function, and long-term survival. The increased activation of these genes likely underlies the stronger correlation with later developmental ages in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A+/</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/A</italic></sup> retinas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, Group 2 genes, many down-regulated in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants, were implicated in cone development and functions. For example, <italic>Gnat2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, <italic>Pde6c</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, and <italic>Pde6h</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> all act in the cone phototransduction cascade. Mis-regulation of these genes has also been implicated in different retinal dystrophies that primarily affect cone photoreceptors. Comparison of ChIP-seq signal revealed that peaks associated with Group 2 genes showed lower occupancy compared to Group 1 genes in the <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/A</italic></sup> retinas (Mann-Whitney U test <italic>p-value</italic>: 9.51e-07) while no difference was observed in <italic>WT</italic> retinas (Mann-Whitney U test <italic>p-value</italic>: 0.541), suggesting loss of CRX activity likely underlies the down-regulation of Group 2 genes in the <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5A</xref>). Collectively, the selective down-regulation of cone genes in Group 2 may explain the CoRD-like phenotype in adult <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutant mice described later.</p>
<p>Additionally, we noticed that a subset of genes not affected in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup> (CRX-independent genes) were also down-regulated in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants (<xref rid="figS5" ref-type="fig">Figures S5B-S5D</xref>). Among these genes were transcription regulators important for early photoreceptor development, such as <italic>Ascl1</italic><sup><italic>59</italic></sup>, <italic>Rax</italic><sup><italic>60</italic></sup>, <italic>Sall3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>, and <italic>Pias3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. The down-regulation of these factors coincided with the up-regulation of mature rod genes in P10 <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> retinas, suggesting that the E80A mutation might hamper the proper timing of photoreceptor differentiation.</p>

<title><italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> retinas display greater reduction of rod and cone genes than the loss-of-function mutants</title>
<p><italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> retinas had the most severe gene expression changes among all mutants with down-regulation of both Group 1 (rod) and Group 2 (cone) genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3B-3D</xref>). The heterozygous <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/+</italic></sup> retina displayed a similar degree of expression reduction as homozygous <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup>, consistent with its association with dLCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Given the normal phenotype of heterozygous loss-of-function mutants -<italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/+</italic>18</sup>, these results suggested that mutant CRX K88N not only failed to activate WT target genes, but also functionally antagonized WT CRX regulatory activity in differentiating photoreceptors. This antagonism might be associated with ectopic CRX K88N activity when bound to regulatory regions with N88 HD DNA motifs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>).

Overall, CRX K88N is associated with greater gene expression changes than other CRX HD mutants, which is likely attributed to ectopic regulatory activity.</p>

<title>Both <italic>E80A</italic> and <italic>K88N</italic> mutants show compromised rod/cone terminal differentiation in young adults</title>
<p>Since <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/+</italic></sup> mutant mouse models showed a late-time recovery in photoreceptor gene expression and function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, we sought to determine the degree of photoreceptor differentiation in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutants at P21. At this age, the normal retina has largely completed terminal differentiation with photoreceptor gene expression reaching a plateau<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. However, when P21 CRX HD mutant retinas were examined for the expression of genes under the GO term <italic>detection of light stimulus</italic> (GO:0009583), which comprises genes in both rod and cone phototransduction cascades, many genes failed to reach <italic>WT</italic> levels, despite variable degrees of impact across different HD mutants (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants, in contrast to the increased rod gene expression at P10, displayed a deficiency in both cone and rod phototransduction genes at P21 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>, Supplementary Table 6).

<p>To assess retinal morphology and photoreceptor subtype-specific gene expression at the cellular level, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis on P21 retinal sections. In <italic>WT</italic> animals, a hallmark of photoreceptor maturation is the outgrowth of photoreceptor outer segments (OS) filled with proteins necessary for the phototransduction. We thus performed hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining on P21 sagittal retinal sections to visualize changes in retinal layer organization, focusing on photoreceptor layers – outer nuclear layer (ONL) and OS. Compared to the well-organized ONL in <italic>WT</italic> retinas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>), all mutants showed variable degrees of ONL disorganization, forming waves, whorls, and rosettes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5B-5E</xref>). The ONL disorganization was more severe in homozygotes than in heterozygotes for both mutations and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutants were more severely affected than <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutants.

Inner retinal layers, including inner plexiform layer (IPL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) were not as severely affected as the outer retinal layers, supporting a model that the mutant morphological abnormalities largely originated from the diseased photoreceptors. These morphological abnormalities were distinct from the degenerative phenotypes of other <italic>Crx</italic> mutant models reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Next, we sought to determine the expression of the rod-specific visual pigment rhodopsin (RHO) and cone arrestin (mCAR) in the P21 mouse retinas. In <italic>WT</italic> retinas, RHO is trafficked to the rod OS while mCAR is present in the cone OS and IS (inner segment), cell body, and synaptic terminals (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Unlike <italic>WT</italic> retina, all mutants lacked mCAR immunoreactivity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G-5J</xref>), consistent with the loss of cone gene expression shown by RNAseq (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/+</italic></sup> retinas, RHO staining was localized to the OS layer; in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/+</italic></sup> retinas, positive RHO staining was observed within the whorls and rosettes; in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/N</italic></sup> mutant retinas, RHO staining was completely absent. Importantly, we did not observe mis-localized RHO staining in the inner retinal layers suggesting that the developmental programs of other retinal cell types were not directly affected by E80A or K88N mutation. Overall, abnormalities in the cone/rod gene expression matched the corresponding human disease diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, and the phenotypic severity correlated with the degree of mis-regulation of CRX target genes in the corresponding RNAseq dataset.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Through molecular characterization of mutant proteins, transcriptome and cellular profiling of developing mutant mouse retinas and ERG testing of adult retinas, we have identified two novel pathogenic mechanisms of CRX HD mutations, E80A and K88N, that are associated with dominant CoRD and dominant LCA in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Distinct from the previously characterized loss-of-function R90W mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, E80A and K88N mutations produce altered CRX proteins with gain of regulatory functions -CRX E80A is associated with increased transcriptional activity and CRX K88N has altered DNA binding specificity.

<p>The <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> knock-in mouse models recapitulate dominant human CRX-linked retinopathies and present novel morphological deficits. Published <italic>Crx</italic> mutant mouse models have established that decreased expression of CRX or loss of CRX transcriptional activity results in incomplete photoreceptor differentiation and ultimately rapid degeneration of immature photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Despite the difference in molecular mechanisms, both <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mouse models show defective photoreceptor terminal differentiation and develop whorls and rosettes in the ONL layers by P21, which are not observed in degenerative CRX mouse models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. No significant increase in cell death is observed in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutant mouse retinas at P21, suggesting distinct pathogenic mechanisms than the photoreceptor degeneration previously reported in other CRX mouse models. P10 RNAseq analysis on cell markers of other neuronal cell types and Muller glia cells did not detect significant changes, suggesting that the developmental programs for these cell types were unaffected. Further studies are needed to systematically characterize changes in photoreceptor differentiation and retinal morphology during early development, and interactions between diseased photoreceptors and other major cell types in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mutant mouse retinas.</p>
<p>Precisely tuned CRX-mediated transcriptional activity is important to ensure proper photoreceptor development. Previous studies have demonstrated that CRX is activated shortly after cell cycle exit in retinal progenitor cells fated to be photoreceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. CRX then works with other cell type specific TFs, such as NRL and NR2E3 (rods) or RORB and THRB (cones), to regulate gene expression important for cell-type specific structures and functions and drive the differentiation of photoreceptor precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Loss-of-function animal studies have established that CRX is primarily a transcriptional activator since loss of CRX protein or regulatory function is associated with decreased expression of photoreceptor-specific genes regulated by CRX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Here, we find that CRX E80A mutant, that displays increased CRX transcriptional activator activity, is also deleterious to photoreceptor development. CRX E80A maintains WT DNA-binding specificity <italic>in vitro</italic> and binds to canonical CRX sites in mutation knock-in mouse retinas. Consistent with CRX E80A’s hyper-activity at canonical CRX target <italic>pRho</italic>, in differentiating <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/A</italic></sup> retinas, many of the CRX-dependent activated genes implicated in rod functions are prematurely up-regulated at early postnatal ages. The RHO protein is also detected in developing rod photoreceptor in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A/A</italic></sup> retinas as early as P3. However, at later ages, rod photoreceptor terminal differentiation is impaired, resulting in disrupted retinal morphology and defective visual functions. Photoreceptor differentiation is precisely programmed via sequential and concerted gene expression programs within a defined time window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref></sup>. One explanation for adult <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> phenotypes is that CRX E80A associated hyper-activity precociously activates later stage genes in the absence of proper nuclear context and/or subcellular structures, which in turn negatively impacts early events in photoreceptor differentiation. Multiple possibilities could account for CRX E80A associated hyper-activity: (1) E80A mutation increases CRX interactions with its binding sites; (2) E80A mutation increases CRX interactions with the transcription complex or other TFs; (3) certain protein factors that could promote photoreceptor gene expression are up-regulated in CRX E80A expressing cells.</p>
<p>While these possibilities are not mutually exclusive, evidence from the current study favors the first possibility since E80A HD is less discriminative of HD motif variants than WT HD as shown by Spec-seq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). Regulatory sequences of many photoreceptor genes contain both consensus and non-consensus CRX motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. CRX E80A might interact better with non-consensus CRX motifs within binding sites, resulting in increased transcriptional output of target genes. Large scale reporter assays (e.g. Massively Parallel Reporter Assays) in the appropriate cellular context – neonatal mouse retinas – would be informative to understanding CRX E80A hyper-activity mechanism and the direct impacts of its hyper-activity.</p>
<p>Although a global increase in expression is expected in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> models, a subset of CRX dependent activated genes implicated in cone photoreceptor development and functions is down-regulated in both differentiating and mature mutant retinas. Cones are born prenatally in mice within an earlier time window than rods. Yet, cones undergo terminal differentiation in a similar postnatal window as rods to develop into subtypes of cones – M-cones v.s. S-cones. One model is that CRX E80A improperly activates later stage cone genes at a much earlier time window, disrupting cone terminal differentiation. Supporting this model, similar to the presented <italic>pRho</italic> data, CRX E80A also hyper-activates the <italic>S-cone opsin</italic> promoter (data not shown).</p>
<p>Detecting premature activation of cone genes in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> retinas will require analysis at early developmental ages. An alternative model for lack of cone markers in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> retinas is that cones might be more sensitive to perturbations in CRX transcriptional activity, which impacts cone survival. It is known that cones depend on a different repertoire of TFs than rods for subtype terminal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>. It is possible that cone TFs respond differently to mutant CRX E80A hyper-activity, leading to the distinct expression changes in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> mutant retains. Since cones only make up a very small portion of photoreceptors in mouse retinas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>, characterization of CRX E80A activity in purified cone population at earlier ages will be necessary to understand its selective effect on the cone differentiation program and help to elucidate WT CRX regulatory principles in early photoreceptor development. Collectively, CRX transcriptional activity at its canonical genomic binding sites need to be maintained within a quantitatively defined range such that CRX dependent target genes are activated in a precise temporal pattern to ensure proper photoreceptor differentiation.</p>
<p>CRX DNA binding specificity constitutes an additional regulatory program required for the fidelity of photoreceptor gene expression during development. Previous work has shown that subtle differences in HD motif content could have distinct transcriptional and functional outcomes. For instance, studies in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> demonstrate that the sequential use of HD DNA motif variants defines different classes of enhancers and coordinates the precise timing of gene expression patterns during embryonic development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref></sup>. In our current study, the K88N mutation alters CRX DNA-binding specificity that redirects CRX binding to binding sites with N88 HD motifs in the mutant mouse retinas. <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> retinas show more severe perturbations in photoreceptor gene expression and development than in loss-of-function mutant <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>R90W/W</italic></sup>. Concomitantly, <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/N</italic></sup> mice display the most severe photoreceptor morphological deficits observed in any <italic>Crx</italic> mouse models and show absence of visual functions in young adults. In developing <italic>WT</italic> mouse retinas, the HD motif preferred by HD TFs with a glutamine (Q) at HD50 position encodes quantitatively different activity than the CRX consensus motif suggesting functional difference between HD binding site variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref></sup>. It is likely that the severe <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> phenotypes are attributed to both loss of activity at canonical CRX motifs and ectopic binding and transcriptional activity of CRX K88N proteins at N88 HD motifs. Additionally, since a functional WT copy of CRX is retained in <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N/+</italic></sup> retinas and CRX K88N prefers different motifs than WT CRX, the lack of WT activity alone cannot explain the severe expression and developmental deficits.</p>
<p>Alternatively, these results suggest involvement of additional regulatory mechanisms: CRX K88N activity at N88 HD motifs might (1) ectopically activate genes whose expression prevents the progression of development or inactivate genes required for development; (2) interfere with other HD TFs that also recognize N88 HD motifs; (3) lead to epigenetic alterations that antagonize normal CRX functions. Many other HD containing TFs are expressed in developing mouse retina, including OTX2, RAX, VSX2, PAX6, SIX3/6, and LHX family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Different from CRX, these HD TFs are essential for gene regulation in retinal progenitor cells and/or in other retinal cell lineages. It is very likely that CRX correctly targets photoreceptor genes at least through its DNA binding specificity and alteration of CRX DNA binding specificity would mis-regulate genes originally targeted by other HD TFs and lead to perturbations in GRNs and development. To date, most studies have focused on CRX activity at cis-regulatory sequences enriched for the WT CRX consensus motifs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>. Systematic comparison of transcriptional activity at N88 HD motifs and WT consensus motifs in the context of photoreceptor development in both <italic>WT</italic> and mutant retinas would be needed to substantiate the impact of mutant CRX K88N activity at different HD motifs. These experiments will also help clarify the pathogenic mechanisms in the <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> models and extend our knowledge of CRX regulatory grammar and activation of photoreceptor genes during development.</p>
<p>One limitation of this work is that effects of E80A and K88N mutations on CRX HD-DNA interactions have been evaluated at monomeric HD motifs and with homogenous protein species both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further evaluation of WT and mutant CRX binding at dimeric motifs will be desirable, since selected dimeric HD motifs are known to mediate HD TF cooperativity to ensure gene expression fidelity during development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Relatedly, we also need to address how CRX WT and mutant E80A or K88N proteins interact at HD binding motifs – whether they cooperate or compete with each other, whether these interactions are HD motif sequence-dependent, and how gene expression is impacted by CRX cooperativity or competition. While CRX HD mediates both TF-DNA interactions and protein-protein interactions, evaluation of how E80A and K88N mutations impact CRX interaction with other important photoreceptor TFs and how perturbations in these interactions lead to disease phenotypes warrant further study.</p>
<p>Since the spatial structures and HD-DNA contact models of HD proteins are evolutionarily conserved, our study of CRX provides valuable molecular insights for HD mutations implicated in other diseases. For example, <italic>p</italic>.<italic>E79K</italic> substitution (corresponds to CRX E80) in OTX2 HD is associated with dominant early-onset retinal dystrophy in two Caucasian Canadian families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref></sup>, heterozygous <italic>p</italic>.<italic>R89G</italic> (corresponds to CRX R90) mutation in OTX2 HD causes severe ocular malformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup>, and missense mutations of the CRX K88 and R90 homologous residues in PITX2 HD are associated with Rieger syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. It is likely that these mutations affect HD activity in similar ways as observed in CRX, and the exact disease manifestation is determined by cell-type specific mechanisms. The retina is readily accessible and a broad range of molecular tools are available for <italic>ex vivo</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> manipulations. We believe that CRX is an ideal model to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of HD mutations and to test therapeutic regimens, which would ultimately benefit the study of HD TFs and their associated diseases in other tissues and organs.</p>
<p>Collectively, our findings support a unifying model in which precise CRX interaction with cis-regulatory sequences is essential for gene expression and functional maturation during photoreceptor development. Mutations that perturb CRX target specificity or transactivation activity impair the integrity of CRX-mediated transcriptional regulation and result in distinct morphological and functional deficits (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7A-7D</xref>). Regulatory activity at ectopic N88 HD motifs antagonizes normal CRX functions and leads to aberrant photoreceptor development and early vision loss. This model also emphasizes the importance of tailoring gene therapy regimens to tackle individual pathogenic mechanisms. For instance, while supplementing WT CRX might be sufficient to rescue a hypomorphic/loss-of-function mutant, simultaneous elimination of a gain-of-function <italic>CRX</italic> product would be necessary to rescue dominant mutants, as exemplified in a recent report of allele-specific gene editing to rescue dominant CRX-associated LCA7 phenotypes in a retinal organoid model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref></sup>. We believe that this principle also applies to other dominant neurological diseases. Additionally, with the refinement of the CRX mechanistic model, when new disease mutations are identified, genetic counsellors can now provide more informed predictions of disease progression and future visual deficits. This information is important for individuals to be psychologically prepared and seek necessary assistance to improve their quality of life.</p>

<title>Mutation knock-in mouse model generation</title>
<p>CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing was performed to generate the <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>E80A</italic></sup> and <italic>Crx</italic><sup><italic>K88N</italic></sup> mice as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref></sup>. The Cas9 guide RNAs (gRNA) were designed based on proximity to the target amino acid and was synthesized using the MEGAshortscript™ T7 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The gRNAs were subsequently tested for cutting efficiency in cell culture by the Washington University Genome Engineering and iPSC Center. The validated gRNA and Cas9 protein were then microinjected into the pronuclei of C57Bl/6J-0.5-dpc (days post coitum) zygotes along with the donor DNA, a 190-bp single stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) carrying either the <italic>c</italic>.<italic>239A&gt;G</italic> substitution for <italic>p</italic>.<italic>E80A</italic> mutation or the <italic>c</italic>.<italic>264G&gt;T</italic> substitution for <italic>p</italic>.<italic>K88N</italic> mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref></sup>. Embryos were then transferred into the oviduct of pseudo-pregnant female. Pups were generally delivered ∼20 days after microinjection. Tissues from 10-day postnatal (P10) pups were collected by toe biopsy/tail for identification of the targeted allele by restriction digest (HinfI) of PCR amplified DNA first and then confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Genewiz).</p>
<p>Founders carrying the correct alleles were then bred with wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, Strain #000664) to confirm transmission. All experimental animals used were backcrossed at least 10 generations. Genotyping of mutation knock-in mice follows cycling conditions: 95°C for 2 min, 94°C for 30 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 60 sec, repeat steps 2-4 for 34 cycles, 68°C for 7 min, and hold at 4°C. After PCR reaction, the amplified DNA fragments wee digested with HinfI. Sequences of gRNAs, ssODNs and genotyping primers can be found in Supplementary Table S3. A representative DNA gel of HinfI digested genotyping DNA fragments can be found at <xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>.</p>

<p>Expression plasmids for GST-WT, E80A, and R90W HDs were published previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.

The cultures were incubated for 2 hours or until OD600 = 2.0 at 34°C and the cells were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm and 4°C for 15 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1x PBS (Corning, Corning, NY) and then lysed by sonication. 5mM DTT (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA) and 1% Triton X-100 (MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA) was then added, and the mixtures were incubated with gentle shaking at 4°C for 30 minutes to maximize protein extraction. The separation of proteins from the cellular debris were then performed by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 10 minutes and filtered through a 0.45μm membrane. Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA) was first equilibrated with PBS before adding to the supernatant. 5x Halt™ Protease Inhibitor Cocktail and PMSF was added to minimize degradation.

<title>Determination of relative binding affinity with Spec-seq</title>
<p>For a biomolecular interaction between a protein <italic>P</italic> and a particular DNA sequence, <italic>Si</italic>, the interaction can be diagrammed as:
<disp-formula id="eqn1">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>P</italic> · <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> refers to the protein-DNA complex. The affinity of the protein <italic>P</italic> to sequence <italic>Si</italic> is defined as the association constant <italic>KA</italic>, or its reciprocal, the dissociation constant <italic>KD</italic>. The <italic>KA</italic> of the protein-DNA interaction is determined by measuring the equilibrium concentrations of each reactant and the complex:
<disp-formula id="eqn2">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where […] refers to concentrations. As in a typical Spec-seq experiment, thousands of different DNA sequences compete for the same pool of proteins, their relative binding affinities (the ratio of their <italic>KA</italic>) can be determined by measuring the concentrations of each sequence in the bound and unbound fractions without measuring the free protein concentrations, which is often the most difficult to measure accurately:
<disp-formula id="eqn3">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>In a binding reaction involving TF and a library of DNAs, the concentration of bound and unbound species are directly proportional to the number of individual DNA molecules in each fraction which can be obtained directly from sequencing data. With enough counts in each fraction, we can accurately estimate the ratios of concentrations from counts with the relationship:
<disp-formula id="eqn4">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v2_eqn4.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>NU</italic> denotes counts in the unbound fraction and <italic>NB</italic> denotes counts in the bound fraction. Therefore, the binding affinity of a sequence variant <italic>Sx</italic> relative to the reference sequence <italic>Sref</italic> can be calculated by:
<disp-formula id="eqn4a">
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="526652v2_eqn4a.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>The natural logarithms of these ratios are the relative binding free energies in the units of <italic>kcal/mol</italic>. The relative free energy of the reference site for each CRX HD was set to 0.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s7d3">
<title>Spec-seq data analysis and energy logo visualization</title>
<p>The sequencing results were first filtered and sorted based on conserved regions and barcodes. Reads with any mismatch in the conserved regions were discarded prior to further analysis as described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup>. The ratio of individual sequence in bound and unbound reads was calculated as a measurement of relative binding affinity (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eqn4">Equation. 4</xref>) compared to the consensus sequence. The relative binding energy was then derived from the natural logarithm of the relative binding affinity and represented in <italic>kcal/mol</italic> units.</p>
<p>For wild type CRX HD and all the mutants, the energy weight matrices (ePWMs) were generated based on the regression of the TF’s binding energy to its reference sequence. Only sequences within two mismatches to the reference were used to generate the ePWMs. Energy logos were generated from ePWMs after normalizing the sum of energy on each position to 0 and the negative energy values were plotted such that preferred bases are on top. The sequence logos were generated from ePWMs with python package logomaker (v0.8). The ePWMs for all CRX HDs are listed in Supplementary Table S3.</p>

<title>Definition of CRX-dependent and -independent gene set</title>

<p>The manuscript by Zheng et al. examined the disease-causing mechanisms of two missense mutations within the homeodomain (HD) of CRX protein. Both mutations were found in humans and can produce severe dominant retinopathy. The authors investigated the two CRX HD mutants via in vitro DNA-binding assay (Spec-seq), in vivo chromatin-binding assay (ChIP-seq), in vivo expression assay of downstream target genes (RNA-seq), and retinal histological and functional assays. They concluded that p.E80A increased the transactivation activity of CRX and resulted in precocious photoreceptor differentiation, whereas p.K88N significantly changed the binding specificity of CRX and led to defects in photoreceptor differentiation and maintenance. The authors performed a significant amount of analyses. The claims are sufficiently supported by the data. The results not only uncovered the underlying disease-causing mechanisms, but also can significantly improve our understanding of the interaction between HD-TF and DNA during development.</p>
<p>Minor concerns:</p>
<p>
1. The E80A, K88N and R90W (previously reported by the same group) mutations are located very close to each other in the homeodomain (Figure 1A), but had distinct effects on the activity of CRX. Has the structure of the homeodomain (of CRX) been resolved? If so, could the authors discuss this phenomenon (mutations close to each other but have distinct effects) based on the HD-DNA structure? In addition, has this phenomenon been observed in other homeodomain TFs?</p>
<p>
2. The authors should briefly summarize the effects/disease-causing-mechanisms of all the reported CRX mutations in the discussion part. The readers can then have a better overview of the topic.</p>
<p>
3. CRX can also function as a pioneer factor (reported by the same group). Would these HD mutations distinctively affect chromatin accessibility (which then leads to ectopic binding on the genome)?</p>
<p>
4. The discussion part can be shortened and simplified.</p>

<p>Zheng et al., investigated the molecular and functional mechanisms of two homeodomain missense mutations causing human retinal photoreceptor degeneration diseases in photoreceptor development regulated by the CRX transcription factor. They analyzed the E80A mutation associated with dominant cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) and the K88N mutation associated with dominant Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). The authors found that E80A CRX binds to the same target DNA sites as WT CRX, but the binding specificity of K88N CRX is altered from that of WT in an in vitro assay. They generated Crx(E80A) and Crx(K88N) KI mice and performed ChIP assay and observed that K88N CRX binds to novel genomic regions from the WT-binding sites, while E80A binds to the WT sites. In addition, using the KI mice, they found that E80A and K88N differently affect the expression of Crx target genes. This study is well executed with proper and solid methodologies, and the manuscript is clearly written. This study gives us the insights how single missense CRX mutations lead to different types of human retinal photoreceptor degeneration diseases.</p>
<p>While the study has strengths in principle, it has a couple of weaknesses. One is how well E80A KI mice function as a pathological model of dominant CRD, in which cones are mainly first affected, is not clearly shown in this study. More data investigating how cones are affected by performing histological, molecular, and physiological analyses will be helpful and useful. For example, in the Discussion, the authors describe that E80A associates with S-cone opsin promoter results is &quot;data now shown&quot;. This data must be presented for the readers. In addition, more molecular insights as to how E80A affects cones will strengthen this study. Another point is that it will be very valuable if the authors could show how E80A and K88N differently affect the 3D structure of the CRX homeodomain. Even a simulation model would be valuable.</p>

<p>Thank you for summarizing the key findings and strengths of our manuscript.</p>

<p>Minor concerns:</p>
<p>1. The E80A, K88N and R90W (previously reported by the same group) mutations are located very close to each other in the homeodomain (Figure 1A), but had distinct effects on the activity of CRX. Has the structure of the homeodomain (of CRX) been resolved? If so, could the authors discuss this phenomenon (mutations close to each other but have distinct effects) based on the HD-DNA structure?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In paragraphs 2, 4, 5 of the discussion section, we have added explanations on how each mutation could affect CRX HD-DNA interactions differently based on published structural studies. And we further explain how these biochemical changes relate to the molecular perturbations and cellular phenotypes seen in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In addition, has this phenomenon been observed in other homeodomain TFs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Disease associated missense mutations at residues HD50 (K88) and HD52 (R90) have also been reported in other HD TFs implicated in CNS development (see discussion paragraph 7). Distinctively, different substitutions at CRX E80 residue have been reported in multiple CoRD cases, suggesting its essential role in HD-DNA-mediated regulation during retinal development. These new points are now included in the discussion section.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Prior evidence has demonstrated that regulatory regions for many photoreceptor genes failed to stay accessible upon loss of CRX in the Crx-/- model (PMID: 30068366). It is unclear with the existing data whether CRX could initiate the chromatin remodeling (true pioneering function) of these regions, or it simply maintains the accessibility once these regions became accessible. Future studies comparing epigenomic landscape changes in mutant Crx KI models at various ages can be informative, particularly for the CRX K88N ectopic binding events. Determining how the CRX K88N mutant protein alters chromatin landscape important for photoreceptor fate and/or differentiation during development would shed light on the nature of these ectopic binding events.</p>

In addition, using the KI mice, they found that E80A and K88N differently affect the expression of Crx target genes. This study is well executed with proper and solid methodologies, and the manuscript is clearly written. This study gives us the insights how single missense CRX mutations lead to different types of human retinal photoreceptor degeneration diseases.</p>

<p>While the study has strengths in principle, it has a couple of weaknesses. One is how well E80A KI mice function as a pathological model of dominant CRD, in which cones are mainly first affected, is not clearly shown in this study. More data investigating how cones are affected by performing histological, molecular, and physiological analyses will be helpful and useful. For example, in the Discussion, the authors describe that E80A associates with S-cone opsin promoter results is &quot;data now shown&quot;. This data must be presented for the readers. In addition, more molecular insights as to how E80A affects cones will strengthen this study.</p>

<p>The mouse retina is rod dominant and contains only a small number of cones (3% of all photoreceptors) that are born prenatally. This poses technical challenges to appropriately assess cone-specific changes during disease initiation/progression. We are in the process of developing cellular/molecular tools to investigate how cones are being affected in Crx E80A KI model, but this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have added a supplemental panel showing that, based on P0 retinal immunostaining of the early cone marker RXRγ, cones were initially born, and fate specified in CrxE80A retinas (see Figure S7A). Since the E80A protein also hyper-activated S-cone opsin promoter-luciferase (Sop-luc) reporter in HEK293 cells (see Figure S7B), we predict that CRX E80A affects cone photoreceptor differentiation in a similar manner as rod photoreceptors. Furthermore, the cone transcriptional program might be more prone to perturbations by abnormal CRX activities. These possibilities require future investigations. For this manuscript, we have included all these points in the discussion section.</p>

<p>Another point is that it will be very valuable if the authors could show how E80A and K88N differently affect the 3D structure of the CRX homeodomain. Even a simulation model would be valuable.</p>

<p>Please see our answer to Point 1 of Reviewer #1. In short, we have added in the discussion section our explanations on how each mutation could affect CRX HD-DNA interactions differently based on structural studies. We further explain how these biochemical changes relate to the molecular perturbations and cellular phenotypes seen in vivo. Additionally, since TF-DNA interactions are diverse and dynamic across binding sites with different sequence features and genomic environments, future studies that systematically and quantitatively evaluate CRX transcriptional activity at different regulatory sequences would be important.</p>
