<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Modern fungicides have made significant contributions to crop disease management, but the development of resistant fungal strains has caused their failure in disease control. Therefore, developing fungicides with novel action mechanisms is the most effective measure to manage resistance. Quinofumelin, a novel quinoline fungicide, exhibits exceptional antifungal activity against phytopathogens. However, there is currently no available information on its mechanism of action. Here, we used transcriptome and metabolome analysis to observe a co-enrichment pattern of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) within pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (PBP), identifying down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Exogenous uridine monophosphate (UMP), uridine or uracil (metabolites in PBP) successfully restored quinofumelin-induced inhibition of mycelial growth in <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic> and <italic>Fusarium asiaticum</italic>. Additionally, the deletion of <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> was determined to be lethal; however, mycelial growth of ΔFgDHODHII mutants could be restored by adding UMP, uridine or uracil. These findings indicate that the deficiencies in <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin. Finally, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microscale thermophoresis (MST) results strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence for the involvement of <italic>de novo</italic> uracil biosynthesis as mechanism of action for quinofumelin while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
    <p>Agrochemical fungicides have a history spanning over 3000 years in the control of plant diseases, and have undergone a development process from traditional protective fungicides with multiple action sites to modern selective fungicides with single action site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Lamberth, 2022</xref>). The introduction of the first fully systemic seed treatment agent (carboxin, a succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) in 1966 and the launch of the first broad-spectrum foliar systemic fungicide (benomyl, a tubulin polymerization inhibitor) in 1968 represent significant milestones in the advancement of modern selective fungicides with single action site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lamberth et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Morton et al., 2008</xref>). Owing to their exceptional selectivity, potent activity, specific target site, and low toxicity, modern selective fungicides have gained widespread acceptance and witnessed an increasing market share year after year. However, like every coin has two sides, these types of fungicides encounter substantial challenges related to serious resistance issues when deployed in agricultural fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Lucas et al., 2015</xref>). Numerous reports have been published on plant pathogens developing resistance to modern selective fungicides, which often result in failures or reductions in the effectiveness of chemical control against plant diseases and lead to decreased crop yields and quality (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info">https://www.frac.info</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">King et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to expedite the development of new-generation selective fungicides with innovative modes of action. Based on a single fungicide target, numerous modern selective fungicides can be developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Umetsu et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, 24 commercialized available fungicides have been created so far based on the respiratory chain complex II as the target. Similarly, another 20 commercialized fungicides have been developed targeting the respiratory chain complex III. Additionally, there are already 37 commercialized fungicides that specifically target the fungicide target C14-demethylase in ergosterol biosynthesis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info">https://www.frac.info</ext-link>). However, identifying specific targets that efficiently control plant pathogens while ensuring safety for non-target organisms remains a significant challenge. The rate of discovery for new targets lags far behind current demands.</p>
<p>According to the latest information released by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), over 30 fungicide selective targets have been identified and acknowledged in the field of fungicide biological research spanning more than 130 years. Currently, these targets have been identified based on the successful development of fungicides and are all related proteins that are essential for pathogen growth or pathogenicity. Extensive identification and functional analysis of essential genes for growth or pathogenicity in plant pathogens have been achieved with rapid advancements in molecular biology techniques; however, there is no precedent for successfully developing commercialized fungicides targeting genes involved in growth or pathogenicity. The creation of highly active modern selective fungicides currently relies on the structural characteristics of existing targets and is accomplished through technologies such as AI drug discovery and design (AIDD), and computer aided drug design (CADD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). The biological functions of drug targets are highly conserved, although variations may occur at critical amino acid sites during genetic evolution. Therefore, it is crucial to explore drug targets and analyze their structural characteristics in order to develop novel fungicides with enhanced activity and selectivity. Recently, the Fungicide Biology group from Nanjing Agricultural University proposed a new concept for targeting pesticides based on the principles of targeted drugs in the medicine field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>). The objective is to create specialized targeted pesticides that exhibit higher activity, greater selectivity, stronger specialization, lower toxicity, and environmental friendliness by leveraging the structural characteristics of pesticide targets. This approach aims to provide essential technical support for scientifically controlling crop diseases.</p>
<p>Quinofumelin (CAS 861647-84-9) is a novel quinoline fungicide developed by Mitsui Chemicals Co., Ltd. Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ito et al., 2023</xref>). Due to their significant bioactivity, quinoline compounds and their derivatives have found extensive applications in medicine and pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Wheeler et al., 2003</xref>). In our previous study, quinofumelin not only exhibited excellent antifungal activity against the mycelial growth and spore germination of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, but also inhibited the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Xiu et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, quinofumelin exhibits no cross-resistance to currently extensively used fungicides, indicating its unique action target against phytopathogenic fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). In previous studies, quinofumelin was identified as a specific inhibitor of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase class II (DHODHII) in <italic>Pyricularia oryzae,</italic> suppressing fungal growth by blocking the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>). Gene disruption of <italic>DHODHII</italic> (<italic>PoPYR4</italic>) further confirmed its critical role in fungal pathogenicity and validated it as the action target site of quinofumelin. However, previous investigations did not report any detailed methodologies for target identification. Additionally, there was a lack of information regarding the precise interaction between quinofumelin and DHODHII. In this study, we used transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to investigate the co-enrichment patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). This approach enabled the identification of potential metabolic pathways were identified. Ultimately, the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway was identified as the target. Therefore, this study unveils that the mechanism of action of quinofumelin involves <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of uracil, thereby identifing DHODH as its specific target. As a selective fungicidal target, DHODH offers a valuable resource for the design and development of novel fungicides.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as affected by quinofumelin</title>
<p>RNA-seq experiments have emerged as the standard approach for quantifying and comparing gene expression levels across a wide range of species and conditions, providing critical insights into cellular phenomena (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate the impact of quinofumelin on gene expression levels in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, we performed an RNA-Seq experiment. For quality assessment of the RNA-Seq data, we conducted a comprehensive quality control analysis. In the principal component analysis, PC1 and PC2 accounted for 45.59% and 16.98% of the total variance, respectively. The distinct separation observed between the groups indicates significant differences in gene expression between the controls and experimental samples, which could be used for subsequent investigations (Supplementary Information, Fig. S1). The clustering heat map effectively categorized the controls and experimental samples into distinct clusters based on their gene expression profiles, demonstrating robust biological replication with minimal intra-group variability and ensuring the reliability of the data. Moreover, notable inter-group dissimilarities highlighted variations among different treatment samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p>

<p>The differential analysis unveiled a total of 234 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the control and experimental samples. Among these findings, there were identified as up-regulated for a count of 97 genes while down-regulation was observed in case of another set comprising around 137 genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). A graphical representation was employed to depict the statistical distribution pattern exhibited by these DEGs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). To gain deeper insights into gene functionalities, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed on these DEGs. The results showed that they are notably enriched in seventeen distinct GO terms spanning across two major categories; eleven molecular functions along with six processes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). Furthermore, the enrichment analysis highlighted significant associations with various functional attributes including transition metal ion binding, oxidoreductase activity, modified amino acid binding, amide binding, monooxygenase activity, and heme binding. Moreover, the enriched biological processes primarily involved transcriptional regulation driven by nucleic-enabled mechanisms as well as monocarboxylic acid metabolism and RNA biosynthesis. Additionally, the KEGG enrichment analysis identified specific pathways associated with thiamine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, amino acid sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, pantothenic acid and CoA biosynthesis, as well as nucleotide sugar production compound synthesis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>). In the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, the detailed counts of down- and up-regulated DEGs for each metabolic pathway are provided in Supplementary Table S1 and S2.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Metabolomic analysis of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> as affected by quinofumelin</title>
<p>According to the findings from the KEGG enrichment analysis of DEGs derived from transcriptomic data, these DEGs are associated with metabolism pathways as above described. To specifically investigate the metabolic pathways involved action mechanism of quinofumelin, we performed further metabolomic experiments. In metabolomics principal component analysis, the contribution rate of PC1 was determined to be 76.6% in positive ion mode and 51.2% in negative ion mode, respectively. Moreover, the quality control (QC) samples exhibited highly concentrated results, indicating excellent instrument stability and remarkable data repeatability. Furthermore, a distinct separation between groups was observed, particularly prominent in the positive ion mode, indicating significant variations in metabolites among different groups that warrant further investigation (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2a and S2b). The findings from Pearson correlation analysis were consistent with those obtained from principal component analysis (Supplementary Information, Fig. S2c and S2d). Strong correlations were identified within samples belonging to the same group, while weak correlations were observed between different groups.</p>
<p>Metabolomics analysis revealed a total of 713 differential metabolites, with 14 up-regulated and 699 down-regulated in the positive ion mode, as well as 230 differential metabolites, including 103 up-regulated and 127 down-regulated in the negative ion mode (Supplementary Information, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> and Fig. S3a). Based on the classification of the identified 943 different metabolites, it was observed that amino acids and their derivatives accounted for the highest proportion (17%), followed by organic acids and their derivatives (11%), benzene and substituted derivatives (11%), aldehydes, ketones, esters (11%), and heterocyclic compounds (10%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The volcano plot visually represents the distribution of statistical differences in metabolite abundance between the two groups (Supplementary Information, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and Fig. S3b).</p>

<p>KEGG pathways enriched by differential metabolites primarily include arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, purine metabolism, citrate cycle, arginine and proline metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, and metabolic pathways (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). The classification of enrichment pathways for differential metabolites revealed that the majority of these metabolites were associated with nucleotide metabolism (25%), amino acid metabolism (25%), carbohydrate metabolism (25%), and energy metabolism (12.5%) (Supplementary Information, Fig. S3c).</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Conjoint analysis of transcriptome and metabolome integration</title>
<p>Through transcriptome and metabolome data analysis, we observed a co-enrichment of differentially expressed genes and differentially accumulated metabolites in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. In the expression calorigrams of metabolites and genes depicting the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis pathway of pyrimidine, we identified down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in the experimental groups. Through in vitro RT-qPCR verification, it was found that after treating with quinofumelin at EC<sub>50</sub> (0.035 μg/mL) and EC<sub>90</sub> (1 μg/mL) concentrations, the expression of the DHODH gene was respectively decreased by 11.91% and 33.77% (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary Information, Fig. S4). This down-regulation hinders the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, thereby inhibiting the biosynthesis of downstream metabolites orotidine-5P and uracil, leading to their decreased abundance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the action mechanism of quinofumelin may involve inhibition of the <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis pathway of pyrimidine.</p>

<title>Identification of DHODHII in <italic>F. graminearum</italic></title>
<p>The <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> gene (FGSG_09678) was identified through the integrated analysis of transcriptome and metabolome data. The gene sequence for <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> was retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database. <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> is a gene consisting of 1419 bp without introns and is predicted to encode a protein consisting of 472 amino acids. Orthologs of <italic>FgDHODHII</italic> were obtained using the BLAST algorithm.

<title>Discussion</title>
    <p>In over 130 years of research on fungicide biology, more than 30 novel targets for selective fungicides have been identified. Based on these newly discovered targets, over 200 modern selective fungicides have been developed. Consequently, the identification of novel targets for fungicides poses a significantly greater challenge compared to the development of new fungicides. Currently, modern selective fungicides with single action site are widely applied in agricultural practices for crop disease management. However, these specific types of fungicides encounter substantial obstacles associated with resistance issues when deployed in agricultural fields. Numerous studies have extensively documented cases of plant pathogens developing resistance to modern selective fungicides, resulting in failures or reductions in their efficacy against plant diseases and subsequently leading to decreased crop yields and quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Duan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">King et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). For instance, <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, a significant plant pathogenic fungus, has emerged as multi-resistant population that is resistant to all currently used modern selective fungicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Shao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Weber et al., 2023</xref>). This poses a formidable challenge for the control of crop grey mold disease caused by <italic>B. cinerea</italic>. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of new fungicides with novel mechanisms of action to effectively manage multiple resistance.</p>
<p>The novel quinoline, quinofumelin, developed by Mitsui Chemicals Co., Ltd. Japan, has demonstrated remarkable antifungal activity against plant pathogens such as <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Xiu et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, our research group found that quinofumelin exhibits no cross-resistance to all types of currently used modern selective fungicides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tao et al., 2021</xref>). These findings indicate that quinofumelin possesses a distinctive mode of action against plant pathogens. Quinofumelin has been identified as a agrochemical fungicide targeting DHODHII in <italic>Pyricularia oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, ipflufenoquin, another agrochemical fungicide with an analogous mechanism of action to quinofumelin, has been reported to target DHODH in <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> (Rhijn et al., 2023). To elucidate the mode of action of quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, we conducted a comprehensive investigation using integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. The transcriptome data revealed that DEGs were involved in ‘tryptophan metabolism’ and ‘amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism’. Furthermore, the metabolome data identified DAMs enriched in ‘nucleotide metabolism’ and ‘amino acid metabolism’. Interestingly, we observed a co-enrichment of DEGs and DAMs in the pyrimidine metabolism pathway. Specifically, we identified a down-regulation of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) in the experimental groups, which impeded the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate. Consequently, this inhibition led to decreased biosynthesis of downstream metabolites orotidine-5P and uracil. Therefore, we conducted an experiment using <italic>F. graminearum</italic> standard strain PH-1 to quantify mycelial growth by supplementing exogenous uracil, which is the end product of the uracil biosynthesis pathway. This was performed in the presence of complete inhibition of mycelial growth caused by quinofumelin. Surprisingly, the addition of exogenous uracil restored the inhibited mycelial growth induced by quinofumelin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Meanwhile, similar results were successfully verified with four other <italic>F. graminearum</italic> strains and five <italic>F. asiaticum</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> and Fig. S4). Based on our depicted pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), we also supplemented other intermediate products such as dihydroorotate, orotate, UMP, and uridine externally. Except for dihydroorotate and orotate, supplementation of exogenous UMP and uridine effectively restored mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin as well. These findings strongly support that quinofumelin acts through modulation of the uracil biosynthesis pathway. Based on these findings and in conjunction with previous studies ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>; Rhijn et al., 2023), these agrochemical fungicides are categorized under FRAC group 52. This classification targets dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) during <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, as outlined by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frac.info/">https://www.frac.info/</ext-link>).As a key enzyme in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, DHODH has previously been investigated as a potential target for inhibiting infectious organisms and as an antitumor agent in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Mao et al., 2021</xref>). Inhibiting DHODH can effectively impede the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and glycoproteins, thereby regulating aberrant cell metabolism and proliferation to ultimately achieve therapeutic objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Boukalova et al., 2020</xref>). Within mammalian cells, DHODH is closely associated with the mitochondrial membrane and plays a pivotal role in the respiratory chain through its interaction with ubiquinone (Chen et al., 1976). Here, using amino acid sequences from <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> DHODHII as a reference query, we have identified FgDHODHII (FGSG_09678), a gene comprising of 1419 bp without any introns, which encodes 472 amino acids in <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. FgDHODHII possesses a typical DHOD-2 like domain (NCBI: cd04738) and belongs to class 2 DHODs. Class 2 DHODHs are membrane-bound enzymes, whereas class 1 enzymes are located in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Nørager et al., 2002</xref>). The DHODH enzyme catalyzes a unique redox reaction in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Dorasamy et al., 2017</xref>). The DHOD-2 like domain can bind orotate and flavin mononucleotide (FMN), facilitating the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate and the reduction of the FMN cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alves et al., 2015</xref>). Based on the aforementioned findings, we have concluded that DHODHII functions as the target of action for quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. Consequently, we performed a protoplast transformation assay to delete FgDHODHII in <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and further validate the precise target of action for quinofumelin. Typically, most fungicide targets are either lethal genes or essential pathogenic genes. Therefore, it is plausible that the inactivation of FgDHODHII may be lethal. In our genetic transformation experiment, exogenous uridine was supplemented to successfully obtain deletion mutants of the FgDHODHII gene. Fortunately, two ΔFgDHODHII mutants were successfully obtained. These mutants exhibited an inability to grow on PDA or CZA medium; however, mycelial growth was fully restored upon addition of uridine to the medium (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Additionally, exogenous supplementation of UMP or uracil effectively restored mycelial growth. However, the supplementation of dihydroorotate to the medium did not alleviate the growth defect observed in ΔFgDHODHII mutants (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Furthermore, mycelial growth in two ΔFgDHODHII mutants was restored by exogenously adding UMP, uracil or uridine under quinofumelin treatments. These findings indicate that the defects of FgDHODHII are functionally equivalent to complete inhibition of its activity by quinofumelin and further confirm that the mechanism of action for quinofumelin involves <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of uracil while identifying FgDHODHII as its specific target.</p>
<p>Molecular docking is a computational procedure employed to predict the optimal binding orientation of a ligand with its macromolecular target (receptor), thereby forming a stable complex. In concise terms, docking is a molecular modeling technique employed to predict the interaction between a protein (enzyme) and small molecules (ligands). In this study, we conducted molecular docking analysis between quinofumelin and the target protein FgDHODHII. The docking results unveiled a robust affinity between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin. Furthermore, these findings provided additional evidence that the strong affinity of quinofumelin with FgDHODHII disrupts its activity and function.</p>
<p>Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technique is employed for real-time measurement of molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Olaru et al., 2015</xref>). The SPR sensor map characterizes intermolecular interaction rates primarily by conveying the kinetic rate constant, while it characterizes the binding level between molecules mainly by conveying the affinity constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Guo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Piliarik et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we used SPR technology to measure the binding energy and kinetics between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin. The binding kinetics of FgDHODHII and quinofumelin demonstrated fast-binding and fast-dissociation modes. Soluble FgDHODHII exhibited an ideal affinity (Kd) of 6.606×10<sup>−6</sup> M with quinofumelin, falling within the suitable range of 10<sup>−3</sup> M to 10<sup>−</sup> <sup>6</sup> M for biomacromolecule-small molecule interactions. Furthermore, the binding affinity between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin was confirmed by a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay. Therefore, these data strongly support the precise interaction between quinofumelin and its target protein FgDHODHII. This newly discovered selective target for antimicrobial agents offers a valuable resource for the design and development of targeted pesticides.</p>
    <p>Unlike many other dehydrogenases that require NAD or NADP as an electron acceptor, DHODH transfers electrons to ubiquinone, which then transfers electrons into respiratory complex III and eventually to oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the production of orotate in pyrimidine biosynthesis is coupled with the electron transport system and energy production, exerting additional control over nucleotide synthesis and ensuring its coupling to cellular energy metabolism. In the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, DHODHII regulates the conversion from dihydroorotate to orotate. Our findings demonstrated that DHODHII is target of action for quinofumelin. A previous study reported that exogenous orotate but not exogenous dihydroorotate recovered mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin, indicating that quinofumelin inhibits the formation of orotate in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Higashimura et al., 2022</xref>). However, we observed that the supplementation of orotate to the medium did not alleviate the growth defect of ΔFgDHODHII mutants. Considering the disparity in mycelial growth inhibition between <italic>F. graminearum</italic> and other fungi, our data suggests that a nonclassical two-site ping-pong mechanism is the most suitable model for DHODH as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chen et al., 1992</xref>). In the classical ping-pong mechanism, DHODH interacts with dihydroorotate and ubiquinol in an identical confirmation, while orotate and ubiquinone combine with an alternative form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cleland, 1963</xref>). However, similar to brequinar sodium inhibiting the activity of DHODH isolated from mammalian sources, FgDHODHII may follow a nonclassical, two-site ping-pong mechanism. In this nonclassical ping-pong mechanism, the two substrates may not share chemical resemblance and therefore do not bind to a single binding site but likely bind to two adjacent sites that facilitate reactant transfer. The precise nature of the interaction between quinofumelin and FgDHODHII may require further elucidation studies.</p>

The resulting suspensions were gently mixed into regeneration medium (RM) (100 mL) containing 50 μg/mL uridine and poured into plates. After incubating for 24 h at 25°C, the plates were overlaid with selective regeneration medium (SRM) containing 50 μg/mL uridine and continuously incubated for an additional 4 days. The putative transformants could be observed growing on SRM. All primers used are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Molecular docking</title>
<p>The binding affinity of quinofumelin with FgDHODHII protein was assessed through molecular docking using AutoDockTools-1.5.7 software. The three-dimensional structure of quinofumelin (PubChem CID: 23160856) used for docking was obtained from PubChem database, while the three-dimensional structural model of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> DHODHII protein predicted by AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) was obtained from the UniProt database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bateman et al., 2019</xref>). In the docking studies, binding energy was employed as a metric to evaluate the strength of protein-ligand interaction, where lower values indicated higher affinity between proteins and ligands. The resulting docking outcomes were visualized using PyMOL software version 2.5.4.</p>

<title>Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) verification of specific interactions between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin</title>
    <p>The cDNA sequence of FgDHODHII was analyzed and codon optimization was performed for the <italic>E. coli</italic> expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kyriakopoulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Subsequently, it was ligated into the pCold-9×his-MBP plasmid and the pET-28a plasmid at the NdeI and EcoRI sites within the multiple cloning sites to construct recombinant plasmids: pCold-9×his-MBP-TEV-DHODHII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fang et al., 2018</xref>), pET-28a (+)-DHODHII and pET-28a (+)-DHODHII<sup>124-467</sup> (with removal of insoluble fragments) (Supplementary Information, Fig. S6).</p>
<p>Plasmid DNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.A Plasmid Extraction DNA Mini Kit I protocol (Omega, China). For protein overexpression, the exacted plasmids were separately transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>). A single clone obtained from each transformation was used for protein overexpression and purification. Upon reaching an OD600 of 1.0, 0.6 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to induce protein overexpression. Following induction at 16°C for 9 h, cells were harvested, lysed, and purified using a Ni-NTA column (QIAGEN).</p>
<p>The interaction between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin was evaluated using Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). The CM7 sensor chip was employed for immobilizing 50 μg/mL of purified FgDHODHII protein via amino coupling method at a flow rate of 10 μL/min, utilizing 1×PBS-P+ containing 5% DMSO as running buffer. The desired coupling amount of FgDHODHII protein on the chip surface was targeted to be within the range of 12000-24000 RU. To investigate binding affinity, quinofumelin concentrations were diluted from 3.90625 to 62.5 μM in a constant flow rate running buffer containing 5% DMSO. Following sample injection, a switching buffer was introduced to allow spontaneous dissociation of quinofumelin from FgDHODHII on the chip surface, and this dissociation process was continuously monitored in real time by measuring response values. The affinity value (Kd) was determined through kinetic analysis or steady-state affinity method.</p>

<title>Identification of specific interactions between FgDHODHII and quinofumelin using microscale thermophoresis (MST)</title>
<p>To construct the FgDHODHII-GFP cassette, the FgDHODHII fragment containing the native promoter and ORF (without the stop codon) was amplified. Subsequently, the resulting PCR product was co-transformed with XhoI-digested pYF11 into <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Tang et al., 2020</xref>). The fusion vector was then used to transform PH-1 to obtain the FgDHODHII-GFP strain. The GFP fusion protein was extracted from mycelia. Two Monolith NT.115 standard capillaries were employed for repeated absorption of a specific protein concentration, and placed in positions 1 and 2 of the sample tray in the MonoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument. Sixteen PCR tubes were prepared, with 10 μL DMSO added to PCR tubes 2-16 and 20 μL of 5000 μM quinofumelin (or phenamacril) dissolved in DMSO added to PCR tube 1. Then, 10 μL of quinofumelin from PCR tube 1 was transferred and thoroughly mixed with PCR tube 2 using a pipette. These steps were repeated for PCR tubes 3-16. Following mixing with PCR tube 16 (discarding the remaining 10 μL), each PCR tube was thoroughly mixed with 190 μL DHODHII-GFP protein, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Monolith NT.115 standard capillaries were inserted into each PCR tube to allow solution entry into the capillary. The capillaries 1-16 were subsequently placed in the sample tray of the device and the program was initiated. All measurements were performed using 80% (Auto-detect) Nano-RED. MonoTemper Monolith NT.115 software was used to evaluate the binding affinity between the target protein and quinofumelin using the Kd values and the signal to noise ratio, and the results were combined and analyzed using Mo. Affinity Analysis v2.3 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rotem et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors aim to identify the mode of action/molecular mechanism of characterized a fungicide, quinofumelin, and its biological impact on transcriptomics and metabolomics in Fusarium graminearum and other Fusarium species. Two sets of data were generated between quinofumelin and no treatment group, and differentially abundant transcripts and metabolites were identified, suggesting a potential role of pyrimidine biosynthesis. Upon studying the genetic mutants of the uridine/uracil biosynthesis pathway with quinofumelin treatment and metabolite supplementation, combining in vitro biochemical assay of quinofumelin and F.graminearum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase protein, the authors identified that quinofumelin inhibits the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and blocks downstream metabolite biosynthesis, limiting fungal metabolism and growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Omics datasets were leveraged to understand the physiological impact of quinofumelin, showing the intracellular impact of the fungicide. The characterization of FgDHODHII deletion strains with supplemented metabolites clearly showed the impact of the enzyme on fungal growth. Corroborating in vitro and in vivo data revealed the direct interaction of quinofumelin with Fusarium protein target.</p>
<p>Potential Impact:</p>
<p>Understanding this new mechanism could facilitate rational design or screen for molecules targeting the same pathway, or improve binding affinity and inhibitor potency. Confirming the target of quinofumelin may also help understand its resistance mechanism, and further development of other inhibitory molecules against the target.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript shows the mechanism of action of quinofumelin, a novel fungicide, against the fungus Fusarium graminearum. Through omics analysis, phenotypic analysis and in silico approaches, the role of quinofumelin in targeting DHODH is uncovered.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The phenotypic analysis and mutant generation are nice data and add to the role of metabolites in bypassing pyrimidine biosynthesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The role of DHODH in this class of fungicides has been known and this data does not add any further significance to the field.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Phytophathogens including fungal pathogens such as <italic>F. graminearum</italic> remain a major threat to agriculture and food security. Several agriculturally relevant fungicides including the potent Quinofumelin have been discovered to date, yet the mechanisms of their action and specific targets within the cell remain unclear. This paper sets out to contribute to addressing these outstanding questions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's accurate summary of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is generally well-written and provides convincing data to support their claims for the impact of Quinofumelin on fungal growth, the target of the drug, and the potential mechanism. Critically the authors identify an important pyrimidine pathway dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) gene FgDHODHII in the pathway or mechanism of the drug from the prominent plant pathogen <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, confirming it as the target for Quinofumelin. The evidence is supported by transcriptomic, metabolomic as well as MST, SPR, molecular docking/structural biology analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of the strengths of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Whilst the study adds to our knowledge about this drug, it is, however, worth stating that previous reports (although in different organisms) by Higashimura et al., 2022 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9716045/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9716045/</ext-link> had already identified DHODH as the target for Quinofumelin and hence this knowledge is not new and hence the authors may want to tone down the claim that they discovered this mechanism and also give sufficient credit to the previous authors work at the start of the write-up in the introduction section rather than in passing as they did with reference 25? other specific recommendations to improve the text are provided in the recommendations for authors section below.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. In the revised manuscript, we have incorporated the reference in the introduction section and expanded the discussion of previous work on quinofumelin by Higashimura et al., 2022 in the discussion section to more effectively contextualize their contributions. Moreover, we have made revisions and provided responses in accordance with the recommendations.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the current study, the authors aim to identify the mode of action/molecular mechanism of characterized a fungicide, quinofumelin, and its biological impact on transcriptomics and metabolomics in Fusarium graminearum and other Fusarium species. Two sets of data were generated between quinofumelin and no treatment group, and differentially abundant transcripts and metabolites were identified. The authors further focused on uridine/uracil biosynthesis pathway, considering the significant up- and down-regulation observed in final metabolites and some of the genes in the pathways. Using a deletion mutant of one of the genes and in vitro biochemical assays, the authors concluded that quinofumelin binds to the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's accurate summary of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Omics datasets were leveraged to understand the physiological impact of quinofumelin, showing the intracellular impact of the fungicide. The characterization of FgDHODHII deletion strains with supplemented metabolites clearly showed the impact of the enzyme on fungal growth.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's recognition of the strengths of our manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Some interpretation of results is not accurate and some experiments lack controls. The comparison between quinofumelin-treated deletion strains, in the presence of different metabolites didn't suggest the fungicide is FgDHODHII specific. A wild type is required in this experiment.</p>
<p>Potential Impact: Confirming the target of quinofumelin may help understand its resistance mehchanism, and further development of other inhibitory molecules against the target.</p>
<p>The manuscript would benefit more in explaining the study rationale if more background on previous characterization of this fungicide on Fusarium is given.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. Under no treatment with quinofumelin, mycelial growth remains normal and does not require restoration. In the presence of quinofumelin treatment, the supplementation of downstream metabolites in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway can restore mycelial growth that is inhibited by quinofumelin. The wild-type control group is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 5b depicts the phenotypes of the deletion mutants. With respect to the relationship among quinofumelin, FgDHODHII, and other metabolites, quinofumelin specifically targets the key enzyme FgDHODHII in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, disrupting the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, which consequently inhibits the synthesis downstream metabolites including uracil. In our previous study, quinofumelin not only exhibited excellent antifungal activity against the mycelial growth and spore germination of <italic>F. graminearum</italic>, but also inhibited the biosynthesis of deoxynivalenol (DON). We have added this part to the introduction section.</p>

<p>Thank you for this insightful suggestion. We fully agree with the importance of elucidating the interaction mechanism. At present, we are conducting site-directed mutagenesis studies based on interaction sites from docking results and the mutation sites of FgDHODHII from the resistant mutants; however, due to the limitations in the accuracy of existing predictive models, this work remains ongoing.

<p>(12) Figure 2a:</p>
<p>It seems many more metabolites were reduced than increased. Is this expected? Due to the antifungal activity of this compound, how sick is the fungus upon treatment? A physiological study on F. graminearum (in a dose-dependent manner) should be done prior to the omics study. Why do you think there's a stark difference between positive and negative modes in terms of number of metabolites down- and up-regulated?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Quinofumelin demonstrates exceptional antifungal activity against <italic>Fusarium graminearum</italic>. The results indicate that the number of reduced metabolites significantly exceeds the number of increased metabolites upon quinofumelin treatment. Mycelial growth is markedly inhibited under quinofumelin exposure. Prior to conducting omics studies, we performed a series of physiological and biochemical experiments (refer to Qian Xiu's dissertation <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paper.njau.edu.cn/openfile?dbid=72&amp;objid=50_49_57_56_49_49&amp;flag=free">https://paper.njau.edu.cn/openfile?dbid=72&amp;objid=50_49_57_56_49_49&amp;flag=free</ext-link>). Upon quinofumelin treatment, the number of down-regulated metabolites notably surpasses that of up-regulated metabolites compared to the control group. Based on the findings from the down-regulated metabolites, we conducted experiments by exogenously supplementing these metabolites under quinofumelin treatment to investigate whether mycelial growth could be restored. The results revealed that only the exogenous addition of uracil can restore mycelial growth impaired by quinofumelin.</p>
<p>Quinofumelin exhibits an excellent antifungal activity against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. At a concentration of 1 μg/mL, quinofumelin inhibits mycelial growth by up to 90%. This inhibitory effect indicates that life activities of <italic>F. graminearum</italic> are significantly disrupted by quinofumelin. Consequently, there is a marked difference in down- and up-regulated metabolites between quinofumelin-treated group and untreated control group. The detailed results were presented in Figures 1 and 2.</p>

<p>We validated the expression level of the DHODH gene under quinofumelin treatment using RT-qPCR. The results indicated that, upon treatment with the EC50 and EC90 concentrations of quinofumelin, the expression of the DHODH gene was significantly reduced by 11.91% and 33.77%, respectively (P&lt;0.05). The corresponding results have been shown in Figure S4.</p>

<p>The experiments involving the exogenous supplementation of uracil revealed that the addition of uracil could restore mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin. Consequently, we infer that quinofumelin disrupts the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway.

<p>(18) Line 164:</p>
<p>Why do you hypothesize supplementing dihydroorotate would restore resistance? The metabolite seemed accumulated in the treatment condition, whereas downstream metabolites were comparable or even depleted. The DHODH gene expression was suppressed. Would accumulation of dihydroorotate be associated with growth inhibition by quinofumelin? Please include the hypothesis and rationale for the experimental setup.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>DHODH regulates the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. The inhibition of DHODH by quinofumelin results in the accumulation of dihydroorotate and the depletion of the downstream metabolites, including UMP, uridine and uracil. Consequently, downstream metabolites were considered as positive controls, while upstream metabolite dihydroorotate served as a negative control. This design further demonstrates DHODH as action target of quinofumelin against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. In addition, the accumulation of dihydroorotate is not associated with growth inhibition by quinofumelin; however, but the depletion of downstream metabolites in the <italic>de novo</italic> pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway is closely associated with growth inhibition by quinofumelin.</p>

In contrast, the second row (third column, fourth column, fifth colomns) for each strain demonstrated that the supplementation of 50 μg/mL of UMP, uridine and uracil, respectively, can effectively restore mycelial growth inhibited by quinofumelin.</p>

<p>Would you expect different restoration of growth in the presence of quinofumelin vs. no treatment? The wild type control is missing here. Any conclusions about the relationship between quinofumelin, FgDHODHII, and other metabolites in the pathway?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Under no treatment with quinofumelin, mycelial growth remains normal and does not require restoration. In the presence of quinofumelin treatment, the supplementation of downstream metabolites in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway can restore mycelial growth that is inhibited by quinofumelin. The wild-type control group is illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 5b depicts the phenotypes of the deletion mutants. With respect to the relationship among quinofumelin, FgDHODHII, and other metabolites, quinofumelin specifically targets the key enzyme FgDHODHII in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway, disrupting the conversion of dihydroorotate to orotate, which consequently inhibits the synthesis downstream metabolites including uracil.</p>

<p>Lacking positive and negative controls (known binder and non-binder). What does the Kd (in comparison to other interactions) indicate in terms of binding strength?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tested the antifungal activities of publicly reported DHODH inhibitors (such as leflunomide and teriflunomide) against <italic>F. graminearum</italic>. The results showed that these inhibitors exhibited no significant inhibitory effects against the strain PH-1. Therefore, we lacked an effective chemical for use as a positive control in subsequent experiments. Biacore experiments offers detailed insights into molecular interactions between quinofumelin and DHODHII. As shown in Figure 6b, the left panel illustrates the time-dependent kinetic curve of quinofumelin binding to DHODHII. Within the first 60 s after quinofumelin was introduced onto the DHODHII surface, it bound to the immobilized DHODHII on the chip surface, with the response value increasing proportionally to the quinofumelin concentration. Following cessation of the injection at 60 s, quinofumelin spontaneously dissociated from the DHODHII surface, leading to a corresponding decrease in the response value. The data fitting curve presented on the right panel indicates that the affinity constant KD of quinofumelin for DHODHII is 6.606×10-6 M, which falls within the typical range of KD values (10-3 ~ 10-6 M) for protein-small molecule interaction patterns. A lower KD value indicates a stronger affinity; thus, quinofumelin exhibits strong binding affinity towards DHODHII.</p>
