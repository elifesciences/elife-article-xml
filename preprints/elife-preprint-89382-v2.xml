<title>Summary</title>
<p>Suppressive function of regulatory T cells (Treg) is dependent on signaling of their antigen receptors triggered by cognate self, dietary or microbial antigens in the form of peptide-MHC class II complexes. However, it remains largely unknown whether distinct or shared repertoires of Treg TCRs are mobilized in response to different challenges in the same tissue or the same challenge in different tissues. Here we used a fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model to analyze conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector TCRα repertoires in response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lung and skin. This model showed highly “digital” repertoire behavior, allowing for easy-to-track challenge-specific TCRα CDR3 clusters. For both studied subsets, we observed challenge-specific clonal expansion yielding homologous TCRα clusters within and across animals and exposure sites, which were also reflected in the draining lymph nodes but not systemically. Some clusters were shared across cancer challenges, suggesting response to common tumor-associated antigens. For most challenges, eCD4 and eTreg clonal response did not overlap, indicating the distinct origin of the two cell subsets. At the same time, we observed such overlap at the sites of certain tumor challenges. The overlaps included dominant responding TCRα motif and characteristic iNKT TCRα, suggesting the tumor-induced eCD4-eTreg plasticity. Additionally, our TCRα repertoire analysis demonstrated that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for eTreg cells residing in particular lymphatic tissues, regardless of the challenge, revealing the homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations. Altogether, our study highlights both challenge-specific and tissue-specific responses of Treg cells associated with distinct clonal expansions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory T cells (Treg), which constitute 5-10% of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are indispensable for the maintenance of immunological self-tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> and regulation of ongoing immune responses to microbiotal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and foreign<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> antigens, contributing to tissue and metabolic homeostasis and regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Treg suppress immune responses through various mechanisms, but primarily do so via antigen-specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> interaction with professional and non-professional antigen-presenting cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. There is considerable data suggesting that Treg employ higher-affinity T cell receptor (TCRs) and CTLA4 to compete with conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in an antigen-specific manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Most Treg cells are produced by the thymus as a functionally distinct FoxP3<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. Thymic Treg are generated based on positive selection against self-peptide/MHCII (pMHCII) complexes in the thymic medulla, and multiple other immune cell types may further contribute to this process, including medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), resident and immigrating dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells<sup>2,13-15</sup>.</p>
<p>Here we investigated the TCR landscape of conventional (eCD4) and regulatory (eTreg) effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in lungs, spleen, skin, and three lymph node locations after response to six distinct antigenic challenges to the lungs or skin (see <bold>Graphical abstract</bold>). We used FoxP3-GFP mice with a fixed TCRβ context<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and analyzed the TCRα repertoire composition for eCD4 and eTreg cells.</p>
<p>The adaptive immune system in this mouse model relies entirely on TCRα diversity to generate antigen-specific responses. On one hand, the relatively limited TCRα repertoire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> results in highly convergent responses that are easily traceable across groups of mice facing the same challenge. The selection of the same or highly similar TCRα sequences against each antigen leads to the formation of clusters of homologous TCRα CDR3s within and between mice. On the other hand, this model allows for the tracking of all challenge-specific or tissue-specific features of the TCR repertoire using only one chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Overall, compared to conventional mice, this model provides a more powerful means of monitoring convergent TCR responses. At the same time, the model generally mimics the natural behavior of the full-fledged TCRαβ T cell repertoire.</p>
<p>Both for eCD4 and eTreg subpopulations, our analysis of the TCRα repertoire on the fixed TCRβ background revealed a highly focused response which was distinct for each of the antigenic challenges. The response was clonotypically shared between individual mice and between different tissues and formed clear convergent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> TCRα CDR3 sequence motifs responding to the challenges.</p>
<p>In conditions with such a highly convergent TCR response involving multiple independently-primed T cell clones with similar TCRα CDR3 sequences, one could expect a similar repertoire of clonotypes to dominate within the eCD4 and eTreg subpopulations, given the assumption that both subsets may start from the same pool of antigen-inexperienced naïve T cells. However, we demonstrate that the TCR landscape of eCD4 and eTreg responses was distinct, suggesting that these effector cell types originate from distinct T cell subsets.</p>
<p>The exceptions were the antigenic challenges with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and MMTV-PyMT-derived tumor cells (PYMT), where we observed increased overlap between the eCD4 and eTreg repertoires at the site of challenge, but not systemically. A dominant eCD4 TCRα motif was also present in corresponding eTreg subsets in the LLC and PYMT challenge.</p>
<p>Similarly, the characteristic innate natural killer T cell (iNKT) TCRα variants (that were abundant within eCD4 subsets upon challenge with LLC, bleomycin, and the helminth <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic>) were represented in the corresponding eTreg subset in the LLC challenge experiments but not with the bleomycin and helminth antigens. We attribute these observations to the transient plasticity of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the context of an immunosuppressive tumor burden.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we reveal tissue-specific eTreg TCRα CDR3 motifs that were always present in specific tissue locations irrespectively of the applied antigenic challenge. This observation highlights the existence of the diverse homing-specific, antigen-specific resident Treg populations.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results show the highly antigen-specific and distinct eCD4 and eTreg responses to different challenges, supporting the initial thymic programming of Treg cells responding to newly incoming challenges, and suggest that the fixed TCRβ chain, FoxP3-GFP mouse offers a valuable “digital” model of TCR response that benefits from highly convergent, easy-to-track TCRα CDR3 motifs.</p>

<title>TCRα repertoire sequencing</title>
<p>Six distinct challenges including influenza virus, <italic>N. brasiliensis</italic>, bleomycin-induced injury, LLC, PYMT, and B16 melanoma were applied to the lung and skin of <italic>Foxp3</italic><sup><italic>gfp</italic></sup> <italic>Tcra</italic><sup><italic>−/+</italic></sup> mice bearing the DO11.10 TCRβ transgene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> (3–7 mice per group, see <bold>Supplementary Table 1</bold> for details on each tissue and challenge experiment). After incubation, mice were sacrificed and tissue from the lungs, spleen, skin, and three types of lymph nodes (lung-draining mediastinal, MLN, axillary, AXLN, and intraglandular, IGLN) were isolated and digested to generate single-cell suspensions. eCD4 and eTreg CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted based on FoxP3-GFP signal. RNA-based unique molecular identifier (UMI)-labeled TCRα cDNA libraries were obtained using a previously-reported technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> with minor modifications, and then analyzed using MIGEC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and MiXCR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> software. See <bold>Graphical abstract</bold> for the experimental scheme. Altogether, we sequenced 524 TCRα cDNA libraries, yielding 13,605 ± 14,948 UMI-labeled TCRα cDNA molecules and 3,392 ± 3,076 TCRα CDR3 clonotypes per eTreg sample, and 37,412 ± 33,129 UMI-labeled TCRα cDNA molecules and 5,518 ± 4,601 TCRα CDR3 clonotypes per eCD4 sample (see <bold>Supplementary Table 2</bold> for details on each cloneset).</p>
<p>Lungs are exposed to a myriad of different insults during their lifetime and are constantly in need of a T cell response to resolve inflammatory insults. Furthermore, Treg with an effector phenotype accumulate in the inflamed lung<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> but it remains poorly understood whether there is a common antigenic denominator driving TCR specificities in the tissue or whether there are selective TCR subsets expanded upon a particular inflammatory insult. Therefore, in the following analyses, we mainly focused on TCR repertoires obtained from T cells infiltrating the lung tissue, for which we have also obtained the largest collection of samples, with several more specific cross-tissue analyses showing the similarity of systemic T cell responses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Clonality of eCD4 and eTreg repertoires in the lung</title>
<p>First, we explored how clonal the eCD4 and eTreg response is in lungs following distinct antigenic challenges. TCRα repertoire diversity was assessed using several widely used metrics, including observed diversity (number of distinct clonotypes), normalized Shannon Wiener index (repertoire evenness and the extent of clonal expansion) and Chao 1 (estimated lower bound of total diversity based on relative representation of small clonotypes). For normalization, all of these metrics were obtained from datasets that had been down-sampled to 1,000 randomly-chosen, UMI-labeled TCRα cDNAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We observed a prominent clonal response to each of the challenges compared to the control group (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–c</xref></bold>). The decrease in diversity metrics was comparable for the lung-infiltrating eCD4 and eTreg cells. This indicates that the amplitude and focused nature of the effector and regulatory T cell response in lungs is generally comparable.</p>

<title>Responding eCD4 and eTreg repertoires are distinct</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed all-versus-all pairwise overlap of the amino acid TCRα CDR3 repertoires of lung-infiltrating eTreg and eCD4 cells. We used F2 similarity metrics in the VDJtools software<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>, which employs a clonotype-wise sum of geometric mean frequencies that takes into account the relative size of shared clonotypes. As such, F2 metrics generally enable comparison of pairs of TCR repertoires with regard to the relative share occupied by common clonotypes. This analysis showed that the eTreg and eCD4 repertoires are highly distinct across distinct challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>eTreg response is convergent and differs for distinct challenges</title>
<p>We next zoomed in on the eTreg repertoire in order to investigate how focused their antigen-specific response is in the lungs. Repertoire overlap analysis showed that eTreg repertoires were highly similar across mice for each of the challenges, and differed between challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref></bold>). Cluster sequence analysis further revealed common dominant TCRα CDR3 motifs in response to each of the challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">2</xref>, Supplementary Tables 4</bold>,<bold>5</bold>). It should be noted that the eTreg repertoires in the three different cancer challenges (B16, LLC, and PYMT) clustered together and shared some CDR3 motifs, suggesting response to shared tumor-associated antigens. In LLC and PYMT, but not in other challenges, some of the characteristic CDR3 motifs were shared with the eCD4 subset.</p>

<title>eTreg repertoire upon lung challenge is reflected in the draining lymph node</title>
<p>It has previously been shown in a mouse model that the antigen-specific Treg response to influenza in the lungs is also reflected in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node (MLN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Our data revealed this at the repertoire level, showing that the same TCR clonotypes and CDR3 motifs distinguish antigen-specific eTreg response to each of the different lung challenges in the lung and MLN (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">2</xref>, Supplementary Tables 4</bold>,<bold>5</bold>). It should be noted that each challenge produces its own specific response, wherein eTreg TCRα CDR3 repertoires from the lung and MLN are located side by side. At the same time, the lung and MLN eTreg repertoires of control mice obtained in the absence of any antigenic challenges were distinct, confirming that repertoire similarity is dictated by corresponding antigenic challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref></bold>). In contrast, the eTreg repertoires in distant AXLN and IGLN lymph nodes and the spleen were less similar to that observed in the lungs, and clustered separately (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c–f</xref></bold>). Altogether, these results demonstrate the selective tissue localization of the antigen-focused Treg response.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">

<title>eCD4 to eTreg conversion is only observed in two cancer challenges</title>
<p>As can be seen in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref></bold>, TCRα CDR3 eTreg and eCD4 amino acid repertoires in the lungs were more similar in the context of the LLC tumor challenge compared to other challenges, and this could reflect induced plasticity of the eCD4 subset. In order to assess possible eCD4-to-eTreg clonal conversion due to natural helper T cell plasticity, we analyzed eTreg versus eCD4 repertoire overlap at the level of CDR3a nucleotide clonotypes for paired eCD4-eTreg samples obtained from the same mice. Estimated eCD4-to-eTreg conversion was strongest in skin and in lung following LLC and PYMT challenge, but was low or absent in the aftermath of other antigenic challenges, including B16 tumor (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a,c</xref></bold>). The effect was probably local and transient, and was not observed at systemic level in the spleen (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b,d</xref></bold>). CDR3a cluster #408 was the major contributor to the observed conversion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Local lymphatic tissue-resident eTreg and eCD4 cells</title>
<p>Global TCRα CDR3 cluster analysis revealed that characteristic eTreg TCR motifs were present in distinct lymphatic tissues, including spleen and thymus, irrespective of the applied challenge (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figs. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figS2">2</xref>, Supplementary Tables 4</bold>,<bold>5</bold>). To better illustrate this phenomenon, we performed MDS analysis of TCRα CDR3 repertoires for distinct lymphatic tissues, excluding the lungs due to their otherwise dominant response to the current challenge. This analysis demonstrated close proximity of eTreg repertoires obtained from the same lymphatic tissues upon all lung challenges and across all animals (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a, b</xref></bold>). These results indicate that distinct antigenic specificities are generally characteristic for eTreg cells that preferentially reside in particular lymphatic niches.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We observed a prominent local clonal response to different antigenic challenges within the lung. Remarkably, this effect was comparable for both lung-infiltrating eCD4 and eTreg cells, suggesting similar amplitude for the effector and regulatory response (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a–c</xref></bold>). The TCR repertoires of the eTreg and eCD4 subsets were highly distinct across antigenic challenges (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref></bold>). At the same time, eTreg repertoires were highly similar across mice for each challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a, b</xref></bold>), and common TCRα CDR3 motifs dominated each response (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>). That being said, the eTreg repertoires were similar for the three different cancer challenges, suggesting a response to shared tumor-associated antigens. Antigen-specific Treg response in lungs was reflected in the lung-draining MLN, but not in distant tissues including the AXLN, IGLN, and spleen (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref></bold>), showing the local character of the antigen-specific regulatory response.</p>
<p>For the LLC and PYMT tumors—but not other antigenic challenges—the overall repertoires and dominant CDR3 motifs were shared between the two subsets, suggesting induction of eCD4-eTreg plasticity. Further analysis showed that eCD4 to eTreg conversion was strongest in the skin and lung following LLC and PYMT tumor challenge, and was observed in the site of challenge but not systemically (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a–e</xref></bold>). The presence of an increased proportion of Treg-iNKT cells among the total pool of eTreg cells in the lung upon LLC challenge provided further support for the notion of tumor-induced plasticity (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f–h</xref></bold>). This observation is of particular interest in the context of recent reports on innate-like T cell anti-tumor response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The local eTreg response to a given tumor type was clonally very similar upon lung and skin challenge, showing that the antigen-specific character of the eTreg response dominates over the tissue location of the initial challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Strikingly, we observed commonality between eTreg repertoires obtained from the same lymphoid tissue in different mice irrespectively of the antigenic challenge (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a,b</xref></bold>). This observation indicates that distinct antigenic specificities are characteristic for Treg cells with distinct tissue residence.</p>
<p>The eCD4 subset generally exhibited similar patterns to the eTregs, although the extent of convergence among eTreg repertoires was higher in most scenarios compared to the eCD4 subset, indicating the highly antigen-specific nature of the Treg response.</p>
<p>Altogether, our data demonstrate highly antigen-specific and distinct Teff and Treg responses to different challenges and support the use of the fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse as a “digital” model of TCR response that benefits from access to highly convergent and easy-to-track TCRα CDR3 clusters.</p>

A dose of 1x 10<sup>5</sup> cells in 200 uL DMEM was injected to each mouse intravenously (i.v) via the tail vein or subcutaneously (s.c) in right flank to induce lung or skin tumors, respectively. Influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus was grown in the cavity of 10-day embryonated chicken eggs, and a dose 100 pfu in 35 uL PBS was used to challenge mice intranasally (i.n)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. <italic>Nippostrongylus brasiliensis</italic> L3 stage larvae were passaged and isolated from the feces of Wistar rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. 500-700 infective L3 larvae were injected s.c to mice in 500 uL PBS. Bleomycin for injection was obtained from the pharmacy and each mouse was challenged i.n with a dose of 0.1 U in 35 uL PBS. Control mice were mock challenged with PBS.

As a baseline, we used random mouse TCRα VDJ rearrangements. Each cluster was assigned a frequency based on the total frequency of T cells encoding corresponding CDR3s within a sample. The CDR3 cluster frequency matrix was then subjected to hierarchical clustering using the ‘aheatmap’ R package with default parameters.</p>

<p>This study presents a valuable exploration of CD4+ T cell response in a fixed TCRβ chain FoxP3-GFP mouse model across stimuli and tissues through the analysis of their TCRα repertoires. This is an insightful paper for the community as it suggests several future directions of exploration.</p>
<p>The authors compare Treg and conventional CD4+ repertoires by looking at diversity measures and the relative overlap of shared clonotypes to characterize similarity across different tissues and antigen challenges. They find distinct yet convergent responses with occasional plasticity across subsets for some stimuli. The observed lack of a general behavior highlights the need for careful comparison of immune repertoires across cell subsets and tissues. Such comparisons are crucial in order to better understand the heterogeneity of the adaptive immune response. This mouse model demonstrates its utility for this task due to the reduced diversity of the TCRα repertoire and the ability to track a single chain.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has significantly improved in terms of clarity of explanations and presentations of the results.</p>

<p>eLife assessment</p>
<p>This manuscript presents a valuable approach to exploring CD4+ T-cell response in mice across stimuli and tissues through the analysis of their T-cell receptor repertoires. The authors use a transgenic mouse model, in which the possible diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire is reduced, such that each of a diverse set of immune exposures elicits more detectably consistent T-cell responses across different individuals. However, whereas the proposed experimental system could be utilized to study convergent T-cell responses, the analyses done in this manuscript are incomplete and do not support the claims due to limitations in the statistical analyses and lack of data/code access.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study investigates T-cell repertoire responses in a mouse model with a transgenic beta chain, such that all T-cells in all mice share a fixed beta chain, and repertoire diversity is determined solely by alpha chain rearrangements. Each mouse is exposed to one of a few distinct immune challenges, sacrificed, and T-cells are sampled from multiple tissues. FACS is used to sort CD4 and Treg cell populations from each sample, and TCR repertoire sequencing from UMI-tagged cDNA is done.</p>
<p>Various analyses using repertoire diversity, overlap, and clustering are presented to support several principal findings: 1) TCR repertoires in this fixed beta system have highly distinct clonal compositions for each immune challenge and each cell type, 2) these are highly consistent across mice, so that mice with shared challenges have shared clones, and 3) induction of CD4-to-Treg cell type transitions is challenge-specific.</p>
<p>The beta chain used for this mouse model was previously isolated based on specificity for Ovalbumin. Because the beta chain is essential for determining TCR antigen specificity, and is highly diverse in wildtype mice, I found it surprising that these mice are reported to have robust and consistently focused clonal responses to very diverse immune challenges, for which a fixed OVA-specific beta chain is unlikely to be useful. The authors don't comment on this aspect of their findings, but I would think it is not expected <italic>a priori</italic> that this would work.
If this does work as reported, it is a valuable model system: due to massively reduced diversity, the TCR repertoire response is much more stereotyped across individual samples, and it is much easier to detect challenge-specific TCRs via the statistics of convergent responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This was to some extent expected, since these mice live almost normally and have productive adaptive immune responses and protection. In real life, there are frequent TCR-pMHC interactions where the TCR-alpha chain dominates (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701794/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5701794/</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047500/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37047500/</ext-link>). On the fixed TCR-beta background this mechanics starts working full-fledged, essentially substituting TCR-beta diversity, at the extent of relatively simplified TCRab repertoire and probably higher cross-reactivity.</p>
<p>We agree that this is a valuable model, for sure, and indicated this in the last sentence of our Discussion. Now we are also adding this point to the abstract.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the data and analyses present interesting signals, they are flawed in several ways that undermine the reported findings. I summarize below what I think are the most substantive data and analysis issues.</p>
<p>(1) There may be systematic inconsistencies in repertoire sampling depth that are not described in the manuscript. Looking at the supplementary tables (and making some plots), I found that the control samples (mice with mock challenge) have consistently much shallower sampling-in terms of both read count and UMI count-compared with the other challenge samples. There is also a strong pattern of lower counts for Treg vs CD4 cell samples within each challenge.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The immune response of control mice is less extensive, as it should be. Just like the fact that the number of Tregs in tissues is lower than CD4, this is normal. So this all follows the expectations.  But please note that we were very accurate everywhere with appropriate data normalisation, using all our previous extensive experience (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>In particular (now adding more relevant details to Methods):</p>
<p>For diversity metrics calculations, we randomly sampled an equal number of 1000 UMI from each cloneset. Samples with UMI &lt; 700 were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>For amino acid overlap metrics calculations, we selected top-1000 largest clonotypes from each cloneset. Samples with clonotype counts &lt; 700 were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>For nucleotide overlaps  metrics calculations (eCD4-eTreg), we selected top-100 clonotypes from each cloneset. Samples with clonotypes &lt; 100 were excluded from analysis.</p>
<p>The top N clonotypes were selected as the top N clonotypes after randomly shuffling the sequences and aligning them in descending order. This was done in order to get rid of the alphabetical order for clonotypes with equal counts (e.g. count = 1 or 2).</p>
<p>Downsampling was carried out using software vdjtools v.1.2.1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) FACS data are not reported. Although the graphical abstract shows a schematic FACS plot, there are no such plots in the manuscript. Related to the issue above, it would be important to know the FACS cell counts for each sample.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we agree that this is valuable information that should be provided. Unfortunately, this data has not been preserved.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) For diversity estimation, UMI-wise downsampling was performed to normalize samples to 1000 random UMIs, but this procedure is not validated (the optimal normalization would require downsampling cells). What is the influence of possible sampling depth discrepancies mentioned above on diversity estimation? All of the Treg control samples have fewer than 1000 total UMIs-doesn't that pose a problem for sampling 1000 random UMIs?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, I simulated this procedure and found systematic effects on diversity estimates when taking samples of different numbers of cells (each with a simulated UMI count) from the same underlying repertoire, even after normalizing to 1000 random UMIs. I don't think UMI downsampling corrects for cell sampling depth differences in diversity estimation, so it's not clear that the trends in Fig 1A are not artifactual-they would seem to show higher diversity for control samples, but these are the very same samples with an apparent systematic sampling depth bias.</p>
<p>We evaluated this approach through all our work, and summarised in the ref: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/</ext-link>. Altogether,  normalising to the same count of randomly sampled UMI seems to be the best approach (although, preferably, the initial sequencing depth should be essentially higher for all samples than the sampling threshold used). Initial sorting of identical numbers of cells and ideally uniform library preparation and sequencing is generally not realistic and does not work in the real world, while UMI downsampling does the same work much better.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The Figures may be inconsistent with the data. I downloaded the Supplementary Table corresponding to Fig 1 and made my own version of panels A-C. This looked quite different from the diversity estimations depicted in the manuscript. The data does not match the scale or trends shown in the manuscript figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There was a wrong column for Chao1, now correcting. Also, please note that we only used samples with &gt; 700 UMI. Supplementary Table now corrected accordingly. Also, please note that Figure 1 shows the results for lung samples only.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) For the overlap analysis, a different kind of normalization was performed, but also not validated. Instead of sampling 1000 UMIs, the repertoires were reduced to their top 1000 most frequent clones. It is not made clear why a different normalization would be needed here. There are several samples (including all Treg control samples) with only a couple hundred clones. It's also likely that the noted systematic sampling depth differences may drive the separation seen in MDS1 between Treg and CD4 cell types. I also simulated this alternative downsampling procedure and found strong effects on MDS clustering due to sampling effects alone.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>That’s right, for the overlap analysis (which values are mathematically proportional to the clonotype counts in both compared repertoires, so the difference in the counts causes major biases) the right way to do it is to choose the same number of clonotypes. See Ref. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29080364/</ext-link>.</p>
<p>We kept only samples with &gt; 700 for the overlap analyses. Some relatively poor samples are present in all challenges, while MDS1 localization has clear reproducible logic, so we are confident in these results.</p>

<p>It is not made clear how the overlap scores were converted to distances for MDS. It's hard to interpret this without seeing the overlap matrix.</p>

<p>(6) The cluster analysis is superficial, and appears to have been cherry-picked. The clusters reported in the main text have illegibly small logo plots, and no information about V/J gene enrichments. More importantly, as the caption states they were chosen from the columns of a large (and messier-looking) cluster matrix in the supplementary figure based on association with each specific challenge. There's no detail about how this association was calculated, or how it controlled for multiple tests. I don't think it is legitimate to simply display a set of clusters that visually correlate; in a sufficiently wide random matrix you will find columns that seem to correlate with any given pattern across rows.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Particular CDR3 sequences and VJ segments do not mean much for the results of this manuscript. Logos are given just for visual explanation of how the consensus motifs of the clusters look like.</p>
<p>We now add two more Supplementary Tables and a Supplementary Figure with full information about clusters.</p>
<p>We disagree that the Supplementary Figure 1 (representing all the clusters) looks “messy”. Vice versa, it is surprisingly “digital”, showing the clear patterns of responses and homings. This becomes clear if you visually study it for a while. But yes, it is too big to let the reader focus on this or that aspect. That is why we need to select TCR clusters to illustrate this or that aspect discussed in the work, but they were selected from the overall already structured picture.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) The findings on differential plasticity and CD4 to Treg conversion are not supported. If CD4 cells are converting to Tregs, we expect more nucleotide-level overlap of clones. This intuition makes sense. But it seems that this section affirms the consequent: variation in nucleotide-level clone overlap is a readout of variation in CD4 to Treg conversion. It is claimed, based on elevated nucleotide-level overlap, that the LLC and PYMT challenges induce conversion more readily than the other challenges. It is not noted in the textual interpretations, but Fig 4 also shows that the control samples had a substantially elevated nucleotide-level overlap. There is no mention of a null hypothesis for what we'd expect if there was no induced conversion going on at all. This is a reduced-diversity mouse model, so convergent recombination is more likely than usual, and the challenges could be expected to differ in the parts of TCR sequence space they induce focus on. They use the top 100 clones for normalization in this case, but don't say why (this is the 3rd distinct normalization procedure).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Your point is absolutely correct: “This is a reduced-diversity mouse model, so convergent recombination is more likely than usual”. Distinct normalisation procedure was required to focus on the most expanded clonotypes to avoid the tail of (presumably cross-reactive) and identical TCRs present in all repertoires in these limited-repertoire mice. So we downsampled as strictly as possible to minimise this background signal of nucleotide overlap, and only this strict downsampling to the top-100 clonotypes allowed us to visualise the difference between the challenges. This is a sort of too complicated explanation that would overload the manuscript. But your comments and our answers will be available to the reader who wants to go into all the details.</p>
<p>The observed (at this strict downsampling) overlaps between the top-nucleotide clones in both LLC and PYMT challenges are prominently above the average, and this result is reproducible in lungs and skin, so we have no doubts in interpretations based on these data. Further experiments with different methods, including tracking the clonal fates, should clarify and confirm/correct/disprove our findings.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Although interpretations of the reported findings are limited due to the issues above, this is an interesting model system in which to explore convergent responses. Follow-up experimental work could validate some of the reported signals, and the data set may also be useful for other specific questions.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Nakonechnaya et al present a valuable and comprehensive exploration of CD4+ T cell response in mice across stimuli and tissues through the analysis of their TCR-alpha repertoires.</p>
<p>The authors compare repertoires by looking at the relative overlap of shared clonotypes and observe that they sometimes cluster by tissue and sometimes by stimulus. They also compare different CD4+ subsets (conventional and Tregs) and find distinct yet convergent responses with occasional plasticity across subsets for some stimuli.</p>
<p>The observed lack of a general behaviour highlights the need for careful comparison of immune repertoires across cell subsets and tissues in order to better understand their role in the adaptive immune response.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this is an important paper to the community as it suggests several future directions of exploration.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lack of code and data availability does not allow the reproducibility of the results.</p>

<p>The whole explanation is here in the text:</p>
<p>“Global CDR3α cluster analysis revealed that characteristic eTreg TCR motifs were present in distinct lymphatic tissues, including spleen and thymus, irrespective of the applied challenge (Supplementary Fig. 1). To better illustrate this phenomenon, we performed MDS analysis of CDR3α repertoires for distinct lymphatic tissues, excluding the lungs due to their otherwise dominant response to the current challenge. This analysis demonstrated close proximity of eTreg repertoires obtained from the same lymphatic tissues upon all lung challenges and across all animals (Fig. 5a, b). These results indicate that distinct antigenic specificities are generally characteristic for eTreg cells that preferentially reside in particular lymphatic niches. Notably, the convergence of lymphatic tissue-resident TCR repertoires was less prominent for the eCD4 T cells (Fig. 5c, d).”</p>

I think to convince myself of a real conversion, I would track the cells between groups, unfortunately, I'm not sure how to track this.. Maybe looking at the thymus population? For example, what is the overlap in the thymus vs. after the challenge? I don't have an answer on how to verify but I feel that this conclusion is a bit on the weaker end.</p>
