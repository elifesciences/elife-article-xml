<abstract>
<p>The zona pellucida (ZP) is vital for species-specific fertilization as this barrier mediates sperm-oocyte binding. Here, we determined whether sperm from distant mammalian orders (Carnivora, Primates, and Rodentia) could penetrate bovine oocytes by examining the role of bovine oviductal fluid and species-specific oviductal glycoprotein (OVGP1 or oviductin) from bovine, murine, or human sources in modulating the species specificity of bovine and murine oocytes. Sperm from all the species were found to penetrate intact bovine ovarian oocytes to form hybrid embryos. However, contact with oviductal fluid or bovine, murine, or human OVGP1, conferred the ZP species specificity, allowing only the penetration of the corresponding sperm regardless of the ZP’s origin. Glycolytic and microstructural analyses revealed that OVGP1 covers the pores present in the ZP and that OVGP1 glycosylation determines sperm specificity. This suggests specific fertilization capacity is acquired in the oviduct through the ZP’s incorporation of specific oviductin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Interaction between the sperm and egg is generally assumed to be a species-specific event mediated by the recognition and binding of complementary molecules on the sperm plasma membrane to both the zona pellucida (ZP) and the oocyte oolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether both the oocyte’s ZP and plasma membrane are necessary to determine species specificity. In evolutionary terms, the ZP is the oldest among the coatings that envelop vertebrate oocytes and conceptuses. This barrier is responsible for preventing polyspermy, facilitating preimplantation development, and mediating species-restricted recognition between the gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). ZP proteins and sperm-oocyte fusion protein are usually found to evolve under selection pressure. It is proposed that this rapid evolution plays an important role in the reproductive isolation of diverging taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). The mechanism of fusion between the sperm and oolemma membranes is not fully understood, although various candidate molecules have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). The species specificity of interactions between gamete membranes in mammals is not always apparent. The significance of the ZP in maintaining species boundaries is revealed by the fact that its removal allows for heterospecific sperm binding and penetration of the oocyte plasma membrane. For example, sperm from humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs, goats, bulls, horses, pigs, rabbits, and dolphins can all successfully penetrate hamster oocytes lacking their ZP coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). This phenomenon was demonstrated in the hamster egg penetration test (HEPT) developed by Yanagimachi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). In this test, researchers observed that upon removal of the ZP from hamster ova, the eggs allowed for the penetration of sperm from other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). However, it remains unknown why zona-free hamster eggs are readily penetrated by heterologous spermatozoa, as this characteristic is not shared by the ova of other species. For instance, human spermatozoa will not penetrate zona-free rat, rabbit, or mouse ova (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>). The ability of sperm from different species to penetrate the hamster oocyte suggests that the ZP could be a key factor in preventing heterologous fertilization between different species.</p>
<p>The successful <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) of zona-free bovine oocytes with deer spermatozoa has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). The IVF of zona-intact bovine oocytes with endangered African antelope spermatozoa was also described in 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Further heterologous gamete interactions have been documented between porcine or equine sperm and ZP-intact bovine oocytes in large domestic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>), as have interspecific interactions between equine and porcine gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). However, other research groups have reported complete species-specificity for IVF between heterologous gametes in pigs and cattle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). In prior work, we observed in zona-intact bovine oocytes obtained directly from ovaries, the sperm fertility of other species of the same order, such as ram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>), common bottlenose dolphins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), and wild goats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). This suggests that species within the order Artiodactyla share similar fertilization mechanisms. However, it appears that this capacity is not restricted solely to this order. Both, our group and other researchers have found that horse (order Perissodactyla) and guinea pig spermatozoa (order Rodentia) are also capable of fertilizing zona-intact bovine oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p>In the present study, we used spermatozoa from the orders Carnivora (cats), Primates (humans), and Rodentia (mice, Muridae family) to examine whether species from other mammalian orders can also fertilize zona-intact bovine oocytes. We also explored the role of bovine oviductal fluid and murine, human, or bovine oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1, also known as oviductin) in modulating the sperm-binding species specificity of the bovine and murine ZP.</p>

<title>Human, mouse, and cat spermatozoa can fertilize bovine ovarian oocytes</title>
<p>We first examined whether human spermatozoa could penetrate bovine oocytes obtained directly from the ovary, without prior exposure to oviductal fluids. For this purpose, human spermatozoa were capacitated in two different media: G-IVF™ PLUS (HeA) and Fert (HeB), commonly used for the capacitation of human spermatozoa and bovine spermatozoa, respectively. As presented in table S1 and depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and S1, human spermatozoa were able to penetrate the bovine oocytes, which went on to develop a pronucleus and eventually underwent cleavage into the two-cell stage. Heterologous fertilization outcomes were improved when the G-IVF™ PLUS medium (HeA) was used instead of Fert (HeB). However, these outcomes were still worse than those obtained for homologous fertilization. No differences were observed in the number of spermatozoa remaining attached to the ZP, or in pronuclear formation up to 12 hours post-insemination (hpi). These results indicate that human spermatozoa can bind to and penetrate both the bovine oocyte’s ZP and plasma membrane. Human spermatozoa were also found capable of inducing the first embryo cleavage.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in table S2 and illustrated in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and S2, mouse spermatozoa showed a similar capacity to human spermatozoa to fertilize bovine ovarian oocytes. Following sperm penetration of the oocyte, the sperm nucleus decondenses, forming a pronucleus, which ultimately induces cleavage into two-cell stage bovine zygote. Pronucleus formation and cleavage rates were, however, lower than those obtained for homologous fertilization. Nonetheless, these findings confirm that mouse spermatozoa can also bind to and penetrate both the bovine oocyte ZP and plasma membrane, and are also capable of inducing the first embryo cleavage.</p>
<p>Similar results were also obtained with cat sperm. As presented in table S3 and depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and S3, feline spermatozoa were found to bind to and penetrate bovine oocytes, thereby initiating the first cellular division of the hybrid embryo. Pronucleus formation and cleavage rates were lower than those observed for homologous bovine fertilization.</p>
<p>To explore if the same effect was produced using oocytes from another species, we collected oocytes from the ovaries of mice following PMSG-induced superstimulation. The ovarian murine oocytes were matured <italic>in vitro</italic> and then fertilized with bovine sperm. The results obtained were similar to those obtained with bovine oocytes in that both the ZP and plasma membrane of the mouse oocytes could be penetrated by the bovine sperm, which then underwent decondensation giving rise to two-cell cleavage stage embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Oviductal fluid inhibits the heterologous fertilization of bovine ovarian oocytes</title>
<p>We then went on to investigate whether the interaction of oocytes with oviductal fluid would hinder the heterologous fertilization of bovine oocytes with human spermatozoa. In this experiment, oocytes were subjected to 30 minutes of incubation with oviductal fluid derived from the oviducts of slaughtered heifers. Subsequently, these oocytes were inseminated with either human or bovine spermatozoa. Results showed that oocytes co-incubated with oviductal fluid could only be fertilized by bovine spermatozoa, with 86% of these oocytes cleaving into two cells. In contrast, bovine oocytes that had been exposed to oviductal fluid were impervious to the penetration by human spermatozoa when using either of the two IVF media (only 3% of these oocytes cleaved into two cells, a similar rate to that recorded in the non-fertilized parthenogenesis group) (see table S4 and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that the ZP and/or oolema undergo certain alterations upon contact with oviductal fluid, rendering them penetrable exclusively by spermatozoa of the same species. No sperm were found in the perivitelline space, suggesting that the changes occur in the ZP.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Oviductal fluid sets the species specificity of the zona pellucida</title>
<p>To validate our hypothesis that the ZP undergoes modifications within the oviduct that confer species specificity, we used murine oocytes sourced both from the ovary and oviduct. We extracted the cytoplasmic contents from the oocytes, keeping the ZP (Fig. S4), and then subjected them to either homologous IVF with mouse sperm or heterologous IVF with bovine or human sperm over 4 hours. Because this experiment was done on empty ZPs, we called this test “empty zona penetration test” (EZPT). Our results showed that the ZPs of oocytes obtained directly from the ovary were susceptible to penetration by the sperm of all three species, but once exposed to oviductal fluids, they could only be penetrated by sperm of their homologous species (see table S5 and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-G</xref>). While mouse spermatozoa were found to adhere to the ZP of oocytes obtained both from the ovary and oviduct, more sperm cells appeared on the ZP of oocytes from the ovary. Further, very few bovine and human spermatozoa adhered to the mice ZP of oocytes obtained from the ovary or oviduct (table S5 and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D, E</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether oviductal fluid indeed determines the species specificity of bovine oocytes and ascertain whether bovine oviductal fluid affects the ZP, the oocyte, or both, we extracted the cytoplasmic contents from the bovine ZP oocytes (Fig. S4) and exposed the empty ZP to oviductal fluid for 30 minutes. Subsequently, we co-incubated ZP with either bovine, human or murine spermatozoa for a period of 6 hours in an EZPT. As observed in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, when ZPs were obtained from ovarian oocytes and not exposed to the oviductal fluid, although the numbers of spermatozoa penetrating the ZP were higher in the homologous IVF group, penetration percentages were similar for human, murine or bovine spermatozoa (see table S6 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, C, E, G</xref>). However, when ZP devoid of oocyte cytoplasmic contents were exposed to oviductal fluid for 30 minutes, these were only susceptible to penetration by bovine spermatozoa (see table S6 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, D, F, H</xref>), thereby confirming that the effect of oviductal fluid on the ZP is sufficient to determine the specificity of penetrating sperm.</p>

<caption><title>Co-incubation of empty ZPs obtained from bovine ovarian oocytes with oviductal fluid determines the specificity of spermatozoa capable of penetrating the zona.</title>
<p>The empty zona penetration test (EZPT) was performed after homologous (bovine sperm) or heterologous (human sperm) fertilization. Similar outcomes were observed when ZPs were not treated with oviductal fluid (<bold>A</bold>), but after co-incubation with oviductal fluid for 30 minutes, human sperm were unable to penetrate the bovine ZPs (<bold>B</bold>) (6 replicates per medium per semen sample). (<bold>C-I</bold>) Representative pictures of empty bovine ZPs penetrated by bovine sperm illustrating that the penetrating sperm (<bold>H</bold>) lack an acrosome, while those unable to penetrate the zona maintain the acrosome (<bold>I</bold>). (<bold>E</bold>-<bold>L</bold>) Empty bovine ZP penetrated by human sperm revealing that the penetrating sperm have lost the acrosome (<bold>K</bold>), whereas those not penetrating the zona maintain the acrosome (<bold>L</bold>). In the absence of oviductal fluid, the empty bovine ZP can be penetrated by bovine (<bold>C, G</bold>) or human (<bold>E, J</bold>) sperm; however, when the ZP has been in contact with oviductal fluid, it can only be penetrated by bovine sperm (<bold>D</bold>), and not by human sperm (<bold>F</bold>). Scale bar for ZP pictures = 50 µm. Scale bar for sperm pictures = 5 µm.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="601502v1_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>With our EZPT, we were able to determine that all spermatozoa penetrating the ZP lacked an acrosome, while the majority of those that failed to penetrate the egg coat retained an intact acrosome (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I-Q</xref>). To assess acrosomal status, the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peanut agglutinin (FITC-PNA) method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). This observation suggests that during the penetration of the ZP, bovine, murine, and human spermatozoa undergo the acrosomal reaction. Additionally, it should be noted that, regardless of co-incubation with oviductal fluid, a higher proportion of bovine spermatozoa remained bound to the ZP (see table S6 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-H</xref>). It may be seen in table S6 and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>, that more bovine spermatozoa bound to the ZP than human ones, though numbers were similar to murine sperm and there was no difference between numbers of bovine sperm bound to ZP treated or not with oviductal fluid. Also, for human spermatozoa, no difference was found between those bound to ZPs treated or not with oviductal fluid, but for mice sperm, a greater number attached to the bovine ZP when it had not been in contact with oviductal fluid.</p>

<title>Homology of bovine, human and murine OVGP1 proteins and fusion of recombinant OVGP1 proteins with murine or bovine ZPs</title>
<p>To investigate the role of OVGP1 on the species specificity of the ZP, we prepared histidine-tagged cow and mouse recombinant OVGP1 glycoproteins and purchased DDK-tagged human recombinant OVGP1 glycoprotein. As depicted in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>, the sequences of these three OVGP1 have five distinct regions (A, B, C, D and E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Regions A and D are conserved in the different mammals. Region A, corresponding to the amino terminal end, shows high identity among monotremes, marsupials and placentals. Region B features low identity among the different mammals and contains multiple insertions/deletions. Region C is an insertion present only in the mouse (Mus) and region E is typical of human oviductin. Details of OVGP1 sequence alignments for the three species can be seen in Figure S5. Clear differences may be seen in predicted N-glycosylation sites and chitin-binding sites (Fig. S5) as well as in predicted O-glycosylation sites (Table S7).</p>

<p>Proteins were expressed in mammalian cells, separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal antibody to human OVGP1. Additionally, rabbit monoclonal antibody against His-tag, and mouse monoclonal antibody against Flag (DDK)-tag immunoblots were performed to test the recombinant OVGP1 proteins (data not shown). Western blots of the three OVGP1 recombinants indicated expected sizes based on those of the proteins: 75 kDa for human and murine OVGP1 and around 60 kDa for bovine OVGP1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Immunoblots were prepared of bovine and murine oviductal fluid protein extracts from animals in estrus (mice) or ovulated (cow) versus anestrous animals.

Murine oviductal fluids displayed the expected 75kDa band and a more intense 50kDa band, but only the 75kDa band corresponded to OVGP1 glycoprotein, as confirmed by proteomics of the bands along with PEAKS Studio v11.5 search engine peptide identification software.</p>
<p>OVGP1 recombinant proteins were also assessed for their ability to bind murine or bovine ZPs obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> matured (IVM) ovarian oocytes compared to ZPs derived from murine oocytes from superovulated females.

All three recombinant proteins were able to bind to the murine and bovine ZPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>; controls in Fig. S6). No differences were observed in the ability of the three OVGP1s to attach and penetrate the mouse ZPs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and Fig S6A). However, while binding of bOVGP1 was observed throughout the thickness of the bovine ZP, mOVGP1 and hOVGP1 preferentially bound to the outer bovine ZP surface without penetrating the coat (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref> and Fig S6B).</p>

<title>OVGP1 plays a species-specific role in setting the specificity of the zona pellucida</title>
<p>To investigate whether oviductal protein OVGP1 had a similar effect to oviductal fluid in determining the species specificity of bovine ZP during fertilization, we conducted the EZPT using ZPs from bovine oocytes that were either treated with bOVGP1 or left untreated (for 30 minutes). In this experiment, we used homologous (bovine) and heterologous sperm (human and murine). As illustrated in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, when the ZPs from ovarian oocytes had not been exposed to bovine OVGP1, both homologous and heterologous sperm could penetrate the ZPs (table S9 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

<p>We then conducted an experiment to assess whether oviductin from a species different from the origin of the ZP would confer the same specificity as sperm from the same species as that of the ZP or that of the oviductin. Through the EZPT several combinations were tested whereby ZPs from bovine or murine ovarian oocytes were co-incubated with bovine, murine, or human OVGP1 and then exposed to sperm of the three species. As shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref> and table S10, for bovine ZPs and bOVGP1, penetration of the empty ZP was only possible in the case of bovine sperm, such that the entry of sperm of the other two species was completely blocked. For the combination bovine ZP/mOVGP1, human sperm were fully blocked, while some penetration (approximately 60%) by bovine sperm (homologous to the ZP) or murine sperm (homologous to OVGP1) was possible. Similar results were observed for bovine ZP/hOVGP1, sperm homologous to the ZP (bovine) and their pretreatment with human OVGP1, giving rise to partial penetration capacity (around 60%), indicating that OVGP1 non-homologous to the ZP allow the partial passage of sperm of the ZP’s species of origin and of the OVGP1-providing species.

<p>Results corresponding to mean numbers of penetrated sperm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">B, center graphs</xref>) were consistent with these previous findings reflecting a clear reduction (from approximately 17 to 5 sperm cells) when the OVGP1 source was not homologous to that of the ZP, but the sperm used belonged to one of these two species.

Interestingly, species homology between OVGP1 and sperm resulted in more bound sperm than when there was only homology between ZP and sperm, indicating the involvement of OVGP1 in sperm-ZP binding. These differences in sperm binding were, nevertheless, not reflected in the penetration rate.</p>

<title>Impact of neuraminidase on the EZPT in bovine and murine oocytes pre and post OVGP1 treatment</title>
<p>The enzyme neuraminidase (NMase) cleaves sialic acid residues commonly found in glycoproteins and glycolipids, and is thus able to modify the surface properties of cells and consequently affect their interactions with other molecules or cells. While the involvement of sialic acid in sperm–ZP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>) is generally accepted, studies reaching this conclusion have not compared the ZPs of oocytes that have been in contact or not with OVGP1.

<p>The results indicate that, regardless of whether ZPs had been or not in contact with OVGP1, after NMase treatment, sperm penetration was completely blocked, and the number of sperm adhering to the ZP was reduced by 70%, suggesting that both nonspecific sperm-ZP binding and species-specific binding occurring after contact with OVGP1 are prevented by NMase treatment, thus impeding sperm penetration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). It is important to note that despite completely blocking penetration, the binding of some sperm to the ZP likely indicates their ability to nonspecifically adhere, which could occur, for example, when the acrosome is damaged.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The zona pellucida (ZP) exhibits different characteristics before and after ovulation and fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). The present study provides evidence that both bovine and murine oocytes acquire species-specific fertilization capacity within the oviduct. Oocytes from the ovaries of cows and mice can be fertilized by sperm from distant mammalian species, yet they acquire species specificity upon contact with oviductal fluid or specific OVGP1 protein. Our results unveil two distinct mechanisms for sperm to recognize and penetrate the ZP. One is nonspecific and acts when oocytes come directly from the ovary, while the other is specific and operates when oocytes reach the oviduct and encounter oviductal fluid or its main secreted constituent, OVGP1. In the nonspecific mechanism, carbohydrate residues present in the ZP, particularly those containing sialic acid, are necessary, allowing sperm to penetrate through the ZP’s matrix. For the species-restricted mechanism, oligosaccharides chains containing sialic acids from OVGP1 must be recognized by sperm for them to bind and penetrate the ZP. These findings indicate that species-specific OVGP1 determines the species specificity of the ZP in mammals. Further, our results suggest that heterologous IVF using ovarian oocytes or their ZPs could be an excellent way to assess sperm capacitation and fertility in mammalian species. This study contributes to our understanding of reproductive biology and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms driving cross-species fertilization.</p>
<p>The ZP is an extracellular matrix that surrounds the oocyte and preimplantation embryo in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). This matrix acts as a barrier, separating cumulus cells from the oocyte, facilitating species-restricted recognition during fertilization, and preventing polyspermy, contributing in this way to preimplantation embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). ZP matrix proteins are glycosylated and specific oligosaccharide residues have been linked to their role as sperm receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). The diverse glycoconjugate composition of the ZP is thought to be unique to each species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). In cattle, the main components (77%) of the carbohydrate chains of ZP glycoproteins are acidic chains containing sialic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>): mainly Neu5Ac (84.5%) and Neu5Gc (15.5%) linked to Galβ1-4GlcNAc and GalNAc by α2,3- and α2,6-linkages on N- and O-glycans respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). Oviductal fluid composition plays a crucial role in fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and subsequent embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). Oviductal proteins have been proposed to induce changes in the ZP, influencing sperm-oocyte binding specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). These changes may impact ZP maturation, sperm-ZP binding, and the prevention of polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Modifications induced by oviductal proteins could alter the ZP’s composition by affecting its carbohydrates or proteins. One set of proteins found in oviductal fluid is a family of glycosylated proteins collectively known as oviduct-specific glycoprotein (OVGP1) or oviductin. This protein has been identified in various mammalian species, including humans. Oviductin has been associated with the ZP of ovarian oocytes post-ovulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). OVGP1, along with heparin-like glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), plays a role in functionally modifying the ZP in pigs and cows, making it more resilient to enzyme digestion and sperm penetration, thereby helping prevent polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>). However, it remains uncertain whether the ZP’s sperm receptor is consistent across all mammalian species. This raises questions about how sperm from different mammalian orders are able to fertilize cow oocytes, and whether the lack of contact between cow oocytes from slaughterhouse ovaries and oviductal proteins prevents the changes in the ZP necessary for bull sperm recognition.</p>
<p>The empty zona penetration test (EZPT) enables heterologous sperm to overcome the oocyte’s second barrier, the plasma membrane or oolema. While the exact mechanism of fusion between sperm and oolemma membranes is only partially understood, several molecules such as IZUMO, TMEM95, SPACA6, and SOF1 have been incriminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). However, species-specific interactions between gamete membranes in mammals are not always clear-cut. The test known as HEPT, which employs ZP-free oocytes, has shown that the hamster oocyte membrane can fuse with the sperm membrane of many mammalian species but the presence of ZP prevents sperm penetration. Our study reveals that bovine and murine ovarian oocytes permit the penetration of both the ZP and oolema of various mammalian orders. This suggests that, prior to reaching the oviduct, a similar mechanism is used across mammalian species for heterologous sperm to recognize and penetrate the ZP and oocyte plasma membrane. However, when the oviduct is reached, some components play a crucial role in inducing species-specific alterations in the ZP, preventing the recognition and/or penetration of the sperm of other species.</p>
<p>During folliculogenesis and transit through the oviduct, the ZP of ovarian oocytes undergoes maturation in preparation for interactions with spermatozoa in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). These changes occur when ovulated oocytes are exposed to oviductal fluid, although the exact molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood, it was previously reported changes in carbohydrate composition and incorporation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). It has been observed that immature oocytes possess a smooth, compact ZP surface with few pores, while IVM oocytes exhibit a net-like porous surface with a rough pattern on the zona matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Here, we observed that IVM ZPs exposed to OVGP1, undergo a complete transformation, oviductin covering most of the ZP and its pores. This suggests that OVGP1 contributes to the maturation of the oviductal ZP by influencing matrix morphology. At the point of fertilization, OVGP1 is found as the main non-serum glycoprotein in oviductal fluid and its relationship with the ZP was noted early on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). OVGP1 plays a role in strengthening the ZP, rendering it resistant to proteolytic digestion and sperm penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>), and these processes are regulated by OVGP1’s C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>). The C-terminal region of OVGP1 is the region which mainly differ among species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>) and this fact may explain the species-specificity of sperm penetrability.</p>
<p>In mammals, it is accepted that fertilization typically occurs within the ampulla of the oviduct, where sperm bind to the oocyte through interactions with ZP via N- and O-glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Over time, the proposed molecular model explaining sperm-oocyte interactions has evolved. Initially, studies suggested ZP2 and ZP3 acted as primary sperm receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Later, it was proposed that sperm-ZP interactions might depend more on the supramolecular structure of the oocyte coat rather than specific ZP subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). More recent research points to a nuanced perspective, highlighting a central role for a specific domain of ZP2 in gamete recognition, which physically interacts with complementary molecules on sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>). Despite these advances, the exact roles of ZP and OVGP1 glycosylation and sialic acid residues (Sias) in fertilization are poorly understood. After ovulation, the changes reported in the carbohydrate composition of the ZP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>) are likely induced by the addition of glycoproteins of oviductal origin, as we have seen here with OVGP1. By employing NMase, to remove sialic acid residues from ZP glycoproteins, we here ascertain that OVGP1 plays a pivotal role in the modifications to the carbohydrate composition of the ZP necessary for species-specific sperm fertilization. In conclusion, our results indicate that the oocyte ZP must interact with the contents of the oviductal fluid, specifically with OVGP1 protein, to ensure that only sperm from the same species can fertilize the egg. This determines that OVGP1 modifications are critical to define the barrier among the different species of mammals.</p>

For this purpose, COCs were vortexed for 3 minutes, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, washed with cold PBS, and stained with Hoechst 33342 to count the number of sperm that remained bound to the ZP. This was done using a widefield fluorescence microscope with structured illumination (ApoTome, Zeiss) and UV-2E/C excitation: 340–380 nm and emission: 435–485 nm. In addition, pronuclear formation was assessed at 6, 12, 18, and 22 hpi. For this, presumptive zygotes were treated and examined following the procedures explained above for sperm-ZP binding. The times used in this study for hybrid embryo analysis were similar to those used in co-incubation studies performed in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>

<p>After 22 hours co-incubation, presumptive zygotes or COCs were denuded of cumulus cells by vortexing for 3 minutes and then cultured in groups of approximately 20 in 25 µL droplets of G-IVF™ PLUS medium, or 25 µL droplets of synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF). The SOF contained 4.2 mM sodium lactate, 0.73 mM sodium pyruvate, 30 mL/mL BME amino acids, 10 mL/mL minimum essential medium (MEM) amino acids, and 1 mg/mL phenol red. These cultures were supplemented with 5% FCS and placed under mineral oil in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, 5% O<sub>2</sub>, and 90% N<sub>2</sub>, and maximum humidity at 38.5°C (cow) or 37°C (human, mouse, and rabbit).

<title>Collection of oviductal fluid</title>
<p>Five stage I (Days 1 to 4) oviducts and another five stage II (Days 5 to 9) were selected from slaughtered heifers. The stage of the estrous cycle was estimated based on the morphology of ovarian structures, especially the corpus luteum (CL). Briefly, in stage I, the CL is small and red, and the epithelium has not yet covered the point of follicular rupture. In stage II, the CL is somewhat bigger, vascularization is observed around it, the apex is reddish in color, and the epithelium has already covered the rupture point. Each tract was independently deposited in a plastic bag and transported to the laboratory on ice in a polystyrene box within 2 hours of collection. The oviducts were washed with cold water to remove blood traces and then in cold Ca2+ and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS-). Each oviduct was strengthen by removing the adjacent tissues and flushed with 1 mL of cold PBS− from the ampulla to the isthmus. All manipulations were performed at 4°C. The fluid from the five oviducts was pooled and then centrifuged once at 300 × g for 7 minutes. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 30 minutes at 4°C to remove debris (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>). The resulting supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80°C.</p>

<title>Preparation of empty zona pellucidae from bovine ovarian oocytes</title>
<p>COCs obtained from ovaries from slaughtered heifers and matured in vitro underwent a thorough washing process before their immersion in 30 mL of Tyrode’s medium. The oocytes were then mechanically denuded by vortexing and gentle pipetting. The denuded oocytes were subjected to three washing cycles using either G-IVF™ PLUS (Vitrolife, Igenomix) or FERT medium, depending on the experimental requirements. Batches of approximately 30 oocytes were then carefully placed in 400-μL droplets of the selected medium and covered with mineral oil. For the removal of cytoplasmic contents, a micromanipulator was used following the procedure outlined in Figure S5. The oocyte was secured using a glass capillary holder, while an ICSI needle, attached to a piezoelectric manipulator, was used to create a small opening in the ZP. This opening facilitated the penetration of the needle, allowing for the complete aspiration of the oocyte’s cytoplasm. The aspiration needle was then retrieved from the ZP to expel the extracted cytoplasm. Following this, the empty ZP underwent two washing cycles using G-IVF™ PLUS or FERT medium. These prepared zona pellucidae were either frozen at −20°C for a duration of several months (3-9 months) or directly utilized in the sperm penetration experiments.</p>

<p>Female mice aged 8 to 10 weeks were superovulated by intraperitoneal injections of 0.1 mL of PMSG (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, Folligon, 5 IU, INIA, Madrid, Spain). Fifty hours after PMSG supplementation, the females were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and their ovaries removed. Collected ovaries were cleaned of any connective tissue and placed in M2 handling medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL of bovine serum albumin fraction V. Antral follicles were gently punctured with 30-gauge needles, and COCs with at least 3 compact cumulus cells layers were collected in handling medium and matured for 16-17 hours in TCM199 supplemented with 10% FCS and 10 ng/mL EGF (epidermal growth factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>) and kept at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air with maximum humidity.

<title>Isolation of superovulated mice oocytes</title>
<p>Metaphase II oocytes were collected from the oviducts of 6- to 8-week-old female mice superovulated with 7.5 IU of eCG (equine chorionic gonadotropin), and an equivalent dose of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) 48 hours later. Briefly, 14 hours post-chorionic gonadotropin administration, oviducts were removed from the superovulated female mice and placed in a petri dish containing M2 at room temperature. After washing, collected oviducts were placed in fresh M2 medium, and COCs previously in contact with oviductal fluid were released from the ampulla with the aid of Dumont #55 forceps and washed in fresh M2 medium until cytoplasm removal.</p>

<title>Preparation of zona pellucidae from mice oocytes</title>
<p>After obtaining the COCs using the two methods described, cumulus cells were dispersed by 3 to 5 minutes of incubation in M2 medium containing 350 IU/mL of hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich H4272). After washing, oocytes were kept in KSOM medium at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until use.</p>
<p>To obtain empty zona pellucidae, cytoplasmic contents of the oocytes were removed using a micromanipulator, following the procedure outlined in Figure S5. The protocol used was similar to that employed for the bovine oocytes with the help of a holding pipette and a blunt microinjection pipette. The decumulated oocytes were placed in a drop of M2 medium, and with the assistance of a piezoelectric manipulator, each zona pellucida was penetrated, followed by the removal of the cytoplasm using the blunt microinjection pipette.</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> fertilization, sperm penetration, and binding assessment in mice</title>
<p>Four experimental groups were established. Each of the two groups of oocytes described was used for heterologous fertilization with bovine semen that had been recovered and capacitated via the procedure detailed earlier. For each group, a positive control was set up through homologous fertilization with murine semen.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> fertilization was carried out under the same conditions for all four groups. The zona pellucidae were co-incubated with sperm, and the sperm concentration was determined by counting these cells in a Thoma chamber and then adjusting to a final concentration of 1×10^6 sperm/mL. Male and female gametes were then co-incubated for 6 hours in 50 µL of HTF fertilization medium covered with mineral oil in a 4-well plate at 38.5°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> maximum humidity atmosphere.</p>
<p>Six hours after insemination, the zona pellucidae were transferred from the 50 µL drop of fertilization medium to a new drop to correctly assess both sperm penetration of the zona pellucida and sperm binding to the zona. Once the zonas were in the new drop, the spermatozoa inside every zona pellucida were individually counted and differentiated from binding spermatozoa, which were also quantified.</p>

<title>Origins of bovine, murine and human OVGP1 recombinants</title>
<p>The coding sequences of bovine OVGP1 (NM_001080216.1) and mouse OVGP1 (NM_007696.2), an additional leader peptide sequence for mammalian cell expression (MGWSCIILFLVATATGVHS) and the sequence to express six-His residues were cloned into a pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector from GenScript Giotech (Rijswijk, NL) containing a promoter for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Tagged OVGP1 protein was produced by transient expression using a Vaccinia/T7 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>) in BHK-21 cells (ATCC CCL-10) grown in G-MEM BHK-21 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% FBS (Gibco), 10% tryptose phosphate medium (Gibco), 20 mM Hepes (Fisher Scientific), and supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine (Lonza), 0.1 µg/ml penicillin, and 0.1 µg/ml streptomycin (Lonza). BHK-21 cells grown in 6-well plates were infected with a crude stock of vaccinia virus expressing T7 polymerase (vTF7-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 5 pfu (plaque-forming unit)/cell in 2% FBS EMEM (Eagle’s minimum essential medium) medium. After a 90-minute adsorption period, the virus inoculum was removed, cell monolayers were washed with EMEM medium and subsequently transfected with pH224 plasmid. Transfection for each well was performed with a mixture of 2 µg of DNA and 6 µL of Fugene HD reagent (Promega). The DNA/fugene mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature prior to its drop-wise addition to the infected culture. At 3 days post-infection, the cell culture was harvested and cells were sedimented by low speed centrifugation. Supernatant was used in subsequent experiments.</p>
<p>Bovine OVGP1 (bOVGP1) and murine OVGP1 (mOVGP1) recombinant proteins were purified using the Amicon Pro Purification System (Merck Millipore Ltd) by combining metal chelation chromatography with an Amicon concentrator membrane. Mammalian cell supernatants were incubated under constant agitation for 2 hours with the Ni-NTA His-Bind resin, previously equilibrated with binding buffer. Then, following the manufacturer’s protocol specifications and after washing and elution centrifugation steps, His-tagged proteins were concentrated in an Amicon Ultra-0.5 device, and eluted in 25 μL of the desired buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH=8) and stored at −80°C.</p>
<p>Human recombinant oviductin protein was obtained from Origene Technologies Inc. (human Cat. No. TP321684, murine Cat. No. Tp521693; Rockville, US). A sequence expressing FLAG-tagged epitope proteins (DYKDDDDK) was cloned into an expression vector. The recombinant proteins were produced by transient transfection in HEK293T, obtained from the cell culture supernatant, and captured on an affinity column followed by conventional chromatography steps.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study sheds light on the species-specific nature of sperm-oocyte interactions by examining sperm binding and penetration of the zona pellucida across various mammalian species. While the evidence remains <bold>incomplete</bold>, the authors propose that two distinct mechanisms drive mammalian sperm-oocyte recognition and penetration: a specific, zona pellucida (ZP)-mediated mechanism, and a non-specific, oviductal glycoprotein 1 (OVGP1)-mediated mechanism. Upon revision, this study would offer insights to reproductive biologists, potentially improving porcine in vitro fertilization (IVF) - which is particularly susceptible to polyspermy - and enhancing sperm selection processes in human IVF, ultimately leading to better outcomes in assisted reproduction techniques.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This very interesting manuscript first shows that human, murine, and feline sperm penetrate the zona pellucida (ZP) of bovine oocytes recovered directly from the ovary, although first cleavage rates are reduced (Figure 1A). Similarly, bovine sperm can penetrate superovulated murine oocytes recovered directly from the ovary (Figure 1B). However, bovine oocytes incubated with oviduct fluid (30 min) are generally impenetrable by human sperm (Figure 1C).</p>
<p>Thereafter, the cytoplasm was aspirated from murine oocytes - obtained from the ovary (Figure 1D) or oviduct (Figure 1D). Binding and penetration by bovine and human sperm were reduced in both groups relative to homologous (murine) sperm. However, heterologous (bovine and human) sperm penetration was further reduced in oviduct vs. ovary derived empty ZP. These compelling data show that outer (ZP) not inner (cytoplasmic) oocyte alterations reduce heterologous sperm penetration as well as homologous sperm binding.</p>
<p>This was repeated using empty bovine ZP incubated (Figure 2B), or not (Figure 2A) with bovine oviduct fluid. Prior oviduct fluid exposure reduced non-homologous (human and murine) empty ZP penetration, polyspermy, and sperm binding. This demonstrates that species-specific oviduct fluid factors regulate ZP penetrability.</p>
<p>To test the hypothesis that OVGP1 is responsible, the authors obtained his-tagged bovine and murine OVGP1 and DDK-tagged human OVGP1 proteins. Tagging was to enable purification following overexpression in BHK-21 or HEK293T cells. The authors confirm these recombinant OVGP1 proteins bound to both murine (Figure 3C) and bovine (Figure 3D) oocytes. Moreover, previous data using oviduct fluid (Figure 1D-E and 2A-B) was mirrored using bovine oocytes supplemented with homologous (bovine) recombinant OVGP1 (Figure 4B) or not (Figure 4A). This confirms the hypothesis, at least in cattle.</p>
<p>Next, the authors exposed bovine (Figure 6A) and murine (Figure 6B) empty ZP to bovine, murine, and human recombinant OVGP1, in addition to bovine, murine, or human sperm. Interestingly, both species-specific ZP and OVGP1 seem to be required for optimal sperm binding and penetration.</p>
<p>Lastly, empty bovine (Figures 7A-B) and murine (Figures 7C-D) ZP were treated with neuraminidase, or not, with or without pre-treatment with homologous OVGP1. In each case, neuraminidase reduced sperm binding and penetration. This further demonstrates that both ZP and OVGP1 are required for optimal sperm binding and penetration.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that two mechanisms underpin mammalian sperm recognition and penetration, the first being specific (ZP-mediated) and the second non-specific (OVGP1-mediated). This may prove useful for improving porcine in vitro fertilization (IVF), which is notoriously prone to polyspermy, in addition to human IVF, for better intrinsic individual sperm selection.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In my estimation, the following would improve this manuscript:</p>
<p>(1) The physiological relevance of these data could be better highlighted. For instance, future work could revolve around incubating oocytes with oviduct fluid (or OVGP1) to reduce polyspermy in porcine IVF, and naturally improve sperm selection in human IVF.</p>
<p>(2) Biological and technical replicate values for each experiment are unclear - for semen, oocytes, and oviduct fluid pools. I suggest providing in the Materials and Methods and/or Figure legends.</p>
<p>(3) Although differences presented in the bar charts seem obvious, providing statistical analyses would strengthen the manuscript.</p>
<p>(4) Results are presented as {plus minus} SEM (line 677); however, I believe standard deviation is more appropriate.</p>
<p>(5) Given the many independent experimental variables and combinations, a schematic depiction of the experimental design may benefit readers.</p>
<p>(6) Attention to detail can be improved in parts, as delineated in the &quot;author recommendation&quot; review section.</p>

<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Oviductin sets the species-specificity of the mammalian zona pellucida.&quot; The study analyzes the species specificity of sperm-egg recognition by looking at sperm binding and penetration of zonae pellucidae from different mammalian species and find a role for the oviductal protein OVGP1 in determining species specificity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>By combining sperm, oocytes, zona pellucida (ZP), and oviductal fluid from different mammalian species, they elucidate the essential role of OVGP1 in conferring species-specific fertilization.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors postulate a role for oviductal fluid in species-specific fertilization, but in my opinion, they cannot rule out hormonal effects or differences in the method of oocyte maturation employed.</p>
<p>They also cannot unequivocally prove that OVGP1 is the oviductal protein involved in the effect. Additional experiments are necessary to rule out these alternative explanations.</p>
<p>When performing the EZPT assay on mouse oocytes obtained either from the ovary or from the oviduct, the oocytes obtained from the ovary came from mice primed with eCG, whereas the ones collected from the oviduct were obtained from superovulated mice (eCG plus hCG). This difference in the hormonal environment may make a difference in the properties of the ZP. Additionally, the ones obtained from the ovary were in vitro matured, which is also different from the freshly ovulated eggs and, again, may change the properties of the ZP. I suggest doing this experiment superovulating both groups of mice but collecting the fully matured MII eggs from the ovary before they get ovulated. In that way the hormonal environment will be the same in both groups and in both groups, oocytes will be matured in vivo. Hence, the only difference will be the exposure to oviductal fluids.</p>
<p>Mice with OVGP1 deletion are viable and fertile. It would be quite interesting to investigate the species-specificity of sperm-ZP binding in this model. That would indicate whether OVGP1 is the only glycoprotein involved in determining species-specificity. Alternatively, the authors could immunodeplete OVGP1 from oviductal fluid and then ascertain whether this depleted fluid retains the ability to impede cross-species fertilization.</p>
<p>What is the concentration of OVGP1 in the oviduct? How did the authors decide what concentration of protein to use in the experiments where they exposed ZPs to purified OVGP1? Why did they use this experimental design to check the structure of the ZP by SEM? Why not do it on oocytes exposed to oviductal fluid, which would be more physiological?</p>
<p>None of the figures show any statistical analysis. Please perform analysis for all the data presented, include p values, and indicate which statistical tests were performed. The Statistical analysis section in the Methods indicating that repeated measures ANOVA was used must refer to the tables. Was normality tested? I doubt all the data are normally distributed, in which case using ANOVA is not appropriate.</p>
<p>Why was OVGP1 selected as the probable culprit of the species specificity? In the Results section entitled &quot;Homology of bovine, human and murine OVGP1 proteins...&quot; the authors delve into the possible role of this protein without any rationale for investigating it. What about other oviductal proteins?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The present study reports findings from a series of experiments suggesting that bovine oviductal fluid and species-specific oviductal glycoprotein (OVGP1 or oviductin) from bovine, murine, or human sources modulate the species specificity of bovine and murine oocytes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study reported in the manuscript deals with an important topic of interest in reproductive biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript began with a well-written introduction, but problems started to surface in the Results section, in the Discussion, as well as in the Materials and Methods. Major concerns include inconsistencies, misinterpretation of results, lacking up-to-date literature search, numerous errors found in the figure legends, misleading and incorrect information given in the Materials and Methods, missing information regarding statistical analysis, and inadequate discussion. These concerns raise questions regarding the authenticity of the study, reliability of the findings, and interpretation of the results. The manuscript does not provide solid and convincing findings to support the conclusion.</p>
