<title>Abstract</title><p>The nucleus incertus (NI), a conserved hindbrain structure implicated in the stress response, arousal, and memory, is a major site for production of the neuropeptide relaxin-3. On the basis of <italic>goosecoid homeobox 2</italic> (<italic>gsc2</italic>) expression, we identified a neuronal cluster that lies adjacent to <italic>relaxin 3a</italic> (<italic>rln3a</italic>) neurons in the zebrafish analogue of the NI. To delineate the characteristics of the <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons, we used CRISPR/Cas9 targeted integration to drive gene expression specifically in each neuronal group, and found that they differ in their efferent and afferent connectivity, spontaneous activity, and functional properties. <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons have widely divergent projection patterns and innervate distinct subregions of the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN).

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The nucleus incertus (NI), originally identified in the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Streeter, 1903</xref>), consists of bilaterally paired clusters of neurons at the midline of the floor of the fourth ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Olucha-Bordonau et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ma and Gundlach, 2015</xref>). A variety of neuropeptides have been detected in the region, including cholecystokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Olucha-Bordonau et al., 2003</xref>), neuromedin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), neurotensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jennes et al., 1982</xref>), and relaxin-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burazin et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Smith et al., 2010</xref>), however, the properties of NI neuronal subtypes are not well defined.</p>
<p>Initial investigations in rodents indicate that the NI responds to stressful cues; NI neurons are enriched in receptors for the Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) and upregulate c-Fos in response to CRF exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Potter et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittencourt and Sawchenko, 2000</xref>). Placement in an elevated plus maze, exposure to an anxiogenic drug, foot shock, or water-restraint stress also induce expression of the neural activity marker c-Fos in the NI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lawther et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Passerin et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rajkumar et al., 2016</xref>). Other reports have implicated the NI in regulating baseline locomotor activity. For example, electrical microstimulation of the NI promotes locomotion in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Farooq et al., 2016</xref>), and optogenetic activation of a subset of neurons in the mouse NI that produce the neuropeptide neuromedin B increases locomotor speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In rodents, the NI contains the largest population of neurons in the brain that produce relaxin-3 (RLN3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), a neuropeptide thought to mediate behavioral responses to aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lawther et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>, Zhang et al., 2015). Although there are also NI neurons that do not produce RLN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>), their characteristics are not well distinguished from the RLN3 population.</p>
<p>Larval zebrafish are a powerful model to investigate neuronal diversity and connectivity because their transparency and genetic tractability are advantageous for monitoring and manipulating specific subpopulations. In zebrafish, the presumed analogue of the NI is the griseum centrale, situated on the ventral surface of the rhombencephalic ventricle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Wullimann et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agetsuma et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Olson et al., 2017</xref>). Expression of <italic>relaxin 3a</italic> (<italic>rln3a</italic>) is restricted to two bilaterally paired clusters of neurons in the midbrain and two bilaterally paired nuclei bordering the hindbrain midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donizetti et al., 2008</xref>). It was proposed that the midbrain <italic>rln3a</italic> expression domains correspond to the periaqueductal grey (PAG), a region that produces RLN3 in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Smith et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), and that the hindbrain <italic>rln3a</italic> neuron clusters correspond to the NI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donizetti et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The zebrafish griseum centrale is a proposed target of the habenulo-interpeduncular nucleus (Hb-IPN) axis, a highly conserved forebrain to midbrain pathway implicated in modulating anxiety and the response to aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agetsuma et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Facchin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">DubouÃ© et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">McLaughlin et al., 2017</xref>). Left-right asymmetry of the habenular region is widespread among vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Harris et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Concha and Wilson, 2001</xref>) and, in zebrafish, the left and right dorsal habenulae (LdHb and RdHb) exhibit prominent differences in their molecular properties, connectivity and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">deCarvalho et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gamse et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Facchin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">DubouÃ© et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chou et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agetsuma et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dreosti et al., 2014</xref>). The LdHb projects to the dorsal IPN (dIPN) and ventral IPN (vIPN), whereas RdHb neurons largely innervate the vIPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gamse et al., 2005</xref>). Using tract tracing in adult zebrafish, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agetsuma <italic>et al</italic>. (2010)</xref> found that vIPN neurons project to the dorsal raphe, and dIPN neurons to the hindbrain griseum centrale. Moreover, injection of the cell-filling dye neurobiotin into the dorsal IPN labeled cell bodies in the griseum centrale, suggesting reciprocal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agetsuma et al., 2010</xref>). The NI and IPN are also reciprocally connected in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goto et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Olucha-Bordonau et al., 2003</xref>). However, whether different neuronal populations in the hindbrain NI innervate distinct subregions of the IPN is unresolved.</p>
<p>In this study, we find that a small population of neurons defined by expression of the <italic>goosecoid homeobox 2</italic> (<italic>gsc2</italic>) gene is closely apposed to <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the zebrafish hindbrain, and distinct from neurons producing relaxin-3, cholecystokinin, and neuromedin B. Through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted integration, we generated transgenic driver lines to facilitate selective labeling and manipulation of the <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> neuronal populations in the nucleus incertus, and found that they differ in efferent and afferent connectivity, calcium signaling, and control of locomotor behavior.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Identification of <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons in the nucleus incertus</title>
<p>We initially identified the <italic>gsc2</italic> gene through transcriptional profiling aimed at distinguishing genes with enriched expression in the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN). IPN tissue was micro-dissected from the brains of adult zebrafish harboring <italic>TgBAC(gng8:Eco.NfsB-2A-CAAX-GFP)<sup>c375</sup></italic>, a transgene that labels dorsal habenular (dHb) neurons and their axons with membrane-targeted GFP in the larval and adult brain. Because GFP-labeled dHb axon terminals demarcate the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">deCarvalho et al., 2013</xref>), they serve as a guide to locate and excise this midbrain structure. After comparing the transcriptional profile of pooled IPN samples with remaining brain tissue, <italic>gsc2</italic> transcripts were identified as enriched approximately 5-fold in the IPN region relative to the rest of the brain. The <italic>gsc2</italic> gene encodes a protein that has homology to Goosecoid-related proteins in its homeobox domain-containing sequence. We note that the <italic>gsc2</italic> sequence is not annotated in the latest genome assembly (GRCz11) and was initially identified by aligning reads to Zv9 (Ensembl release 77).</p>
<p>From whole-mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (WISH), we found that <italic>gsc2</italic> transcripts are restricted to bilateral clusters just posterior to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and to a few sparsely distributed neurons anterior to the main cluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A, Aâ</xref>). Double labeling with <italic>somatostatin 1.1</italic> (<italic>sst1.1</italic>), a marker of IPN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Doll et al., 2011</xref>), revealed that the bilateral clusters are not situated within the IPN but rather lie dorsal to it (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B, Bâ</xref>).</p>

<p>Owing to the similar positions of <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Donizetti et al., 2008</xref>) neurons in the larval hindbrain, we performed double-label WISH, and found that <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons are a distinct population, located anterior to the <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C, Câ, D</xref>).</p>
<p>Other neuropeptides in addition to RLN3 have been detected in the rodent NI, including neuromedin B in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), and cholecystokinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Olucha-Bordonau et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kubota et al., 1983</xref>) and neurotensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jennes et al., 1982</xref>) in rats. To determine whether transcripts encoding each of these neuropeptides are present in the zebrafish NI, we performed WISH for the zebrafish <italic>cholecystokinin a</italic> (<italic>ccka</italic>), <italic>cholecystokinin b</italic> (<italic>cckb</italic>), <italic>neuromedin a</italic> (<italic>nmba</italic>), <italic>neuromedin b</italic> (<italic>nmbb</italic>), and <italic>neurotensin</italic> (<italic>nts</italic>) genes (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-1 A-Eâ</xref>). For <italic>cholecystokinin</italic> and <italic>neuromedin B</italic>, the combined expression of the two zebrafish paralogues closely resembles the overall expression pattern of each single rodent gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Albus, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ohki-Hamazaki, 2000</xref>). Only <italic>cckb</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> transcripts were detected in the NI, and <italic>nmbb</italic> expression was also observed in the PAG (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-1 B, D</xref>). Using double-label fluorescent WISH, we found that the <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons (48.33 Â± 2.33 neurons) fail to express any of these neuropeptides and comprise a unique population. We found that hindbrain <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons (8.33 Â± 1.45) are intermingled with <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons (10.67 Â± 1.33) in the NI, with a small subset expressing both neuropeptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>, <xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-2 Aâ-Cââ</xref>). By contrast, <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons exist as separate, adjacent populations in the PAG (<xref rid="figs1a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1-2 A</xref>). Hindbrain <italic>cckb</italic> neurons (4.5 Â± 1.1) are a distinct population located just posterior to <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). From these results, we can construct a map of peptidergic neurons in the zebrafish NI (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>), with a discrete group of <italic>gsc2</italic>-expressing neurons, partially overlapping expression of <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> in cells posterior to the <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons, and a distinct population of <italic>cckb</italic> neurons posterior to the <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons.</p>

<title><italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> transgenic lines drive expression in the NI</title>
<p>To verify that the <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons reside in the zebrafish analogue of the mammalian NI, we examined the properties of these closely apposed neuronal populations. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome integration, we generated transgenic lines to selectively label and manipulate each group. The <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> loci were independently targeted for integration of sequences encoding QF2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, D</xref>), a modified transcription factor that binds to the upstream activating sequence (QUAS) in the bipartite Q transcriptional regulatory system of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Riabinina and Potter, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Subedi et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Tg(gsc2:QF2)<sup>c721</sup></italic> was generated by introducing the <italic>QF2</italic> sequence into exon 2 of the <italic>gsc2</italic> gene through non-homologous end joining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kimura et al., 2014</xref>). Another method for homology-directed integration called GeneWeld (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wierson et al., 2020</xref>) was adapted to include a secondary reporter that, together with the <italic>QF2</italic> sequence, was integrated into exon 1 of the <italic>rln3a</italic> gene to produce <italic>Tg(rln3a:QF2, he1.1:YFP)<sup>c836</sup></italic>. Identification of <italic>rln3a:QF2</italic> transgenic carriers was facilitated by inclusion of a reporter consisting of a promoter from the <italic>hatching enzyme 1, tandem duplicate 1</italic> (<italic>he1.1</italic>) gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Xie et al., 2012</xref>) driving expression of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in hatching gland cells starting at 1 day post-fertilization (dpf). Because labeling is transient, the <italic>he1.1:YFP</italic> secondary reporter does not interfere with brain imaging of older larvae.</p>
<p>We confirmed that the <italic>Tg(gsc2:QF2)<sup>c721</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg(rln3a:QF2, he1.1:YFP)<sup>c836</sup></italic> driver lines recapitulate endogenous expression patterns of <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic>, respectively, at both larval (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C, E, F</xref>) and adult (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-1 A-G</xref>) stages. Consistent with their location in the NI, the <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons reside on the floor of the 4<sup>th</sup> ventricle (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-1 G</xref>), with the <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons anterior to the <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons and also distributed more ventrally up to the dorsal surface of the raphe nucleus (<xref rid="figs2a" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-1 C</xref>). Using <italic>TgBAC(gng8:Eco.NfsB-2A-CAAX-GFP)<sup>c375</sup></italic> to delineate dHb axon terminals at the IPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">deCarvalho et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hong et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davison et al., 2007</xref>) we confirmed that <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons are located outside of the IPN in the adult brain, although a few scattered <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons lie just posterior and lateral to it (<xref rid="figs2b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2-2 A-Dâ</xref>). As the sparsely distributed anterior group of <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons are anatomically distinct from the main cluster and not within the nucleus incertus proper (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref>), they were excluded from subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>Neurotransmitter identity of <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons</title>
<p>In mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">SzÅnyi et al., 2019</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Olucha-Bordonau et al., 2003</xref>), the NI contains a large population of GABAergic neurons, and <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons are largely GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Ma et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nasirova et al., 2020</xref>).

<p>To our knowledge, it has not been verified whether <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the periaqueductal grey are also GABAergic. We found that <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the PAG were not labeled by the glutamatergic reporter (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), whereas an average of 81.67 Â± 3.81% showed labeling from the <italic>gad1b</italic> transgene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, Eâ, Eââ, G). This suggests that <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons possess similar neurotransmitter identity across neuroanatomical locations.</p>

<p>Projections from <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons were found in the medulla, IPN, diencephalon, lateral hypothalamus, and optic tectum (Movie 4-2, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4F-J</xref>), with some axons appearing to pass through the posterior commissure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4G</xref>). Sparse fibers were also observed in the raphe and telencephalon (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H, J</xref>).</p>
<p>Innervation of the IPN by <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons originates solely from the NI cluster, whereas the bulk of projections throughout the brain emanate from <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the PAG (Movie 4-2). This was confirmed by two-photon laser ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> PAG neurons, which greatly reduced fibers in the medulla, diencephalon, hypothalamus and optic tectum, but spared innervation of the IPN (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K-M</xref>). Reduction of <italic>rln3a</italic> PAG neuronal projections enabled visualization of those from the NI, which exclusively target the IPN (Movie 4-3, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref>). Accordingly, ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons solely in the NI eliminated innervation of the IPN without affecting the rest of the <italic>rln3a</italic> neuron projection pattern, including projections to the medulla, diencephalon, hypothalamus and optic tectum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref>). Efferents from <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons were far more extensive than those of <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons, and were observed in regions not innervated by any <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons (e.g., cerebellum and caudal hypothalamus). Thus, the closely apposed <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons exhibit divergent and largely non-overlapping projection patterns.</p>
<p>To examine <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> efferent innervation of the IPN more precisely, we used <italic>TgBAC(gng8:Eco.NfsB-2A-CAAX-GFP)<sup>c375</sup></italic> or <italic>TgBAC</italic>(<italic>gng8:GAL4FF</italic>)<italic><sup>c426</sup>; Tg(UAS-E1B:NTR-mCherry)<sup>c264</sup></italic> to delineate the IPN by labeled dHb axon terminals.

Using membrane-tagged reporters, we identified projections from both populations to the IPN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, D, E</xref>-H) and found that they innervate disparate regions. This is more readily observed in sections of the adult brain in which axons of <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons terminate at the ventral IPN mainly along the midline neuropil (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B, E</xref>-Fâ, I, K) and axons of <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons terminate at the dorsal IPN (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D, G-Hâ, J, K</xref>), as depicted schematically in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5K</xref>.</p>

These results show that activation of the dHb-IPN axis increases activity in <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons but not in <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons, indicating that the latter do not directly mediate functions of the dHb-IPN pathway.</p>

<title>Ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> but not <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons alters locomotor activity</title>
<p>Previous reports have implicated the NI in regulating locomotor activity and proposed that an animalâs increased movement after an aversive stimulus is, in part, mediated by increased activity in the NI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Farooq et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Both ablated and unablated larvae exhibited hyperactivity immediately following shock (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D-E</xref>), and statistically significant differences in the response to shock were not detected (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). This suggests that neither the <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons nor the neighboring <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons are required for the immediate behavioral response to shock.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, however, larvae that lacked <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons swam a greater overall distance during the pre-shock period and exhibited longer phases of activity than unablated controls, larvae with ablated <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons, or larvae with ablated <italic>rln3a</italic> PAG neurons (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8F-H</xref>, Movie 8-1). Phases of activity were defined by continuous movement of the larvae with no more than one second of prolonged immobility. The total number of phases was similar in all groups (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8I</xref>). This indicates that ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons promotes prolonged phases of movement, rather than increasing the frequency of movement initiation. In addition to increased swimming, larvae that lacked <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons showed increased turning behavior. For larvae with ablated <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons, the change in angle of orientation measured per unit of distance traveled was greater than that of unablated controls, larvae with ablated <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons, or larvae with ablated <italic>rln3a</italic> PAG neurons (<xref rid="figs8b" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8-2A</xref>).

<p>The nucleus incertus (âuncertain nucleusâ), first described in the human brain in 1903 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Streeter, 1903</xref>), remains an enigmatic structure that has been implicated in stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Potter et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittencourt and Sawchenko, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lawther et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Passerin et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rajkumar et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>), arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">SzÅnyi et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). As the NI is the primary source of relaxin-3 expressing neurons in the rodent brain, they have been a focus of interest even though not all NI neurons produce this neuropeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nasirova et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we compare the properties of the cells expressing <italic>rln3a</italic> with a neighboring group of neurons in the zebrafish NI.</p>
<p>Through transcriptional profiling, <italic>gsc2</italic> transcripts were found to be enriched in samples dissected from the adult zebrafish brain that encompassed the IPN. However, closer examination of both larval and adult brains revealed that <italic>gsc2</italic>-expressing neurons are located outside of the IPN, just anterior to the <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the NI. The enriched transcripts were likely due to the presence of <italic>gsc2-</italic>positive neurons that lie just posterior and lateral to the IPN. Neurons expressing the <italic>Gsc2</italic> murine homolog had previously been identified in the mouse brain, although there is conflicting information about their precise anatomical location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Funato et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gong et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Saint-Jore et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gottlieb et al., 1998</xref>). On the basis of our results, we suspect that <italic>Gsc2</italic> neurons are not located within the rodent IPN as was previously concluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Funato et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gong et al., 2003</xref>), but are likely situated adjacent to it.</p>
<p>We developed transgenic tools to characterize <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in more detail. The Gal4-UAS system of yeast is widely used in zebrafish to express reporter genes in specific cell populations; however, its utility for small groups of neurons is limited because of mosaicism due to progressive methylation of CpG residues in multicopy upstream activation sequences, resulting in transcriptional silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Goll et al., 2009</xref>). The QF2/QUAS system of Neurospora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Riabinina and Potter, 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Subedi et al., 2014</xref>), coupled with CRISPR/Cas9 integration, enabled the generation of targeted driver lines and robust and selective expression of reporter genes in either <italic>gsc2</italic> or <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons. By labeling with QUAS-driven fluorescent reporters, we determined that the anatomical location, neurotransmitter phenotype, and hodological properties of <italic>gsc2</italic> and <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons are consistent with NI identity, supporting the assertion that the griseum centrale of fish is analogous to the mammalian NI. Both groups of neurons are GABAergic, reside on the floor of the fourth ventricle and project to the interpeduncular nucleus. However, these adjacent neuronal populations have distinct connections with the IPN and other brain regions, and also differ in their afferent input, calcium signaling, and influence on locomotor behavior (summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Owing that the NI has been proposed to act in concert with the median raphe and IPN, in âa midline behavior control network of the brainstemâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Goto et al., 2001</xref>), it is important to build the framework of neuronal subtypes that mediate such coordinated activity.</p>

<title>The IPN as an integrating center for dHb and NI input</title>
<p>Previous work demonstrated that axons from left dHb and right dHb neurons innervate different regions along the dorsoventral extent of the IPN; neurons in the left dHb project to both the dorsal IPN (dIPN) and ventral IPN (vIPN) whereas right dHb neurons mainly target the vIPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gamse et al., 2005</xref>). We found that different populations of NI neurons also target specific IPN compartments; <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons project mainly to the dIPN and <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons predominantly innervate the vIPN along its midline neuropil. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Zaupa <italic>et al</italic>. (2021)</xref> demonstrates that axon terminals from cholinergic and noncholinergic dHb neurons, which innervate the vIPN and dIPN respectively, show distinct patterns of activity. Spontaneous calcium spikes in cholinergic dHb terminals at the vIPN coincide with transient decreases in calcium signaling in non-cholinergic dHb terminals at the dIPN. This negatively correlated activity is mediated by activation of vIPN neurons that release GABA to inhibit non-cholinergic dHb terminals at the dIPN through their presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. Our results raise the possibility that innervation by different populations of NI neurons also shapes activity in the dorsal and ventral IPN. The IPN could thus integrate signals from disparate neuronal populations in the dHb and NI, and perhaps other brain regions. Future work will explore how the activity of <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>gsc2</italic> axon terminals is coordinated with cholinergic and non-cholinergic dHb input to the dorsal and ventral IPN.</p>

<title>Distinct patterns of calcium signaling by NI neurons</title>
<p>Distinct patterns of activity were observed in the neuronal populations of the NI, with <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons having little spontaneous activity and <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons exhibiting continuous fluctuations in calcium signaling. A study in rats found that relaxin-3 neurons fire in synchrony with the ascending phase of the hippocampal theta oscillation (4-12 Hz), which has been implicated in spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ma et al., 2013</xref>). Stimulation of NI neurons in rats and <italic>Nmb</italic> NI neurons in mice also increases hippocampal theta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">NuÃ±ez et al., 2006</xref>). The oscillating calcium transients that we detected in <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons of larval zebrafish are on the order of seconds, however, consistent with infra-slow waves that occur at frequencies in the range of tens to hundreds of seconds, and within which fast oscillations are often nested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Palva and Palva, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Infra-slow oscillations correlate with rhythmic fluctuations in performance observed in psychophysical experiments with humans, in which a subject performs a task of constant difficulty for several minutes. It has been proposed, therefore, that intra-slow waves coordinate shifts between attentive and inattentive brain states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Palva and Palva, 2012</xref>). Given that ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons increases the length of phases of movement in zebrafish larvae, fluctuating activity in <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons may control transitions between phases of behavioral activity and inactivity.</p>

<title>Cell type-specific roles for the NI</title>
<p>Rodent studies have described the behavior of animals with null mutations in the gene encoding RLN3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Smith et al., 2012</xref>), or its receptor, RXFP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hosken et al., 2015</xref>), and found decreased voluntary wheel running, suggesting that the relaxin-3 system is involved in regulating locomotor activity. However, it is difficult to attribute mutant phenotypes to specific sub-groups of <italic>Rln3</italic> neurons. Activation of the NI through microstimulation or chemogenetics increased movement in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Farooq et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ma et al., 2017</xref>), which implicates the NI region in regulating locomotor activity but does not identify the relevant neurons.</p>
<p>Strikingly, removal of <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons elicited hyperactivity in zebrafish larvae. Ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the PAG did not affect locomotion. This suggests that the role of the NI in regulating baseline locomotor activity is mediated by <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons.</p>
<p>Because some <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons are interspersed with <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons in the NI, we cannot eliminate the possibility that loss of <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons also contributes to the hyperactivity phenotype. Previous studies in adult rodents indicate that enhanced NI activity promotes locomotion, but we find the opposite in larval zebrafish; NI neurons normally suppress spontaneous locomotor activity. Interestingly, a study of dopaminergic signaling in larval zebrafish also reported that dopamine suppressed spontaneous fictive swim episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Thirumalai and Cline, 2008</xref>), although dopamine is classically known for stimulating locomotor activity in adult rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Ryczko and Dubuc, 2017</xref>). Thus, differential roles for neuromodulators during development and adulthood could be a general feature of locomotor circuitry.</p>
<p>A number of studies have found that aversive stimuli promote expression of c-Fos in the NI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lawther et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Passerin et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Rajkumar et al., 2016</xref>), leading researchers to evaluate the role of relaxin-3 in anxiety-like behaviors. In rats, intracerebroventricular infusion of a relaxin-3 receptor agonist increased entries to the open arms of an elevated plus maze and the amount of time animals spend in the light portion of a light-dark box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Ryan et al., 2013</xref>). Similar assays in mice showed that the relaxin-3 receptor agonist did not alter the basal behavioral state but rather reduced anxiety-like behavior induced by the anxiogenic drug FG-7142 (Zhang et al., 2015). However, a role for the NI in regulating the behavioral response to acute aversive stimuli has so far not been described. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref> note that <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons in the mouse NI promote spontaneous locomotor activity and are activated in response to foot shock, a stimulus that elicits immediate locomotion, but whether they mediate the immediate locomotor response to this stimulus is unclear. Through selective ablation, we found that loss of either NI <italic>rln3a</italic> or <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons was not sufficient to alter hyperactivity normally observed in zebrafish larvae post-shock.</p>
<p>Previous work showed that zebrafish hindbrain <italic>rln3a</italic> neurons localize to a region expressing <italic>corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1</italic> (<italic>crhr1</italic>), which encodes a receptor expressed at high levels in the rodent NI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Potter et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bittencourt and Sawchenko, 2000</xref>). We find that transcripts encoding neuromedin B and cholecystokinin, which have also been detected in the rodent NI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Olucha-Bordonau et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kubota et al., 1983</xref>), likewise map to the presumptive zebrafish NI. Similar to <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons in the zebrafish larval NI, in mice <italic>Rln3</italic> and <italic>Nmb</italic> are expressed in interspersed neuronal populations and are co-expressed in a subset of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nasirova et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we found that <italic>cckb</italic> neurons are a separate population located posterior to the <italic>rln3a</italic> and <italic>nmbb</italic> neurons.</p>
<p>Szlaga <italic>et al</italic>. also found little overlap between cholecystokinin and relaxin-3 neurons in the rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Szlaga et al., 2022</xref>). Together, these results suggest conservation of NI cell types and their organization from fish to mammals, establishing zebrafish as a model to understand the connectivity and function of the diverse types of NI neurons. Intriguingly, a new study identified a region in the zebrafish larval hindbrain, referred to as the dorsal tegmental nucleus, whose GABAergic neurons project to the dorsal IPN and are activated in conjunction with directional turning by the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Petrucco et al., 2023</xref>). Although the specific neuronal cell types have yet to be identified, it is likely they correspond to a subpopulation in the NI.</p>

<p>At 6 dpf, <italic>Tg(gsc2:QF2)<sup>c721</sup></italic>; <italic>Tg(QUAS:GFP)<sup>c578</sup></italic>or <italic>Tg(rln3a:QF2, he1.1:YFP)<sup>c836</sup></italic>; <italic>Tg(QUAS:GFP)<sup>c578</sup></italic> larvae were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine and individually mounted within a droplet of 1.5% low melting point agarose (50100, Lonza) centered in a 30 mm x 10 mm Petri dish. After the agarose solidified, system water was added. GFP-expressing cells were located using a two-photon microscope (Bruker) with a 60X (NA = 1) objective. The laser was tuned to 885 nm and, using GFP labeling as a guide, was focused on the relevant neuronal population and activated for several seconds at maximum power until the GFP signal disappeared. Because the two-photon laser power is delivered to a restricted Z-plane, ablations were repeated at multiple depths to eliminate each cell population. For ablation of <italic>gsc2</italic> neurons the laser was activated over an area of 600-2000 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> on four Z-planes. The laser was activated over an area of 1000-1250 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> on two Z-planes for ablation of <italic>rln3a</italic> NI neurons and over an area of 1200-1800 um<sup>2</sup> on two Z-planes for removal of each <italic>rln3a</italic> PAG nucleus (left and right).</p>

<title>Locomotor assay</title>
<p>Behavioral experiments were performed blind to the ablation status of each larva being assayed. Unablated controls were a mixture of <italic>Tg(gsc2:QF2)<sup>c721</sup></italic>; <italic>Tg(QUAS:GFP)<sup>c578</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg(rln3a:QF2, he1.1:YFP)<sup>c836</sup></italic>; <italic>Tg(QUAS:GFP)<sup>c578</sup></italic>, and were siblings of ablated larvae. Behavioral tests were conducted in a temperature-controlled room (27Â° C) on individual 7 dpf larvae. The 6 cm<sup>3</sup> acrylic testing chamber had a 0.5 cm platform on which a 40 mm cell strainer (Falcon) was placed. The chamber was filled with fresh system water and set on top of an infrared illumination source (880 nm, ViewPoint Life Sciences). Locomotor activity was recorded by a high frame rate charged-coupled device (CCD) camera (Point Grey Research), which was connected to a computer (Dell). Tracking was performed in real time at 60 frames per second, using ZebraLab software (ViewPoint Life Sciences). Swimming behavior was recorded for 120 seconds, then each larva was shocked once (25 V, 200 ms duration), and activity recorded for an additional 120 seconds. To analyze locomotor activity, the x and y coordinates of a larvaâs position in each frame were exported from ZebraLab. Activity was quantified using R statistical software (R Core Team) according to the following equation:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="487414v3_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where i indicates a single frame. Total distances were calculated by summing the distance for all frames over the relevant period of the recording. Total number of movement phases and average length of movement phases during the pre-shock period were calculated for each larva using R statistical software (R Core Team). Movement trajectories were plotted using MATLAB. Phases of movement and their durations were extracted using R statistical software by first binning the distances for all frames within each second of the recording, then iterating through each subsequent second. A movement phase was determined to commence when there was movement within a given second and no movement in the preceding second, and the phase persisted for each subsequent consecutive second with movement. The phase of movement was determined to end when there was no movement within a given second following one with movement. Turning behavior was quantified using R statistical software by iterating through the x and y coordinates of a larvaâs position in each frame. Starting with the second frame, the size of the angle formed by the larvaâs change in orientation between the first and second frame, and the second and third frame, was calculated according to the law of cosines:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="487414v3_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where C is the angle formed by two lines of length a and b, and c is the length of the side opposite angle C. Total turning was calculated by summing the size, in degrees, of all calculated angles of all frames in which a larva was active. Total turning for each larva was divided by the total distance traveled to calculate a ratio of turning per unit of distance traveled.</p>

<p>This study presents an <bold>important</bold> finding on the anatomical connectivity and functional roles of the previously uncharacterized neuronal populations in the nucleus incertus. The evidence supporting the conclusions is <bold>convincing</bold>, with imaging and manipulations of the genetically targeted populations of neurons. The work presents a significant milestone for future mechanistic studies of the nucleus incertus.</p>

<p>Spikol et al. investigate the roles of two distinct populations of neurons in the nucleus incertus (NI). The authors established two new transgenic lines that label gsc2- and rln3a-expressing neurons. They show that the gsc2+ and rln3a+ NI neurons show divergent projection patterns and project to different parts of the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which receive inputs from the habenula (Hb). Furthermore, calcium imaging shows that gsc2 neurons are activated by the optogenetic activation of the dorsal Hb-IPN and respond to aversive electric shock stimuli, while rln3a neurons are highly spontaneously active. The ablation of rln3a neurons, but not gsc2 neurons, alters locomotor activity of zebrafish larvae.</p>
<p>The strength of the paper is their genetic approach that enabled the authors to characterize many different features of the two genetically targeted populations in the NI. These two neuronal populations are anatomically closely apposed and would have been indistinguishable without their genetic tools. Their analyses provide valuable information on the diverse anatomical, physiological and behavioral functions of the different NI subtypes. On the other hand, these pieces of evidence are loosely linked with each other to reach a mechanistic understanding of how the NI works in a circuit. For example, the anatomical study revealed the connections from the NI to the IPN, while the optogenetic mapping experiments investigate the other way around, i.e. the connection from the IPN to the NI.</p>

<p>This study uses a range of methods to characterize heterogeneous neural populations within the nucleus incertus (NI). The authors focus on two major populations, expressing gsc2 and rln3a, and present convincing evidence that these cells have different patterns of connectivity, calcium activity and effects on behavior. Although the study does not go as far as clarifying the role of NI in any specific neural computation or aspect of behavioral control, the findings will be valuable in support of future endeavors to do so. In particular, the authors have made two beautiful knock-in lines that recapitulate endogenous expression pattern of gsc2 and rln3a which will be a powerful tool to study the roles of the relevant NI cells. Experiments are well done, data are high quality and most claims are well supported. In this revised version, the authors have added additional analysis that has clarified their results and strengthened some of the claims.</p>
<p>Two points of note:</p>
<p>â¢ The data very clearly show different patterns of neurites for gsc2 and rln3a neurons in the IPN and the authors interpret these are being axonal arbors. However, they do not rule out the possibility that some of the processes might be dendritic in nature. Of relevance to this point, they cite a recent study (Petrucco et al. 2023) that confirmed that, as in other species, tegmental neurons in zebrafish extend spatially segregated dendritic as well as axonal arbors into IPN, and the authors speculate that these GABAergic tegmental cells might in fact be part of NI.</p>
<p>â¢ Although the gsc2 and rln3a populations show differences in calcium activity, there is not as clear a dichotomy as stated in the abstract. For example, both populations clearly respond to electric shocks, albeit with different response time courses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, Spikol et al. explore the projection patterns and functional characteristics of two distinct and genetically defined populations in the larval zebrafish Nucleus Incertus (NI), expressing the transcription factor gsc2 or the neuropeptide rln3a. To label in vivo these neurons two transgenic lines were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated Knock-in. These genetic tools allowed the analysis of the projection patterns of these neuronal populations showing that the NI neurons expressing gsc2 and rln3a exhibit markedly different projection patterns, targeting separate subregions within the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN).</p>
<p>
Functional imaging and behavioral analysis revealed that while gsc2 neurons respond to electric shock stimuli, rln3a neurons show high spontaneous activity and play a role in regulating locomotor activity.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper relies on a series of rigorous experimental approaches including molecular genetic, neuroanatomical, functional and behavioral analysis. The resources generated including the two knock-in transgenic reporter lines will be of great value for the zebrafish neurobiology community as well as inspire further studies of the NI in other model systems.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Technical weaknesses present in the first version of the manuscript have largely been addressed in the present revision.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We are thankful to the reviewers and the editor for their detailed feedback, insightful suggestions, and thoughtful assessment of our work. Our point-by-point responses to the comments and suggestions are below.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript has taken into account all the comments of the three reviewers. Modifications include corrections to errors in spelling and unit notation, additional quantification, improvements to the clarity of the language in some places, as well as additional detail in the descriptions of the methods, and revisions to the figures and figure legends.</p>
<p>We have also undertaken additional analyses and added materials in response to reviewer suggestions. In brief:</p>
<p>In response to a suggestion from Reviewer #1, we added Figure 6-1 to show examples of the calcium traces of individual fish and individual ROIs from the condensed data in Figure 6.
We revised Figure 7 as follows:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>We added an analysis of the duration of the response to shock to address comments from Reviewers #2 and #3.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item><p>In response to Reviewer #3, we added histograms showing the distribution of the amplitudes of the calcium signals in the gsc2 and rln3a neurons to show, without relying on the detection of peaks in the calcium trace, that the rln3a neurons have more oscillations in activity.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We added Figure 8-2 in response to the suggestion from Reviewer #3 to analyze turning behavior in larvae with ablated rln3a neurons.</p>
<p>To address Reviewer #2âs suggestion to show how the ablated transgenic animals compare to the non-ablated transgenic animals of the same genotype, we have added this analysis as Figure 8-3.</p>
<p>A detailed point-by-point is as follows:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The reviewers agree that the study of Spikol et al is important, with novel findings and exciting genetic tools for targeting cell types in the nucleus incertus. The conclusions are overall solid. Results could nonetheless be strengthened by performing few additional optogenetic experiments and by consolidating the analysis of calcium imaging and behavioral recordings as summarized below.</p>
<p>(1) Light pulses used for optogenetic-mediated connectivity mapping were very long (5s), which could lead to non specific activation of numerous population of neurons than the targeted ones. To confirm their results, the authors should repeat their experiments with brief 5-50ms (500ms maximum) -long light pulses for stimulation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the activity of the gsc2 neurons is already increased by 1.8 fold (Â± 0.28) within the first frame that the laser is activated (duration ~200 msec), it is unlikely that that the observed response is due to non-specific activation induced by the long light pulse.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of analysis, the authors should improve :</p>
<p>a) The detection of calcium events in the &quot;calcium trace&quot; showing the change in fluorescence over time by detecting the sharp increase in the signal when intracellular calcium rises;</p>
<p>We have added an additional analysis to Figure 7 that does not rely on detection of calcium peaks. See response to Reviewer #3.</p>
<p>b) The detection of bouts in the behavioral recordings by measuring when the tail beat starts and ends, thereby distinguishing the active swimming during bouts from the immobility observed between bouts.</p>
<p>Our recordings capture the entire arena that the larva can explore in the experiment and therefore lack the spatial resolution to capture and analyze the tail beat. Rather, we measured the frequency and length of phases of movement in which the larva shows no more than 1 second of immobility. To avoid confusion with studies that measure bouts from the onset of tail movement, we removed this term from the manuscript and refer to activity as phases of movement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The reviewers also ask for more precisions in the characterization of the newly-generated knock-in lines and the corresponding anatomy as explained in their detailed reports.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please refer to the point-by-point request for additional details that have now been added to the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are mostly well supported by data, but some technical aspects, especially about calcium imaging and data analysis, need to be clarified.</p>
<p>(1) Both the endogenous gsc2 mRNA expression and Tg(gsc2:QF2) transgenic expression are observed in a neuronal population in the NI, but also in a more sparsely distributed population of neurons located more anteriorly (for example, Fig. 2B, Fig. 5A). The latter population is not mentioned in the text. It would be necessary to clarify whether or not this anterior population is also considered as the NI, and whether this population was included for the analysis of the projection patterns and ablation experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The sparsely distributed neurons had been mentioned in the Results, line 134, but we have now added more detail. In line 328, we have clarified that: âAs the sparsely distributed anterior group of gsc2 neurons (Fig. 2B, C) are anatomically distinct from the main cluster and not within the nucleus incertus proper, they were excluded from subsequent analyses.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Both Tg(gsc2:QF2) and Tg(rln3a:QF2) transgenic lines have the QF genes inserted in the coding region of the targeted genes. This probably leads to knock out of the gene in the targeted allele. Can the authors mention whether or not the endogenous expression of gsc2 and rln3a was affected in the transgenic larvae? Is it possible that the results they obtained using these transgenic lines are affected by the (heterozygous or homozygous) mutation of the targeted genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 8-1 includes in situ hybridization for gsc2 and rln3a in heterozygous Tg(gsc2:QF2)c721; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 and Tg(rln3a:QF2; he1.1:YFP)c836; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 transgenic larvae.</p>
<p>The expression of gsc2 is unaffected in Tg(gsc2:QF2)c721; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 heterozygotes</p>
<p>(Fig. 8-1A), whereas the expression of rln3a is reduced in Tg(rln3a:QF2; he1.1:YFP)c836;
Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 heterozygous larvae (Fig. 8-1D), as mentioned in the legend for Figure 8-1. We confirmed these findings by comparing endogenous gene expression between transgenic and non-transgenic siblings that were processed for RNA in situ hybridization in the same tube.</p>
<p>The behavioral results we obtained are not due to rln3a heterozygosity because comparisons were made with sibling larvae that are also heterozygous for Tg(rln3a:QF2; he1.1:YFP)c836; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578, as stated in the Figure 8 legend.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Optogenetic activation and simultaneous calcium imaging is elegantly designed using the combination of the orthogonal Gal4/UAS and QF2/QUAS systems (Fig. 6). However, I have some concerns about the analysis of calcium responses from a technical point of view. Their definition of ÎF/F in this manuscript is described as (F-Fmin)/(Fmax-Fmin) (see line 1406). This is confusing because it is different from the conventional definition of ÎF/F, which is F-F0/F0, where F0 is a baseline GCaMP fluorescence. Their way of calculating the ÎF/F is inappropriate for measuring the change in fluorescence relative to the baseline signal because it rather normalizes the amplitude of the responses across different ROIs. The same argument applies to the analyses done for Fig. 7.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have taken a careful look at our analyses and replotted the data using F-F0/F0. However, this only changes Y-axis values and does not change the shape of the calcium trace or the change in signal upon stimulation. Both metrics (F-F0/F0 and (F-Fmin)/(Fmax-Fmin)) adjust the fluorescence values of each ROI to its own baseline.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The %ÎF/F plots shown in Fig.6 are highly condensed showing the average of different ROIs (cells) within one fish and then the average of multiple fish. It would be helpful to see example calcium traces of individual ROIs and individual fish to know the variability across ROIs and fish. Also, It would be helpful to know how much laser power (561 nm laser) was used to photostimulate ReaChR.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Laser power (5%) was added to the section titled Calcium Signaling in Methods.</p>
<p>In Figure 6, shading in the %ÎF/F plots (D, Dâ, E, Eâ, F, Fâ, G, Gâ, H, Hâ) represents the variability across ROIs, and the dot plots (Dââ, Eââ, Fââ, Gââ, Hââ) show the variability across fish (where each data point represents an individual fish). We have now also added Figure 6-1 with examples of calcium traces from individual fish and individual ROIs.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Some calcium traces presented in Fig. 6 (Fig. 6D, D', F, H, H') show discontinuous fluctuations at the onset and offset of the photostimulation period. Is this caused by some artifacts introduced by switching the settings for the photostimulation? The authors should mention if there are some alternative explanations for this discontinuity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted by the reviewer, this artifact does result from switching the settings for photostimulation, which we mention in the legend for Figure 6.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) In the introduction, they mention that the griseum centrale is a presumed analogue of the NI (lines 74-75). It would be helpful for the readers to better understand the brain anatomy if the authors could discuss whether or not their findings on the gsc2 and rln3a NI neurons support this idea.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our findings on the gsc2 and rln3a neurons support the idea that the griseum centrale of fish is the analogue of the mammalian NI. We have now edited the text in the third paragraph of the discussion, line 1271, to make this point more clearly: âBy labeling with QUAS-driven fluorescent reporters, we determined that the anatomical location, neurotransmitter phenotype, and hodological properties of gsc2 and rln3a neurons are consistent with NI identity, supporting the assertion that the griseum centrale of fish is analogous to the mammalian NI. Both groups of neurons are GABAergic, reside on the floor of the fourth ventricle and project to the interpeduncular nucleus.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

</list-item></list>
<p>We annotated Figures 2-1 and 2-2 as suggested. We also indicated the orientation (anterior to the top or anterior to the left) in all figure legends. For additional context on the position of gsc2 and rln3a neurons within the larval brain, refer to Fig. 1A-Câ, Fig. 1-2A, Fig. 2, Fig. 4 and Fig. 5.</p>

<p>We added a note to the legend of Figure 2-2: Arrowheads in B and Bâ indicate mApple labeling of gsc2 neuronal projections to the hypothalamus. We also refer to Fig 2-2B, Bâ in the Results section titled Distinct Projection Patterns of gsc2 and rln3a neurons.</p>

<p>We are not sure what the author meant by subtraction as there are no before and after images in this experiment. Larvae underwent ablation of cell bodies and were imaged one day later in comparison to unablated larvae.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In particular, it is not clear to me if both PAG and NI rln3a neurons project to medulla - can the authors specify this point &amp; the comparison between intact &amp; PAG vs NI ablation maps? The authors should resolve better the projections to all targeted regions of NI gsc2 neurons and differentiate them from other PAG gsc2 neurons, same for rln3a neurons.</p>

<p>(â2) calcium imaging experiments:</p>
<p>a) with optogenetic connectivity mapping:</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>the authors combine an impressive diverse set of optogenetic actuators &amp; sensors by taking advantage of the QUAS/QF2 and UAS/GAL4 systems to test connectivity from Hb-IPN onto gsc2 and rln3 neurons.</p>
<p>The experiments are convincing but the choice of the duration of the stimulation (5s) is not adequate to test for direct connectivity: the authors should make sure that response in gsc2 neurons is observed with short duration (50ms-1s max).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above:</p>
<p>âAs the activity of the gsc2 neurons is already increased by 1.8 fold (Â± 0.28) within the first frame that the laser is activated (duration ~200 msec), it is unlikely that that the observed response is due to non-specific activation induced by the long light pulse.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>note: Specify that the gsc2 neurons tested are in NI.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have edited the text accordingly in the Results section titled Afferent input to the NI from the dHb-IPN pathway.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) for the response to shock:
in the example shown for rln3 neurons, the activity differs before and after the shock with long phases of inhibition that were not seen before. Is it representative? the authors should carefully stare at their data &amp; make sure there is no difference in activity patterns after shock versus before.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We reexamined the responses for each of the rln3a neurons individually and confirmed that, although oscillations in activity are frequent, the apparent inhibition (excursions below baseline) are an idiosyncratic feature of the particular example shown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) motor activity assay:</p>
<p>a) there seems to be a misconception in the use of the word &quot;bout&quot; to estimate in panels H and I bout distance and duration and the analysis should be performed with the criterion used by all in the motor field:</p>
<p>As we know now well based on the work of many labs on larval zebrafish (Orger, Baier, Engert, Wyart, Burgess, Portugues, Bianco, Scott, ...), a bout is defined as a discrete locomotor event corresponding to a distance swam of typically 1-6mm, bout duration is typically 200ms and larvae exhibit a bout every s or so during exploration (see Mirat et al Frontiers 2013; Marques et al Current Biology 2018; Rajan et al. Cell Reports 2022).</p>
<p>Since the larval zebrafish has a low Reynolds number, it does not show much glide and its movement corresponds widely to the active phase of the tail beats.</p>
<p>Instead of detecting the active (moving) frames as bouts, the authors however estimate these values quite off that indicate an error of calibration in the detection of a movement: a bout cannot last for 5-10s, nor can the fish swim for more than 1 cm per bout (in the definition of the authors, bout last for 5-10 s, and bout correspond to 10 cm as 50 cm is covered in 5 bouts).</p>
<p>The authors should therefore distinguish the active (moving) from inactive (immobile) phase of the behavior to define bouts &amp; analyze the corresponding distance travelled and duration of active swimming. They would also benefit from calculating the % of time spent swimming in order to test whether the fish with ablated rln3 neurons change the fraction of the time spent swimming.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above:</p>
<p>Our recordings capture the entire arena that the larva can explore in the experiment and therefore lack the spatial resolution to capture and analyze the tail beat. Rather, we measured the frequency and length of phases of movement in which the larva shows no more than 1 second of immobility. To avoid confusion with studies that measure bouts from the onset of tail movement, we removed this term from the manuscript and refer to activity as phases of movement.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Note that a duration in seconds is not a length and that the corresponding symbol for seconds in a scientific publication is &quot;s&quot; and not &quot;sec&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have corrected this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) controls in these experiments are key as many clutches differ in their spontaneous exploration and there is a lot of variation for 2 min long recordings (baseline is 115s). The authors specify that the control unablated are a mix of siblings; they should show us how the ablated transgenic animals compare to the non ablated transgenic animals of the same clutch.</p>

Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 larvae in the control group are siblings of ablated larvae. We repeated the analyses using either the Tg(gsc2:QF2)c721; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 or Tg(rln3a:QF2, he1.1:YFP)c836; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 larvae only as controls and added the results in Figure 8-3. Although the statistical power is slightly reduced due to a smaller number of samples in the control group, the conclusions are the same, as the behavior of Tg(gsc2:QF2)c721; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 and Tg(rln3a:QF2, he1.1:YFP)c836; Tg(QUAS:GFP)c578 unablated larvae is indistinguishable.</p>

Moreover, the inset images suggest GCaMP7a expression might be weaker in the gsc2 transgenic and as such, differences in peak count might be related to the SNR of the recordings rather than underlying activity. Overall, the process for estimating spontaneous activity should be more rigorous.</p>

<p>To not solely rely on the identification of peaks in the calcium traces, we also plotted histograms of the amplitudes of the calcium signals for the rln3a and gsc2 neurons. The histograms show that the amplitudes of the rln3a calcium signals frequently occur at small and large values (suggesting large fluctuations in activity), whereas the amplitudes of the gsc2 calcium signals occur most frequently at median values. We added this analysis to a revised Figure 7.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there are a number of large negative excursions in the calcium data for the rln3a cell - what is the authors' interpretation of these? Could it be that presynaptic inhibition via GABA-B receptors in dIPN might influence dIPN-innervating rln3a neurons?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted above:</p>
<p>We reexamined the responses for each of the rln3a neurons individually and confirmed that, although oscillations in activity are frequent, the apparent inhibition (excursions below baseline) are an idiosyncratic feature of the particular example shown.</p>

<p>Regarding shock-evoked activity, the authors state &quot;rln3a neurons showed ... little response to shock&quot;, yet the immediate response after shock appears very similar in gsc2 vs rln3a cells (approx 30 units on the dF/F scale). The subsequent time-course of the response is what appears to distinguish gsc2 versus rln3a; it might thus be useful to separately quantify the amplitude and decay time constant of the shock evoked response for the two populations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that the difference between the gsc2 and rln3a neurons in the response to shock is dependent on the duration of time post-shock that is analyzed. Thus, the more relevant feature is the length of the response rather than the size. To reflect this, we compared the average length of responses for the gsc2 and rln3a neurons. We have now added this analysis to Figure 7 and updated the text accordingly.</p>

<list-item><p>The difference in spontaneous locomotor behavior is interesting and the example tracking data suggests there might also be differences in turn angle distribution and/or turn chain length following rln3 NI ablations. I would recommend the authors consider exploring this.</p>

<p>Thank you for this suggestion. We wrote additional code to quantify turning behavior and found that larvae with rln3a NI neurons ablated do indeed have a statistically significant increase in turning compared to other groups. We now show this analysis as Figure 8-2 and we added an explanation of the quantification of turning behavior to the Methods section titled Locomotor assay.</p>

<list-item><p>I didn't follow the reasoning in the discussion that activity of rln3a cells <code>may control transitions between phases of behavioral activity and inactivity</code>. The events (at least those that are detected) in Fig7 occur with an average interval exceeding 30 s, yet swim bouts occur at a frequency around 1 Hz. The authors should clarify their hypothesis about how these disparate timescales might be connected.</p>

<p>As noted above:</p>
<p>Our recordings capture the entire arena that the larva can explore in the experiment and therefore lack the spatial resolution to capture and analyze the tail beat. Rather, we measure the frequency and length of phases of movement in which the larva shows no more than 1 second of immobility. To avoid confusion with studies that measure bouts from the onset of tail movement, we removed this term from the manuscript and refer to activity as phases of movement.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2 also pointed out that the difference between the gsc2 and rln3a neurons in the response to shock is dependent on the duration of time post-shock that is analyzed. Thus, the more relevant feature is the length of the response rather than the size. To reflect this, we compared the average length of response for the gsc2 and rln3a neurons and modified the text and Figure as described above.</p>

<p>See response to Reviewer # 2, repeated below:</p>
<p>We looked through each of the responses of individual  rln3a neuron and confirmed that, although oscillations in activity are frequent among the rln3a neurons, the apparent inhibition (excursions below baseline) are an idiosyncratic feature of the particular example shown.</p>

<list-item><p>There are several large and apparently perfectly straight lines in the fish tracking examples (Fig8) suggestive of tracking errors (ie. where the tracked centroid instantaneously jumps across the camera frame). Please investigate these and include analysis of the distribution of swim velocities to support the validity of the tracking data.</p>

<p>The reason for this is indeed imperfect tracking resulting in frames in which the tracker does not detect the larva. The result is that the larva appears to move 1 cm or more in a single frame. However, analysis of the distribution of distances across all frames shows that these events (movement of 1 cm or more in a single frame) are rare (less than 0.04%), and there are no systematic differences that would explain the differences in locomotor behavior presented in Fig. 8. A summary of the data is as follows:</p>
<p>Controls: 0.0249% of distances 1 cm or greater gsc2 neurons ablated: 0.0302% of distances 1 cm or greater rln3a NI neurons ablated: 0.0287% of distances 1 cm or greater rln3a PAG neurons ablated: 0.0241% of distance 1 cm or greater</p>
