<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Collecting lymphatic vessels (cLVs) exhibit spontaneous contractions with a pressure-dependent frequency, but the identity of the lymphatic pacemaker cell is still debated. By analogy to pacemakers in the GI and lower urinary tracts, proposed cLV pacemaker cells include interstitial cells of Cajal like cells (ICLC) or the lymphatic muscle (LMCs) cells themselves. Here we combined immunofluorescence and scRNAseq analyses with electrophysiological methods to examine the cellular constituents of the mouse cLV wall and assess whether any cell type exhibited morphological and functional processes characteristic of pacemaker cells: a continuous if not contiguous network integrated into the electrical syncytium; spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients; and depolarization-induced propagated contractions. We employed inducible Cre (iCre) mouse models routinely used to target these specific cell populations including: c-kitCreER<italic><sup>T2</sup></italic> to target ICLC; <italic>PdgfrβCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> to target pericyte-like cells; <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> to target CD34<sup>+</sup> adventitial cells and ICLC; and <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> to target LMCs directly. These specific inducible Cre lines were crossed to the fluorescent reporter ROSA26mT/mG, the genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor GCaMP6f, and the light-activated cation channel rhodopsin2 (ChR2). c-KitCreER<italic><sup>T2</sup></italic> labeled both a sparse population of LECs and round adventitial cells that responded to the mast cell activator compound 48-80. <italic>PdgfrβCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> drove recombination in both adventitial cells and LMCs, limiting its power to discriminate a pericyte-specific population. <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> labeled a large population of interconnected, oak leaf-shaped cells primarily along the adventitial surface of the vessel. Of these cells, only LMCs consistently, but heterogeneously, displayed spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> events during the diastolic period of the contraction cycle, and whose frequency was modulated in a pressure-dependent manner. Optogenetic depolarization through the expression of ChR2 under control of <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, but not <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> or c-KitCreER<italic><sup>T2</sup></italic>, resulted in propagated contractions upon photo-stimulation. Membrane potential recordings in LMCs demonstrated that the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly correlated with contraction frequency. These findings support the conclusion that LMCs, or a subset of LMCs, are responsible for mouse cLV pacemaking.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The spontaneous contractions of collecting lymphatic vessels (cLV) are an integral component to fluid and macromolecule homeostasis as they provide the force to transport fluid from the interstitial spaces back to the blood circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Scallan et al., 2016</xref>). In humans, spontaneous contractile activity is estimated to account for 2/3 of lymph transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Engeset et al., 1977</xref>) and this function is significantly compromised in patients suffering from lymphedema, whose cLVs typically display weak and irregular or entirely absent contractile activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Olszewski, 2002</xref>). <italic>Ex vivo</italic> studies, in which the intraluminal pressure can be precisely controlled, have refined our understanding of the pressure-dependent regulation of contraction frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Benoit et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gashev et al., 2004</xref>), with some mouse cLVs displaying a 10-fold increase in contraction frequency over a 10 cmH2O pressure gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Scallan and Davis, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Zawieja et al., 2018a</xref>). The observation that cLVs, often cannulated at various lengths for <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparations, retain a consistently tunable contraction frequency points to the presence of a pacemaker cell(s) innate to the structure of the cLV wall and with a seemingly ubiquitous presence along the length of the vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Zawieja et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>). Furthermore, isolated cLVs typically display single pacemaker initiation sites unless damaged or electrically uncoupled by pharmacological inhibition of gap junctions or genetic deletion of <italic>Gjc1</italic> (Connexin 45, Cx45) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Behringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2020</xref>). In sum, this suggests the pacemaker cell(s) is(are) likely both ubiquitous and continuous, to allow for electrical conduction via gap junctions, along the length of the cLV and prevent colliding contractile waves which would impair lymph transport.</p>
<p>Investigations into the cLV pacemaker identity have focused largely on cells termed interstitial cells of Cajal like cells (ICLC; or telocytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCloskey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>), as they display some morphological and cell marker expression profiles similar to the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which are bona fide pacemakers in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. ICC are classically identified by either methylene blue staining and expression of cKit, and coordinate GI smooth muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Maeda et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Ward et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Ordog et al., 1999</xref>). ICC also express the canonical Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated chloride channel Anoctamin 1 (Ano1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Gomez-Pinilla et al., 2009</xref>), which is required for pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). Previous reports in sheep mesenteric lymphatic vessels identified a population of cKit<sup>+</sup>, vimentin<sup>+</sup>, ICLC in the vessel wall between the endothelial and LMC layer and running along the axis of the vessel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCloskey et al., 2002</xref>). Investigations in the human thoracic duct also identified a significant population of ICLC in close proximity to the lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) evident by methylene blue staining, immunostaining for CD34, vimentin, and cKit, as well as the gold standard of electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>). However, neither study could determine if these cells had functional electrical communication with the LMCs or demonstrate either a membrane electrical clock or internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> clock to drive the rhythmic lymphatic vessel contractions observed <italic>ex vivo</italic>. LMCs share a functional similarity to ICC in that they also display the <italic>Ano1</italic> mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated chloride current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Toland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Mohanakumar et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>), that regulates pacemaking. Spontaneous transient depolarizations, presumably Ano1 dependent, were recorded in mesenteric cLVs from guinea pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">von der Weid et al., 2008</xref>) providing a mechanism for membrane potential instability to drive AP initiation. Furthermore, computational models have proposed LMC sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as the oscillator mechanism driving pacemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Imtiaz et al., 2007</xref>). SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release has also been implicated in pericyte regulation of arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hashitani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">van Helden and Imtiaz, 2019</xref>), in microvascular vasomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Boedtkjer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aalkjaer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">van Helden and Imtiaz, 2019</xref>), and in the contraction waves of atypical muscle cells of the lower urinary tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Grainger et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Presently, no investigations have clearly identified the cellular identities of possible pacemaker cells within the cLVs of the mouse. Mouse cLVs exhibit contractile parameters and conduction speed equivalent to those of human vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>) and their simplified architecture, compared to larger mammals, in combination with the genetic tools developed for the mouse model, allowed us to test for a fundamental pacemaker cell in the cLV. In this study we utilized multiple genetic mouse models, confocal imaging of fluorescent reporters, cell specific expression of GCaMP6f for Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, and optogenetic light-activated depolarization to both visualize and test the functional aspects of putative pacemaker cells, and membrane potential recordings in LMCs in pressure-challenged cLVs. We also performed immunostaining and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of isolated cLVs to provide greater detail to the heterogenous cellular populations found within the mouse cLVs. Despite identifying a significant population of CD34<sup>+</sup>Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> adventitial cells along the length of mouse cLVs, the results of our functional studies support a myogenic origin of pacemaking in cLVs.</p>

<title>Methylene Blue Staining Reveals a Minor Population of Cells in Mouse cLVs</title>
<p>Methylene blue staining was used to identify an ICLC population in the human lymphatic thoracic duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>). In our isolated and cleaned lymphatic inguinal axillary collecting vessels (IALVs), methylene blue stained a significant number of cells with variable density along the length of the IALV and heterogenous cell morphologies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). A significant portion of the stained cells resembled lymphatic vessel-associated macrophages with an elongated shape, while other cells were smaller and circular (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-F</xref>). Methylene blue also appeared to stain mast cells as there were large ovoid cells on the adventitia of the vessel with intracellular granules. In addition, methylene blue stained a minor population of cells that exhibited long and thin axon-like extensions which appeared to have a slight helical orientation, with a small central body and nucleus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). None of these cell populations were aligned with the longitudinal axis of the vessel that would permit efficient coupling or regulation across the circumferential LMCs required for coordinated propagation along the length of the vessel.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence Imaging of IALVs Stained for ICLC, LEC, and LMC Markers</title>
<p>We next stained IALVs for the putative telocyte/ICLC markers cKIT, CD34, and the intermediate filament Vimentin, which have been previously utilized for ICLC identification in human and sheep lymphatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCloskey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, an antibody to the intermediate filament Desmin was used to label muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCloskey et al., 2002</xref>). IALVs stained with cKIT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) showed robust signal in large ovoid cells with a non-segmented circular nucleus (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), characteristic of mast cells that were located in the outer part of the adventitia. Similarly, cKIT stained populations of elongated cells as well as circular cells with variable densities throughout the IALV wall, similar to methylene blue<sup>+</sup> cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B, J</xref>). Staining for CD34 revealed a large population of cells that were seemingly contiguous along the length of the vessel. The CD34<sup>+</sup> cells generally had multiple lobular processes and a “oak leaf” like appearance, typically a characteristic of fibroblasts, though some contained short, thin dendrite-like extensions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, G, K</xref>). The CD34<sup>+</sup> cells were negative for Desmin [<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), which primarily stained the circumferential LMCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>; note that the largely non-circumferential cell organization in this region is typical for a lymphatic endothelial valve site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Bridenbaugh et al., 2013a</xref>)]. Furthermore, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells and cKIT<sup>+</sup> cells were separate populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, L</xref>). A Vimentin antibody labeled lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) which exhibited a horizontal cobblestone morphology in parallel with the vessel axis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E, I</xref>), while also co-labeling the majority of the CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>) and cKIT<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref>). Videos of the half vessel z-stacks are provided (Supplemental Movies 1-3 for <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, H</xref>, and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">L</xref> respectively).</p>

<p>Of the cells stained in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, the CD34<sup>+</sup> population was intriguing due to its high density and distribution throughout the length of the IALV, which potentially would be conducive to effective regulation of LMC excitability. In addition to CD34 and Vimentin, PDGFRα staining is also commonly ascribed to both telocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Vannucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>) as well as fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kimura et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Clayton et al., 2022</xref>). We performed immunofluorescence imaging for PGDFRα counterstained with CD34 and markers for LMCs, LECs, and pericytes. As noted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, CD34<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) did not co-label LMCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) which were smooth muscle actin<sup>+</sup> (SMA, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) and Calponin<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). However, nearly all CD34<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) cells were also PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, H). Occasionally some overlap of PDGFRα and SMA<sup>+</sup> signal was noted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>, H). LECs staining with CD31 (PECAM, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>) revealed the expected rectangular elongated cobblestone morphology that was distinct from the PDGFRα+ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J, L</xref>). Staining for Calponin also specifically labeled LMCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>) but not PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3L</xref>). Lastly, we stained for PDGFRα, CD34, and PDGFRβ, a commonly used pericyte marker (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 M-P</xref>). As above, CD34 and PDGFRα were highly colocalized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q, R, T</xref>), and many of the CD34<sup>+</sup> and PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells were also PDGFRβ<sup>+</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3P</xref>). PDGFRβ also stained some circumferential LMCs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3Q</xref>). During the imaging of mouse IALVs for these markers, we also observed that the lymphatic secondary endothelial valves were populated by elongated cells that stretched the length of the valve leaflet and were positive for CD34, PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ, with varying intensities. These cells could be observed in most, if not all, the valves we assessed and found within both leaflets of the valve (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3R,S</xref>). These cells had long, thin extensions that were branched, along with apparent dendrite extensions with a morphology that closely resembled those described of pericytes or telocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Popescu and Faussone-Pellegrini, 2010</xref>). PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> or CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with this morphology were only observed in the valve leaflets, and thus seemed insufficient to regulate pacemaking as normal contractions are observed in cLVs without secondary valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Gashev et al., 2002</xref>).

<caption><title>Immunofluorescence Labeling of Mouse IALVs with Markers for ICLC, LMC, LEC, and Immune Cell Populations</title>
<p>We stained isolated mouse IALVs with cellular markers used to differentiate various cell types observed in cLVs. Half vessel image stacks were taken with confocal microscopy and the resulting representative max projections are shown. (A) CD34 stained cells and LMC staining with SMA (B) and calponin (C) and the corresponding merged (D) image. There was significant overlap in (E) CD34 staining along with the fibroblast marker PDGFRα compared to LMC staining with SMA (G) and the merged (H) image. The endothelial marker CD31 (I) to delineate LECs with PDGFRα staining (J), and the LMC marker calponin (K) with the merged image (L) revealed 3 separate populations of cells. PDGFRβ (O) stained many cells that were CD34 (M) and PDGFRα (N) positive, as seen in the merge imaged (P), in addition to PDGFRβ signal detected in the LMC layer (Q). Max projections of only the luminal frames of a z-stack at lymphatic valve locations revealed PDGFRβ, CD34, and PDGFRα labeling in bipolar shaped cells with long extensions that traveled throughout the valve leaflets (V, W). d Control IALV (Y) stained only with secondary antibody. Scale bar = 100 µm for all images.</p></caption>

<p>We next determined the degree of colocalization between the CD34 and PDGFRα signal given the significant overlap in their staining profile. Colocalization analysis of PDGFRα (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1A</xref>) and CD34 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1B</xref>) and their colocalization (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1C</xref>) was determined with the FIJI BIOP-JACoP tool. The Pearson’s coefficient was 0.83 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1D</xref>) and Mander’s coefficient of overlap 0.80 was for the PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> signal and 0.87 for the CD34 signal (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1E</xref>). Colocalization between Myh11 and PDGFRα was significantly lower (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1D</xref>-F) with a Pearson’s coefficient of 0.30 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1G</xref>), whereas the Mander’s coefficient for Myh11 overlap with PDGFRα was 0.077 and PDGFRα signal overlap with Myh11 was 0.043 (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 1H</xref>). The high degree of colocalization CD34 and PDGFRα signal informed our use of the commercially available transgenic <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> mouse model to target these cells. The vast majority of the PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells were located in the adventitial layer (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 2A-D</xref>), which varied between 1-3 PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells thick (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 2E</xref>). Under this layer, we observed only a single layer of largely circumferential LMCs stained by Myh11 (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 2B</xref>) sitting atop a single layer of CD31<sup>+</sup> LECs (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 2A</xref>). We also observed occasional PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells or their extensions located in the sub-endothelial space (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 2 E’, E”</xref>) positioned between the LECs and the LMCs.</p>

<title>Use of iCre-Mediated Recombination of Rosa26mT/mG to Delineate and Characterize Specific IALV Cell Types</title>
<p>After confirming the presence of Vimentin<sup>+</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, and CD34<sup>+</sup> PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> positive cells within the mouse IALV, we sought to further investigate these cell populations by using constitutive and inducible Cre recombinase expressing mouse lines. IALVs from the constitutively active <italic>PdgfrαCre</italic>-ROSA26mTmG and <italic>Ng2Cre</italic>-ROSA26mTmG mice had GFP fluorescence in the majority of LMCs as well as in the fibroblast-shaped cells found within the IALV wall (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4 A,B</xref>).

In contrast to the constitutively active <italic>PdgfrαCre</italic>, the tamoxifen inducible <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> line drove significant recombination in only the fibroblast-shaped cells previously stained with CD34 and PDGFRα but not in LMCs or LECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). <italic>PdgfrβCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, commonly used to label pericytes, drove recombination in both a minor population of the LMCs and the fibroblast-shaped cells. <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, which capably drives recombination in the ICC of the GI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baker et al., 2016</xref>), drove recombination only in a small population of irregularly spaced large ovoid cells on the surface of the IALV (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), although recombination in 1 or 2 LECs could occasionally be detected (not shown). Finally, <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> drove recombination in nearly all LMCs which were largely circumferentially oriented with dendrite-like, cell-cell contacts visible between them and without significant GFP fluorescence in either LECs or the fibroblast-shaped CD34<sup>+</sup> PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cell population (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Additionally, some LMCs maintained the bipolar shape but had secondary extensions forming a “Y” shape in which an adjacent LMC typically filled the inner void. A very minor population of recombined cells in the <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ROSA26mTmG IALVs were smaller and irregularly patterned with multiple fine axon-like projections or ruffled edges (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of the cellular constituents of the mouse IALVs by scRNAseq and FACs-RT-PCR</title>
<p>The results from the immunofluorescence staining, ROSA26mTmG reporter imaging, and FACs-RT-PCR experiments suggested both LMCs and AdvCs express <italic>Pdgfrβ</italic>. To provide further clarity and detail to the cellular populations within the mouse cLV wall, and potential subsets within those broad cell types we performed scRNAseq on our isolated and cleaned inguinal axillary cLVs from male and female mice. The resulting UMAP projection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>) revealed a host of cell types which had 3 main clusters which corresponded to LECs, LMCs and AdvCs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We assessed the expression of genes that correspond to the markers from our earlier immunofluorescence staining as well as cell identification markers commonly used within the literature to identify each cell cluster (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Cell identity was confirmed by commonly used markers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) and the top differentially expressed genes (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">SuppFigure 3A</xref>).

Very few <italic>Kit</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>) expressing cells were observed in accordance with our imaging results. <italic>Pdgfrβ</italic> was observed in both LMC and AdvC clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>) while the remaining cell clusters were of immune origin as they expressed the gene encoding the hematopoietic marker <italic>CD45</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>).

<p>We next used optogenetic methods to test whether the cell populations recombined by either <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>, <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>, or <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> could elicit a coordinated contraction. The ChR2-tdTomato construct appeared more sensitive to recombination than ROSA26mTmG, in some cases resulting in LMC expression of ChR2-tdTomato in <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> and <italic>CkitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> popliteal cLVs based on morphology. Care was taken to image each vessel for tdTomato (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A,C,E</xref>) prior to stimulation at its respective sites under brightfield conditions for diameter tracking (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B,D,F</xref>) to ensure fidelity of the cell types and morphologies observed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. As with ROSA26mTmG, <italic>CkitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> drove the ChR2-tdTomato expression primarily in large ovoid cells found on the adventitia of the vessel. Cells were stimulated by positioning an optical laser fiber (tip diameter 2-3 mm) near a ChR2+ cell, with an illumination field of 10-50 mm. Localized photo-stimulation of these cells did not initiate coordinated contractions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8G-J,S</xref>). Similarly, photo-stimulation of ChR2-tdTomato expressing cells driven by <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> failed to initiate a coordinated contraction (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8K-N, T</xref>). In contrast, localized photo-stimulation of LMCs, using <italic>Myh11CreER</italic>T2 to express Chr2-tdTomato, resulted in a propagated contraction in the popliteal vessel (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8O-R, U</xref>). In total, only 3.25% of photo-stimulation events for <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2-TdTomato and 3.03% of photo-stimulation events for <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato were associated with a contraction, while 88.5% of photo-stimulation events for <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato induced contractions (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8V</xref>). The optogenetic triggering of contractions observed in <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato and <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2-TdTomato vessels is likely due to the happenstance of spontaneous contractions occurring during the time and proximity of optogenetic stimulation (see Methods). As a control, we also used non-induced (no tamoxifen) <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato cLVs and contractions were associated with only 7% of photo-stimulation events, in line with the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> and <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> results (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8V</xref>).

<p>Subcellular calcium transients are observed in many pacemaker cells. We imaged IALVs from <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMp6f mice, which primarily resulted in expression of GCaMp6f in the large ovoid cells in the adventitia (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>), although we occasionally observed GCaMP6f expression in both LEC and LMCs (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A</xref>) as depicted in the maximum projection of the acquisition period (Supplemental Movie 10) and the spatio-temporal maps (STMS). The aberrant expressions of GCaMP6f in cells that demonstrated the typical cobblestone morphology of LECs or the circumferential LMCs that exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> flashes and diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D,E</xref> green arrows) prior to contraction were not included in the <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMp6f analysis. Of 39 <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMp6f cells analyzed, only 1 <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f cell exhibited a spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient during the recording period (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9B,C</xref> Cell 7). However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient in that cell did not align temporally with the “Ca<sup>2+</sup> flash” of the LMC with incidental GCaMp6f expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C,D</xref>). Despite the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients under the baseline conditions throughout the IALV contraction cycle, many <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f cells exhibited a robust and prolonged Ca<sup>2+</sup> event in response to stimulation with the mast cell activator compound 48-80 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F, G, H</xref>). Notably, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in the ovoid cells elicited by administration of compound 48-80 did not acutely alter the LMC Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9I,J</xref>). Like <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMp6f, the majority of PDFRnCreER<italic><sup>TM</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f expressing cells also largely lacked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and resulted in incidental LMC GCaMP6f expression (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B</xref>, Supplemental Movie 11). Some cells exhibited high basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10A,D</xref>) sustained throughout the recording, but without oscillations (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B,C</xref>). In contrast, spurious GCaMP6f expression in a circumferentially oriented LMC displayed Ca<sup>2+</sup> flashes associated with contraction (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10B,C</xref>). Of the 21 PDGFRα-GCaMP6f cells assessed, only 3 exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that were singular events with limited spatial spread within the 20 sec imaging period (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10E,F</xref>). The lack of either global or consistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within either <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f or <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f IALVs was in stark contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f IALVs. <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> drove GCaMp6f expression in the circumferential LMCs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11A</xref>), which had global and nearly synchronous Ca<sup>2+</sup> flashes in 100% of the analyzed cells (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B, C</xref>). Additionally, non-synchronous stochastic and localized Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during diastole were commonly observed in the LMCs (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11D, E</xref>, Supplemental Movie 12). Many LMCs exhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during each diastolic period while other LMCs displayed few Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients or lacked diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients during the recording period (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11B</xref>). In aggregate, of the 39 <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-GCAMP6f cells only 1 displayed a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient during recording, 3 of 21 <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-GCaMP6f cells, while 20 of 43 LMCs displayed at least one diastolic transient apart from 43 of 43 LMCs with global flashes.</p>

<title>Pressure Dependency of Subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> Transients in LMCs</title>
<p>We next sought to test whether diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were pressure-dependent, given that cLVs exhibit pressure dependent chronotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>). GCaMP6f expressing LMCs were studied at intraluminal pressures of 0.5 -5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in the presence of nifedipine, which blocks the Ca<sup>2+</sup> flashes but not local Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12A</xref>). As intra-luminal pressure was increased, there was a marked increase in the occurrence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12B</xref>, Supplemental Movies 13-15). We converted these calcium transients into particles (PTCLs) for further analysis as previously described.

The maps show that as pressure increased, the activity of PTCLs across the vessel also increased (as evident by the increase in PTCL area activation). Across 11 experiments, the area of the field of view activated by PTCLs/frame increased from 73.2 ± 17.7 µM <sup>2</sup>/frame at 0.5 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 to 108.6 ± 20.5 µM <sup>2</sup>/frame at 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 and further enhanced to 139.2 ± 26.9 µM <sup>2</sup>/frame at 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12F</xref>).

<title>Contraction Frequency is Set by the Diastolic Depolarization Rate</title>
<p>To assess how pressure regulates LMC membrane potential we first recorded membrane potential in cells exhibiting action potentials (APs) using a microelectrode filled with biocytin-AF488 to label the cell. In each case (n=3 IALVs) the labeled cell were LMCs wrapping circumferential around the vessel (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A, B</xref>) and as these recordings were made over the course of many minutes the neighboring circumferential LMCs also exhibited fluorescence, albeit weaker in intensity, as expected (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13A</xref>). In all the recorded cells exhibiting APs, we noted a diastolic depolarization preceding the sharp upstroke achieved once threshold was met at each pressure (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13C</xref>). The AP frequency and rate of the diastolic depolarization increased with pressure (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13D, E</xref>). Linear regression of a plot of each AP frequency and diastolic depolarization rate at each pressure demonstrated a tight associated between the two parameters. However, we did not observe a significant effect of pressure on minimum membrane potential (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13G</xref>), threshold potential (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13H</xref>), the AP upstroke (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13I</xref>), AP peak potential (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13J</xref>), plateau potential (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13K</xref>), or the time spent over threshold (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure 13L</xref>).</p>

In this study we tested proposed pacemaker cell types based on 3 parameters: 1) that the pacemaker cells are located along the entire length of the cLV, to accommodate spontaneous contractions and coordinated electrical conduction despite progressive shortening of cLVs; 2) that depolarization of the pacemaker cell can drive a coordinated and propagated contraction of the vessel; and 3) that the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients precedes or coincides with contraction, as commonly observed in other pacemaker cells. We used confocal microscopy and a combination of immunofluorescence and fluorescent reporters under the control of various inducible Cres to identify and target both muscle and non-muscle cells, previously labeled as ICLCs, that coexpress the markers CD34 and PDGFRα. Our cell characterizations were supplemented by scRNAseq analysis of isolated and cleaned mouse IALVs which supported our finding of 3 major cell types including LECs, LMCs, and AdvCs each of which could be further sub-clustered into transcriptionally unique populations. From our initial fluorescence imaging studies, a role for intrinsic pacemaking by LMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">von der Weid et al., 2008</xref>), or by a novel population of CD34<sup>+</sup> lymphatic ICLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCloskey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>), also referred to as telocytes, were further examined and found to co-express <italic>Pdgfrα</italic>. We utilized <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> to further test whether these cells exhibited pacemaker capabilities. However, these Pdgfrα<sup>+</sup> cells had minimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity despite ongoing contractions and optogenetic stimulation of ChR2 in these cells failed to drive a spontaneous contraction. In contrast, photo-stimulation of LMCs expressing ChR2 elicited robust, propagated contractions with similar characteristics and propagation to spontaneous contractions in the same vessels. Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in LMCs revealed diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in diastole that increased in frequency and spatial spread as pressure was elevated. We also demonstrated that the primary component of the AP driving the frequency change with pressure is the diastolic depolarization, which we have previously reported to be dependent on Ano1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>) and IP3R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Zawieja et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, we recently reported that diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients are abrogated in IALVs from Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup>-Itpr1 inducible knockout mice, supporting a IP3R1-Ano1 axis as the pressure dependent pacemaker mechanism in LMCs. These results, in addition to the recent findings using targeted deletion of Cx45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>) or Cav1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">To et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Davis et al., 2022</xref>) in lymphatic muscle support the model of LMCs as the intrinsic pacemaker as has been previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Van Helden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Van Helden and Zhao, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Pacemaking in Smooth Muscle</title>
<p>In many smooth muscle organs, regulation of a coordinated contraction is a complex and multicellular phenomenon. Multiple cell types integrate physical and biological information into electrical activity to be transmitted to the force-producing smooth muscle cells, sometimes across great distances relative to cell size, to regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by voltage dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels required for contraction. The intestine is one such documented tissue in which cKit<sup>+</sup> ICCs and interstitial PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells form an electrical syncytium to regulate intestinal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Sanders et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Sanders et al., 2014</xref>). The pacemaking function of intestinal ICCs relies heavily on Ano1, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel, which is required for slow wave activity in the ICCs. Both cKit and Ano1 can be used as a marker for ICCs in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Hwang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Cobine et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Malysz et al., 2017</xref>), cKit<sup>+</sup> and vimentin<sup>+</sup> ICLCs have been observed in sheep lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">McCloskey et al., 2002</xref>), yet these cell populations did not form gap junctions with the smooth muscle to form electrical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>) as occurs in the intestinal ICCs. Our cKit staining and <italic>CkitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ROSA26mTmG reporter studies on mouse IALVs revealed a sparse population of large ovoid cells previously classified as mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Chatterjee and Gashev, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>). Their identity as mast cells was further supported by a sustained global Ca<sup>2+</sup> event after stimulation with the mast cell degranulating agent compound 48-80. However, both vimentin and CD34 showed robust staining throughout the mouse lymphatic vessel wall. Vimentin stained LECs, as well as non-muscle stellate shaped cells, with many co-expressing CD34, and other smaller circular cells some of which were cKit<sup>+</sup> as well and some whose morphology was similar to that of the macrophage staining profile of the GFP<sup>+</sup> cells in IALVs from MacGreen mice, consistent with previous reports of macrophage staining in cLVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Bridenbaugh et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Chakraborty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Zawieja et al., 2016</xref>). While vimentin<sup>+</sup> cells had a perinuclear staining profile, CD34 demarcated the cell membrane and was useful for assessing the morphology of these cells. Of particular interest, the vimentin<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> cells densely populated the length of the mouse IALV, with a majority displaying a flattened stellate morphology characterized by the classic rounded oak leaf appearance, although some displayed fine dendrite extensions. Contrasting with the previous findings in the human thoracic duct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>), we did not observe a significant population of CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with a bipolar morphology oriented axially along the vessel. However, z-stack reconstructions of sections of the mouse IALV that included the secondary valves revealed interstitial CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells that resembled the bipolar cells with multiple axon-like extensions throughout the endothelial leaflets similar to interstitial cells that were reported in in collecting vessel valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Leak and Burke, 1968</xref>) and lymphovenous valves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Geng et al., 2016</xref>). While these cells have not been frequently described in the peripheral cLV valves, we observed these cells in each of the valve regions imaged in addition to labeling them with other Cre drivers, including <italic>NG2Cre-ROSA26mTmG</italic> and <italic>PdgfrβCreER</italic><sup>T2</sup><italic>-ROSA26mTmG</italic> (data not shown). Whether these cells regulate leaflet extracellular matrix deposition or lymphatic valve integrity is unknown, but a role as a critical pacemaker can be excluded as vessel segments without valves display normal contractile behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Gashev et al., 2002</xref>). Instead, the majority of the CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells were found in the adventitia with 2-3 layers overtop the LMCs and were consistently observed in high density along the IALV. Some CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells or their extensions were present between the lymphatic endothelial and muscle layers as had been previously reported with electron microscopy of human lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>). Thus while some of these AdvCs may be contained within the extracellular matrix in the immediate vicinity of the lymphatic vessel, and thus collected during dissection, many others are intimately dispersed within the vessel wall.</p>

<title>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>CD34<sup>+</sup> Cells are Not Involved in cLV Pacemaking Under Physiological Conditions</title>
<p>Co-expression of CD34 and PDGFRα has recently been ascribed as a delineating feature of telocytes, although PDGFRα routinely labels fibroblasts and specific interstitial cells in the GI tract involved in purinergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Kurahashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kurahashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Clayton et al., 2022</xref>), and CD34 expression has been observed in multipotent cell populations of various origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Sidney et al., 2014</xref>). In the intestinal villi, PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts appear to be the progenitors of the smooth muscle fibers associated with the lacteal, the lymphatic capillary in the villi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Sanketi et al., 2024</xref>). Of course, mesenchymal stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Andrzejewska et al., 2019</xref>) and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Muhl et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Buechler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Forte et al., 2022</xref>), and it remains controversial to what extent telocytes are distinct from or are components/subtypes of either cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Clayton et al., 2022</xref>), are not monolithic in their expression patterns displaying both organ directed transcriptional patterns as well as intra-organ heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Lendahl et al., 2022</xref>) as readily demonstrated by recent single cell RNA sequencing studies that provided immense detail about the subtypes and activation spectrum within these cells and their plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Luo et al., 2022a</xref>). We were able to distinguish up to 10 subclusters of AdvCs, the majority of which expressed or co-expressed CD34 and PDGFRα. These cells were consistently negative for smooth muscle markers such as <italic>Des</italic>, <italic>Cnn1</italic>, <italic>Acta2</italic>, <italic>Myh11</italic> or the pericyte marker <italic>Mcam</italic>. However, PDGFRβ expression was noted in our scRNAseq and sorted <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic><sup>-</sup>ROSA26mTmG cells, in addition to the staining of LMCs. PDGFRβ protein expression was confirmed with variable immunofluorescence staining amongst the PDGFRα stained cells as well as LMCs. The <italic>PdgfrβCreER</italic><sup>T2</sup><italic>ROSA26mTmG</italic> mice had only modest recombination in both the LMC and PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cell population, but potentially highlighted a myofibroblast-like cell subpopulation, cells that might lie on the spectrum of differentiation from lymphatic muscle and PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells, or perhaps a cell with pacemaker activity as PDGFRβ is widely used as a pericyte marker and some pericytes display pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hashitani et al., 2015</xref>). Adding to this intrigue, the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> sorted cells expressed transcripts for <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, the voltage-gated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel critical for lymphatic contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Zawieja et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">To et al., 2020</xref>); <italic>Ano1</italic>, the ion channel underlying pressure dependent chronotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Mohanakumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>); and <italic>Cx45</italic>, the primary connexin mediating electrical conduction in mouse lymphatic collecting vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hald et al., 2018</xref>). Expression of these genes in certain sub-populations of the AdvCs was also apparent in our scRNAseq analysis. Thus, the presence of those gene transcripts does not appear to be due to muscle cell contamination or incidental recombination in LMCs as we did not detect LMC markers in the RT-PCR profiling of the sorted PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells nor were GFP-expressing cells with an LMC morphology observed in imaging of <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-ROSA26mTmG vessels. Critically, however, deletion of <italic>Cav1.2</italic>, <italic>Cx45</italic>, or <italic>Ano1</italic> through <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-mediated recombination neither recapitulated the previous phenotypes achieved with <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">To et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Davis et al., 2022</xref>) nor significantly affected pacemaking in mouse popliteal cLVs. This is in stark contrast to the complete lack of contractions observed in <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup>-Cav1.2 <sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">To et al., 2020</xref>) or the vessels from vascular muscle specific <italic>Itga8CreER<sup>T2</sup>-Cav1.2<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Davis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Warthi et al., 2022</xref>), and the significant loss in pressure-induced chronotropic modulation of pacemaker function in IALVs with <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-mediated deletion of Ano1 that we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>). While a sub-population of CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells may share expression of critical pacemaker genes identified in the LMCs, they do not appear to be involved in cLV pacemaking or contractile function under physiological states. Instead, CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells co-stained significantly with Sca1<sup>+</sup>, suggesting they may be primed to act as resident multipotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Kimura et al., 2021</xref>). To this point, the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> FACS purified cells also expressed markers associated with “stemness” such as <italic>CD34</italic>, <italic>Klf4</italic>, <italic>Gli1</italic>, <italic>CD29</italic>, <italic>CD105</italic>, <italic>CD44</italic>, and <italic>Vimentin</italic>, in addition to <italic>Sca1</italic>, and it is likely that the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> population includes various distinct subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Jolly et al., 2022</xref>) expressing these markers. These cells may play a role in rebuilding the lymphatic collecting vessel vasculature following collecting vessel damage or lymph node resection and further studies are required to assess their functional multipotency.</p>

<title>SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> Cycling in Pacemaking</title>
<p>The use of the mouse model, in addition to the simplicity of the vessel architecture, provided the use of genetic tools that previously had been instrumental in identifying the cKit<sup>+</sup> ICC as the pacemaker cells of the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Ward et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huizinga et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Torihashi et al., 1995</xref>). Through the use of the respective <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> and <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> models, we were able to specifically image Ca<sup>2+</sup> in each cell type in pressurized, contracting vessels. Pacemaking initiating cells have an inherently unstable membrane potential, oftentimes utilizing the oscillatory nature of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive electrogenic exchangers and ion channels to drive depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Hashitani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Baker et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Sanders et al., 2022</xref>). One such example is the pacemaker ICC in the gastric corpus which exhibits abundant Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients that couple to Ano1-mediated chloride currents in both the intervening period between slow waves as well as the plateau phase of the slow wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Baker et al., 2021a</xref>), although such activity is not characteristic of all pacemaker ICC types. The identification of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated chloride current in LMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Toland et al., 2000</xref>) and its correspondence with subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Ferrusi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">von der Weid et al., 2008</xref>) led Van Helden to postulate that LMCs had an intrinsic pacemaking capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Van Helden, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Van Helden et al., 1996</xref>). We have previously reported that mouse LMCs in pressurized vessels routinely display subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events that reflect the kinetics and characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs and waves in addition to the coordinated global Ca<sup>2+</sup> flash associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during an AP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Zawieja et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>). Here we confirmed the consistent presence of subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients only in LMCs with GCaMP6f driven by <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> but not in the cells with GCaMP6f driven by <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>. Critically, we also demonstrated that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients increased in both frequency and spatial spread as pressure was elevated in the vessel, as would be expected to account for the pressure dependent chronotropy observed in lymphatic collecting vessels. This underscores the recent finding that the genetic deletion of Ano1 in the LMCs dramatically reduced contraction frequency and abolished pressure-dependent chronotropy in those vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Zawieja et al., 2019</xref>). This phenotype was largely replicated with a similar reduction in frequency and loss of pressure dependent chronotropy in our recent study utilizing <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> to drive deletion of IP3R1 from LMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Zawieja et al., 2023</xref>) in which these diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were absent. This fits with the central role of IP3R and subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> release as critical components of intrinsic LMC pacemaking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Van Helden et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">von der Weid et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to the transcriptional heterogeneity identified by scRNASeq, we also noted heterogeneity in the propensity of LMCs to display diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients under control conditions or the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations that occur in the presence of nifedipine. We did not detect and significant difference in the expression of <italic>Itpr1</italic>, the gene encoding the IP3R1, across our LMCs subclusters. However, the LMC cluster “0” had significantly increased expression of <italic>Itprid2</italic> which encodes the KRas-induced actin-interacting protein (KRAP). KRAP has recently been implicated in IP3R1 immobilization and licensing and was required for IP3R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> puffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Thillaiappan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atakpa-Adaji et al., 2024</xref>). Whether the higher expression of KRAP results in a greater probability of these LMCs to display IP3R1-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in LMCs requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The membrane potential recordings we made in this work suggest that the regulation of pressure dependent chronotropy is through modulation of the diastolic depolarization rate in LMCs, as previously demonstrated in rat mesenteric lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Zawieja et al., 2018b</xref>). The appearance of the diastolic depolarization may depend on the method of stretch employed as it is not always observed in preparations using a wire myograph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">von der Weid et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, in this study <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> mediated deletion of Ano1 had no effect on contractile parameters. The lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells across any stage of the lymphatic contraction cycle diminishes any expected role for this cell type to perform as the pacemaker for the mouse IALV. In the pacemaker ICCs, slow wave activity is dependent on calcium transient clusters Instead pressure-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from the SR, through IP3R1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Zawieja et al., 2023</xref>), appears to set the basis for LMC pacemaking as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Van Helden, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">von der Weid et al., 2008</xref>). However, the mechanisms driving IP3R1 activation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations remain to be fully addressed.</p>
<p>A pacemaker cell would be expected to be electrically coupled to the LMC layer to permit the nearly synchronous conduction velocity of the contraction wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Zawieja et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hald et al., 2018</xref>) and to transmit depolarization into coupled LMCs to activate the voltage dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels that are responsible for lymphatic muscle APs. Connexins are the molecular constituents of gap junctions and, as stated above, we detected Cx45 expression in the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> sorted cells. However, we did not detect any impairment in pacemaking, nor were contraction conduction speed deficits or multiple pacemakers noted in the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> -Cx45fl/fl popliteal cLVs, in contrast to the development of multiple pacemaker sites and the lack of entrainment that characterize cLVs from <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-Cx45fl/fl mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>). Admittedly, we did not perform an exhaustive assessment of the connexin expression profile of the CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells, and Cx45 may not be the dominant connexin expressed in the CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells, or heterotypic connexons could exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Koval et al., 2014</xref>). However, electron microscopy studies of the putative ICLC in the human thoracic duct did not detect any gap junctions, although peg-and-socket connections were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>). We utilized optogenetics to directly depolarize the specific cell populations in both the <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> and <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> mouse models in an attempt to drive contractions. Local photo-stimulation of the PDGFRα cells failed to initiate contraction while the stimulation of <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> recombined cells resulted in contractions that were indistinguishable from the spontaneously occurring contractions. These results give functional credence to the lack of hetero-cellular coupling via gap junctions that was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Briggs Boedtkjer et al., 2013</xref>). Just as critically, they also highlight the regenerative nature of the lymphatic muscle AP as local depolarization was sufficient to drive a coordinated contraction along the vessel and that a single or few LMCs reaching threshold for AP initiation are sufficient to drive the conducted activity observed at the tissue level.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our present findings lend further support to the hypothesis that the LMCs are intrinsic pacemakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">van Helden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Mitsui and Hashitani, 2020</xref>) and mouse cLVs do not require an ICC-like cell network to drive propagated contractions. These findings also underscore the significance of lymphatic muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling as the driver of lymphatic pacemaking, which can be compromised in disease states leading to impaired lymphatic contractile activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Stolarz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Van et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies delineating the specific SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and influx pathways, and the contributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive ion channels are required to develop sophisticated in silico models and identify potential therapeutic targets to rescue lymphatic pacemaking in lymphedema patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Olszewski, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One fundamental assumption underlying our conclusions is that there is a conserved pacemaking pathway and cell type regulating lymphatic collecting vessel contractions across species, specifically pertaining to the capability of lymphatic muscle to maintain pacemaking and coordination despite changes in tissue complexity and cLV wall thickness. It is worth noting that lymphatic collecting vessels in mice have similar pressure-dependent chronotropy and contraction conduction velocity as recorded in rats and human vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>). These similarities exist despite the fact that mouse lymphatic collecting vessels are typically encircled by a single layer of lymphatic muscle while larger species may have multiple layers of LMCs in the wall. It is possible that vessels with multiple layers of LMCs need a network of ICLC to coordinate their activity. The simplicity in the makeup of the mouse cLV and the use of cell targeting Cre models provide great control over experimental variables, but other cell types may provide coordination of LMC pacemaking in other species where the lymphatic cLV walls are larger and thicker and contain multiple muscle cell layers. Our scRNAseq analysis also is likely biased using ROSAmTmG mice with FACS purification to remove debris and concentrate specific cell types from these pooled small vessels. Larger and more complex cells, with attributes that can be ascribed to ICCs, are more likely to be lost in this methodology (e.g.., depending on the FACS gating parameters) and this procedure can also elicit a stress response in the transcriptome of the analyzed cells. However, we also did not observe long and complex cells, aside from the circumferential LMCs, in our immunofluorescence and recombination reporter imaging experiments. Immediate and early gene expression motifs driven by a stress response may be a component of the differences in sub-clusters that were identified. Future scRNAseq or snRNAseq studies with deeper sequencing will be required to ensure the full transcriptomic heterogeneity is accounted under different cellular stress conditions.</p>
<p>Our data demonstrate that limited staining of a few cell markers alone is insufficient to identify discrete cell populations in the mouse cLVs. Additionally, mRNA expression does not equal protein translation nor guarantee specific function as we did not readily detect endothelial CD34 with immunofluorescence despite detecting transcript; additionally, <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> mediated deletion of Ano1, Cx45, or Cav1.2 had no effect on cLV pacemaking. Hence, further experimentation is also required to fully characterize expression of multipotent cell markers and function of CD34<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells invested within the mouse cLVs, although this was beyond the scope of this study assessing pacemaker identity. Tangentially, another limitation of our approach pertains to the specificity and recombination efficiency of inducible Cre recombinase models, which can be a notable confounding variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>). We observed that our inducible Cre models led to a degree of nonspecific recombination within the mouse cLV, with the GCaMP6f and ChR2 particularly susceptible to recombination compared to the ROSA26mT/mG reporter. Recombination in multiple cell types was expected with the constitutive Cre models we employed (<italic>Ng2Cre</italic> and <italic>PdgfrαCre</italic>), as vascular and lymphatic muscle precursor cells can transiently express <italic>Nestin</italic>, <italic>Pdgfrα</italic>, and <italic>Ng2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Hill et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Kenney et al., 2020</xref>). We also observed that <italic>PdgfrβCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic> drove recombination in a sub population of LMCs and PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells. These appeared to be two distinct populations that only share expression for PDGFRβ based on our scRNAseq dataset but may exist along a continuum of differentiation. PDGFB-PDGFRβ signaling is critical for normal mural cell recruitment to both the blood and lymphatic vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Gaengel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes have both been documented to express PDGFRβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andrae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Pitulescu and Adams, 2014</xref>). Ideally, novel Cre or combinatorial Cre models that specifically target LMCs or sub populations of LMCs may be developed to further tease out the functional role of these cells.</p>

<title>Lymphatic Vessel Isolation</title>
<p>We utilized both popliteal and inguinal-axillary lymphatic collecting vessels (IALVs) in this study, which were isolated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Zawieja et al., 2018a</xref>). In brief, mice were anaesthetized with a cocktail of 100/10 mg/mL ketamine/xylazine and shaved along the flank or the legs for IALVs and popliteal cLVs respectively. The IALV (also referred to as the flank cLV) is located adjacent to the thoracoepigastric vein and connects the inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. A cut was made along the dorsal midline and the skin retracted and pinned out to reveal the thoracoepigastric vascular bed. The thoracoepigastric vascular bed and connected perivascular adipose containing the IALVs vessel was dissected out and pinned onto a Sylgard coated dish in Krebs buffer. Popliteal lymphatic vessels were exposed through a superficial incision in the leg, removed and transferred to the Krebs-albumin filled dissection chamber. After removal, the vessel was carefully cleaned of adipocytes and excess matrix using fine forceps and scissors through micro-dissection. For immunofluorescence, sections containing 2-3 valves were isolated, while smaller IALV sections consisting of 1-2 valves were isolated for GCaMP6f Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging. Similarly, popliteal cLVs were isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018a</xref>) following an incision along the skin overlying the saphenous vein for contractile function analysis and for ChR2 optogenetic depolarization experiments.</p>

<title>Methylene Blue Staining</title>
<p>Isolated IALVs sections were transferred into a Krebs-BSA buffer filled 3-mL observation chamber, with a cover slip bottom, and cannulated onto two glass micropipettes (30-80 μm, outer diameter) held in place by pipette holders on a Burg-style V-track mounting system. The pipette holders were attached to a 3-way valve stop cock with polyethylene tubing filled with Krebs-BSA buffer. Vessels were pressurized to approximately 5 cmH2O by raising the 3-way valve and the vessels were stretched to remove any slack. For methylene blue staining, IALVs from wild type C57Bl6 mice were stained with 50 μM methylene blue in Krebs-BSA buffer for two hours at room temperature and covered in foil to limit light-induced phototoxicity. After the staining period, the vessel chambers were washed three times with Ca<sup>2+</sup> free PSS to remove methylene blue. Brightfield images and manual Z-stack videos were collected on an inverted Leica DMi1 4X or 20X air objective, or a Leica DMi8 with a 25X water objective or an inverted DMi8 using a Leica Flexacam C1 color camera for image acquisition. Some Methylene blue images were also collected using a color Nikon DS-Fi3 camera. The collected z-stacks were analyzed using Image J and the “Stack Focuser” plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/stack-focuser.html">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/stack-focuser.html</ext-link>). To accentuate the methylene blue stained cells, the color image stack was split into red, green, and blue channel stacks. The blue channel stack was then divided by the green channel stack using the “Image Calculator” function. The resulting 32-bit image was then converted into 16-bit image to permit the use of the Stack Focuser plugin with the ‘n kernel value’ set to 11.</p>

<title>Fluorescence Confocal Imaging</title>
<p>IALVs vessels from each respective iCre-ROSA26mT/mG mouse were prepared in a similar manner (excluding the addition of methylene blue). We performed confocal imaging to acquire z-stacks of 7-10 overlapping regions of interests to allow for manual stitching, with 1 μM z-steps (20Χ) or 0.5 μM steps at 40X. We imaged through to the midpoint of the vessel except when imaging the valve interstitial cells, in which case the entire vessel was imaged. Max projections were made using FIJI. Following live imaging, the vessels were pressurized to 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. IALVs were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) 3 times and blocked for a minimum of 2 hr with Blockaid® (B-10710, ThermoFisher Scientific). IALVs were then stained with the corresponding primary antibodies in BlockAid® Solution: anti-smooth muscle actin (SMA) 1:500 (Sigma, A2547), anti-GFP 1:200 (ThermoFisher, A11122), anti-cKit 1:100 (Cell Signaling, 3074), anti-Vimentin 1:100 (Thermofisher, OMA1-06001), anti-desmin 1:200 (Invitrogen, PA5-16705), anti-GFP 1:200 (Abcam, ab13970, anti-CD34 1:200 (Invitrogen, 14-0341-82), anti-PDGFRΑ 1:200 (R&amp;DSystems, AF1062), anti-PDGFRβ 1:200 (eBiosciences, 14-1402-82), anti-calponin 1:500 (Abcam, AB46794), anti-MYH11 1:500 (Abcam, AB124679), anti-Sca1 1:200 (Biolegend, 108101). IALVs were then washed in PBS and incubated overnight with the corresponding donkey secondary antibodies (ThermoFisher®) at 1:200. After a final wash, IALVs were re-cannulated and pressurized for imaging using the aforementioned spinning disk confocal and Hamamatsu Orca Flash4 camera using a 20X air objective (Olympus UplanApo, 0.75) or 40X (Olympus UApo A340, 1.15) water objective.

Isolated vessels were then transferred into a low Ca<sup>2+</sup> PSS solution supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA, Amersham Life Science, Arlington Heights, IL). Primary LMCs were collected by enzymatic dissociation of IALVs. The dissected vessels were cleaned in room temperature Krebs-BSA buffer and then transferred into a 1-mL tube of low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> PSS on ice, washed, and equilibrated for 10 min. Vessels were then digested in low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> PSS with 26 U/mL papain (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 1 mg/mL dithioerythritol for 30 min at 37°C with gentle agitation every few minutes.

The mixture was then spun down at 1000 rpm for 4 min, the digestion buffer removed, and replaced with low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> PS. This process was repeated twice to remove residual digestion buffer. The vessel was then triturated with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette to dissociate the cells into a single cell suspension, passed through a Falcon cap strainer (35 μm), and resuspended in ice-cold low-Ca<sup>2+</sup> PSS for sorting.

PTCLs &lt;10 µM<sup>2</sup> were rejected to facilitate the removal of noise and then the total PTCL area and PTCL count could be tabulated for each recording.</p>

<title>Membrane Potential Recordings in IALVs</title>
<p>Mouse IALVs were isolated and cleaned as described above. IALVs were pressurized in our isobaric myography apparatus and allowed to equilibrate to ensure typical contractile activity was evident. A bolus of wortmannin at 2 µM was then applied to the bath to blunt contraction amplitude below 5 microns. Intracellular recordings of lymphatic muscle were made with microelectrodes (250–300 MΩ) filled with 1 M KCl and an SEC-05x amplifier (NPI) connected to a Grass S48 stimulator, viewed with a Tektronix TDS3052 digital oscilloscope. Membrane potential and diameter were simultaneously recorded using a custom Labview program. Membrane potential and APS were allowed to stabilize and then pressure was slowly raised from 0.5 cmH2O to 2 cmH2O and then 5cmH<sub>2</sub>O. In some cases, the electrode dislodged due to the intrinsic contractions of the vessel or wall displacement as pressure was modulated. In these situations, we attempted to re-impale the cell or one of the neighboring cells. Only vessels in which a recording with a minimum of 3 stable APs was successfully made at 2 of the 3 experimental pressures were used for subsequent analysis.</p>
<p>We also confirmed LMC impalement using microelectrode filled with 1 M KCl and (100 µg/ml) Biocytin-AF488 (A12924, ThermoFisher) to label impaled cells that displayed APs, over a 10-minute recording period. Following the impalement and loading with Biocytin-AF488 the vessel was transferred to our imaging apparatus for confocal imaging and 3D reconstruction using the Andor Dragonfly 200 and IMARIS. Image stacks were taken with a 25x water objective at 0.5-micron intervals throughout the diameter of the vessel.</p>

<title>Light Activation of ChR2 to stimulate Popliteal Collecting Lymphatic Vessel Contractions</title>
<p>As the IALV has a nearly continuous contractile cycle, we utilized the popliteal vessel for its much slower contraction frequency in the experiments testing our ability to trigger a propagated contraction upon stimulation of the enforced expression of ChR2. Popliteal vessels were isolated from <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2/tdTomato, <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic> -ChR2/tdTomato, or <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2/tdTomato mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Scallan and Davis, 2013</xref>), although we intentionally retained some connective tissue and adipose tissue to ensure we had a sufficient population of recombined cells to test in the adventitia layer of the vessel. Contractions were allowed to stabilize over a 30-min equilibration period with pressure set to 3 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. If basal contraction frequency was too high, we applied pinacidil to the bath in 100 nM increments, without exceeding 600 nM, to further slow contraction frequency to around 6 contractions per minute. Pinacidil at sub 1 µM doses can slow contraction frequency without causing overt hyperpolarization of membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Davis et al., 2020</xref>). Supplemental 100 nM doses of pinacidil were applied throughout the experiment to maintain a spontaneous contraction frequency below 6 per minute to allow ample diastolic time for ChR2 stimulation. Throughout this protocol the popliteal was allowed to contract spontaneously to ensure we had not overly inhibited APs by the pacemaking cells with pinacidil. Occasionally, spontaneous contractions occurred just prior to light-evoked contractions, resulting in a potential false positive, so we performed multiple stimulations over a period of 5 - 10 min, typically waiting at least 3 s after any spontaneous contraction before stimulating. Care was made to align the light fiber in such a way that only part of the vessel would be directly illuminated and so target cells of interest would be directly activated by 473 nm light using a Laser diode (Doric LD Fiber Light Source, Quebec, Canada), through an optical probe with a 10-µm tip (Doric, OPT_200_0.22.010). To further limit the excitation field, the optical probe was coated with black acrylic paint using an eyelash brush so that the uncoated opening was ∼2-3 µm. With the probe positioned within 5 µm of one side of the vessel wall, the spread of light covered an area ∼10-100 µm wide on the back side of the vessel (depending on the diode amplitude setting). Light pulses, 200 ms in length, were triggered by a Grass S9 stimulator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) connected to the external TTL input of the laser diode. Pulse amplitude was adjusted between 40-90 mA using the Laser Diode Module Driver (Doric). A contraction was considered to be triggered if it occurred within 50ms of stimulation. We performed photo-stimulation from 2-4 sites within each vessel, with 6-14 stimulations per site. If a photo-stimulation was triggered incidentally after the initiation of a “spontaneous contraction” it was discarded from the analysis. For <italic>Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato 6 vessels from 3 separate mice were tested. For <italic>PdgfrαCreER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato 6 vessels from 4 separate mice were tested with a max of two vessels per mouse. For <italic>cKitCreER<sup>T2</sup></italic>-ChR2-tdTomato 7 vessels from 3 separate mice were assessed. Diameter was recorded to align photo-activation with the contraction cycle in a custom Labview program.</p>

Data from cLVs in which a negative tone value was recorded at any pressure, which typically indicated incomplete passivation or bubbles in the cannula, were not included in the tone analysis. Vessels that failed to contract at a given pressure had no value recorded for ejection fraction or normalized amplitude and REML mixed effects model was used in place of repeated measures 2-way ANOVA. We used a categorical Chi-squared statistical test for the experiments assessing our ability to trigger a contraction with activation of ChR2+ cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup> particle area and frequency was compared using 1-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. Significance was determined at a p value of &lt; 0.05.

<p>This manuscript aims to identify the pacemaker cells in the lymphatic collecting vessels - the cells that initiate the autonomous action potentials and contractions needed to drive lymphatic pumping. Through the exemplary use of existing approaches (genetic deletions and cytosolic calcium detection in multiple cell types), the authors <bold>convincingly</bold> determine that lymphatic muscle cells are the origin of the action potential that triggers lymphatic contraction. The inclusion of scRNAseq and membrane potential data enhances a tremendous study. This <bold>fundamental</bold> discovery establishes a new standard for the field of lymphatic physiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the multiple cell types present in the wall of murine collecting lymphatic vessels with the goal of identifying cells that initiate the autonomous action potentials and contractions needed to drive lymphatic pumping. Through the use of genetic models to delete individual genes or detect cytosolic calcium in specific cell types, the authors convincingly determine that lymphatic muscle cells are the origin of the action potential that triggers lymphatic contraction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are rigorously performed, the data justify the conclusions and the limitations of the study are appropriately discussed.</p>
<p>There is a need to identify therapeutic targets to improve lymphatic contraction and this work helps identify lymphatic muscle cells as potential cellular targets for intervention.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a well written manuscript describing studies directed at identifying the cell type responsible for pacemaking in murine collecting lymphatics. Using state-of-the-art approaches, the authors identified a number of different cell types in the wall of these lymphatics and then using targeted expression of Channel Rhodopsin and GCaMP, the authors convincingly demonstrate that only activation of lymphatic muscle cells produces coordinated lymphatic contraction and that only lymphatic muscle cells display pressure-dependent Ca2+ transients as would be expected of a pacemaker in these lymphatics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of targeted expression of channel rhodopsin and GCaMP to test the hypothesis that lymphatic muscle cells serve as the pacemakers in musing lymphatic collecting vessels.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only significant weakness was the lack of quantitative analysis of most of the imaging data shown in Figures 1-11. In particular, the colonization analysis should be extended to show cells not expected to demonstrate colocalization as a negative control for the colocalization analysis that the authors present. These weaknesses have been resolved by revision and addition of new and novel RNAseq data, additional colocalization data and membrane potential measurements.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zawieja et al. aimed to identify the pacemaker cells in the lymphatic collecting vessels. Authors have used various Cre-based expression systems and optogentic tools to identify these cells. Their findings suggest these cells are lymphatic muscle cells that drive the pacemaker activity in the lymphatic collecting vessels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have used multiple approaches to test their hypothesis. Some findings are presented as qualitative images, while some quantitative measurements are provided.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- More quantitative measurements.</p>
<p>
- Possible mechanisms associated with the pacemaker activity.</p>
<p>
- Membrane potential measurements.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have answered my comments with additional experiments, data and manuscript edits.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript explores the multiple cell types present in the wall of murine-collecting lymphatic vessels with the goal of identifying cells that initiate the autonomous action potentials and contractions needed to drive lymphatic pumping. Through the use of genetic models to delete individual genes or detect cytosolic calcium in specific cell types, the authors convincingly determine that lymphatic muscle cells are the origin of the action potential that triggers lymphatic contraction.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments are rigorously performed, the data justify the conclusions, and the limitations of the study are appropriately discussed.</p>
<p>There is a need to identify therapeutic targets to improve lymphatic contraction and this work helps identify lymphatic muscle cells as potential cellular targets for intervention.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>My only major comment would be that the manuscript provides a lot of rich information describing the cellular components of the muscular lymphatic vessel wall and that these data are not well represented by the title. The title (while currently accurate) could be tweaked to better represent all that is in this manuscript. Maybe something like</p>
<p>&quot;Characterization/Interrogation of the cellular components of murine collecting lymphatic vessels reveals that lymphatic muscle cells are the innate pacemaker cells regulating lymphatic contractions&quot; or &quot;Discovery/Confirmation of lymphatic muscle cells as innate pacemaker cells of lymphatic contraction through characterization of the cellular components of murine collecting lymphatic vessels&quot;. Potentially a cartoon summary figure of the components that make up the collecting lymphatic vessel wall could also be included. In my opinion, these changes will make this manuscript of more interest to a broader group of scientists. I have a few additional comments for consideration to improve the clarity and enhance the discussion of this work.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer that our original manuscript, and our resubmission even more so with the addition of the scRNAseq data, provides a significant amount of information regarding the composition of the lymphatic collecting vessel wall. We have changed our title to match one suggestion of the reviewer: “Characterization of the cellular components of murine collecting lymphatic vessels reveals that lymphatic muscle cells are the innate pacemaker cells regulating lymphatic contractions&quot;.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a well-written manuscript describing studies directed at identifying the cell type responsible for pacemaking in murine-collecting lymphatics. Using state-of-the-art approaches, the authors identified a number of different cell types in the wall of these lymphatics and then using targeted expression of Channel Rhodopsin and GCaMP, the authors convincingly demonstrate that only activation of lymphatic muscle cells produces coordinated lymphatic contraction and that only lymphatic muscle cells display pressure-dependent Ca2+ transients as would be expected of a pacemaker in these lymphatics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of a targeted expression of channel rhodopsin and GCaMP to test the hypothesis that lymphatic muscle cells serve as the pacemakers in musing lymphatic collecting vessels.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The only significant weakness was the lack of quantitative analysis of most of the imaging data shown in Figures 1-11. In particular, the colonization analysis should be extended to show cells not expected to demonstrate colocalization as a negative control for the colocalization analysis that the authors present.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern regarding the lack of a control for the colocalization analysis and that the colocalization analysis was limited to just one set of cell markers. We have now provided a colocalization analysis of Myh11 and PDGFRα, to serve as a co-localization negative control based on our RT-PCR and scRNASeq findings, which is incorporated into the current Supplemental figure 1. In regard to the staining pattern of other various marker combinations, the results were often quite clear with the representative images that two separate cell populations were being stained such as the case with labeling endothelial cells with CD31, macrophage labeling with the MacGreen mice, or hematopoietic cells with CD45.</p>
<p>During our lengthy rebuttal process we completed a single cell RNA sequence analysis using our isolated and cleaned mouse inguinal axillary lymphatic collecting vessels to aid in our characterization of the vessel wall and to more thoroughly answer these questions regarding colocalization in arguably a robust manner. The generation of our scRNAseq dataset, derived from isolated and cleaned mouse inguinal axillary collecting vessels from 10 mice, 5 male and 5 females, allowed us to profile over 2200 of the adventitial fibroblast like cells (AdvCs) we had identified in our original submission. Using this dataset, we were able to confirm co-expression of Cd34 and Pdgfrα in AdvCs and assess the co-expression of other genes of interest from our RT-PCR experiments and immunofluorescence experiments. This approach will also allow other lymphatic investigators to assess their genes of interest as our dataset is uploaded to the NIH Gene Omnibus and will be uploaded to the Broad Institute Single Cell Portal upon publication.</p>
<p>Here we show that the vast majority of non-muscle fibroblast like cells referred to as AdvCs were double positive for both CD34 and PDGFRα. We also show that the AdvCs that express commonly used pericyte markers Pdgfrb and Cspg4 also co-expressed Pdgfrα. Critically, this data also shows that the AdvCs that express genes linked with lymphatic contractile dysfunction (Ano1, Gjc1 or connexin 45, and Cacna1c “Cav1.2”) co-express Pdgfrα and would render these genes susceptible to Cre-mediated recombination using our Pdgfrα-CreER<sup>TM</sup> model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zawieja et al. aimed to identify the pacemaker cells in the lymphatic collecting vessels. Authors have used various Cre-based expression systems and optogenetic tools to identify these cells. Their findings suggest these cells are lymphatic muscle cells that drive the pacemaker activity in the lymphatic collecting vessels.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors have used multiple approaches to test their hypothesis. Some findings are presented as qualitative images, while some quantitative measurements are provided.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>-  More quantitative measurements.</p>
<p>-  Possible mechanisms associated with the pacemaker activity.</p>
<p>-  Membrane potential measurements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their concerns and have addressed them in the following manner.</p>
<p>- We added novel single cell RNA sequencing of isolated and cleaned inguinal axillary vessels from 10 mice (5 males and 5 females). This allowed us to quantify the number of AdvCs that coexpress CD34 and Pdgfrα as well as the number of cells co-expressing Pdgfrα and other markers.</p>
<p>- We have added a negative control with quantification for the co-localization analysis assessing Myh11 and Pdgfrα. We have added a negative control with quantification for the ChR2-photo stimulated contraction experiments using Myh11CreERT2-ChR2 mice that were not injected with tamoxifen.</p>
<p>- We also used Biocytin-AF488 in our intracellular Vm electrodes to map the specific cells in which we recorded action potentials and in neighboring cells since Biocytin-AF488 is under 1KDa and can pass through gap junctions. This approach independently labeled lymphatic muscle cells and their direct neighbors for 3 IALVs from 3 separate mice.</p>
<p>- We performed membrane potential recordings in isolated, pressurized (under isobaric conditions), and spontaneously contracting inguinal axillary lymphatic collecting vessels at different pressures.</p>
<p>- We also show that the pressure-frequency relationship is dependent on the slope of the diastolic depolarization as no other parameter was significantly altered in our study and the diastolic depolarization slope was highly correlated with contraction frequency.</p>
<p>We believe the addition of these novel data, controls, experiments, and quantifications have improved the manuscript in line with the reviewers’ suggestions.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Lines 149-162: The authors rule out the methylene blue staining cells in the cLV wall as pacemakers because they don't form continuous longitudinal connections to drive propagation. Is it possible for a pacemaker cell to only initiate the contraction and then have the LMCs make the axial electrical connections to propagate the electrical wave? I am not trying to suggest the methylene blue cells are pacemakers, but I am not sure the lack of longitudinal (or radial) connectivity is sufficient evidence to rule out the possibility. This comment also is relevant to the 3 criteria for a pacemaker cell listed in the Discussion (Lines 413-417).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s broader point that a pacemaker cell may not require direct contact with other ‘pacemaker’ cells within the tissue as long as they are still within the same electrical syncytium. However, we do expect a continuous presence of a pacemaker cell type throughout the vessel wall length to account for the persistence of spontaneous contractile behavior despite vessel length, and the ability for contraction initiation to shift (Akl et al 2011, Castorena et al 2018 and Castorena et al 2022) and the occurrence of spontaneous action potentials. In Dirk van Helden’s seminal work in 1993 on lymphatic pacemaking, a major finding was that “SM of small lymphangions or that of short segments, cut from lymphangions of any length, behaved similarly”. We have adjusted our phrase regarding the requirement of a contiguous network and instead suggest a continuous presence along the vessel network and integrated into the electrical syncytium.</p>
<p>Methylene blue is an alkaline stain that will stain acidic structures and historically methylene blue is noted to stain Interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract which typically exist as network of cells(Huizinga et al 1993 and Berezin 1988). No such network was readily apparent in our methylene blue staining nor did the stained cells have a similar morphology to the ICCs of the gastrointestinal tract. Further, methylene blue is staining is not limited to ICCs or pacemaker cells at large as it has been used to kill cancer cells. Within the small intestine methylene blue was noted to also stain macrophage like cells (Mikkelsen et al 1988), and we too draw parallels between the macrophage morphology observed with Macgreen mice and methylene-blue stained cells. The specific structure for the ICC affinity for methylene blue is not well described and while the innate cytotoxicity of methylene blue and light has been used to kill ICCs and impair slow wave generation, the lack of specificity of this method leaves much to be desired. What is clear is that the ICC network highlighted by methylene blue in the gut is absent in lymphatic collecting vessels.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 15/Video12, is it possible that the cells that are showing intracellular Ca2+ in diastole are the cells that reach a threshold membrane potential that then trigger the rest of the LMCs? As the authors have shown heterogeneity in the LMCs surface markers, is it possible that the cells with Ca2+ activity during diastole are identifiable by a distinct molecular phenotype? Or is the thought that these cells are randomly active in diastole? Some discussion/speculation about this seems appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are in agreement with the reviewer’s conclusion that there is heterogeneity in the LMCs as it pertains to the calcium oscillations in diastole, either under normal buffer conditions or when L-type channels are inhibited with nifedipine. We also note significant heterogeneity in the gene expression noted within the four LMC subclusters (0-3), though we did not see significant differences in either in Ip3R1 or Ano1 expression. However, subcluster “0” had increased expression of Itprid2, also known as KRas-induced actin-interacting protein (KRAP) which is thought to tether, and thus immobilize, IP3 receptors to the actin cortex beneath the cell membrane. KRAP has been recently proposed to be a critical player in IP3 receptor “licensing” which allows IP3 receptors to release calcium (Vorontsova et al., 2022).  However, whether similar requirement of IP3R licensing is necessitated in all cells or specifically in LMCs is unknown it is quite clear there are specific release sites within the cell and this topic is currently under further investigation for a separate manuscript. We would like to note that there is yet to be a clear consensus on whether IP3R licensing is required as much of these studies are performed in cultured cells and this mechanism has only recently been described.</p>
<p>Healthy lymphatic collecting vessels typically have a single pacemaker driving a coordinated propagated contraction in ex vivo isobaric myograph studies (Castorena-Gonzalez et al., 2018), which is typically at either end of the cannulated vessel. We believe that this is due to the lack of a bordering cell in one direction and allows charge to accumulate and voltage to reach threshold at these sites preferentially. We have tried to image calcium at the pacemaking pole of the vessel to observe the specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients at these sites though invariably the act of imaging GCaMP6f results in the pacemaker activity initiating from the other pole of the vessel. It is our opinion that the fact that LMCs are heterogenous in their Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients is a feature to the system as it permits a wider range of depolarization signals, and thus allows finer control of the pacing as different physical/pressure or signaling stimuli is encountered. Likely, the cells with the higher propensity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients act as the contraction initiation site <italic>in vivo</italic>, though it must also be noted that the LMC density decreases around lymphatic valve sites. In fact, in guinea pig collecting vessels there are very few LMCs at the valves which can render them electrically uncoupled or poorly coupled (Van Helden, 1993). Thus, valve sites in which there is greater electrical resistance due to lower LMC-LMC coupling may allow for charge accumulation in the LMCs at the valve site, similar to the artificial condition achieved in our myograph preparations with two cut ends, and allow them to reach threshold first and drive coordination at the valve sties.</p>
<p>An additional description of what the PTCL analysis is meant to represent physiologically would be helpful for readers.</p>
<p>We have better described the conversion of the calcium signals into “particles” for analysis at first mention in the methods and results section and have included the requisite reference to this specific methodology in Line 429-30.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A description of how DMAX is experimentally determined is needed.</p>

<p>We have adjusted our methods section to describe DMAX in line 774-775.</p>
<p>“with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free Krebs buffer (3mM EGTA) and diameter at each pressure recorded under passive conditions (DMAX).”</p>

<p>I think the vessels referred to as popliteal lymphatic vessels are actually saphenous lymphatic vessels (afferent to the popliteal lymph node). Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Indeed, some of the vessels used in this study are the afferents to the single popliteal node. They travel with the caudal branch of the saphenous vein, but have routinely been described as popliteal vessels, as opposed to saphenous lymphatic vessels, by the lymphatic field at large (Tilney 1971 PMCID: PMC1270981, Liao 2015 PMID: 25512945). To move away from this nomenclature would likely add to confusion although we agree that the lymphatic field may need to improve or correct the vessel naming paradigm to match the vascular pairs they follow.</p>

<p>We understand the reviewer’s sentiment and agree. We have now added a “negative control” colocalization staining and analysis for PDGFR and Myh11 which has been added to the current SuppFigure 1. We stained 3 IALVs from 3 separate mice with PDGFRα and Myh11 and performed confocal microscopy. We ran the FIJI BIOP-JACOP colocalization plugin as before and observed very little colocalization of the two signals.

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript from Zawieja et al. explored an interesting hypothesis about the pacemaker cells in lymphatic collecting vessels. Many aspects of lymphatic collecting vessels are still under investigation; hence this work provides timely knowledge about the lymphatic muscle cells as a pacemaker. Although it is an important topic of the investigation, the data provided do not support the overall goal of the manuscript. Many figures (Figure 1-5) provide quantitative estimation and the description provided in the results section might only be useful for a restricted audience, but not to the broader audience. Some of the figures are very condensed with multiple imaging panels and it is hard to follow the differences in qualitative analysis. Overall, this manuscript can be improved by more streamlined description/writing and figure arrangements (some of the figures/panels can be moved to the supplementary figures).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We disagree with the notion that the original data provided did not support the goal of the manuscript- to identify and test putative pacemaker cell types. Nonetheless we believe we have also added ample novel data to the manuscript, including membrane potential recordings and scRNAseq to highlight and to add further support to our conclusion that the pacemaker cell is an LMC. We believe the scRNAseq data will also greatly enhance the appeal of the manuscript to a broader audience and have renamed the manuscript in line with the wealth of data we have collected on the components of the vessel wall as we tested for putative pacemaker cells.</p>
<p>As requested, we have moved many figures to the supplement to allow readers to focus more on the more critical experiments.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A few other points that need to be addressed:</p>
<p>(1) Authors used immunofluorescence-based differences in various cell types in the collecting vessels. Initially, they chose ICLC, pericytes, and lymphatic muscle cells. But then they started following adventitial cells and endothelial cells. It is not clear from the description, why these other cells could be possibly involved in the pacemaker activity. It will be easier to follow if authors provide a graphical abstract or summary figure about their hypothesis and what is known from their and others' work.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to clarify that we used the endothelial cells as controls to ensure what we observed via immunofluorescence and FACs RT-PCR were a separate cell type from either lymphatic muscle or lymphatic endothelial cells on the vessel wall. Staining for the endothelium also allowed us to assess where these PDGFRα+CD34+ cells reside in the vessel wall.  We started with a wide range of markers that are conventionally used for targeting specific cell types, but as expected those markers are not always 100% specific. Specifically, we focused on CD34, Kit, and Vimentin as those were the markers for the non-muscle cells observed in the lymphatic collecting vessel wall previously. What we found was that CD34 and PDGFRα labeled the same cell type. As there was not a CD34Cre mouse available at the time we instead utilized the inducible PDGFRαCreERTM. We are unsure how well an abstract figure will condense the conclusions from the experiments listed here but if absolutely required for publication we can attempt to highlight the representative cell populations identified on the vessel wall.</p>

<p>(2) Authors used many acronyms in the manuscript without defining them (when they appeared for the first time). Please follow the convention.</p>

<p>(3) How specific PDGFR-alpha as a marker of the pericytes? It can also label the mesenchymal cells. Why did the author choose PDGFR-alpha over beta for their Cre-based expression approach?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We tried to assess if there were a pericyte like cell present in or along the wall using PDGFRbeta (Pdgfrβ). Pdgfrβ is commonly used to identify pericytes (Winkler et al., 2010), while in contrast Pdgfrα is a known fibroblast marker (Lendahl et al., 2022). Pdgfrβ CreERT2 resulted in recombination in both LMCs and AdvCs, preventing it from being a discriminating marker for our study where as Myh11CreER<sup>T2</sup> and PDGFRαCreER<sup>TM</sup> were specific at least to cell type based on our FACSs-RT-PCR and staining. As you can tell from the scRNAseq data in Figure 5, there was no cell cluster that Pdgfrβ was specific for in contrast to PDGFRα and Myh11.  In Figure 6 we show the expression of another commonly used pericyte marker NG2 (Cspg4) in our scRNAseq dataset which was observed in both LMCs and AdvCs as well. Lastly, MCAM (Figure 6) can also be a marker for pericytes though we see only expression in the LMCs and LECs for this marker. Notably, almost all of the AdvCs express PDGFRα rendering the PDGFRαCreER<sup>TM</sup> a powerful tool to study this population of cells on the vessel wall including those that were PDGFRα+Cspg4+ or PDGFRα+ Pdgfrβ+.</p>
<p>We were reliant on PDGFRαCreER<sup>TM</sup> as that was the only available PDGFRα Cre model at the time. Note we used PdgfrβCreER<sup>T2</sup> and Ng2Cre in our study but found that both Cre models recombined both LMCs and AdvCs.</p>

<p>(6) What are the resting membrane potentials of Lymphatic muscle cells? The authors should provide some details about this in the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and have added membrane potential recordings (Figure 13) at different pressures and filled our recording electrode with the cell labeling molecule BiocytinAF488 to highlight the action potential exhibiting cells, which were the LMCs. Lymphatic resting membrane potential is dynamic in pressurized vessels, which appears to be a critical difference in this approach as compared to pinned out vessels or those on wire myographs likely due to improper stretch or damage to the vessel wall. In mesenteric lymphatic vessels isolated from rats the minimum membrane potential achieved during repolarization ranges from -45 to 50mV typically while IALVs from mice are typically around -40mV, though IALVs have a notably higher contraction frequency. Critically, we have also added novel membrane potential recordings to this manuscript in IALVs at different pressures and show that the diastolic depolarization rate is the critical factor driving the pressure-dependent frequency.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In the discussion, the authors discussed SR Ca2+ cycling in Pacemaking, but the relevant data are not included in this manuscript, but a manuscript from JGP (in revision) is cross-referenced.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As discussed above, we have recently published our work where studied IALVs from Myh11CreERT2-Ip3R1fl/fl (Ip3r1ismKO) and Myh1CreERT2-Ip3r1fl/fl-Ip3r2fl/fl-Ip3r3fl/fl mice (Zawieja et al., 2023). Deletion of Ip3r1 from LMCs recapitulated the dramatic reduction in frequency we previously published in Myh11CreERT2-Ano1fl/fl mice and the loss of pressure dependent chronotropy. Furthermore, in this manuscript we also showed that the diastolic calcium transients are nearly completely lost in ILAVs from Myh11CreERT2-Ip3R1fl/fl knockout mice. There was no difference in the contractile function between IALVs from single Ip3r1 knockout and the triple Ip3r1-3 knockout mice suggesting that it is Ip3r1 that is required for the diastolic calcium oscillations. Further, in the presence of 1uM nifedipine there were still no calcium oscillations in the Myh11CreERT2-Ip3r1fl/fl LMCs. These findings provide further support for our interpretation that the pacemaking is of myogenic origin.</p>
