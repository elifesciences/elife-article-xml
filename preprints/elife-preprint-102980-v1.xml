<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>) infection of macrophages reprograms cellular metabolism to promote lipid retention. While it is clearly known that intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> utilize host derived lipids to maintain infection, the role of macrophage lipid processing on the bacteria’s ability to access the intracellular lipid pool remains undefined. We utilized a CRISPR-Cas9 genetic approach to assess the impact of sequential steps in fatty acid metabolism on the growth of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic>. Our analyzes demonstrate that mutated macrophages that cannot either import, store or catabolize fatty acids restrict <italic>Mtb</italic> growth by both common and divergent anti-microbial mechanisms, including increased glycolysis, increased oxidative stress, production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enhanced autophagy and nutrient limitation. We also show that impaired macrophage lipid droplet biogenesis is restrictive to <italic>Mtb</italic> replication, but increased induction fails to rescue <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. Our work expands our understanding of how host fatty acid homeostasis impacts <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in the macrophage.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<italic>Mtb</italic>), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), has caused disease and death in humans for centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">WHO, 2023</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> primarily infects macrophages in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wolf et al., 2007</xref>) wherein the bacterium relies on host derived fatty acids and cholesterol for synthesis of its lipid rich cell wall, and to produce energy and virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Russell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Muñoz-Elías and McKinney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brzostek et al., 2009</xref>). Within the lung microenvironment, resident alveolar macrophages preferentially oxidize fatty acids and are more permissive to <italic>Mtb</italic> growth while recruited interstitial macrophages are more glycolytic and restrictive of <italic>Mtb</italic> replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pisu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pisu et al., 2021</xref>). Globally, <italic>Mtb</italic> infection modifies macrophage metabolism in a manner that enhances its survival. <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages shift their mitochondrial substrate preference to exogenous fatty acids which drives the formation of foamy macrophages that are laden with cytosolic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Russell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cumming et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Podinovskaia et al., 2013</xref>). Foamy macrophages are found in abundance in the central and inner layers of granulomas, a common histopathological feature of human TB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Russell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Interference with key regulators of lipid homeostasis, such as the miR-33 and the transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and PPAR-γ enhances macrophage control of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Almeida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ouimet et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, compounds which modulate lipid metabolism such as the anti-diabetic drug metformin and some cholesterol lowering drugs are under investigation for host directed therapeutics (HDTs) against <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Parihar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Singhal et al., 2014</xref>). Although the dependence of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> on host fatty acids and cholesterol is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wilburn et al., 2018</xref>), the impact of specific aspects of macrophage lipid metabolism on the bacteria remains opaque. In <italic>Mtb</italic> infected foamy macrophages, bacteria containing phagosomes are found in close apposition to intracellular lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>). It is believed that the bacterial induction of a foamy macrophage phenotype in host cells results in a steady supply of lipids that addresses the bacteria’s nutritional requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Russell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> has been shown to import fatty acids from host lipid droplet derived triacylglycerols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>). However, other studies indicate that macrophage lipid droplet formation in response to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection can lead to the induction of a protective, anti-microbial response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> appears unable to acquire host lipids when lipid droplets are induced by stimulation with interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, there is some evidence that lipid droplets can be sites for the production of host protective pro-inflammatory eicosanoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>). Lipid droplets can also act as innate immune hubs against intracellular bacterial pathogens by clustering anti-bacterial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bosch et al., 2020</xref>). Inhibition of macrophage fatty acid oxidation by knocking out mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT2) or using chemical inhibitors of CPT2 also restrict intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). These data demonstrate that modulation of the different stages in lipid metabolism inside <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages can result in opposing outcomes.</p>
<p>We carried out a candidate-based, CRISPR mediated knockout of lipid import and metabolism genes in macrophages to determine their roles in intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. By targeting genes involved in fatty acid import, sequestration, and metabolism in Hoxb8 derived conditionally immortalized murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kiritsy et al., 2021</xref>), we show that impairing lipid homeostasis in macrophages at different steps in the process negatively impacts the growth of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic>, albeit to differing degrees. The impact on <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in the mutant macrophages was mediated through different mechanisms despite some common anti-microbial effectors. <italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages deficient in the import of long chain fatty acids increased production of pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β). In contrast, ablation of lipid droplet biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation increased production of reactive oxygen species and limited the bacteria’s access to nutrients. We also found that suppression of <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in macrophages that are unable to produce lipid droplets could not be rescued by exogeneous addition of fatty acids indicating that this is not purely nutritional restriction. Our data indicate that interference of lipid metabolism in macrophages leads to suppression of <italic>Mtb</italic> growth via multiple routes.</p>

<title>Knockout of fatty acid import and metabolism genes restricts <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in macrophages</title>
<p>To apply a holistic approach to assessing the role(s) of fatty acid metabolism on the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>, we used a CRISPR genetic approach to knockout genes involved in lipid import (CD36, FATP1), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2) and fatty acid oxidation (CPT1A, CPT2) in mouse primary macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Deletion of CD36 or CPT2 from mouse macrophages has been shown to impair intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>). But the role of specialized long chain fatty acid transporters (FATP1-6) on <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in macrophages is uncharacterized. FATP1 and FATP4 are the most abundant fatty acid transporter isoforms in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nishiyama et al., 2018</xref>). PLIN2, or adipophilin, is known to be required for lipid droplet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Paul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Larigauderie et al., 2004</xref>). Five isoforms of mammalian perilipins (PLIN) are involved in lipid droplet biogenesis amongst which PLIN2 is the dominant isoform expressed in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). However, macrophages derived from PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> mice show no defects in production of lipid droplets nor do they impair intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). We targeted each of these genes with at least 2 sgRNAs in Hoxb8 Cas9<sup>+</sup> conditionally immortalized myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kiritsy et al., 2021</xref>) to generate a panel of mutants that were deficient in the following candidates of interest; FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup>, CD36<sup>-/-</sup>, CPT1A<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>. Each individual sgRNA achieved &gt;85% CRISPR-mediated deletion efficiency for all the 5 genes, as analyzed by the Inference for CRISPR Edits (ICE) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Conant et al., 2022</xref>) (Supplementary file 1). We verified the protein knockout phenotypes by flow cytometry and western blot analysis of differentiated macrophages derived from the CRISPR deleted Hoxb8 myeloid precursors (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1).</p>

<p>To confirm certain knockout phenotypes functionally, we checked lipid droplet biogenesis in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages in comparison to macrophages transduced with a non-targeting scramble sgRNA by confocal microscopy of BODIPY stained cells. Cells were cultured for 24 hours in the presence of exogenous oleate to enhance the formation of lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Listenberger and Brown, 2007</xref>). We observed a complete absence of lipid droplet formation in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages as compared to controls (Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A). This is contrary to previous observations in macrophages derived from PLIN2 knockout mice which were reported to have no defect in lipid droplet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). We also assessed the ability of CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages to oxidize fatty acids using the Agilent Seahorse XF Palmitate Oxidation Stress Test. Scrambled sgRNA and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were cultured in substrate limiting conditions and supplied with either bovine serum albumin (BSA) or BSA conjugated palmitate. As shown in Figure 1 - figure supplement 2B, control macrophages were able to utilize and oxidize palmitate in substrate limiting conditions indicated by a significant increase in oxygen consumption rates (OCRs) in contrast to cells supplied with BSA alone. Addition of the CPT1A inhibitor, etomoxir, inhibited the cell’s ability to use palmitate in these conditions (Figure 1 - figure supplement 2B). CPT2 knockout in CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages impaired the cell’s ability to oxidize palmitate to a degree comparable to etomoxir treatment as evidenced by baseline OCRs when compared to scrambled sgRNA control (Figure 1 - figure supplement 2C).</p>
<p>We then assessed the different knockout mutant macrophages in their ability to support the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. We infected macrophages with <italic>Mtb</italic> Erdman at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.4 and assessed intracellular bacterial growth rates by counting colony forming units (CFUs) 5 days post infection. All the 5 mutant macrophages significantly impaired <italic>Mtb</italic> growth rates when compared to scrambled sgRNA as assessed by CFUs counts on day 5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup>, FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages displayed the strongest growth restriction phenotypes while CD36<sup>-/-</sup>macrophages had a moderate, but significant, impact on <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. In parallel, we quantified intracellular bacteria on day 0, 3 hours post infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>), to ascertain that subsequent differences on day 5 were not due to any disparity in initial bacterial uptake. The moderate growth restriction phenotypes of CD36<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were consistent with previous findings which reported similar impact on <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>M. marinum</italic> growth in macrophages derived from CD36<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkes et al., 2010</xref>). Impaired growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> in CPT1A<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages is also consistent with previous reports that genetic and chemical inhibition of fatty acid oxidation is detrimental to the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Mtb</italic> infected macrophages with impaired fatty acid import and metabolism display altered mitochondrial metabolism and elevated glycolysis</title>
<p>Impairment of fatty acids metabolism by FATP1 knockout in macrophages rewires their substrate bias from fatty acids to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). We reasoned that deletion of genes required for downstream processing of lipids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) could also reprogram macrophages and increase glycolysis which could, in part, explain bacterial growth restriction. We analyzed the metabolic states of 3 knockout macrophages (FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>) in uninfected and <italic>Mtb</italic> infected conditions by monitoring oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECARs) using the Agilent Mito and Glucose Stress Test kits. All 3 mutant uninfected macrophages displayed reduced mitochondrial respiration as evidenced by lower basal and spare respiratory capacity (SRC) when compared to scrambled sgRNA controls (Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A, 1B). <italic>Mtb</italic> infection proportionally reduced basal and SRC rates across all the mutant macrophages and scrambled controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2B</xref>) when compared to uninfected macrophages, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cumming et al., 2018</xref>). PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages displayed the most marked reduction in mitochondrial activity in both uninfected and infected conditions, while FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were the least affected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>, Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>), uninfected FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were more glycolytically active with higher basal and spare glycolytic capacity (SGC) compared to scrambled controls (Figure 2 - figure supplement 1C, 1D). Uninfected PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were also more glycolytically active, but to a greater degree than FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> (Figure 2 - figure supplement 1C, 1D). <italic>Mtb</italic> infection increased the glycolytic capacity of all the 3 mutant macrophages (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>). Overall, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages exhibited the highest glycolytic capacity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>, Figure 2 - figure supplement 1D). Our data indicates that impairment of fatty acid metabolism at different steps significantly impacts mitochondrial respiration and reprograms cells towards glycolysis. Increased glycolytic flux in macrophages has been linked to the control of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Metabolic realignment as a consequence of interference with lipid homeostasis, which results in enhanced glycolysis may contribute to <italic>Mtb</italic> growth restriction in these mutant macrophages.</p>

<title>Knockout of lipid import and metabolism genes in macrophages activates AMPK and stabilizes HIF-1α</title>
<p><italic>Mtb</italic> infection is known to induce increased glycolysis or the “Warburg effect” in macrophages, mouse lungs and human TB granulomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belton et al., 2016</xref>).

During <italic>Mtb</italic> infection, HIF-1 is activated by production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), TCA cycle intermediates and hypoxia in the cellular microenvironments as a consequence of altered metabolic activities and increased immune cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Belton et al., 2016</xref>). We assessed HIF-1 stability in the 3 mutant macrophage lineages (FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>) by monitoring total HIF-1α protein levels by western blot, having confirmed that they were all more glycolytically active than the scrambled controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Figure 2 - figure supplement 1). Indeed, all the 3 mutant macrophages displayed significantly higher amounts of total HIF-1α when compared to scrambled controls in uninfected conditions and after <italic>Mtb</italic> infection for 48 hours (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>). We also checked the phosphorylation status of the adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cell energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garcia and Shaw, 2017</xref>), in the mutant macrophages since Seahorse flux analyses indicated that they had impaired mitochondrial activities (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Figure 2 - figure supplement 1). Western blot analysis revealed that in both <italic>Mtb</italic> infected and uninfected conditions, impaired fatty acid metabolism correlated with moderate activation of AMPK as indicated by increased AMPK phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C, 3D</xref>). These data point to a metabolic reprogramming of cells through activation of HIF-1α and AMPK to promote glycolysis. In energetically stressed cellular environments, activated AMPK promotes catabolic processes such as autophagy to maintain nutrient supply and energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Garcia and Shaw, 2017</xref>). Autophagy is also an innate immune defense mechanism against intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gutierrez et al., 2004</xref>). We examined the levels of autophagic flux in the mutant macrophages by monitoring LC3I to LC3II conversion by western blot and by qPCR analysis of selected autophagy genes (<italic>AMBRA1</italic>, <italic>ATG7</italic>, <italic>MAP1LC3B</italic> and <italic>ULK1)</italic>. We observed a moderate increase in autophagic flux by western blot in uninfected FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, which was amplified upon infection with <italic>Mtb</italic> (Figure 2 - figure supplement 2A, 2B). Our qPCR analysis revealed that the 4 autophagy genes were upregulated in both <italic>Mtb</italic> infected and uninfected conditions in all the 3 mutants (Figure 2 - figure supplement 2C, 2D). These data suggest that impaired fatty acid import and metabolism in macrophages could be restricting <italic>Mtb</italic> growth by promoting autophagy. These data agree with previous observations that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation enhances macrophage xenophagic activity whichleads to improved control of <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Exogenous oleate fails to rescue the <italic>Mtb icl1-</italic>deficient mutant in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages</title>
<p>The mycobacterial isocitrate lyase (<italic>icl1</italic>) acts as an isocitrate lyase in the glyoxylate shunt and as a methyl-isocitrate lyase in the methyl-citrate cycle (MCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gould et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">McKinney et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> uses the MCC to convert propionyl CoA originating from the breakdown of cholesterol rings and β-oxidation of odd chain fatty acids into succinate and pyruvate, which are eventually assimilated into the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muñoz-Elías et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Griffin et al., 2012</xref>). The buildup of propionyl CoA is toxic to <italic>Mtb</italic> and the bacteria relies on the MCC together with the incorporation of propionyl CoA to methyl-branched lipids in the cell wall as an internal detoxification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Muñoz-Elías et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savvi et al., 2008</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> propionyl CoA toxicity is, in part, due to a cellular imbalance between propionyl CoA and acetyl CoA as an accumulation of the former or paucity of the latter results in the propionyl CoA mediated inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Mtb icl1</italic> deficient mutants (<italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic>) are unable to grow in media supplemented with cholesterol or propionate, or intracellularly in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). However, this growth inhibition could be rescued both in culture and in macrophages by exogenous supply of acetate or even chain fatty acids which can be oxidized to acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). We took advantage of this metabolic knowledge to assess whether exogenous addition of the even chain fatty acid oleate can rescue the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic> mutants in our CRISPR knockout macrophages. Scrambled controls, FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages in normal macrophage media or media supplemented with oleate were infected with an <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic> strain expressing mCherry at MOI 5. Bacterial growth measured by mCherry expression was recorded 5 days post infection. Consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), the <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic> mutant failed to replicate in both mutant and scramble macrophages that were grown in normal macrophage media as evidenced by baseline mCherry fluorescence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Oleate supplementation successfully rescued the <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic> mutant in scrambled control macrophages. However, the growth restriction of the <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic> strain could not be alleviated by exogenous addition of oleate to the mutant macrophages (FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). These data suggest that impaired import (FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>), sequestration (PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup>) or β-oxidation of fatty acids (CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>) blocks <italic>Mtb</italic>’s ability to access and use cellular lipids.</p>

<p>Oleate supplementation in macrophages induces the formation of lipid droplets and we were able to confirm the inability to produce lipid droplets in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages using this approach (Figure 1 - figure supplement 2A). As an indirect measure to track the fate of supplemented oleate in the mutant macrophages, we monitored lipid droplet biogenesis in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages to check if the inability to rescue the <italic>Mtb</italic> Δ<italic>icl1</italic> impaired growth phenotypes in these mutant macrophages could be possibly related to disruptions in lipid droplet biogenesis. Confocal analysis of BODIPY stained cells upon oleate supplementation revealed that FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages also fail to generate lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages produced more and larger lipid droplets in comparison to scrambled controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These data suggest that the inhibition of <italic>Mtb</italic> growth in these mutant macrophages is not merely through limitation of access to fatty acid nutrients.</p>

<title>Dual RNA sequencing to identify host and bacterial determinants of <italic>Mtb</italic> restriction in mutant macrophage lineages</title>
<p>We performed RNA sequencing of both host and bacteria in <italic>Mtb</italic> infected mutant macrophages as a preliminary step in identification of pathways restricting bacterial growth. We infected scrambled controls, FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages with the <italic>Mtb</italic> smyc’::mCherry strain for 4 days and processed the samples for dual RNA sequencing as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Simwela et al., 2024</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of host transcriptomes revealed a clustering of all the 3 mutant macrophages away from scrambled controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, there was a separation in transcriptional responses between the 3 mutant macrophages as CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> and PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages clustered closer together and more distant from FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Overall, using an adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and absolute log2 fold change &gt; 1.2, we identified 900 genes which were differentially expressed (DE) in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (589 up, 311 down), 817 genes which were DE in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (501 up, 315 down) and 189 genes which were DE in CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> (124 up, 65 down) (Supplementary file 2, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Consistent with the PCA analysis, Venn diagram of the DE genes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>) indicated divergent responses in the 3 mutant macrophage populations. We performed pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) of the DE genes to identify anti-microbial pathway candidates in the 3 mutant macrophages. We found that defects in fatty acid uptake in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> infected macrophages upregulated pro-inflammatory pathways involved in MAPK and ERK signaling and production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, interleukin-6, Interleukin-1α, β) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>, Supplementary file 3). The pro-inflammatory signatures of the FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages are consistent with previous observations that demonstrated that a deficiency in FATP1 exacerbated macrophage activation <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). FATP1 is a solute carrier family member (SLC27A1) and <italic>Mtb</italic> infected FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages showed reduced expression of other solute carrier transporters (SLC) such as FATP4 (SLC27A4), GLUT1 (SLC2A1) and 8 SLC amino acid transporters (Figure 5 - figure supplement 1A, 1B, 2A, Supplementary file 2). Interestingly, <italic>Mtb</italic> infected FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophage transcriptomes exhibited upregulation of macrophage scavenger receptors (MSR1) and the ATP binding cassette transporter ABCC1 (Figure 5 - figure supplement 1A), both of which can independently transport fatty acids into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Vogel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Raggers et al., 1999</xref>).</p>

<p>Meanwhile, inability generate lipid droplets in <italic>Mtb</italic> infected PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages led to upregulation in pathways involved in ribosomal biology, MHC class 1 antigen presentation, canonical glycolysis, ATP metabolic processes and type 1 interferon responses (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, Supplementary file 3). In the downregulated PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> DE gene set, enriched pathways included those involved in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines; interleukin-6 and 8, IFN-γ and interleukin-1 (Figure 5 - figure supplement 2B, Supplementary file 3). Oxidative phosphorylation and processes involved in the respiratory chain electron transport were also significantly enriched in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> downregulated genes. This suggests that <italic>Mtb</italic> infected PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages increase glycolytic flux and decrease mitochondrial activities, which is consistent with our metabolic flux analysis data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). Unlike FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages are, however, broadly anti-inflammatory as most pro-inflammatory genes were downregulated upon <italic>Mtb</italic> infection.</p>
<p>Further downstream in the lipid processing steps, inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages upregulated pathways involved in MHC class 1 antigen presentation, response to IFN-γ and interleukin-1 and T-cell mediated immunity (Figure 5 - figure supplement 3, Supplementary file 3). There was a limited overlap in enriched pathways in the upregulated genes between <italic>Mtb</italic> infected CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> and FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages such as those involved in the cellular responses to interleukin-1 and IFN-γ. However, many pathways over-represented in CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were common to PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>, Figure 5 - figure supplement 3, Supplementary file 3). Similarly, both <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> <italic>and</italic> CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages were downregulated in expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Supplementary file 3). We confirmed expression levels of key genes by qPCR analysis of IL-1β and the type 1 interferon (IFN-β) response during the early time points of infection. Indeed, 4 hours post infection, IL-1β and IFN-β were both upregulated in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages as compared to scrambled controls consistent with their pro-inflammatory phenotype (Figure 5 - figure supplement 4A, 4B). On the contrary, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages downregulated IL-1β (Figure 5 - figure supplement 4B). These data indicate that macrophages respond quite divergently to the deletion of the different steps in fatty acid uptake, which implies that the intracellular pressures to which <italic>Mtb</italic> is exposed may also differ.</p>

<title>Oxidative stress and nutrient limitation are major stresses experienced by <italic>Mtb</italic> in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages</title>
<p>We also analyzed transcriptomes from intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> from scrambled controls, FATP1<sup>-/-</sup>, CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> and PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages in parallel with host transcriptomes in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>. Using an adjusted p-value of &lt; 0.1 and an absolute log2 fold change &gt; 1.4, 0 genes were DE in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, 105 <italic>Mtb</italic> genes were DE in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (69 up, 36 down) and 10 genes were DE in CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (3 up, 7 down) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Despite being restrictive to <italic>Mtb</italic> growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) and appearing more pro-inflammatory (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages did not elicit a detectable shift in the transcriptional response in <italic>Mtb,</italic> compared to control host cells. We speculate that pro-inflammatory responses in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages could be enough to restrict the growth of bacteria, but the resulting compensatory responses as evidenced by the upregulation of macrophage scavenger receptors (Figure 5 - figure supplement 1A) alleviate some of the stresses that a lack of fatty acid import could be duly exerting on the bacteria. PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages appeared to elicit the strongest transcriptional response from <italic>Mtb</italic> which is consistent with our CFU data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) as PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages exhibited the strongest growth restriction. Among the DE genes in <italic>Mtb</italic> from PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, a significant number of upregulated genes are involved in nutrient assimilation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages upregulated CobU (Rv0254c) which is predicted to be involved in the bacteria’s cobalamin (Vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) biosynthesis. Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> is an important cofactor for the activity of <italic>Mtb</italic> genes required for cholesterol and fatty acid utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Campos-Pardos et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Savvi et al., 2008</xref>). Genes involved in de novo long chain fatty acid synthesis (AccE5, Rv281) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bazet Lyonnet et al., 2014</xref>), cholesterol breakdown (HsaD, Rv3569c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lack et al., 2010</xref>), β-oxidation of fatty acids (EchA18, Rv3373; FadE22, Rv3061c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>), purine salvage (Apt, Rv2584c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Warner et al., 2014</xref>) and tryptophan metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lott, 2020</xref>) were also upregulated in <italic>Mtb</italic> from PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). This metabolic re-alignment response is seen most frequently under nutrient limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pisu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Theriault et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Mtb</italic> in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages also appears to experience a significant level of other cellular stresses as genes involved in DNA synthesis and repair, general response to oxidative stress and PH survival in the phagosome (DnaN, Rv0002; RecF, Rv0003; DinF, Rv2836c; Rv3242c, Rv1264) were upregulated (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Amongst the down-regulated genes in <italic>Mtb</italic> in PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, FurA (Rv1909c), a KatG repressor was the most significant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, Supplementary file 4). FurA downregulation derepresses the catalase peroxidase, KatG, which promotes <italic>Mtb</italic> survival in oxidative stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zahrt et al., 2001</xref>).

In this report, we characterized the role of macrophage lipid metabolism on the intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> by a targeted CRISPR mediated knockout of host genes involved in fatty acid import, sequestration and catabolism. Macrophage fatty acid uptake is mediated by the scavenger receptor CD36 and specialized long chain fatty acid transporters, FATP1 and FATP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 2023</xref>). Earlier studies reported that a deficiency of CD36 enhances macrophage control of <italic>Mtb,</italic> albeit to a modest degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkes et al., 2010</xref>). Work from Hawkes et al.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkes et al., 2010</xref>) indicated that the anti-microbial effectors in CD36 deficient macrophages were not due to bacterial uptake deficiencies, differences in the rate of <italic>Mtb</italic> induced host cell death, production of ROS or pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hawkes et al., 2010</xref>). We similarly observed a moderate <italic>Mtb</italic> growth restriction phenotype in our CRISPR generated CD36<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages. However, a strong growth restriction of <italic>Mtb</italic> was observed when we knocked out the long chain fatty acid transporter, FATP1. FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages displayed altered metabolism characterized by stabilization of HIF-1α, activated AMPK, increased glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial functions. Given that both CD36 and FATP1 perform similar functions, it is expected that they should be some degree of compensation between the transporters when either of the genes are deleted. Indeed, we found out that FATP1 knockout resulted in the upregulation of other lipid import transporters (MSR1, ABCC1). This would be consistent with the moderate anti-<italic>Mtb</italic> phenotypes in CD36<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages which could easily be compensated by the presence of FATPs to alleviate the reduction in fatty acid supply experienced by intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic>. However, the FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophage phenotype appears to be more severe on <italic>Mtb</italic> and could be exacerbated by an elevated pro-inflammatory response as has been reported previously both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>After uptake into the cells, most fatty acids either undergo β-oxidation in the mitochondria to provide energy or are esterified with glycerol phosphate to form triacylglycerols that may be incorporated into lipid droplets in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 2023</xref>). Over the last 2 decades, it has been believed that lipid droplets are a nutrient source for <italic>Mtb</italic> in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Russell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). However, recent work indicates lipid droplets may serve as centers for the production of pro-inflammatory markers and anti-microbial peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bosch et al., 2020</xref>). It has also been reported that bone marrow macrophages derived from PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> mice did not have defects in the formation of lipid droplets and supported robust intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>). However, our mutant macrophages with myeloid specific knockout of PLIN2 are unable to form lipid droplets and are defective in supporting the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic>. The discrepancies with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Knight et al., 2018</xref>) could be a consequence of compensatory responses to PLIN2 knockout in whole mice which when performed at embryonic level would allow for sufficient time for the cells to recover by upregulating related PLIN isoforms. In fact, PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages displayed the strongest anti-<italic>Mtb</italic> phenotypes amongst our mutants exhibiting activated AMPK, increased glycolysis and autophagy and impaired mitochondrial functions. <italic>Mtb</italic> isolated from PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages displayed signatures of severe nutrient limitation and oxidative stress damage.</p>
<p>It has also been previously reported that chemical, genetic or miR33 mediated blockade of fatty acid β-oxidation in macrophages induces lipid droplet formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ouimet et al., 2016</xref>) but that this enhanced lipid droplet formation does not correlate with improved intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chandra et al., 2020</xref>). We observed a similar phenotype as CPT2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages that generated larger and more abundant lipid droplets than scrambled control macrophages were still restrictive to <italic>Mtb</italic> growth. This implies that the presence or absence of lipid droplets does not in itself indicate whether a macrophage will support or restrict <italic>Mtb</italic> growth, and that the anti-microbial environment extends beyond simple nutrient availability.</p>
<p>In summary, our study shows that blocking macrophage’s ability to import, sequester or catabolize fatty acids chemically or by genetic knockout impairs <italic>Mtb</italic> intracellular growth. There are shared features between potential anti-microbial effectors in macrophages which lack the ability to import (FATP<sup>-/-</sup>) or metabolize fatty acids (PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup>, CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>) such as increased glycolysis, stabilized HIF-1α, activated AMPK, enhanced autophagy and production of ROS. However, there are also intriguing points of divergence as FATP<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages are more pro-inflammatory while PLIN2<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages appear to be broadly anti-inflammatory. The routes to <italic>Mtb</italic> growth restriction in these mutant macrophages are clearly more complex than the bacteria’s inability to acquire nutrients. The data further emphasizes that targeting fatty acid homeostasis in macrophages at different steps in the process (uptake, storage and catabolism) is worthy of exploring in the development of new therapeutics against tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the role of macrophage lipid metabolism in the intracellular growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. By using a CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing approach, the authors knocked out key genes involved in fatty acid import, lipid droplet formation, and fatty acid oxidation in macrophages. Their results show that disrupting various stages of fatty acid metabolism significantly impairs the ability of Mtb to replicate inside macrophages. The mechanisms of growth restriction included increased glycolysis, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine production, enhanced autophagy, and nutrient limitation. The study demonstrates that targeting fatty acid homeostasis at different stages of the lipid metabolic process could offer new strategies for host-directed therapies against tuberculosis.</p>
<p>The work is convincing and methodologically strong, combining genetic, metabolic, and transcriptomic analyses to provide deep insights into how host lipid metabolism affects bacterial survival.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study uses a multifaceted approach, including CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockouts, metabolic assays, and dual RNA sequencing, to assess how various stages of macrophage lipid metabolism affect Mtb growth. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 to selectively knock out key genes involved in fatty acid metabolism enables precise investigation of how each step-lipid import, lipid droplet formation, and fatty acid oxidation affect Mtb survival. The study offers mechanistic insights into how different impairments in lipid metabolism lead to diverse antimicrobial responses, including glycolysis, oxidative stress, and autophagy. This deepens the understanding of macrophage function in immune defense.</p>
<p>The use of functional assays to validate findings (e.g., metabolic flux analyses, lipid droplet formation assays, and rescue experiments with fatty acid supplementation) strengthens the reliability and applicability of the results.</p>
<p>By highlighting potential targets for HDT that exploit macrophage lipid metabolism to restrict Mtb growth, the work has significant implications for developing new tuberculosis treatments.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The experiments were primarily conducted in vitro using CRISPR-modified macrophages. While these provide valuable insights, they may not fully replicate the complexity of the in vivo environment where multiple cell types and factors influence Mtb infection and immune responses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Host-derived lipids are an important factor during Mtb infection. In this study, using CRISPR knockouts of genes involved in fatty acid uptake and metabolism, the authors claim that a compromised uptake, storage, or metabolism of fatty acid restricts Mtb growth upon infection. Further, the authors claim that the mechanism involves increased glycolysis, autophagy, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and nutrient limitation. The authors also claim that impaired lipid droplet formation restricts Mtb growth. However, promoting lipid droplet biogenesis does not reverse/promote Mtb growth.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of the study is the use of clean HOXB8-derived primary mouse macrophage lines for generating CRISPR knockouts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>There are many weaknesses of this study, they are clubbed into four categories below</p>
<p>(1) Evidence and interpretations: The results shown in this study at several places do not support the interpretations made or are internally contradictory or inconsistent. There are several important observations, but none were taken forward for in-depth analysis. A</p>
<p>
a) The phenotypes of PLIN2-/-, FATP1-/-, and CPT-/- are comparable in terms of bacterial growth restriction; however, their phenotype in terms of lipid body formation, IL1B expression, etc., are not consistent. These are interesting observations and suggest additional mechanisms specific to specific target genes; however, clubbing them all as altered fatty acid uptake or catabolism-dependent phenotypes takes away this important point. b) Finding the FATP1 transcript in the HOXB8-derived FATP1-/- CRISPR KO line is a bit confusing. There is less than a two-fold decrease in relative transcript abundance in the KO line compared to the WT line, leaving concerns regarding the robustness of other experiments as well using FATP1-/- cells.</p>
<p>
c) No gene showing differential regulation in FATP-/- macrophages, which is very surprising.</p>
<p>
d) ROS measurements should be done using flow cytometry and not by microscopy to nail the actual pattern.</p>
<p>(2) Experimental design: For a few assays, the experimental design is inappropriate</p>
<p>
a) For autophagy flux assay, immunoblot of LC3II alone is not sufficient to make any interpretation regarding the state of autophagy. This assay must be done with BafA1 or CQ controls to assess the true state of autophagy.</p>
<p>
b) Similarly, qPCR analyses of autophagy-related gene expression do not reflect anything on the state of autophagy flux.</p>
<p>(3) Using correlative observations as evidence:</p>
<p>
a) Observations based on RNAseq analyses are presented as functional readouts, which is incorrect.</p>
<p>
b) Claiming that the inability to generate lipid droplets in PLIN2-/- cells led to the upregulation of several pathways in the cells is purely correlative, and the causal relationship does not exist in the data presented.</p>
<p>(4) Novelty: A few main observations described in this study were previously reported. That includes Mtb growth restriction in PLIN2 and FATP1 deficient cells. Similarly, the impact of Metformin and TMZ on intracellular Mtb growth is well-reported. While that validates these observations in this study, it takes away any novelty from the study.</p>
<p>(5) Manuscript organisation: It will be very helpful to rearrange figures and supplementary figures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides significant insights into how host metabolism, specifically lipids, influences the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). It builds on existing knowledge about Mtb's reliance on host lipids and emphasizes the potential of targeting fatty acid metabolism for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To generate the data, the authors use CRISPR technology to precisely disrupt the genes involved in lipid import (CD36, FATP1), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2), and fatty acid oxidation (CPT1A, CPT2) in mouse primary macrophages. The Mtb Erdman strain is used to infect the macrophage mutants. The study, revealsspecific roles of different lipid-related genes. Importantly, results challenge previous assumptions about lipid droplet formation and show that macrophage responses to lipid metabolism impairments are complex and multifaceted. The experiments are well-controlled and the data is convincing.</p>
<p>Overall, this well-written paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of tuberculosis research, particularly in the context of host-directed therapies (HDTs). It suggests that manipulating macrophage metabolism could be an effective strategy to limit Mtb growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None noted. The manuscript provides important new knowledge that will lead mpvel to host-directed therapies to control Mtb infections.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We acknowledge that our in vitro system may indeed not fully replicate the complex in vivo environment in light of the heterogenous responses of macrophages to Mtb infection in whole animal models. We do believe, however, that the Hoxb8 in vitro model provides a powerful genetic tool to interrogate host-Mtb interactions using primary macrophages that represent the bone marrow-derived macrophage lineage. Reviewer #1 also made several helpful suggestions in their recommendations to authors relating to the reorganization of the data in our Figures in both the manuscript and the supplemental data.  We will incorporate these suggestions into the revised version of the manuscript upon resubmission.</p>

<p>(1) Evidence and interpretations: The results shown in this study at several places do not support the interpretations made or are internally contradictory or inconsistent. There are several important observations, but none were taken forward for in-depth analysis. A</p>
<p>a) The phenotypes of PLIN2-/-, FATP1-/-, and CPT-/- are comparable in terms of bacterial growth restriction; however, their phenotype in terms of lipid body formation, IL1B expression, etc., are not consistent. These are interesting observations and suggest additional mechanisms specific to specific target genes; however, clubbing them all as altered fatty acid uptake or catabolism-dependent phenotypes takes away this important point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this. Our main focus was on assessing the impact of manipulating lipid homeostasis in macrophages and the consequences this has on the intracellular growth of Mtb.  It was never our intention to imply these mutants generated equivalent phenotypes, and we will modify the revised manuscript to reflect this point.  We will stress that interfering with lipid processing at different stages in macrophages results in both shared and divergent anti-microbial conditions against Mtb.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Finding the FATP1 transcript in the HOXB8-derived FATP1-/- CRISPR KO line is a bit confusing. There is less than a two-fold decrease in relative transcript abundance in the KO line compared to the WT line, leaving concerns regarding the robustness of other experiments as well using FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of genes with single sgRNAs as is the case with our mutants generates insertions and deletions (INDELs) at the CRISPR cut site. These INDELs do not block mRNA transcription totally, and this is widely reported and accepted in the field.  In these cases, RT-PCR or RNA-seq methods are not used to verify CRISPR knockouts as they are not sensitive enough to identify INDELs. We provide knockout efficiencies by ICE analysis in supplemental information file 1 for all the mutants used in the study. We also demonstrate protein depletion by western blot and flow cytometry for all the mutants (Figure 1 - figure supplement 1). Only mutants with greater than &gt;90% protein depletion were used for subsequent characterization.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>c) No gene showing differential regulation in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, which is very surprising.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We assume the reviewer is referring to the Mtb transcriptome response in FATP1<sup>-/-</sup> macrophages, which we agree was unexpected.  However, we saw a significant compensatory response in the host cell (at transcriptional level) in FATP1-/- macrophages as evidenced by an upregulation of other fatty acid transporters (Figure 5 - figure supplement 1). We postulate that these compensatory responses could, in part, alleviate the stresses the bacteria experience within the cell, and these were discussed in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>d) ROS measurements should be done using flow cytometry and not by microscopy to nail the actual pattern.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. However, confocal imaging is also widely used to measure ROS with similar quantitative power and individual cell resolution (PMID: 32636249, 35737799).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Experimental design: For a few assays, the experimental design is inappropriate</p>
<p>a) For autophagy flux assay, immunoblot of LC3II alone is not sufficient to make any interpretation regarding the state of autophagy. This assay must be done with BafA1 or CQ controls to assess the true state of autophagy.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to point out that monitoring LC3I to LC3II conversion by western blot, confocal imaging of LC3 puncta and qPCR analysis of autophagy related genes are all validated assays for monitoring autophagic flux in a wide variety of cells. We refer the reviewer to the latest extensive guidelines on the subject (PMID: 33634751). Furthermore, Bafilomycin A and chloroquine are not specific inhibitors of autophagy and therefore are of limited value as controls. BafA is an inhibitor of the proton-ATPase apparatus as well impacting autophagy through activity on the Ca-P60A/SERCA pathway. Chloroquine impacts vacuole acidification, autophagosome/lysosome fusion and slows phagosome maturation. So, while BafA and chloroquine will reduce autophagy their effects are pleotropic and their impact on Mtb is unknown.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Similarly, qPCR analyses of autophagy-related gene expression do not reflect anything on the state of autophagy flux.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>See our response above.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Using correlative observations as evidence:</p>
<p>a) Observations based on RNAseq analyses are presented as functional readouts, which is incorrect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not entirely sure where we used our RNA-seq data sets as functional readouts. We used our transcriptome data to provide a preliminary identification of anti-microbial responses in the mutant macrophages infected with Mtb. Where applicable, we followed up and confirmed the more compelling RNA-seq data either by metabolic flux analyzes, qPCR, ROS measurements, and quantitative imaging.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>b) Claiming that the inability to generate lipid droplets in PLIN2-/- cells led to the upregulation of several pathways in the cells is purely correlative, and the causal relationship does not exist in the data presented.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Again, it was not our intention to infer causality. Throughout the manuscript, we endeavor to present our data with a specific focus on describing the consequences of interfering with either fatty acid import, lipid droplet biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation on macrophage responses to Mtb.  We will revisit the revised manuscript to remove any sections that imply causality.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Novelty: A few main observations described in this study were previously reported. That includes Mtb growth restriction in PLIN2 and FATP1 deficient cells. Similarly, the impact of Metformin and TMZ on intracellular Mtb growth is well-reported. While that validates these observations in this study, it takes away any novelty from the study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, Mtb growth restrictions in PLIN2 and FATP1 deficient macrophages have not been reported elsewhere. To the contrary, PLIN2 knockout macrophages obtained from PLIN2 deficient mice have been reported to robustly support Mtb replication (PMID: 29370315), quite the opposite to our data. We extensively discuss these discrepancies in the manuscript. We also discuss and cite appropriate references where Mtb growth restriction for similar macrophage mutants have been reported (CD36<sup>-/-</sup> and CPT2<sup>-/-</sup>). Our aim was to carry out a systematic myeloid specific genetic interference of fatty acid import, storage and catabolism to assess the effect on Mtb growth at all stages of lipid handling instead of focusing on one target. In the chemical approach, we used TMZ and Metformin deliberately because they had already been reported as being active against intracellular Mtb and we wished to place our data in the context of existing literature.  These studies were referenced extensively in the text.</p>

<p>(5) Manuscript organisation: It will be very helpful to rearrange figures and supplementary figures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will re-organize the figures in the manuscript revision as per the reviewer’s recommendation, and the recommendations of reviewer #1.</p>
<p>We will address the other concerns raised by reviewer #2 in the recommendations to authors during revision of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides significant insights into how host metabolism, specifically lipids, influences the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). It builds on existing knowledge about Mtb's reliance on host lipids and emphasizes the potential of targeting fatty acid metabolism for therapeutic intervention.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>To generate the data, the authors use CRISPR technology to precisely disrupt the genes involved in lipid import (CD36, FATP1), lipid droplet formation (PLIN2), and fatty acid oxidation (CPT1A, CPT2) in mouse primary macrophages. The Mtb Erdman strain is used to infect the macrophage mutants. The study, reveals specific roles of different lipid-related genes. Importantly, results challenge previous assumptions about lipid droplet formation and show that macrophage responses to lipid metabolism impairments are complex and multifaceted. The experiments are well-controlled and the data is convincing.</p>
<p>Overall, this well-written paper makes a meaningful contribution to the field of tuberculosis research, particularly in the context of host-directed therapies (HDTs). It suggests that manipulating macrophage metabolism could be an effective strategy to limit Mtb growth.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>None noted. The manuscript provides important new knowledge that will lead mpvel to host-directed therapies to control Mtb infections.</p>
