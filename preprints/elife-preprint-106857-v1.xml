<abstract>
<p>Extreme stress, such as freeze-thaw, poses a severe challenge to many organisms, but the mechanisms underlying their adaptation to survive such stress remain elusive. Here, we show that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> can rapidly evolve freeze-thaw tolerance through a physiological state transition, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude from ≈2% to ≈70% in about 25 cycles of stress exposure. Evolved yeast cells exhibit a quiescence-like state, characterized by altered cellular physiology: increased intracellular trehalose accumulation, reduced membrane damage, cytoplasmic stiffening and an exit from a proliferative cycle. This mechano-chemically reinforced survival strategy emerges across independent evolutionary lines despite distinct genetic backgrounds, suggesting a convergent mechanism of adaptation. By integrating experimental evolution, biophysical measurements, genomic analysis, and a quantitative model that captures the adaptation dynamics, we reveal that stress tolerance can arise via a potentially generalizable, physiologically mediated adaptation strategy. These findings provide new insights into microbial survival under extreme conditions and suggest broader implications for cellular stress responses beyond yeast.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells across many domains of life survive extreme environmental perturbations, including complete desiccation and freezing, which can cause severe cellular damage. Cellular damage occurs via many mechanisms such as protein denaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], membrane rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>], and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. To survive such conditions, organisms have evolved diverse adaptive mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Classical evolutionary models primarily emphasize genetic mutations as the basis for the evolution of such adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. However, recent evidence suggests that cells can also adapt via phenotypic plasticity and physiological state transitions, allowing rapid, non-genetic survival advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>].</p>
<p>One widely recognized mechanism of stress resistance is the accumulation of protective molecules such as trehalose, which stabilizes proteins and membranes during dehydration and freezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]. Additionally, molecules such as trehalose have also been associated with transition to quiescence, a reversible state of metabolic suppression, to endure unfavorable conditions, in many microbes and multicellular organisms. Among many other characteristics, quiescence is characterized by increased cytoplasmic viscosity, enhanced resistance to oxidative damage, and improved long-term viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In microbes, quiescence has been linked to persistence under starvation and antimicrobial stress, while in multicellular organisms, it plays a role in stem cell maintenance and tumor dormancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we investigate whether repeated exposure to extreme freeze-thaw stress selects for a quiescence-like adapted state in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Using experimental evolution, we subjected yeast populations to repeated cycles of rapid freezing and thawing, a severe mechano-chemical perturbation that initially results in very low survival (<italic>&lt;</italic>2%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]. Strikingly, within <italic>∼</italic>25 selection cycles, survival increased nearly 40-fold. The adapted yeast cells exhibit an increased prevalence of a quiescence-like state, characterized by altered cellular physiology: increased intracellular trehalose accumulation, reduced membrane damage, cytoplasmic stiffening and an exit from a proliferative cycle. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the adaptation was not driven by unique genetic pathways but rather by multiple, distinct genetic backgrounds, all converging on the same mechano-chemically reinforced survival phenotype.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that a quiescence-like adaptation represents a generalizable stress tolerance strategy. While our results strongly suggest a dominant role for non-genetic physiological adaptation, it is possible that genetic and regulatory factors may contribute to this response. These results raise intriguing questions about whether similar physiological state transitions contribute to microbial persistence in fluctuating environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>] and whether such mechanisms can be harnessed for industrial and medical applications, including bio-preservation and cryo-tolerance. By demonstrating that cells can evolve resilience via a physiologically mediated mechanism that operates alongside genetic factors, our work expands the understanding of adaptive evolution and stress biology beyond classical mutationdriven models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> adapts to freeze-thaw stress</title>
<p>We first establish an experimental protocol in order to perform the selection (Methods; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<bold>A</bold></xref>). It is known that the survival of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> upon freeze-thaw depends on the rate of freezing and thawing. Survival has been found to be minimal when it undergoes a fast freeze (&gt; 10 K/min) to −196°C [<bold>?</bold>]. We chose this regime to work in to possibly achieve the most significant increase in survival after adaptation. Before proceeding, we determined the effect of duration at −196°C on survival by exposing the WT (CEN.PK a/ <italic>α</italic>) stationary phase cell cultures to a fast freeze (&gt; 10K/min) to −196°C and allowed them to remain at −196°C for varying lengths of time before thawing. Freezing was done by immersing 500 <italic>µ</italic>l of stationary phase culture in 1.5 mL tubes in liquid nitrogen (−196°C) and the cultures were then thawed by immersing them in 25°C water for 15 minutes. We note that the survival fraction of yeast does not vary with duration at −196°C (Supplementary Information). Therefore, for experimental convenience, we used a freeze duration of 15 minutes and selected for freeze-thaw tolerance at high cooling rates (&gt; 10 K/min).</p>

<p>The cells that survived the freeze-thaw were grown in fresh medium until stationary phase (24 hours, ≈4 generations) and this cycle repeats. The survival fraction was then measured by colony forming units (CFUs). This cycle of freezethaw followed by growth was repeated until the survival fraction stopped increasing. For controls, the same protocol was followed without the freeze-thaw procedure. To start the experiments, a single yeast colony was picked from an agar plate and grown as liquid culture to stationary phase. This starter culture was divided into six parts — two for controls and four biological replicates for selection.</p>
<p>Under this selection protocol, the survival fraction increased from ≈2% up to an average of ≈70%, with one of the replicates as high as 85%, in only a span of ≈25 freeze-thaw cycles. This shows that the yeast cells adapt quite rapidly to freeze-thaw in this regime of very low initial survival rates (i.e. ≈2%) and the dynamics are remarkably similar across independent evolution lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<bold>B</bold></xref>). Next, we characterized the differences in the evolved strain with respect to the WT.</p>

<title>Freeze-thaw tolerant populations of cells have higher basal intracellular levels of trehalose</title>
<p>Trehalose is a sugar containing two <italic>α</italic>-glucose units with a 1,1-glycosidic bond between them. Several studies have found a strong correlation between intracellular trehalose concentration and survival after freeze-thaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. Chen <italic>et al</italic>. showed that trehalose was sufficient to confer freeze-thaw tolerance when cooled slowly to −80°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. These studies either measure the amount of trehalose in existing freeze-thaw tolerant strains or the survival in trehalose accumulated mutant strains. Motivated by these studies, we measured the amounts of intracellular trehalose at the stationary phase to calculate the basal levels of trehalose present in cells, over the course of adaptation to freeze-thaw. Cell colonies were collected and weighed from plates used to measure survival using CFUs 48 hours after thawing. The concentration of trehalose was then measured using a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>] (Methods). We found that the amount of basal intracellular trehalose systematically increased over the course of adaptation to freeze-thaw, exhibiting similar dynamics to those of the cellular survival levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1<bold>C</bold></xref>). Basal levels of trehalose increased nearly 3 fold over the course of the selection.</p>
<p>Previous studies suggest that trehalose might play a role in reducing membrane damage [<bold>?</bold>], which has been implicated as the primary cause of death after freeze-thaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. Therefore, we next turned our attention to investigating if the freeze-thaw tolerant cells have a membrane-damage related adaptation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<label>C.</label>
<title>Freeze-thaw tolerant cells undergo reduced membrane damage</title>
<p>The presence or absence of membrane damage was measured by staining the cells with two dyes — 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate (5-CFDA) and Propidium Iodide (PI) — and measuring the intensities of fluorescence of both dyes using flow cytometry (Methods). The fluorescent form of CFDA leaks out of a cell quickly if it is membrane damaged. PI permeates cells with damaged membranes. Taken together, these dyes allow a clear distinction between membranedamaged cells and cells with intact membranes, showing up as two distinct clusters in the data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<bold>A</bold>,<bold>B</bold></xref>). Each point on these plots represents a single cell. We compute a single metric that combines this information to estimate the total membrane damage (Methods), which clearly indicates that a smaller fraction of freeze-thaw tolerant cells undergoes membrane damage after freeze-thaw (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<bold>C)</bold></xref>. Further, we sought to understand the effect of membrane damage on cellular survival. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to sort the cells into “membranedamaged” and “membrane-intact” fractions. We then measured the number of colony forming units (CFUs) within each sorted fraction to quantify their viability (detailed description in Supplementary Information). We found that the survival fraction of freeze-thaw tolerant cells within the membrane-damaged sub-population exceeded the wild type by about two orders of magnitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2<bold>D</bold></xref>). Similarly, the viability of freeze-thaw tolerant cells with intact membranes was an order of magnitude higher than the corresponding wild type population.</p>

</fig>
<p>These data indicate that: (i) a significant fraction of cellular death following freeze-thaw is unrelated to membrane damage and (ii) the evolved cells have mechanisms that can aid in survival following membrane damage. This suggests cellular mechanisms and attributes beyond just the membrane protective roles of trehalose.</p>
<p>Increased intracellular trehalose is a defining characteristic of cellular quiescence — a temporary non-proliferating state — during which cells are tolerant to a range of stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Therefore, we next investigated if the freeze-thaw tolerant cells exhibit traits similar to those of quiescent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. We started by probing the morphological and physical traits of freeze-thaw tolerant cells in the stationary phase – the point in their population growth stage at which the freeze-thaw stress was imposed.</p>

<title>Freeze-thaw tolerant cells are smaller, denser, and exhibit reduced budding</title>
<p>To investigate if there could be any morphological changes associated with the increased survival of cells, we imaged cells of the wild-type yeast and the freeze-thaw tolerant yeast at stationary phase to measure their size (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>A</bold></xref>). We observed a two-fold reduction in cell area (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>B</bold></xref>), which corresponds to an estimated six-fold volume reduction in freeze-tolerant cells. A decrease in cell volume could be due to a decrease in its mass and/or increase in cell density. By measuring the single cell mass density of cells at stationary phase using a density gradient column, we found that the freeze-thaw tolerant cells had a significantly higher cell density (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>C</bold></xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>From the cellular morphologies, we also found a reduction in the incidence of budding in the evolved cell population (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>D</bold></xref>), suggesting that they stopped doubling before reaching stationary phase and could have exited the proliferating phase of the cell cycle. This is also corroborated by a measurement of total amount of cellular DNA — the evolved cell population has reduced fraction of dual DNA copies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>E</bold></xref>), suggestive of quiescence.</p>
<p>The increased cellular mass density suggests that there could be an associated increase in molecular crowding in the cytoplasm, thereby reducing cytoplasmic mobility and increasing cellular stiffness. Since we also observed reduced membrane damage, we investigated if the freeze-thaw tolerant cells are more mechanically resilient.</p>

<title>Freeze-thaw tolerant cells are mechanically stiffer</title>
<p>Yeast cells are naturally ellipsoid due to the presence of a stiff cell wall. Exposure to Zymolyase, a cell-wall digesting enzyme, leads, over time, to the formation “spheroplasts”, spherical cells bound by a lipid membrane. We used these Zymolyase treated cells to quantify their stiffness, by employing deformability cytometry a method previously described by Otto <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Briefly, the cytometry is performed by suspending the Zymolyase treated cells in a viscous buffer and flowing them through a narrow microfluidic channel. The resultant shear causes cellular deformation, which is measured using high-speed imaging (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>F</bold></xref>). The deformation of cells due to shear is quantified by their eccentricity in relation to their size. For a given cell size, lower cell stiffness results in a higher deformation and, therefore, higher eccentricity. From such a measurement, we found two clusters of freeze-thaw tolerant cells with a majority of cells minimally deformed, compared to the freeze-thaw sensitive (WT) cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>G</bold></xref>). The presence of two clusters indicates increased cellular stiffness even after the long Zymolyase treatment. Munder <italic>et al</italic>. found that cells that had increased cytoplasmic stiffness did not relax into spheres after treatment with Zymolyase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Hence, the relaxation of freeze-thaw tolerant cells from ellipsoidal to spherical upon treatment with Zymolyase could be affected either by their cytoplasmic stiffness or their cell wall resilience due to a varied cell wall composition that is not affected by Zymolyase to the same extent. Therefore, we further investigated the role of these two factors – cell wall resilience and cytoplasmic stiffness – in increased cellular stiffness.</p>
<p>In yeast, the cell wall maintains the structure of the cell. When the cell wall is removed and cells are placed in a hypo-osmotic environment, cells lyse as they cannot regulate the amount of water permeating the cell. Therefore, to investigate the presence of the cell wall after digestion with Zymolyase, we exposed cells to Zymolyase for varying lengths of time in an appropriate buffer followed by a hypo-osmotic environment <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. pure water (Supplementary Information). Cells lacking cell-wall lyse in water. So, we measured the turbidity of the solution after placing the cells in water as a measure of the fraction of intact cells. A significant fraction of the freeze-thaw tolerant cells do not lyse even after exposure to Zymolyase for long periods of time, compared to the duration taken for most of the freeze-thaw sensitive cells to lyse (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>H</bold></xref>). This suggests three possibilities - (a) the freeze-thaw tolerant cells have an altered cell wall composition that is not easily digested by Zymolyase, (b) the cells have an altered membrane structure (as seen above) that does not allow water to enter the cell even after cell wall digestion, or (c) an increased cytoplasmic stiffness that does not allow cells to relax after cell wall digestion and hence the cellular components do not spread into solution enough to change the turbidity of the solution.</p>
<p>These results suggest that cells of the adapted population have increased mechanical (structural) resilience associated with modified cell wall or cytoplasmic properties. Next, we specifically investigated the cytoplasmic rheology to understand the nature of the increased cellular stiffness.</p>

<title>Freeze-thaw tolerant cells exhibit reduced cytoplasmic mobility</title>
<p>To study the cytoplasmic mobility, we tracked the intracellular motion of engineered fluorescent particles (41 nm diameter) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>I</bold></xref>). Briefly, to produce these fluorescent particles, we transformed the wild type CEN.PK strain to express genetically encoded multimers (GEMs) using a plasmid developed by Delarue <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Delarue <italic>et al</italic>. replaced the INO4 promoter with the monomeric fluorophore sequence fused with the INO4 promoter and selected for the integrants using uracil auxotrophy. We inserted the monomeric fluorophore fused with the INO4 promoter at the HO locus in a prototroph which does not affect growth characteristics significantly in a diploid strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. The plasmid also contained a KanMX marker for selecting the integrants using resistance to G418 (full details in the Supplementary Information). We imaged the GEMs expressed in the cell using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, used image analysis to track the particles and analysed the trajectory dynamics using custom written MATLAB code.</p>
<p>To quantify the mobility of these particles, we calculated the mean squared displacement (MSD) for several trajectories of many cells. Two-dimensional MSD is related to the time window, <italic>t</italic>, in which it is calculated by MSD(<italic>t</italic>) <italic>∼ t</italic><sup><italic>α</italic></sup>, where the exponent, <italic>α</italic>, is related to the dynamics of the particles. We calculated the MSD across all trajectories of all replicates, with each line on the plot representing an average of 10’s of thousands of single particle trajectories. We found that the MSD is lower for particles in the cytoplasm of freeze-thaw tolerant cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>J</bold></xref>). This suggests reduced mobility of particles in the cytoplasm of freeze-thaw tolerant cells. From the time and ensemble-averaged MSD, we find <italic>α</italic> ≈ 0.83 for particles in the cytoplasm of freeze-thaw sensitive cells and <italic>α</italic> ≈ 0.77 for particles in the cytoplasm of freeze-thaw tolerant cells. The probability density function, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>α</italic>), of the exponent, calculated by fitting the time-averaged MSD of a particle (Supplementary Information) to a power law, further reveals a larger fraction of particles exhibiting a significantly restricted motion in the freeze-thaw tolerant cells compared to the WT cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3<bold>K</bold></xref>). We find decreased cytoplasmic mobility and increased confinement of particles in the cytoplasm across all freeze-thaw adapted replicate lines (more details in the Supplementary Information).</p>

<title>Freeze-thaw tolerant cells exhibit quiescence-like properties</title>
<p>The morphological and physical attributes that we described thus-far have been associated with the entry of yeast cells into a quiescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]. It is known that trehalose promotes efficient cellular entry into quiescence and reentry into the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Further, higher intracellular trehalose causes a decrease in growth rate of the cell upon re-entry into exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Higher trehalose levels also lead to a decrease in lag phase duration [16, 44– 46]. Therefore, we measured the population growth characteristics of the control and evolved populations after a freeze-thaw at stationary phase. The optical density (OD) of the cell cultures (absorbance at 600nm) was measured to obtain the relative cell concentrations over the course of growth using a spectrophotometer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<bold>A</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>The growth rates of the populations were calculated for the glucose metabolism phase of exponential growth from the maximal slope of the OD curve. Indeed, we found that the minimum doubling time for the evolved populations was longer than that for the WT populations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<bold>B</bold></xref>). Further, the WT population of cells exhibited a 60% longer lag duration (calculated as time taken to reach the maximal growth rate) than the evolved population of cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<bold>C</bold></xref>). These results corroborate previous studies that associate higher intracellular trehalose levels with decreased growth rate and lag phase duration and, therefore, transition to a quiescent state.</p>

<p>Based on these data, we hypothesized that the freeze-thaw tolerant population is enriched with quiescent cells which leads to a high survival fraction. In this case, selection for quiescence would be equivalent to selection for freeze-thaw tolerance. However, it is not feasible to experimentally select for quiescence; therefore, to investigate this hypothesis, we numerically simulated the adaptation of yeast based on the ability of cells to enter and exit quiescence.</p>

<label>H.</label>
<title>Selection based on trehalose linked entry into a quiescence-like state recapitulates the adaptation dynamics</title>
<p>We developed a population level model with trehalose concentration acting as the sole phenotype under selection, since trehalose levels determine the growth rate, probability of entering quiescence, survival probability after a freezethaw, and lag phase duration before re-entry into the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (full details of the model are in the Supplementary Information).</p>
<p>Briefly, we start with an initial cell population characterized by a Gaussian distributed phenotypic trehalose levels. The trehalose level for each cell in stationary phase is correlated with its growth rate in log phase, and assume that it directly determines (a) the probability of going into a quiescent state upon encountering starvation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>], (b)the probability of survival after freeze thaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>], and (c) the duration of lag phase upon re-entry into the cell cycle.</p>
<p>In each cycle of growth-freeze-thaw, the population has differing growth rates, and cells with lower trehalose values have a higher growth rate and a larger number of offspring. Each offspring is allowed a “mutation” which acts to shift its stationary state trehalose concentration with respect to its parent. These mutational effects are drawn from a fat-tailed distribution symmetric about zero <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. most mutations have no effect on the phenotype of the offspring, while the possibility of a few large effect mutations exists. Each cell division uses up a unit of a finite resource, and the population faces starvation when the resource runs out.</p>
<p>Upon starvation, the population differentiates into quiescent and non-quiescent cells. Cells with higher amounts of trehalose have a higher probability of entering a quiescent state. All non-quiescent cells are subsequently assumed to perish when the population is subjected to selection <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. freeze-thaw. The survival of cells after freeze thaw is determined similarly, using a survival probability that increases with the intracellular trehalose concentration. The population that survives freeze-thaw is diluted by selecting a fraction of the population randomly, which is then allowed to enter growth again. The lag phase of each cell is further determined by its trehalose concentration, with cells with higher trehalose concentrations facing a shorter lag time.</p>
<p>Thus, the states of quiescence and increased survival under freeze thaw cause the population distribution to shift to higher values of mean trehalose. Similarly, cells with higher trehalose have longer periods of growth due to a shorter lag phase, and take over more of the population with each generation of offspring. This effect is diminished slightly by the fact that higher trehalose also leads to a smaller growth rate, but is not strong enough initially to stall the increase in mean trehalose of the population. At larger values of trehalose the effect of a decreasing growth rate becomes stronger, leading to saturation of trehalose levels over the course of evolution. We find that when cells are selected in this way for quiescence, the dynamics of the survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<bold>D</bold></xref>) and trehalose levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4<bold>E</bold></xref>) of the adapting population qualitatively resemble the experimentally measured adaptation dynamics (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1<bold>B</bold>,<bold>C</bold></xref>). We speculate that the more sudden jumps seen in the experimental curves could be due to the larger number of replicates in the simulation than what the experiments than what allow for. Altogether, our results suggest that cellular entry into a quiescence-like state facilitates the adaptation to freeze-thaw.</p>

<title>The mechano-chemical adaptation is convergent</title>
<p>Finally, we ask if the results we describe thus far are a result of the specific selection protocol we used for experimental evolution or if they point to a more general mechanism. Therefore, we sought to investigate the phenotypes emerging from a different freeze-thaw selection regime.</p>
<p>To do this, we developed a selection protocol based on exposing cells to multiple consecutive freeze-thaw cycles before a growth cycle (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<bold>A</bold></xref>). First, we note that the survival fraction of the cells decreases exponentially with consecutive freeze-thaw exposures, reducing by about an order of magnitude with the number of consecutive exposures, k<sub>FT</sub> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<bold>B</bold></xref>). Each point obtained by varying k<sub>FT</sub> is, therefore, a quantitatively (and qualitatively) different selection regime. Although the results obtained so far have been obtained from the k<sub>FT</sub> = 1 regime, we now report results from the k<sub>FT</sub> = 3 selection regime. Interestingly, despite nearly two orders of magnitude reduction in the initial viability, the yeast adapted to the k<sub>FT</sub> = 3 regime, with survival close to 40%. We find that the population of cells evolved in this regime also exhibits a multifold increase in basal trehalose levels (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<bold>C</bold></xref>) and reduced budding fractions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<bold>D</bold></xref>). Furthermore, the MSDs obtained from cells of the evolved population in the k<sub>FT</sub> = 3 regime fall directly on top of those obtained from the k<sub>FT</sub> = 1 regime (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<bold>E</bold></xref>); the distribution of the MSD exponents, <italic>p</italic>(<italic>α</italic>) is also quite similar (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5<bold>F</bold></xref>). On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the mechano-chemical phenotype promoting cellular entry into a quiescence-like state is a convergent adaptation.</p>

<title>Distinct genetic routes underlie the adaptations</title>
<p>Since we found a convergent phenotype across all replicates of different freeze-thaw regimes, we performed whole genome sequencing to investigate if the adaptations are associated with a particular genotype (or a specific genetic program). We sequenced samples of the evolved and control populations, collected from the middle and end of the evolution experiment, along with the parent strain (full details in the Supplementary Information). The sequenced reads were analyzed post-filtering for the frequency of occurrences of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions in each replicate population. The final list of all such genetic variants obtained for the freeze-thaw tolerant populations, along with their function, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table V</xref>. Each variant is marked for its mutation type and the sample(s) in which it was detected.</p>

<p>We then checked if any variants were present across multiple samples, as this would imply that the mechano-chemical phenotype found across all replicates was a consequence of a specific genotype(s). We found no variants common across all replicates of both k<sub>FT</sub> = 1 and k<sub>FT</sub> = 3 selection regimes. It must be noted that mutations in different genes with similar or shared functions, or genes linked in cellular pathways, could lead to the same adaptive phenotype. We investigated this aspect using the curated information available on the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> genome database (SGD) on regulatory, metabolic, and physical interactions. We sought to identify a common molecular function or pathway that could have been targeted by different variants across samples. Therefore, we looked for interactions between the different genes and checked if any of the genes are regulators of other genes in the list to understand if there is any complementarity in the genotypes found such that certain replicates have related genotypes. However, no such known cellular network could be found. We also considered changes in gene-copy numbers as a potential basis for observed phenotypes, particularly the increase in intracellular levels of trehalose. Again, we found no gene with a consistent copy-number variation across all replicates (details in the Supplementary Information). These results reveal that the convergent mechano-chemical adaptations seen in this evolution experiment could be achieved with multiple, seemingly disconnected genotypes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using experimental evolution, we have shown that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> can adapt to high freeze rate perturbations in a stereotypical manner, with survival increasing nearly two orders of magnitude over 25 cycles of freezethaw-growth. In all our replicate lines of evolution, the basal intracellular level of trehalose, a sugar speculated to play a physical role in maintaining membrane and cytoplasmic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], exhibited a significant (three-fold) increase in the adapted cells. The adapted cells also show smaller sizes, higher mass densities, and reduced membrane damage. Using rheological measurements we showed that the adapted cells are stiffer and had lower particle mobility within the cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing indicated that the increased survival is associated with multiple, distinct genotypes.</p>
<p>Earlier, independent studies have pointed out the role of increased trehalose to confer stress tolerance in yeast, while not connecting the increased trehalose to a broader physiological context (the trehalose was increased artificially via extracellular means) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Studies have also associated cytoplasmic stiffening with transition to dormancy/quiescence in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>] while not looking at such physical changes in an evolutionarily adaptive sense. Further, Sleight et al used experimental evolution with bacteria to shown that microbes can indeed evolve to increase survival to freeze-thaw stress – in this case, the survival increased only 2 fold, compared to the nearly 40 fold in our case – but concluded that “the physiological mechanism for this fitness improvement remains unknown” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. To our knowledge, our work is the first study showing the <italic>de novo</italic> linkage between increased intracellular trehalose, reduced membrane damage, decreased cytoplasmic mobility, increased cellular stiffness and transition to a quiescence-like state.</p>
<p>The high levels of trehalose could play multiple roles in the increased mechanical resilience of the cell. Reduced membrane damage in freeze-thaw tolerant cells could be a result of altered lipid composition, altered cell wall composition and increased trehalose. Several studies show that increased membrane fluidity of cells was associated with higher freeze-thaw tolerance, with trehalose hypothesized to aid in membrane fluidization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. In addition, our results on the increased cellular stiffness suggest that the cell wall composition could also be altered, thereby protecting the cell wall associated membrane from undergoing damage.</p>
<p>A major cause of death after freeze-thaw has been suggested to be ice crystal formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>]. Ice crystals can damage the cell membrane, proteins in the cytoplasm and disrupt the intracellular structure and organisation, thereby hindering the revival of cellular processes upon thawing. A glassy cytoplasm with decreased mobility is a cytoplasmic rheological state that could aid in retaining cellular structure and organisation during freeze-thaw transitions. Indeed such a cytoplasmic state has been implicated in response to various environmental stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>], also to be a role of trehalose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>] and has long been associated with freeze-thaw tolerance. We found the <italic>de novo</italic> encoding of a similar cytoplasmic state with increased intracellular trehalose in the adapted freeze-thaw tolerant cells.</p>
<p>Trehalose has been shown to be a good glass-former, compared to other sugars like glucose and sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] and has also been found to localise in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Several other studies shown that higher intracellular trehalose levels are associated with tolerance to desiccation, heat, ethanol etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Cakar <italic>et al</italic>. allowed mutagenic lines of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to adapt to various kinds of stresses and found that freeze-thaw tolerant populations were tolerant to multiple other kinds of stress such as high temperature, ethanol and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. The evolution of a mechano-chemically reinforced survival phenotype underscores the role of biophysical constraints in shaping cellular adaptation. Cytoplasmic stiffening and increased trehalose accumulation likely serve as protective mechanisms against mechanical and osmotic damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. This highlights how stress tolerance is not solely dictated by genetic changes but also by modulations in intracellular material properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Beyond yeast, similar adaptations have been observed in bacterial biofilms and dormant cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>], suggesting broader implications for microbial resilience, antibiotic tolerance, and tumor dormancy.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our sequencing analysis did not reveal any mutations directly related to trehalose synthesis, degradation or transport (Table V). Therefore, this increased concentration of trehalose is not of any direct genetic origin, unlike previous studies that used trehalose synthesis, degradation or transport mutants and related viability after freeze-thaw to intracellular trehalose concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>].</p>
<p>While freeze-thaw is lethal to most kinds of cells, several cells survive freeze-thaw on ecological and evolutionary timescales. There have been a few previous studies that used experimental evolution to obtain freeze-thaw tolerance in cells. Kwon <italic>et al</italic>. started with a <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> strain that had a 60% survival fraction after freeze-thaw and the adapted strain was found to have a ≈1.5 fold increase in survival fraction over 150 freeze-thaw-growth cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Sleight <italic>et al</italic>. found only a 2.5 times increase in survival fraction of <italic>E. coli</italic> over 150 freeze-thaw-growth cycles (1000 generations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. Although, these studies are on very different species, they both find <italic>cls</italic> mutants that increase membrane fluidity to be associated with survival. Since these kinds of stress do not cause a drastic reduction in survival, it could lead to a more gradual phenotypic change as fitness is not affected as much – it must be noted that in our experiments, the survival of wild type <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to rapid freeze-thaw is a few percent or lesser. By using freeze-thaw regimes where survival is affected significantly, we found that <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> adapts to have orders of magnitude higher survival in only ≈25 freeze-thaw-growth cycles (≈100 generations). Our observations of stark phenotypic changes could be because of the strong selection regime in which we operate.</p>
<p>The various cellular attributes that we have discovered in our study correlate with those of quiescent cells. The molecular mechanisms of quiescence entry and exit and the characteristics of the quiescent state are only recently being understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>] — specifically it has been uncovered that trehalose promotes efficient entry into and exit from quiescence. Our simulations on trehalose-mediated selection for quiescence suggest that an entry to a quiescence-like state, as well as the ease of re-entering the growth cycle (through lag) facilitates the adaptation dynamics we see in the experiments.</p>
<p>Several studies have found that quiescent cells are more stress resilient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], although the underlying mechanisms underlying have not yet been understood. Specifically, the genetic basis for quiescence is not fully explored. While certain genes involved in the stress response leading to quiescence have been studied through enrichment of quiescent cells in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], these genetic mutations are not present among the adapted populations in our experiments. The emergence of a quiescence-like state in our experimental evolution study, suggests that increased mechanical resilience of a quiescent cell, rather than any specific genetic basis, could be responsible for stress resilience.</p>
<p>By bridging experimental evolution, biophysical characterization, and predictive modeling, our work provides a framework for investigating how cells can rapidly acquire stress tolerance through state transitions rather than relying solely on genetic mutations. Future research should explore the molecular regulation of these adaptive states, including potential epigenetic contributions and metabolic shifts that facilitate quiescence entry and maintenance under extreme conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>].</p>

<title>Intracellular trehalose measurements</title>
<p>Intracellular levels of trehalose were measured based on a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. During evolution of freeze-thaw tolerance, cell colonies were collected in microcentrifuge tubes from plates used to measure CFU 48 hours after thawing. Cells were weighed and suspended in 0.25 ml of 0.25M sodium carbonate. For measurements after the evolution experiment, 500ul of stationary phase culture was centrifuged at 3000 rcf for 2 minutes to remove media. The cell pellet was then washed with Phosphate Buffered Saline and suspended in 0.25 ml of 0.25M sodium carbonate.</p>
<p>The tubes were gently sonicated for a minute and then incubated at 95°C for 4 hours to lyse the cells and break down all existing glucose. The suspension was buffered to pH 5.2 by adding 0.15 ml of 1M acetic acid and 0.6 ml of 0.2M sodium acetate for trehalase activity. The mixture was then incubated with 0.025U/ml trehalase (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog no. - T8778) at 37°C overnight with shaking to break down trehalose into two glucose molecules. The suspension was then centrifuged at 16,900g for 5 minutes and the supernatant was assayed for glucose using a glucose assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog no. - GAGO20). The glucose assay was performed using a 96-well plate. 40 <italic>µ</italic>l of the appropriately diluted supernatant was added to each well so that the glucose concentration was within the dynamic range of the assay (20-80 mg/ml). The plate was incubated for 5 minutes at 37° C, followed by the addition of 80ul of the assay reagent to each well to start the colorimetric reaction. The plate was then incubated at 37° C and the reaction was stopped after 30 minutes by adding 80ul of 12N sulfuric acid to each well. The absorbance of each well was measured at 540 nm to calculate the concentration of glucose (and therefore trehalose) from a standard curve.</p>

<title>Membrane damage and survival measurements</title>
<p>Lysis of cells after freeze-thaw was checked using BD FACSVerse™ Cell Analyzer by measuring the concentration of intact cells before and after freeze-thaw. To investigate membrane damage, cells were stained using the FungaLight™ Yeast CFDA, AM/Propidium Iodide Vitality Kit (Invitrogen, Catalog no. - F34953). Cells were then analysed using a BD FACSAria™ Fusion Flow Cytometer. The cells clustered into two populations on the CFDA vs propidium iodide plot - one membrane-damaged population and one membrane intact population. The two populations were sorted and the concentration of cells in each population was analysed on the BD FACSVerse™ Cell Analyzer. Further, the sorted cell cultures were treated with 50 ug/ml Ampicillin and spread on YPD agar plates with appropriate dilutions to measure survival by counting the number of Colony Forming Units (CFUs). We also checked that FACS did not affect the viability of the resultant fractions. A membrane damage metric was obtained from the fluorescence intensities of propidium iodide (PI) and 5-CFDA (CFDA) combined as follows:

<title>Modelling Trehalose Dependent Selection</title>
<p>We model the freeze-thaw adaptation by assuming trehalose produced at stationary phase to be the primary phe-notypic marker. We assume that the growth rate of cells, the probability of a cell going into quiescence in stationary phase, the probability of survival under a freeze - thaw cycle, as well as the duration of lag time before re-entry into the cell cycle, depend on this stationary phase trehalose concentration.</p>
<p>We start with a population of <italic>N</italic> individual cells whose intracellular trehalose amount in stationary phase, given by <italic>τ</italic>, is drawn initially from a Gaussian distribution with mean <italic>τ</italic><sub>0</sub> and a narrow peak of with standard deviation<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="625389v3_inline1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></inline-formula>. We take the simplest assumption for the dependence of each cell’s growth rate (or fecundity per unit time in the simulation) on stationary phase trehalose concentration,
<disp-formula id="eqnS5">
<graphic xlink:href="625389v3_eqnS5.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>g</italic><sub>0</sub> is the highest achievable growth rate and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> the amount of trehalose that inhibits growth to effectively zero. At each time step in the growth process, we calculate the number of offspring for each cell according to the above equation, and add them to the population. Each offspring is also subject to a small mutation, which acts to change the trehalose concentration of the offspring with respect to its parent. This mutational effect on offspring trehalose is drawn from a Pearson Distribution at a mutation rate <italic>m</italic> for each offspring. The distribution has a mutational standard deviation <italic>σ</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub>, a kurtosis <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and no skew. Thus, most mutations have no effect upon the offspring’s trehalose, preserving the value inherited from the parent cell. Simultaneously, some large effect mutations, both positive and negative are possible.</p>
<p>For each division, we assume a constant amount of a finite resource is consumed. This continues till the resource runs out and the population faces resource exhaustion. Upon starvation, yeast forms a heterogeneous population of quiescent and non-quiescent cells. We model the switch to quiescence as a stochastic process, where the probability of each cell going into quiescence is given by
<disp-formula id="eqnS6">
<graphic xlink:href="625389v3_eqnS6.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>q</italic></sub> is the trehalose concentration at which probability of quiescence is 50% and <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>q</italic></sub> is a parameter quantifying how quickly the probability rises to 1 as <italic>τ</italic> increases. For each cell we decide the fate of the cell by comparing this probability with a randomly generated number.If the probability given by S6 is higher than the random number the cell goes into a quiescent state. Upon freezing, the non-quiescent population entirely perishes. Among the quiescent cells, the cells with trehalose concentration above a cut off survive, since trehalose has been shown to be correlated with higher survival to stress even in exponential phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. We model the probability of survival,
<disp-formula id="eqnS7">
<graphic xlink:href="625389v3_eqnS7.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is the trehalose concentration at which probability of survival under freeze thaw is 50% and <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> is a parameter quantifying how quickly the probability rises to 1 as <italic>τ</italic> increases. In general we assume that <italic>γ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> <italic>&lt; γ</italic><sub><italic>q</italic></sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> since the freezing process is a harsher stress than nutrient scarcity in stationary phase. Thus, both quiescence and the freeze thaw process shift the mean trehalose of the population to higher values since cells with lower trehalose amounts perish.</p>
<p>When the surviving population is allowed to thaw and re-introduced into a growth medium, the cells with higher trehalose concentrations have a shorter lag time, and begin to grow earlier as trehalose is crucial for re-entry into the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]. Longer lag times mean less resource available for growth because a small amount of resource is consumed even in the lag phase and the amount depends on the length of the lag phase. We again assume a linear relationship between the lag time and trehalose amounts,
<disp-formula id="eqnS8">
<graphic xlink:href="625389v3_eqnS8.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where <italic>l</italic><sub>0</sub> represents the maximum lag time possible, and <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>l</italic></sub> the trehalose value at which the lag time reduces to zero.</p>
<p>In each growth cycle, a higher trehalose value thus means a shorter lag phase, and more time available for growth, while simultaneously causing a lower growth rate. Lastly, we model the dilution process of the experimental setup by randomly selecting a fraction <italic>d</italic> of the population. This can introduce additional stochasticity into the evolution process.</p>
<p>At lower values of trehalose, the effect of a lower growth rate is not sufficient to stop the increase in mean trehalose of the population caused by a shorter lag phase. Cells with higher trehalose are able to produce a larger number of offspring and take over the population.</p>
<p>As the population undergoes another round of growth and glucose exhaustion, we once again have a heterogeneous population, with the distribution of quiescent cells now having a higher mean amount of trehalose production. A larger proportion of the cells are now able to survive the freeze-thaw process because of this upward shift. Hence, our simulation includes both a component of trehalose-dependent stochastic switching to quiescence, as well as growth and lag mediated selection for higher trehalose levels. The trade-off between the decrease in growth rate and the positive effect on all other factors from increasing trehalose sets the final equilibrium value of trehalose in the simulations. The effect of a lower growth rate begins to dominate at larger trehalose values, causing the mean trehalose of the population to stagnate.</p>
<p>Since the increase in the mean trehalose for the population is driven entirely by new beneficial mutations, the trajectory of individual replicates shows many jumps in the mean trehalose. The averaging over several replicates smoothens out the curve since the mutations, and the resulting sweep of the population can occur at different time points. Parameter values used in our simulation can be found in Table III.</p>

Samples aliquoted and stored at -80°C during the evolution experiment were inoculated and grown as a liquid culture to stationary phase. DNA from cells of these cultures was isolated using a Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamylalcohol extraction method. A DNA library was generated from this using the library preparation kit - Illumina® DNA Prep, (M) Tagmentation (Catalog no. - 20018705). The library was then amplified by PCR and sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000 platform using an SP flowcell with a sequencing read length of 2×100bp to obtain paired-end reads for all 26 samples.</p>

<title>Preparation of reads for mapping</title>
<p>Trimmomatic was used to filter and trim reads prior to mapping. Bases were trimmed from either end if their quality was below 20. Additionally, the first 20 bases were removed regardless of their quality. Illuminaclip command was used to remove adapter sequence contaminants from read sequences. Trimmomatic first searches for a near exact match of a short adapter segment, of a maximum of 16 bp, within reads and then attempts to extend such “seed” sequences. A maximum of two mismatches were permitted in the seed sequences. A score of 30 (<italic>∼</italic>50 bases match) was required to consider the read a palindromic match (when the read-through was detectable on both reads of a pair) and a score of 10 for a direct match. The minimum adapter length required to be detected was set to 2 in the palindromic mode. Both reads were retained after the clipping. Reads of a minimum length of 60 after clipping were retained. The adapter sequence used was “CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT”, specific to the sequencing platform. The following command was run to apply the above-mentioned filters:</p>

<title>Variant filtering</title>
<p>All filtering operations were performed using bcftools. First, the SNP and Indel variants were separated.

<p>Variants of either type present in parental samples were extracted using the following command:</p>
<preformat>
bcftools view -s &lt;sample1,sample2&gt; -a --min-ac 1
</preformat>
<p>Option -a was used to remove alternative alleles from ALT not seen in the subset. Option {min-ac was used to only print the line with at least 1 non-reference allele remaining.

<p>Option -x was used to print sites where only the subset of samples have a non-ref allele. Option -v was used to extract SNP or Indel variant types.</p>
<p>Further, the private variant files for the parental samples CTC1P1 and CTC3P1 were merged. This list was subtracted from the collection of all parental variants to get a list of variants shared by both parents. Variants that were mutant homozygous in both samples were extracted and used as true variants (182 SNPs + 186 Indels). Heterozygous variants were extracted from the set of private variants and used as false variants (143 SNPs + 142 Indels).</p>

<title>Frequency-based filtering</title>
<p>Up to three non-ref alleles were present for Indels. Frequencies for each non-reference allele were extracted and analyzed separately. For SNPs, only one site with more than one non-reference allele was found for both experiments. The second non-reference allele at the SNP site in the 1-Freeze Thaw experiment was present only in one of the control samples. The SNP site with more than one non-reference allele in the 3-Freeze Thaw experiment had low depth of coverage, exceeding 10 in only one sample with only one or two reads for the alternate allele.</p>
<p>To obtain frequencies of the first non-ref allele for each variant, we used the following query:</p>

<p>A 95% confidence interval for each frequency estimate was obtained to determine whether a significant change occurred in the frequency of a variant in any sample during the course of the evolution experiment. Given the observed frequency of the variant in a sample of reads, the likelihood of different values for the true population frequency was evaluated assuming a binomial distribution of variant read counts. A minimum requirement of 10 total reads at a position was imposed to estimate frequency intervals. The minimum and maximum frequency values at which the probability of observed count falls below 5% constitute the limits of the confidence interval. Only the variants satisfying this condition in the reference as well as in the majority of samples were retained. Where the non-ref allele was already at almost 100% frequency in the parent, the frequency of the reference allele was followed instead. A mutant was removed if its frequency never exceeded 1%. A site was considered invariant if the upper estimate corresponding to its lowest frequency was greater than the lower estimate of its highest frequency. All invariant sites and sites where the minimum frequency change did not exceed 20% in any sample were excluded. The selected variant positions were pooled over experiments, the corresponding variants extracted from the raw VCF, and annotated using snpeff with a locally-built snpeff database for the reference assembly used in this study.</p>

<title>Estimation of the population frequency of a gene-duplicated mutant</title>
<p>Copy number variation is another genotypic variant that could affect phenotype. Therefore, the genome was analysed for changes in copy numbers of genes. The coverage for each gene of each sample was used to estimate the change in copy number of the gene. The following model was used to estimate the frequency of copy number variants in a population, assuming that all copy number variants are gene duplications.</p>
<p>Regions of a genome are sequenced to varying depths due to sequencing bias. Let <italic>x</italic> be the per-base depth of coverage to the reference of a gene that’s present in a single copy in the sample. If an additional copy of the gene is present in the sample in the same region of the genome, then the expected coverage is 2<italic>x</italic>. However, if the second copy is in a different region which is represented in the sequencing data at a factor r of the mean coverage of the original region, then the total expected coverage of the duplicated gene is <italic>x + rx</italic>.</p>
<p>The above expression would be sufficient if the genome of a single clone with two copies of the gene was sequenced, or if the entire population carried the duplicated gene. Instead of single clones, we have sequenced samples of the whole population, and we have seen in the SNP analysis that some key mutants are present in the majority of the population but not in the entire population. Therefore, we must account for the possibility that the additional copy of the gene is only present in a fraction <italic>f</italic> of the population, which makes the expression for the expected coverage to be <italic>x</italic> (1+ <italic>rf</italic>), where <italic>x</italic> is the expected coverage of the gene in the absence of duplication.</p>
<p>The depth of sequencing coverage is expected to vary from sample to sample, leading to variation in the coverage of any target gene across samples even in the absence of duplication. Therefore, a normalization of gene coverage to sample coverage is required. Coverage of a gene normalized to median coverage of its chromosome for a sample should be similar across samples in the absence of gene duplication. In particular, we derived the expected coverage of a gene in a sample in the absence of duplication (<italic>x</italic> <sub>ij</sub>) by using the relation where <italic>x</italic> <sub>i0</sub> is the observed coverage of gene <italic>i</italic> in the parent sample and <italic>x</italic> <sub>m-</sub> is the median coverage of the chromosome of gene <italic>i</italic> in the parent or in sample <italic>j</italic>. With this, the expected coverage of a gene in a sample in case of a duplication event is <italic>x</italic> <sub>ij</sub>(1+<italic>rf</italic>).</p>
<p>The expected coverage of a duplicated gene, based on the above model, can be equated with its observed coverage in sample, from which, a measure of <italic>rf</italic> can be obtained as (Obs – Exp) / Exp. In this expression, the population frequency <italic>f</italic> of a gene-duplicated mutant is confounded with the variation in coverage across chromosomal regions, measured with <italic>r</italic>. Since a gene-specific estimate of <italic>r</italic> cannot be obtained based on coverage alone, we estimated the range of <italic>r</italic> from gene-to-gene variation in normalized depth of coverage seen in parent samples assuming that they carry no duplicated genes relative to the reference. The 95 % Confidence Interval of <italic>r</italic> based on parent samples was (0.7,1.5). Given the expression for <italic>rf</italic>, lower and upper estimates of population frequency of a gene-duplicated mutant in a sample can be obtained by using the upper and lower bounds on <italic>r</italic> respectively. The median of these two estimates is taken to be the central estimate of the population frequency <italic>f</italic>. Note that while <italic>r</italic> can exceed 1, <italic>f</italic> must be restricted to the closed interval [0,1]. Thus, estimates of population frequency less than 0 or greater than 1 were replaced with 0 or 1 respectively.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study demonstrates that yeast populations can rapidly evolve freeze-thaw tolerance by converging on a trehalose-rich, quiescence-like state, illuminating a general physiological route to extreme-stress adaptation. The evidence is <bold>solid</bold>, combining rigorous experimental-evolution design with multi-scale phenotyping, biophysical measurements, whole-genome sequencing, and quantitative modeling that together support the mechanistic conclusions. Questions about the novelty relative to prior growth/stress tolerance links, the precise genetic versus non-genetic drivers of trehalose up-regulation, and the breadth of independently evolved lines. These are areas for clarification, but these do not substantially weaken the overall contribution.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript presents findings on the adaptation mechanisms of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under extreme stress conditions. The authors try to generalize this to adaptation to stress tolerance. A major finding is that S. cerevisiae evolves a quiescence-like state with high trehalose to adapt to freeze-thaw tolerance independent of their genetic background. The manuscript is comprehensive, and each of the conclusions is well supported by careful experiments.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is excellent interdisciplinary work.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: .</p>
<p>I have questions regarding the overall novelty of the proposal, which I would like the authors to explain.</p>
<p>(1) Earlier papers have shown that loss of ribosomal proteins, that slow growth, leads to better stress tolerance in S. cerevisiae. Given this, isn't it expected that any adaptation that slows down growth would, overall, increase stress tolerance? Even for other systems, it has been shown that slowing down growth (by spore formation in yeast or bacteria/or dauer formation in C. elegans) is an effective strategy to combat stress and hence is a likely route to adaptation. The authors stress this as one of the primary findings. I would like the authors to explain their position, detailing how their findings are unexpected in the context of the literature.</p>
<p>(2) Convergent evolution of traits: I find the results unsurprising. When selecting for a trait, if there is a major mode to adapt to that stress, most of the strains would adapt to that mode, independent of the route. According to me, finding out this major route was the objective of many of the previous reports on adaptive evolution. The surprising part in the previous papers (on adaptive evolution of bacteria or yeast) was the resampling of genes that acquired mutations in multiple replicates of an evolution experiments, providing a handle to understand the major genetic route or the molecular mechanism that guides the adaptation (for example in this case it would be - what guides the over-accumulation of trehalose). I fail to understand why the authors find the results surprising, and I would be happy to understand that from the authors. I may have missed something important.</p>
<p>(3) Adaptive evolution would work on phenotype, as all of selective evolution is supposed to. So, given that one of the phenotypes well-known in literature to allow free-tolerance is trehalose accumulation, I think it is not surprising that this trait is selected. For me, this is not a case of &quot;non-genetic&quot; adaptation as the authors point out: it is likely because perturbation of many genes can individually result in the same outcome - upregulation of trehalose accumulation. Thereby, although the adaptation is genetic, it is not homogeneous across the evolving lines - the end result is. Do the authors check that the trait is actually a non-genetic adaptation, i.e., if they regrow the cells for a few generations without the stress, the cells fall back to being similarly only partially fit to freeze-thaw cycles? Additionally, the inability to identify a network that is conserved in the sequencing does not mean that there is no regulatory pathway. A large number of cryptic pathways may exist to alter cellular metabolic states.</p>
<p>
This is a point in continuation of point #2, and I would like to understand what I have missed.</p>
<p>(4) To propose the convergent nature, it would be important to check for independently evolved lines and most probably more than 2 lines. It is not clear from their results section if they have multiple lines that have evolved independently.</p>
<p>(5) For the genomic studies, it is not clear if the authors sequenced a pool or a single colony from the evolved strains. This is an important point, since an average sequence will miss out on many mutations and only focus on the mutations inherited from a common ancestral cell. It is also not clear from the section.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors used experimental evolution, repeatedly subjecting Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations to rapid liquid-nitrogen freeze-thaw cycles while tracking survival, cellular biophysics, metabolite levels, and whole-genome sequence changes. Within 25 cycles, viability rose from ~2 % to ~70 % in all independent lines, demonstrating rapid and highly convergent adaptation despite distinct starting genotypes. Evolved cells accumulated about threefold more intracellular trehalose, adopted a quiescence-like phenotype (smaller, denser, non-budding cells), showed cytoplasmic stiffening and reduced membrane damage, and re-entered growth with shorter lag traits that together protected them from ice-induced injury. Whole-genome sequencing indicated that multiple genetic routes can yield the same mechano-chemical survival strategy. A population model in which trehalose controls quiescence entry, growth rate, lag, and freeze-thaw survival reproduced the empirical dynamics, implicating physiological state transitions rather than specific mutations as the primary adaptive driver. The study therefore concludes that extreme-stress tolerance can evolve quickly through a convergent, trehalose-rich quiescence-like state that reinforces membrane integrity and cytoplasmic structure.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper are the experimental design, data presentation and interpretation, and that it is well-written.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) While the phenotyping is thorough, a few more growth curves would be quite revealing to determine the extent of cross-stress protection. For example, comparing growth rates under YPD vs. YPEG (EtOH/glycerol), and measuring growth at 37ºC or in the presence of 0.8 M KCl.</p>
<p>(2) Is GEMS integrated prior to evolution? Are the evolved cells transformable?</p>
<p>(3) From the table, it looks like strains either have mutations in Ras1/2 or Vac8. Given the known requirements of Ras/PKA signaling for the G1/S checkpoint (to make sure there are enough nutrients for S phase), this seems like a pathway worth mentioning and referencing. Regarding Vac8, its emerging roles in NVJ and autophagy suggest another nutrient checkpoint, perhaps through TORC1. The common theme is rewired metabolism, which is probably influencing the carbon shuttling to trehalose synthesis.</p>
