<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Dystrophin is a critical interacting protein of Nav1.5 that determines its membrane anchoring in cardiomyocytes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the regulation of cardiac ion channels, while their influence on sodium channel remains unexplored. Our preliminary data showed that lncRNA-Dachshund homolog 1 (lncDACH1) can bind to dystrophin, which drove us to investigate if lncDACH1 can regulate sodium channel by interfering with dystrophin. Western blot and immunofluorescent staining showed that cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of lncDACH1(lncDACH1-TG) reduced the membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes. Meanwhile, peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> were reduced in the hearts of lncDACH1-TG mice than wild-type (WT) controls. The opposite data of western blot ,immunofluorescent staining and patch clamp were collected from lncDACH1 cardiomyocyte conditional knockout (lncDACH1-cKO) mice. Moreover, increased ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility was observed in lncDACH1-TG mice <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>ex vivo</italic>. The conservative fragment of lncDACH1 inhibited membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5, and promoted the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmia. Strikingly, activation of dystrophin transcription by dCas9-SAM system in lncDACH1-TG mice rescued the impaired membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5, and prevented the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmia. Furthermore, lncDACH1 was increased in transaortic constriction (TAC) induced failing hearts, which promoted the inducibility of ventricular arrhythmia. And the expression of lncDACH1 is regulated by hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase subunit beta (hadhb), which binds to lncDACH1 and decreases its stability. The human homologue of lncDACH1 inhibited the membrane distribution of Nav1.5 in human iPS-differentiated cardiomyocytes. The findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of Nav1.5 membrane targeting and the development of ventricular arrhythmias.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The voltage gated sodium channel mediates the 0 phase depolarizing inward sodium currents of cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The expression and function of sodium channel is regulated at multiple levels encompassing gene mutation, post-transcriptional modification, post-translational modification and protein trafficking etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The disruption of either process is arrhythmogenic and occasionally causes sudden death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The membrane targeting and localization of pore-forming subunit of sodium channel Nav1.5 was regulated by several interacting proteins such as ankyrin-G, MOG1, syntrophin and dystrophin etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Dystrophin is a cytoplasmic protein that is encoded by duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. It distributes mainly on the cellular membrane of skeletal muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, and acts as a scaffold for Nav1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. In cardiomyocytes, dystrophin controls the expression and membrane anchoring of Nav1.5. Gavillet et al. showed that knockout of dystrophin in cardiomyocytes reduced peak sodium current, Nav1.5 protein expression and conduction velocity in mice <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Subsequently, they confirmed that knockout of dystrophin inhibits membrane distribution of Nav1.5 due to the disruption of dystrophin-syntrophin complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are a new class of RNAs that are more than 200 nts long and possess little protein coding property.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup> LncRNAs have been shown to regulate multiple biological processes and participate in the pathogenesis of various diseases including cardiac diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. LncRNAs were shown to regulate cardiac electrophysiological property by altering the function of different ion channels. For example, the increased expression of lncRNA-Kcna2as in heart failure reduced <italic>I</italic><sub>ks</sub> and prolonged action potential duration (APD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. LncRNA-MALAT1 enhanced arrhythmia susceptibility by suppressing <italic>Ito</italic> and prolonging APD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. In a previous study, we found that lncRNA-CCRR (cardiac conduction regulatory) interacts with connexin-43 interacting protein 85(CIP85) to promote connexin-43 membrane distribution and improve the impaired cardiac conduction of failing hearts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. However, to date, it remains unknown whether and how lncRNA regulates sodium channel.</p>
<p>LncDACH1 is an intronic lncRNA located on the first intron of <italic>DACH1</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. We previously showed that lncDACH1 impairs cardiac function by promoting the degradation of sarco-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), and exacerbates cardiac ischemia injury by inhibiting Yes-associated protein 1(YAP1) mediated proliferation of neonatal cardiomyocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. During analyzing the interacting proteins of lncDACH1 identified by mass spectrometry, we found dystrophin that drove us to hypothesize that lncDACH1 may be a critical regulator of sodium channel Nav1.5.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this study we explored whether lncDACH1 regulates Nav1.5 by interacting with dystrophin. We found that lncDACH1 inhibited the membrane trafficking of Nav1.5 by binding to dystrophin, which led to reduced sodium current and increased ventricular arrhythmia susceptibility. The study highlights a novel mechanism for the regulation of sodium channel trafficking, and reveals a potential therapeutic target for sodium channel dysfunction related cardiac arrhythmias.</p>

<title>LncDACH1 binds to dystrophin and reduces Nav1.5 membrane distribution in cardiomyocytes of lncDACH1 transgenic mice</title>
<p>We first validated the binding between lncDACH1 and dystrophin. The RNA pulldown plus immunoblot assay confirmed that lncDACH1 can successfully pulldown dystrophin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1a</xref>). These data indicated that lncDACH does not interact with Nav1.5 directly. Consistently, the RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) study showed that the antibody for dystrophin precipitated lncDACH1, while the negative control IgG did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Conversely, lncDACH1 failed to pulldown Nav1.5 and anti-Nav1.5 did not precipitate lncDACH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We next explored the influence of lncDACH1 on cellular distribution of dystrophin. The western blot data showed that the total protein of dystrophin did not change, while the membrane fraction was reduced, and the cytoplasmic fraction was increased in the hearts of lncDACH1-TG mice than wild-type (WT) controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1c</xref>). Accordingly, the membrane and total protein levels of Nav1.5 were reduced, while cytoplasmic Nav1.5 increased in the hearts of lncDACH1-TG mice than WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1d</xref>). The reduced membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5 in the cardiomyocytes of lncDACH1-Tg mice was further confirmed by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The mRNA levels of dystrophin and SCN5A did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1f</xref>). We then evaluated the functional change of sodium channel. Consistent with reduction of membrane Nav1.5, the peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> was significantly decreased in the ventricular myocytes of lncDACH1-TG mice than WT controls, while the kinetics of <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> (activation, inactivation, and recovery) did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1g</xref>). Meanwhile, the conduction velocity was slower in the hearts of lncDACH1-TG than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1h</xref>).</p>

<p>We then applied lncDACH1 adenovirus to cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes to confirm the regulation of lncDACH1 on sodium channel <italic>in vitro</italic>. Infection of adenovirus carrying lncDACH1 significantly upregulated the level of lncDACH1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2a</xref>) and remarkably inhibited peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> with no change in kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). The western blot data showed that the total protein of dystrophin did not change, while the membrane fraction was reduced, and the cytoplasmic fraction increased in neonatal cardiomyocytes with lncDACH1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Consistently, the membrane protein level and total protein level of Nav1.5 were reduced, while cytoplasmic Nav1.5 increased in neonatal cardiomyocytes with lncDACH1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). The membrane distribution of dystrophin and Nav1.5 was remarkably reduced by overexpression of lncDACH1 as indicated by immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>). The mRNA levels of dystrophin and SCN5A were not altered by lncDACH1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2e</xref>).</p>

<title>Activation of dystrophin transcription by dCas9-SAM system prevented the reduction of sodium current in lncDACH1 transgenic mice</title>
<p>As lncDACH1 reduced Nav1.5 membrane targeting by interacting with dystrophin, we reasoned that overexpression of dystrophin may rescue the inhibition of Nav1.5 by lncDACH1. To test this notion, we constructed the AAV9 virus carrying dCas9-SAM system that can activate dystrophin transcription (AAV9-Dys-Act) to perform rescuing experiments on lncDACH1-TG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig23">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>).

<title>Hadhb binds to lncDACH1 and promotes its decay</title>
<p>Reduced Nav1.5 expression and reduction of peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> in heart failure have been reported by multiple studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We therefore evaluated the contribution of lncDACH1 on sodium channel remodeling in transaortic constriction (TAC) induced heart failure model in mice. We found that lncDACH1 was increased in failing hearts than sham controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8a</xref>). Although lncDACH1 was upregulated in failing hearts, the mRNA of its host gene DACH1 did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8b</xref>). This finding excluded the transcription related mechanism on lncDACH1 upregulation during heart failure. By analyzing the RNA Pulldown plus Mass Spectrometry data, we identified three potential interacting proteins of lncDACH1 that have been shown to regulate RNA stability. They are ANP32a (acidic leucine-rich nuclear phosphoprotein 32A), eIF4A1(eukaryotic initiation factor 4A1) and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase subunit beta (hadhb). We therefore speculated that it may be the change of RNA stability that renders to the expression change of lncDACH1. We then tested whether these proteins can affect lncDACH1 level by knocking down their expression with siRNA. The data showed that knockdown of hadhb increased the expression of lncDACH1, while knockdown of ANP32a and eIF4A1 produced no influence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8c</xref>). The influence of hadhb on lncDACH1 stability was further validated by the fact that knockdown of hadhb increased the decaying half-life of lncDACH1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8d</xref>). Furthermore, the sense sequence of lncDACH1 successfully pulled down hadhb, and the antibody of hadhb precipitated lncDACH1(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8e</xref>). Additionally, the protein level of hadhb was reduced in mouse failing hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8f</xref>), which is inversely correlated to the upregulation of lncDACH1. The siRNA for hadhb reduced the expression of Nav1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8g</xref>). These data indicated that hadhb is an upstream regulator of lncDACH1 which determines the stability of lncDACH1.</p>
<p>We lastly evaluated the human conserved sequence of lncDACH1(hcF-lncDACH1) on Nav1.5 distribution of human iPS induced cardiomyocytes. We found that overexpression of hcF-lncDACH1 reduced the membrane distribution of Nav1.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig24">Supplemental Fig. 16</xref>). To confirm the arrhythmogenic effects of hcF-lncDACH1 in hiPSC-CM model, we overexpressed hcF-lncDACH1. We found that overexpression of hcF-lncDACH1 significantly inhibited sodium current and the Vmax of APD upstroke (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig25">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). These data indicate the arrhythmogenic effects of hcF-lncDACH1, and imply that knockdown of hcF-lncDACH1 may reduce the susceptibility of arrhythmia.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we discovered that lncDACH1 is critical regulator of sodium channel in the heart. LncDACH1 binds to dystrophin and thus inhibits membrane trafficking of Nav1.5, which leads to the reduction of peak sodium current and impairment of cardiac conduction. Therefore, upregulation of lncDACH1 increased the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8i</xref>).</p>
<p>LncRNAs have been established to be critical regulators of various biological processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The action modes of lncRNAs are complex. One major mechanism for them to exert their biological function in the cytoplasm is to interact with such as proteins, miRNAs, mRNAs to alter protein translation, enzyme activity, protein degradation, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. For instance, lncRNA-CCRR was shown to inhibit the endocytic trafficking of connexin-43 by binding to CIP8512. LncDACH1 mainly distributes in the cytoplasm, and can bind to SERCA2a to promote its ubiquitination and degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. LncDACH1 can also bind to protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit alpha (PP1A) to inhibit its dephosphorylation activity on yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), leading to the cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. The unraveling of the molecular mechanism of Nav1.5 is critical for the insightful understanding of sodium channel function under physiological and pathological conditions. Several interacting proteins have been demonstrated to determine membrane distribution of Nav1.5 and sodium channel function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Dystrophin is a well-characterized Nav1.5 partner protein. It indirectly interacts with Nav1.5 via syntrophin, which binds with the C-terminus of dystrophin and with the SIV motif on the C-terminus of Nav1.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that lncDACH1 binds to dystrophin and leads to the impairment of Nav1.5 trafficking and reduced membrane distribution.</p>
<p>Although the membrane distribution of both dystrophin and Nav1.5 was inhibited by lncDACH1, the total protein level of dystrophin was not affected, while Nav1.5 was reduced. The mechanism for the differential influence of lncDACH1 on total protein levels of dystrophin and Nav1.5 is unclear. One explanation may be that Nav1.5 is a membrane channel protein. If they failed to target on the plasma membrane, they may be regarded as unnecessary protein and undergo the process of protein degradation. The E1-E3 enzymes in the ubiquitination systems have been shown to regulate the degradation of Nav1.5, which includes E1 enzyme UBE1(Ubiquitin-activating Enzyme1), UBA6(Ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 6), E2 enzyme, UBC9 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 9), and E3 ligase Nedd4–2 (neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4–2) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. LITAF (lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor), a protein encoding a regulator of endosomal trafficking, was shown to reduce surface Nav1.5 by promoting degradation of NEDD4–2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, cytoplasmic Nav1.5 that failed to target on plasma membrane may be quickly distinguished and then degraded by these ubiquitination enzymes(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig26">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>).</p>
<p>The dysfunction of sodium channel is associated with various arrhythmias. Reduced peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> due to SCN5A loss-of-function mutation can cause a series of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, sudden cardiac death, and ventricular tachycardia etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Consistently, we found that accompanied with the reduction of peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>, overexpression of lncDACH1 reduced ventricular conduction velocity and increased the susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmia in mice. The increased peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> due to SCN5A gain-of-function mutation is associated arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, long QT syndrome; polymorphic ventricular complexes and ventricular arrhythmia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In this study, although the peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> increased in lncDACH1-cKO mice, the susceptibility to arrhythmia did not increase. One difference of our data with SCN5A gain-of-function mutation is that the kinetics of peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub> often change during mutation, while it is not the case of lncDACH1 knockout. One possible explanation may be that lncDACH1 does not alter Nav1.5 gating, the late Na current may not be enhanced to the same effect as observed with LQT gain-of-function Nav1.5 mutations, in which APD prolongation is attributed to gating defects that increase late Na current.</p>
<p>Sodium channel remodeling is occurs commonly in cardiac diseases especially heart failure. Despite of some discrepancy, the main observations are that the peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Na</sub>, SCN5A mRNA and Nav1.5 protein are reduced during heart failure of both human patients and animal models <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that lncDACH1 was increased during heart failure, indicating that it may contribute to sodium channel remodeling and arrhythmogenesis during heart failure by interfering the action of dystrophin. Interestingly, we found that activation of dystrophin with dCas9-SAM system restored the membrane distribution of Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes of lncDACH1-TG mice, which implies its potential in counteracting sodium channel remodeling of patients with heart failure.</p>
<p>The low sequence conservation of lncRNAs among species is a critical issue that limits the extrapolation of data from animal studies to human beings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. In this study, we found that the conserved fragment of lncDACH1 exhibits the same effect as lncDACH1 on Nav1.5 trafficking and arrhythmogenesis. Moreover, the human conservative homologous fragment of lncDACH1 can inhibit the membrane distribution of Nav1.5 in cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS-CMs). These findings hint the clinical relevance of lncDACH1, which holds the potential to become a therapeutic target for treating sodium channel remodeling in clinic.</p>
<p>In conclusion, lncDACH1 is a novel regulator of sodium channel, which suppresses the membrane trafficking of Nav1.5 by disturbing the function of dystrophin. The current work enriched our understanding of the biology of sodium channel trafficking and function, and indicated that lncRNAs possess the potential to become therapeutic targets for ventricular arrhythmias.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors show that a long-non coding RNA lncDACH1 inhibits sodium currents in cardiomyocytes by binding to and altering the localization of dystrophin. The authors use a number of methodologies to demonstrate that lncDACH1 binds to dystrophin and disrupts its localization to the membrane, which in turn downregulates NaV1.5 currents. Knockdown of lncDACH1 upregulates NaV1.5 currents. Furthermore, in heart failure, lncDACH1 is shown to be upregulated which suggests that this mechanism may have pathophysiological relevance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study presents a novel mechanism of Na channel regulation which may be pathophysiologically important.</p>
<p>(2) The experiments are comprehensive and systematically evaluate the physiological importance of lncDACH1.</p>

<p>This manuscript by Xue et al. describes the effects of a long noncoding RNA, lncDACH1, on the localization of Nav channel expression, the magnitude of INa, and arrhythmia susceptibility in the mouse heart. Because lncDACH1 was previously reported to bind and disrupt membrane expression of dystrophin, which in turn is required for proper Nav1.5 localization, much of the findings are inferred through the lens of dystrophin alterations.</p>
<p>The results report that cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of lncDACH1 reduces INa in isolated cardiomyocytes; measurements in the whole heart show a corresponding reduction in conduction velocity and enhanced susceptibility to arrhythmia. The effect on INa was confirmed in isolated WT mouse cardiomyocytes infected with a lncDACH1 adenoviral construct. Importantly, reducing lncDACH1 expression via either a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout or using shRNA had the opposite effect: INa was increased in isolated cells, as was conduction velocity in the heart. Experiments were also conducted with a fragment of lnDACH1 identified by its conservation with other mammalian species. Overexpression of this fragment resulted in reduced INa and greater proarrhythmic behavior. Alteration of expression was confirmed by qPCR.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which lnDACH1 exerts its effects on INa was explored by measuring protein levels from cell fractions and immunofluorescence localization in cells. In general, overexpression was reported to reduce Nav1.5 and dystrophin levels and knockout or knockdown increased them.</p>
<p>The strengths of this manuscript include convincing evidence of a link between lncDACH1 and Na channel function. The identification of a lncDACH1 segment conserved among mammalian species is compelling. The observation that lncDACH1 is increased in a heart failure model and provides a plausible hypothesis for disease mechanism.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents an important contribution to cardiac arrhythmia research by demonstrating long noncoding RNA Dachshund homolog 1 (lncDACH1) tunes sodium channel functional expression and affects cardiac action potential conduction and rhythms. The evidence supporting the major claims are solid. The work will be of broad interest to cell biologists and cardiac electrophysiologists.</p>
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors show that a long-non coding RNA lncDACH1 inhibits sodium currents in cardiomyocytes by binding to and altering the localization of dystrophin. The authors use a number of methodologies to demonstrate that lncDACH1 binds to dystrophin and disrupt its localization to the membrane, which in turn downregulates NaV1.5 currents. Knockdown of lncDACH1 upregulates NaV1.5 currents. Furthermore, in heart failure, lncDACH1 is shown to be upregulated which suggests that this mechanism may have pathophysiological relevance.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) This study presents a novel mechanism of Na channel regulation which may be pathophysiologically important.</p>
<p>(2) The experiments are comprehensive and systematically evaluate the physiological importance of lncDACH1.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This manuscript by Xue et al. describes the effects of a long noncoding RNA, lncDACH1, on the localization of Nav channel expression, the magnitude of INa, and arrhythmia susceptibility in the mouse heart. Because lncDACH1 was previously reported to bind and disrupt membrane expression of dystrophin, which in turn is required for proper Nav1.5 localization, much of the findings are inferred through the lens of dystrophin alterations.</p>
<p>The results report that cardiomyocyte-specific transgenic overexpression of lncDACH1 reduces INa in isolated cardiomyocytes; measurements in whole heart show a corresponding reduction in conduction velocity and enhanced susceptibility to arrhythmia. The effect on INa was confirmed in isolated WT mouse cardiomyocytes infected with a lncDACH1 adenoviral construct. Importantly, reducing lncDACH1 expression via either a cardiomyocyte-specific knockout or using shRNA had the opposite effect: INa was increased in isolated cells, as was conduction velocity in heart. Experiments were also conducted with a fragment of lnDACH1 identified by its conservation with other mammalian species. Overexpression of this fragment resulted in reduced INa and greater proarrhythmic behavior. Alteration of expression was confirmed by qPCR.</p>
<p>The mechanism by which lnDACH1 exerts its effects on INa was explored by measuring protein levels from cell fractions and immunofluorescence localization in cells. In general, overexpression was reported to reduce Nav1.5 and dystrophin levels and knockout or knockdown increased them.</p>
<p>The strengths of this manuscript include convincing evidence of a link between lncDACH1 and Na channel function. The identification of a lncDACH1 segment conserved among mammalian species is compelling. The observation that lncDACH1 is increased in a heart failure model and provides a plausible hypothesis for disease mechanism.</p>
<p>One limitation of the fractionation approach is the uncertain disposition of Na channel protein deemed &quot;cytoplasmic.&quot; It seems likely that the membrane fraction includes ER membrane. The signal may reasonably be attributed to Na channel protein in stalled transport vesicles, or alternatively in stress granules, but this was not directly addressed.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors report the first evidence of Nav1.5 regulation by a long noncoding RNA, LncRNA-DACH1, and suggest its implication in the reduction in sodium current observed in heart failure. Since no direct interaction is observed between Nav1.5 and the LncRNA, they propose that the regulation is via dystrophin and targeting of Nav1.5 to the plasma membrane.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) First evidence of Nav1.5 regulation by a long noncoding RNA.</p>
<p>(2) Implication of LncRNA-DACH1 in heart failure and mechanisms of arrhythmias.</p>
<p>(3) Demonstration of LncRNA-DACH1 binding to dystrophin.</p>
<p>(4) Potential rescuing of dystrophin and Nav1.5 strategy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The fact that the total Nav1.5 protein is reduced by 50% which is similar to the reduction in the membrane reduction questions the main conclusion of the authors implicating dystrophin in the reduced Nav1.5 targeting. The reduction in membrane Nav1.5 could simply be due to the reduction in total protein.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) What is indicated by the cytoplasmic level of NaV1.5, a transmembrane protein?</p>
<p>This is still confusing. Since Nav1.5 is an integral membrane protein, I am not sure what is really meant here by cytosolic fraction. From the workflow, it seems a separate organelle fraction is also collected. Is the amount of Nav1.5 in this fraction (which I assume includes for e.g. lysosome) also increased with lncDACH1? I recommend the authors to refer to the Nav channels not at the plasma membrane as 'intracellular' rather than 'cytoplasmic'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks for the insightful comment. We completely agree. Accordingly, we have changed “cytoplasmic” to “ intracellular“.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 226. &quot;In consistent with the results&quot; Perhaps unnecessary to have &quot;in&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the insightful comment. We have corrected it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Line 228. Is it optimal or optical?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sorry for the mistake, it should be optical. We have corrected it.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>I still have an issue with the total reduction in Nav1.5 which is about the same as the reduction in membrane and currents. The authors argue that there is an increase in cytoplasmic Nav1.5. However the controls that they provide for membrane and cytoplasmic fractions are not convincing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the insightful comment. We can not rule out the possibility that the reduction in membrane Nav1.5 maybe be due to the reduction in total protein. Our data indicates that the membrane and total protein levels of Nav1.5 were reduced by 50%. However, the intracellular Nav1.5 was not decreased, but increased in the hearts of lncDACH1-TG mice than WT controls, which indicates that the intracellular Nav1.5 failed to traffic to the membrane.</p>
