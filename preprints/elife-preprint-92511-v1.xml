<title>Summary</title><p>Alterations in the function of K<sup>+</sup> channels such as the voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> channel of large conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) reportedly promote breast cancer (BC) development and progression. Underlying molecular mechanisms remain, however, elusive. Here, we provide electrophysiological evidence for a BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variant localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane of murine and human BC cells (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>). Through a combination of genetic knockdown and knockout along with cell permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel blocker, we show that mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates overall cellular and mitochondrial energy production and mediates the metabolic rewiring referred to as the “Warburg effect”, thereby promoting BC cell proliferation in the presence and absence of oxygen. Additionally, we detect mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> and BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in low or high abundance, respectively, in clinical BC specimens. Together, our results emphasize, that targeting mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, combined with established anti-cancer approaches, could represent a novel treatment strategy for selected BC patients.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer represents a complex disease characterized by unconstrained cell proliferation and the spread of malignant cells in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kalia, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Seyfried and Shelton, 2010</xref>). It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, with millions of new cases diagnosed each year(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Globally, the most prevalent form of cancer represents breast cancer (BC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Despite many available anti- cancer treatments which largely depend on the steroid and epidermal growth factor (HER2) receptor status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dunnwald et al., 2007</xref>), cancer cells frequently escape from existing therapies due to adaptions (P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the identification of novel targets and therapeutic strategies that confer benefits for at least a subset of patients, whose cancer displays specific molecular or cellular features, is of utmost relevance.</p>
<p>Important factors that emerged as new cancer targets are ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li and Xiong, 2011</xref>). Especially alterations in the expression levels and function of potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) channels are critically related to cancer malignancy and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Li et al., 2023</xref>, p. 0). One of these channels represents the calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and voltage-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel of large conductance (BK<sub>Ca</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Canonical BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels usually localize in the plasma membrane (PM) of cells, and contribute to the regulation of the cytosolic K<sup>+</sup> content, the PM potential (ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>), cell cycle, -volume, and -motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Opening of BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels results in K<sup>+</sup> efflux, increasing the electrochemical driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the cancer cell and affecting pathological cell growth and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ouadid-Ahidouch and Ahidouch, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, in BC cells (BCCs), an upregulation of BK<sub>Ca</sub> has been associated with increased malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang and Jan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oeggerli et al., 2012</xref>). However, besides their localization in the PM, several K<sup>+</sup> channels, including BK<sub>Ca</sub>, have also been identified in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>), a topic which has been extensively reviewed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Checchetto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kulawiak and Szewczyk, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Szabo and Szewczyk, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Szewczyk et al., 2009</xref>; Wrzosek et al., 2020). mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was first described by Siemen et al. in a human glioma cell line more than 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Siemen et al., 1999</xref>). So far, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> has further been found e.g. in bronchial epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dabrowska et al., 2022</xref>), neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Douglas et al., 2006</xref>), skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Skalska et al., 2008</xref>), and in cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Xu et al., 2002</xref>). In the latter, a splice variant, the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC isoform containing a unique C-terminal exon of 50 amino acids forms the functional mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channel at the IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Little, however, is known about the molecular identity of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> in other cell types, and mitochondrial localization of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in BCCs has not been demonstrated so far.</p>
<p>Cancer cells show increased energy demands due to their high proliferation rates. Thus, tumor cells compensate for their elevated energy demand by increasing metabolic activities and adapting to nutrient- poor metabolic niches in the tumor microenvironment, allowing them to overcome oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>)-dependent mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Eales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gross et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>). This metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, frequently referred to as the “Warburg effect”, describes the phenomenon that cancer cells rather secrete lactate to the extracellular matrix (ECM), instead of utilizing pyruvate to fuel the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Warburg, 1924</xref>). This lactate secretion towards the ECM was shown to promote multiple microenvironmental cues causing tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, extracellular K<sup>+</sup> may also impair effector T-cell function, and, thus, the anti-tumor immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eil et al., 2016</xref>), while, within the cancer cell, functions of several glycolytic enzymes rely on K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; Gohara and Di Cera, 2016). Further, the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to the K<sup>+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix to interfere with mitochondrial volume changes and the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Krabbendam et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, (mito)/BK<sub>Ca</sub>-dependent mechanisms may severely affect energy production pathways and the resulting energy supply of cancer cells.</p>
<p>To elucidate how BK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to increasing BCC malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oeggerli et al., 2012</xref>), we utilized BK<sub>Ca</sub> pro- and deficient human BCC lines including MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7 cells, and primary murine BCCs derived from the mouse mammary tumor polyoma middle T-antigen (MMTV-PyMT)-induced wild type (WT) or BK<sub>Ca</sub> knock-out (BK-KO) BC model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). In these cells, either isoforms of BK<sub>Ca</sub> were expressed, or BK<sub>Ca</sub> was pharmacologically blocked by paxilline or iberiotoxin, two frequently used inhibitors of BK<sub>Ca</sub> that either penetrate the cell or act exclusively at PM localized channels, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Candia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>). These approaches were complemented by patch-clamp experiments, and by measuring the cellular ion homeostasis and metabolism with fluorescence live-cell imaging, extracellular flux analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based approaches.</p>
<p>Our results emphasize that the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in the IMM affects mitochondrial bioenergetics, thereby increasing BCC malignancy. This effect was specifically mediated by the DEC isoform of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, i.e., mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>. Functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was validated by single-channel patch-clamp recordings BCC-derived mitoplasts. Importantly, we also identified BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression in a subset of BC patient biopsies using nanostring-based mRNA expression analysis. Finally, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> crucially contributed to murine and human BCC proliferation and hypoxic resistance, and its activity increased lactate secretion resulting in higher extracellular acidification rates, even in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Combined, our analyses provide, for the first time, a mechanistic link between functionally relevant mitochondrial BKCa isoforms in cancer cells and the promotion of the Warburg effect.</p>

<title><bold>Functional characterization of BKCa expression in BCCs</bold></title>
<p>First, we assessed the functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in established human BCC lines by performing whole- cell patch-clamp experiments. Primary BCCs obtained from transgenic, BC-bearing MMTV-PyMT WT or BK-KO mice were used as positive or negative controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Patch-clamp experiments revealed that depolarizing stimuli delivered in 20 mV increments induced K<sup>+</sup> outward currents that were larger in MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>, and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figs. S1A</xref></bold> and <bold>S1B</bold>). To validate that these increased currents were elicited by BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we pharmacologically inhibited the channel by using either paxilline or iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Candia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>). While the current remained unaffected by these treatments in MMTV-PyMT BK-KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref></bold>), peak currents (I<sub>max</sub>) were drastically reduced in MMTV-PyMT WT cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref></bold>). Further, we analyzed the plasma membrane potential (ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>) in these cells using the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye Dibac4(3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adams and Levin, 2012</xref>). The ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> was more polarized in MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK-KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref></bold>), as expected, due to the presence of hyperpolarizing BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">N’Gouemo, 2014</xref>). Similar current-voltage relationships were recorded using the human BCC lines MDA-MB-453 and MCF-7, expressing either high or low levels of BK<sub>Ca</sub> mRNA transcripts, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Analysis of the outward currents activated by depolarization demonstrated a paxilline- and iberiotoxin-sensitive current in MDA-MB-453 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1C</xref></bold>), indicative for functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in their PM, but not in MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1D</xref></bold>), which is well in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mohr et al., 2022</xref>). Based on the almost non-existent level of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated PM currents in MCF-7 cells, we utilized these cells to express different BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms fused to a red fluorescent protein (RFP). Therefore, we either used the recently identified mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), namely BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, or the same channel lacking the C-terminal amino acids, referred to as BK <sup>RFP</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>We hypothesized, that, in analogy to cardiac myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Singh et al., 2013</xref>), the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> in MCF-7 cells may yield a functional channel present in the IMM. To test this, MCF-7 cells were first transiently transfected either with RFP fused to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor (RFP-GPI) directing RFP to the PM, or with a cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8 (COX8) mitochondrial leading sequence fusion protein (mtRFP) (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E</xref></bold>). Analysis of the colocalization of mtRFP with MitoGREEN, a dye that specifically stains mitochondria, resulted in high colocalization scores, while a low overlap was observed for RFP-GPI transfected MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1E</xref></bold>). Subsequently, the same experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells expressing BK<sup>RFP</sup> or BK <sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>. Although the mitochondrial localization score was lower for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> compared to mtRFP, this BK<sub>Ca</sub> variant showed a significantly higher overlap with the mitochondrial dye than BK<sub>CaRFP</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref></bold>). Nevertheless, as not all RFP signal in the BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> transfected MCF-7 originated from mitochondria, we investigated the PM localization of the two channel isoforms by patch-clamp. Compared to native MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref></bold>), both, BK <sup>RFP</sup> and BK -DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, increased the PM outward current (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figs.

Despite comparable expression levels of the RFP signals (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1H</xref></bold>), presence of BK <sup>RFP</sup> caused significantly bigger currents across the PM compared to BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1H</xref></bold>), indicative either for i) higher intracellular abundance or ii) major functional differences of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>. Importantly, the conductance of both channels was sensitive to the BK<sub>Ca</sub> blockers paxilline and iberiotoxin, yielding comparable PM conductancés to native MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figs.

<p>As BK<sub>Ca</sub> potentially affects cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ouadid-Ahidouch and Ahidouch, 2013</xref>), we next investigated the cytosolic (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2A-C</xref></bold>), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D-F</xref></bold>), and mitochondrial (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2G-I</xref></bold>) Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in these cells. First, we assessed changes in the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>) over-time in response to cell stimulation with the purinergic receptor agonist adenosine-5’- triphosphate (ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Müller et al., 2020</xref>) using the fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Fura-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Grynkiewicz et al., 1985</xref>), either under control conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold>) or in the presence of paxilline (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref></bold>) or iberiotoxin (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref></bold>).

Interestingly, the elevated basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> of WT cells was reduced to BK- KO cell levels in response to paxilline (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A</xref></bold>), but not by iberiotoxin (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2B</xref></bold>), which is a peptide-based pore-blocking toxin that cannot pass the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Candia et al., 1992</xref>).

<p>Next, we visualized changes in the ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>). Therefore, BCCs were transfected with D1ER, an established genetically encoded, FRET-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor targeted to the lumen of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Palmer et al., 2004</xref>). [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was depleted by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> removal and chelation by EGTA, followed by inhibition of the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase (SERCA) with BHQ and activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptors upon purinergic receptor stimulation with ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lape et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Müller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Salter and Hicks, 1995</xref>). Experiments were either performed under control conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2D-F</xref></bold>), or in the presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin for MMTV-PyMT (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2F</xref></bold> and <bold>S2G),</bold> MDA-MB-453 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref></bold>), and MCF-7 cells expressing BK<sub>CaRFP</sub> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>). Throughout all BCCs investigated, expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>, potentially indicating that the channel was i.) functional in this cell compartment and ii.) involved in regulating the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis of the ER. In MMTV-PyMT WT cells, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was restored by the cell-permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor paxilline (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2F</xref></bold>) but not by the cell-impermeable iberiotoxin (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2G</xref></bold>), while both inhibitors restored the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in MDA-MB-453 cells (<bold>Fig.2e</bold>). Accordingly, overexpression of both RFP-tagged BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms in MCF-7 cells depleted the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> reportedly affect the mitochondrial [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Wacquier et al., 2019</xref>). Since an accumulation of K<sup>+</sup> within the mitochondrial matrix may oppose mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Checchetto et al., 2021</xref>), we assessed the effects of functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> utilizing 4mtD3cpV, a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Palmer et al., 2006</xref>). Again, BCCs were treated with ATP to investigate the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> upon cell stimulation. In MMTV-PyMT WT (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref></bold>) as well as MDA-MB-453 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H</xref></bold>), functional expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> reduced basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>. Interestingly, in these two BCC types, basal and maximally elicited [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> peaks increased in response to paxilline (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2G</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2H</xref>, S2J</bold> and <bold>S2K</bold>), but not iberiotoxin treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2G</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figs. S2I</xref>-K</bold>). These findings confirm a role of intracellular located BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels in modulating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> dynamics. Importantly, in MCF-7 cells, basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> was only affected upon expression of the mitochondrially targeted BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not BK <sup>RFP</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref></bold>), whereas neither of the two isoforms affected the maximal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> (<bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2L</xref></bold>). Presumably, by facilitating K<sup>+</sup> fluxes across the IMM, BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression reduces the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and thus the resulting Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the mitochondrial matrix.</p>
<p>In total, our [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] imaging approaches emphasize that different BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms at different localizations, i.e. the PM or intracellular organelles, may either amplify or weaken [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> signals, respectively. These opposing effects are expected as BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated uptake of K<sup>+</sup> into the ER should limit the Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake capacity of this subcellular compartment, while functional channel expression at the PM might increase the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to fuel [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>, however, seems to be exclusively and effectively suppressed by the activity of intracellularly located BK<sub>Ca</sub> variants in MMTV- PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells and solely by the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> in MCF-7 cells.</p>

<title>The metabolic activity of murine and human BCCs is modulated by intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub></title>
<p>Given the involvement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in regulating key features of cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dejos et al., 2020</xref>; Gohara and Di Cera, 2016), we proposed, that BK<sub>Ca</sub> may alter metabolic activities of BCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, we analyzed the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) as a measure of lactate secretion, i.e. glycolytic activity in MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Burgstaller et al., 2021a</xref>). ECAR measurements unveiled an increased basal ECAR of MMTV-PyMT WT compared to BK- KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref></bold>). Subsequently, we performed a mitochondrial stress test by injection of Oligomycin-A, FCCP, and Antimycin-A, which increased ECARs in both cell types due to ATP-synthase inhibition, mitochondrial uncoupling and complex III blockade, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref></bold>). Maximal ECAR, received upon FCCP injection, was elevated in WT compared to BK-KO cells (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref></bold>). Besides this evidence derived from a gene-targeted BK<sub>Ca</sub> channel-deficient model, we used paxilline or iberiotoxin as pharmacological BK<sub>Ca</sub> modulators (<bold><xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figs.

Similar results were obtained in MDA-MB-453 cells, despite in these cells paxilline treatment increased the OCR (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3J-L</xref></bold>), potentially due to the increased supply of oxidative phosphorylation with glycolytic substrates (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3D-F</xref></bold>), while iberiotoxin had no effect.</p>
<p>To confirm that BK<sub>Ca</sub> regulates the bioenergetic profile of BCCs, we subsequently applied LC-MS-based metabolomics according to the workflow presented in <bold>Figure S3E</bold>. We included typical analytes of glycolysis such as lactate (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref></bold>) and pyruvate (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref></bold>), as well as selected metabolites of mitochondrial metabolism including asparagine (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O</xref></bold>) and glutamine (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3P</xref></bold>). Metabolomics data confirmed the metabolic differences between MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells and further demonstrated that BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibition by paxilline directly affected the concentrations of these metabolites (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3M-P</xref></bold>). As observed before for the ECAR and OCR measurements, MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB- 453 cells responded, however, differently to paxilline treatment (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3M-P</xref></bold>).

<p>Interestingly, we found that ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> of MMTV-PyMT cells was tightly dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration ([GLU]<sub>ex</sub>) (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref></bold>). Under high [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> conditions (25.0 mM), the difference in ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> between MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells disappeared, as ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> increased significantly in WT and decreased significantly in BK-KO cells compared to low [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> (2.0 mM). Because F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub>-ATP- synthase (ATP Synthase) may hydrolyze ATP in an attempt to maintain ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>, these results strongly suggest that the forward (ATP producing) <italic>vs</italic> reverse (ATP consuming) mode of the ATP synthase is affected by the BK<sub>Ca</sub> status of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Naguib et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>To unravel the substrate dependency of these BCCs for maintaining their energy homeostasis in dependency of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we measured the mitochondrial ATP concentration ([ATP]<sub>mito</sub>) using a genetically encoded ATP sensor targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, mtAT1.03 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Imamura et al., 2009</xref>). Mitochondrial ATP reportedly responds most dynamically to energy metabolism perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>). To assess the sources of ATP in the cells, we either deprived the cells of [GLU]<sub>ex</sub>, or administered Oligomycin-A to inhibit the ATP-synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Depaoli et al., 2018</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4E-J</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4B</xref>- G</bold>). In MMTV-PyMT cells, glucose removal as well as ATP-synthase inhibition reduced [ATP]<sub>mito</sub>, albeit the effect was more pronounced upon [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> depletion (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4B</xref></bold> and <bold>S4C</bold>). Remarkably, paxilline, but not iberiotoxin treatment reduced the glucose, and increased ATP-synthase dependency of MMTV-PyMT WT cells for maintaining [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4B</xref></bold> and <bold>S4C</bold>). These observations were confirmed in MDA-MB-453 cells, even though i.) these cells showed an overall higher dependency on the ATP-synthase, and ii.) the paxilline-sensitivity of [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> maintenance was much less pronounced (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4G</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4H</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4D</xref></bold> and <bold>S4E</bold>).</p>
<p>To validate these findings in a BK<sub>Ca</sub> deficient model, these experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells either expressing exclusively RFP as control, BK <sup>RFP</sup>, or BK <sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4I</xref></bold>). Expression of BK <sub>Ca-</sub> DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not BK <sup>RFP</sup>, resulted in a high dependency on [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> to maintain [ATP] while the [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> rundown in the presence of Oligomycin A was identical for both BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variants. This suggests that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> specifically triggers a high [GLU]<sub>ex</sub> sensitivity and simultaneously an independency on ATP derived from ATP-synthase for maintaining [ATP]<sub>mito</sub> as demonstrated by the ratio of the respective changes under these experimental conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4I</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4J</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4F</xref></bold> and <bold>S4G</bold>). These findings suggest that intracellular (mitochondrial) BK<sub>Ca</sub> contributes to the metabolic reprogramming of BCCs.</p>
<p>In an extension to extracellular flux analyses, LC-MS metabolomics (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref></bold>), and live-cell imaging experiments (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4A-J</xref></bold>), pointing to a BK<sub>Ca</sub>-dependent “oncometabolic” phenotype, we assessed the concentrations of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide ([H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>mito</sub>) using mitoHyPer3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bilan et al., 2013</xref>), a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator for monitoring H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the mitochondrial matrix (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4K-M</xref></bold>). These experiments demonstrated increased levels of [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]<sub>mito</sub> in MMTV-PyMT WT (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref></bold>) and MDA- MB-453 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4L</xref></bold>), or specifically upon BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression in MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4M</xref></bold>). Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis is caused by uncoupling of the respiratory chain and it is considered as an indicator of mitochondrial stress, which, among other reasons, promotes mutagenesis and BCC progression. In this regard, mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> may serve as an “uncoupling” protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gałecka et al., 2021</xref>), triggering ATP synthase to operate in reverse mode to consume instead of producing ATP, thereby counteracting the dissipation of the proton gradient and consequently the loss of ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>. Consequently, the lack of ATP must be compensated, e.g. by accelerating glycolysis. To investigate this assumption, we performed glucose uptake measurements using 2-NBDG, a fluorescent glucose analogue, which is taken up via glucose transporters (GLUTs), phosphorylated by hexokinase (HK) isoforms to generate 2-NBDG- 6-phosphate and subsequently remains within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4H</xref></bold> and <bold>S4I</bold>). Unexpectedly, we found that MMTV-PyMT BK-KO cells showed a higher rate of glucose uptake and phosphorylation compared to WT cells under basal conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref></bold>). To unravel the role of mitochondria in contributing to glucose uptake by supplying ATP to HKs, we next performed these experiments in the presence of FCCP, which disrupts mitochondrial ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Losano et al., 2017</xref>). If ATP-synthase works in forward mode, FCCP treatment should reduce or even prevent oxidative ATP production, and, subsequently, ATP-dependent 2-NBDG phosphorylation (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4H</xref></bold>). Contrary, if ATP- synthase works in reverse mode, it may compete with HKs for ATP, and FCCP treatment should abolish this competition, leading to increased 2-NBDG phosphorylation in BCCs (<bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4I</xref></bold>). Interestingly, our experiments unveiled increased 2-NBDG uptake in MMTV-PyMT WT and reduced uptake in BK-KO cells upon mitochondrial depolarization (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4N</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4J</xref></bold> and <bold>S4K</bold>). To facilitate the interpretation, we calculated the FCCP-induced change in 2-NBDG uptake. These analyses revealed that mitochondria are less effective in assisting 2-NBDG uptake and phosphorylation in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, while they “support” these processes in BK-KO cells under control conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref></bold>). To test whether the changes in 2-NBDG uptake are sensitive to pharmacological modulation of BK<sub>Ca</sub>, we performed a similar set of experiments in the presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin. While iberiotoxin treatment did not have any effect, paxilline treatment shifted the activity of the ATP-synthase to the ATP-supplying “forward” mode (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4O</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figs. S4J</xref></bold> and <bold>S4K</bold>). Comparable effects were obtained in MDA-MB-453, despite paxilline treatment reduced basal accumulation of 2-NBDG in these cells (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4P</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4Q</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4L</xref></bold>). Overall, the experiments performed so far suggest that mitochondria rather consume than generate ATP if BK<sub>Ca</sub> was functionally expressed intracellularly in BCCs.</p>

<title>BK<sub>Ca</sub> locates functionally in the IMM of murine and human BCCs</title>
<p>So far, our data suggest an important contribution of intracellularly located BK<sub>Ca</sub>, possibly mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, in reprogramming cancer cell metabolism. Thus, we applied an electrophysiological approach to provide functional evidence for endogenous mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>. Single-channel patch-clamp experiments were conducted using mitoplasts isolated from MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells. In MDA-MB-453- and MMTV-PyMT WT-derived mitoplasts we indeed detected channels of large conductance (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A</xref></bold>). For these channels, the open probability did not significantly vary with the voltage (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref></bold>). Only at very negative and positive voltages of approximately -150 mV and +150 mV differences in the open probabilities were observed (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref></bold>). The bursts of single-channel openings showed an average conductance of 212 ± 2 pS (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref></bold>). This large conductance and the sensitivity towards Ca<sup>2+</sup>- (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5B</xref></bold>) and paxilline (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5E</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref></bold>) pointed to mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> that exhibits the pharmacologic characteristics of canonical BK<sub>Ca</sub> channels present at the PM. Overall, our electro-pharmacological experiments unveiled 3 different classes of channels with either small (≤100 pS), medium (≤150 pS) or large (∼210 pS) conductance, where the latter conductivity corresponds to mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 1999</xref>). MitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was detected at a frequency of 15% in 210 patches of MDA-MB-453 mitoplasts and at a lower frequency of 6% in 127 mitoplast patches of MMTV-PyMT WT cells. Importantly, this channel was absent in 76 mitoplast patches from MMTV-PyMT BK-KO and 58 mitoplast patches from MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref></bold>). These findings provide evidence that the molecular entity for the K<sup>+</sup> channel derives from the nuclear <italic>Kcnma1</italic> gene, which is ablated in the MMTV-PyMT BK-KO.</p>

<p>These experiments were further corroborated by immunoblotting experiments using whole-cell lysates and sub-cellular homogenates of different purity. We detected BK<sub>Ca</sub>, the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase as a marker of the PM, and cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV) as a marker of mitochondria in these samples. A protein band corresponding to BK<sub>Ca</sub> was identified not only in whole-cell lysates, but also in isolated mitochondria.

<title>mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> promotes the Warburg effect, triggers cellular O<sub>2</sub> independency and stimulates BCC proliferation</title>
<p>Based on the observed influence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> on glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism, we addressed, whether the channel contributes to the Warburg effect, commonly observed in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bischof et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Warburg, 1924</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the Warburg index (WI) by investigating the cytosolic lactate concentration ([LAC]<sub>cyto</sub>) over-time using Laconic, a FRET-based lactate sensor (San Martín et al., 2013). [LAC]<sub>cyto</sub> was followed in response to either inhibiting mitochondrial metabolism by administration of NaN<sub>3</sub>, a complex IV inhibitor, to stop pyruvate consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Leary et al., 1998</xref>), or upon subsequent inhibition of lactate secretion towards the ECM via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) using BAY-8002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Quanz et al., 2018</xref>) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6A</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref></bold>). Indeed, MMTV-PyMT WT cells exhibited an increased WI compared to BK-KO cells under control conditions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>), indicating that the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> favors lactate secretion rather than TCA-dependent utilization of pyruvate. Paxilline, but not iberiotoxin treatment reduced the WI in WT cells to the BK-KO level (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref></bold>). The WI profiles of MDA-MB-453 (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref></bold>) and MCF-7 cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref></bold>) showed the same sensitivity towards paxilline, while in the latter the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not BK <sup>RFP</sup>, stimulated the WI. To validate the contribution of the different BK isoforms, endogenous BK<sub>Ca</sub> transcripts in MMTV-PyMT and MDA-MB-453 cells were targeted using specific siRNAs targeting either the major BK<sub>Ca</sub> isoforms or specifically the DEC exon of BK<sub>Ca</sub> (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6A</xref></bold>). Cell treatment with the respective siRNAs reduced the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> or BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC (<bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6B</xref></bold> and <bold>S6C</bold>). Interestingly, the knockdown of BK<sub>Ca</sub> interfered with the WI in these cells (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6F</xref></bold> and <bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref></bold>).

<p>As glycolytic metabolites and ATP fuel cell proliferation, we investigated the proliferation rates of MMTV-PyMT WT, MMTV-PyMT BK-KO, and MDA-MB-453 cells over-time in the absence or presence of paxilline or iberiotoxin.

Importantly, if BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was expressed, the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub> well correlated with the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.6060, p = 0.008) (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6M</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>In sum, our experiments emphasize the presence of BK<sub>Ca</sub> in different intracellular organelles including the ER and vesicles of the secretory pathway, yielding its PM localization. At these sites, BK<sub>Ca</sub> modulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and regulates ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub>. K<sup>+</sup> efflux across the PM may additionally affect glycolysis. Importantly, functionally relevant BK<sub>Ca</sub> also locates in the IMM of BCCs, promoting, presumably by the K<sup>+</sup> accumulation in the matrix following channel activation, ΔY<sub>mito</sub> depolarization and consequently ATP- synthase activity in reverse mode as well as a depletion of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub>. These profound ionic and bioenergetic changes ultimately trigger the proliferation of BCCs in a low oxygen environment, as found in solid tumors (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6N</xref></bold>). Taken together, functional expression of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> could possibly denote a prognostic or therapeutic marker for BC patients, and its pharmacologic modulation could represent a novel anti-cancer treatment strategy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrate for the first time that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC (mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>) is functionally expressed in BCCs. BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC modulates BCC metabolism, stimulates the Warburg effect, and accelerates cell proliferation rates in the presence and absence of O<sub>2</sub>. These tumor- and malignancy-promoting effects were sensitive to BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibition using the cell-permeable BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitor paxillin e(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhou and Lingle, 2014</xref>), but not by the cell-impermeable blocker iberiotoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Candia et al., 1992</xref>), indicating that intracellular BK<sub>Ca</sub>, presumably mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, mediates malignant BCC behavior and tumor development.</p>
<p>In line with recent single-cell RNA sequencing data of 26 primary breast tumors (S. Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2021</xref>), we found high transcript levels for BK<sub>Ca</sub> throughout the analyzed BC samples, in addition to BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, albeit in a much smaller subset of BC. Further, we confirmed functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression in the PM of MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells, while MMTV-PyMT BK-KO and MCF-7 cells showed no or very low PM BK<sub>Ca</sub> currents. Therefore, MCF-7 cells represented a suitable model to investigate the effects of BK<sub>Ca</sub> over-/expression on the metabolic homeostasis of human BCC. Similarly to cardiac myocytes, expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC yielded mitochondrial localization of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC, although its abundance in the IMM appeared less pronounced compared to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). While a direct comparison is difficult as plasmid transfections may have caused unexpected effects, our finding that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup> caused significantly reduced currents across the PM compared to BK confirm its increased intracellular abundance. <sup>RFP</sup> putatively</p>
<p>Based on the potential impact of BK<sub>Ca</sub> on the cellular ΔΨ<sub>PM</sub> and ion balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>), we conducted an in-depth investigation of the (sub)cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. Across the BCCs examined, we observed that functional BK<sub>Ca</sub> expression modulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> dynamics. These alterations showed, however, differential sensitivities to BK<sub>Ca</sub> inhibitors in MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells. While basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in MDA-MB-453 cells was reduced by both, paxilline and iberiotoxin treatment, MMTV-PyMT WT cells were only sensitive to paxilline. Examination of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> confirmed the results from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub>, as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> levels increased with paxilline and iberiotoxin in MDA-MB-453, but only upon paxilline exposure in MMTV-PyMT WT cells, suggesting differential effects of intracellular and PM- localized BK<sub>Ca</sub> on Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in these cells. Interestingly, in MCF-7 cells, both BK<sub>Ca</sub> splice variants mediated the opposing effects on the basal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> levels, which either in- or decreased, respectively, upon transient BK <sup>RFP</sup> or BK -DEC<sup>RFP</sup> expression. This is expected as the transitory hyperpolarization and the efflux of K<sup>+</sup> due to the opening of PM BK<sub>Ca</sub> provides the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cytoplasm, while a BK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated K<sup>+</sup> increase within the ER, presumably through PM-directed channels crossing the ER membrane in the secretory pathway, would oppose the Ca<sup>2+</sup> refiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Moreover, these results are in line with the higher proliferative capability of BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient BCCs due to the manifold roles of Ca<sup>2+</sup> as second messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burgstaller et al., 2022a</xref>). Importantly, however, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>mito</sub> of BK<sub>Ca</sub> proficient MMTV-PyMT WT and MDA-MB-453 cells was exclusively sensitive for paxilline, and it was specifically affected by the expression of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>, but not by BK <sup>RFP</sup>, in MCF-7 cells, suggesting that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> pool is exclusively controlled by intracellular BK .</p>
<p>Subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> alterations could reportedly alter cellular bioenergetics, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly regulates metabolic enzymes and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, extracellular flux analysis, LC-MS-based metabolomics and fluorescence-based live-cell imaging confirmed, that the observed alteration in sub- cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis caused by BK<sub>Ca</sub>, especially mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, has severe effects on cell metabolism. Our data further emphasize, that the presence of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, as confirmed by mitoplast patch-clamp and Western blot analysis of isolated mitochondria, depolarizes BCC mitochondria, which is in line with a previous study showing an impact of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> activation on ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kicinska et al., 2016</xref>). mitoBKCa- dependent depolarization of ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub> in turn triggers cellular glucose dependency and reverses the activity of the mitochondrial ATP-synthase to consume ATP for restoring ΔΨ<sub>mito</sub>. Finally, BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC-derived mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> channels promote the Warburg effect and ultimately stimulated proliferation rates of BCCs. Our data fit earlier findings from glioma cells, where an O<sub>2</sub>-sensitivity of mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> was observed, which probably increased the hypoxic resistance of these cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gu et al., 2014</xref>). Excessive production and release of lactate, a hallmark of the Warburg effect, leads to extracellular acidification, subsequently creating a microenvironment that promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis as well as the resistance to anti- tumor immune responses and therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">de la Cruz-López et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nazemi and Rainero, 2020</xref>; P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Extracellular K<sup>+</sup> [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, in turn, accumulating within the necrotic core of solid tumors, was shown to interfere with effector T-cell function triggering immune escape of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eil et al., 2016</xref>). To elucidate whether mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> directly contributes to lactate-induced tumor aggressiveness or [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>ex</sub>, live-cell imaging of extracellular metabolites in 3D BCC models should be applied in future investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burgstaller et al., 2022b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">2021b</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, our results demonstrate for the first time that BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC transcripts are present in human BC biopsies. Although only a small proportion of patients was positive for BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression, this finding could be of considerable clinical relevance considering the link between mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> function and BCC metabolism. Importantly, the design of our study likely underestimates the incidental number of BK<sub>Ca</sub>- DEC positive BC, as i.) only hormone-receptor positive BC specimens were included, and ii.) bulk-tumor mRNA was analyzed, hampering the detection of low-abundant or tightly regulated transcripts against a strong background of non-cancer cells present in bulk tumor tissues. Finally, due to the small number of positive hits (N=10 positive <italic>versus</italic> N=541 BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC negative specimens) and the lack of (sufficient) follow-up information in some of these cases, we are currently unable to correlate BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC expression with, for example, treatment response or survival. Thus, future studies are warranted to show how the tumor’s BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC status can help to predict or therapeutically improve standard chemo-endocrine treatments. The rather low abundance of BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC in the clinical samples, however, is in agreement with our mitoplast patch clamp experiments with mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>-mediated K<sup>+</sup> currents being detected at frequencies between 6 to 15%, suggesting that either a small proportion of mitochondria express functional mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub>, or that the abundance of the channel per mitochondrion is low, requiring sensitive mechanistic approaches for its detection.</p>
<p>In summary, our data highlight a potentially druggable mitoBK<sub>Ca</sub> isoform in BCCs, whose molecular entity is mainly formed by the <italic>Kcnma1</italic> encoded BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC splice variant. This channel promotes metabolic alterations in cancer cells, even under low-oxygen conditions, which may ultimately be of clinical interest for new anti-cancer therapies.</p>

<p>Mouse mammary tumor virus polyoma middle T antigen (MMTV-PyMT) cells were isolated from tumors of MMTV-PyMT transgenic FVB/N WT or BK-KO mice. Tumor growth <italic>in vivo</italic> and biopsies were authorized by the local ethics <italic>Committee for Animal Research</italic> (Regierungspräsidium Tuebingen, Germany), and were performed in accordance with the <italic>German Animal Welfare Act</italic>. Animals were kept on a 12-hour light/ dark cycle under temperature- and humidity-controlled conditions with unlimited access to food (Altromin, Lage, Germany) and water. MMTV-PyMT cells used in this study were isolated from 3 – 7 different female breast-cancer bearing WT and 3 – 4 different female breast-cancer bearing BK-KO animals at an age of ∼ 12 – 14 weeks. Upon dissection, tumors were carefully minced into pieces using atraumatic forceps, lysed by 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> Collagenase-D (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) for 10 min, and cultured as follows: Cells were grown in modified improved minimal essential medium (IMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 100 U mL<sup>−1</sup> penicillin and 100 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin (all purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. Fibroblasts were removed by exposure of the cultures to 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and short incubation at 37°C (∼ 1 minute). After gently tapping the plate, trypsin-EDTA with detached fibroblasts was removed and cells were further cultured in supplemented modified IMEM at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> until subculturing.</p>
<p>MCF-7 and MDA-MB-453 cells were purchased from the Global Bioresource Center (ATCC). Cells were cultivated in Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 100 U mL<sup>−1</sup> penicillin and 100 µg mL<sup>−1</sup> streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator.</p>
<p>Subculturing of cells was performed when cells reached a confluency of 80 – 90%. Therefore, cell culture medium was removed, cells were washed 1x with PBS, and trypsin-EDTA at a final concentration of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in PBS was added. Subsequently, cells were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator until cell detachment occurred (∼ 2-5 minutes). Trypsinization was stopped by adding supplemented cell culture media and cells were pelleted at 300xg for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed, and cells were seeded to new cell culture dishes as required. For fluorescence microscopic live-cell imaging experiments, cells were either seeded in 6-well plates containing 1.5 H 30 mm circular glass coverslips (Paul Marienfeld GmbH, Lauda-Königshofen, Germany). All other vessels and serological pipettes used for cell culture were ordered from Corning (Kaiserslautern, Germany).</p>
<p>Transfection of cells was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions when cells showed a confluency of ∼70%, either using PolyJET DNA transfection reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Maryland, USA) for plasmid DNA transfection or Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for siRNA transfection or co-transfection of siRNA with plasmid DNA. Plasmid DNA amount was reduced to 1/3 for transfection of mitochondrial-targeted probes to ensure proper mitochondrial localization of the probes. Plasmid transfections were performed 16 hours, siRNA transfections were performed 48 hours before the experiments.

<title>Cloning and plasmid preparation</title>
<p>Cloning was performed using conventional PCR-, restriction- and ligation-based procedures. BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was a gift from Michael J. Shipston and was N-terminally attached to an RFP (BK<sub>Ca</sub>-DEC<sup>RFP</sup>) using KpnI and BamHI restriction sites after PCR amplification (NEB Q5 High-Fidelity DNA-Polymerase, New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, USA). For generation of BK <sup>RFP</sup>, a PCR amplification of BK <sub>Ca</sub>-DEC was performed, where the reverse primer omitted the last amino acids including the 50 amino acids encoding the DEC exon. Mitochondrial targeted TagRFP (mtRFP) was generated by fusing a double repeat of COX8 pre-sequence N-terminally to TagRFP. RFP-GPI was generated by fusing the membrane leading sequence (MLS) and the GPI-anchor signal of cadherin 13 N- and C-terminally to TagRFP, respectively. After PCR reactions, the DNA fragments were purified from gel electrophoresis using the Monarch DNA gel extraction kit (NEB), fragments and destination plasmid were digested using the respective restriction enzymes (NEB) and ligation (T4 DNA Ligase, NEB) and transformation (chemically competent NEB 5- alpha <italic>E. coli</italic>) were performed according to manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmids were verified by sequencing (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). DNA maxipreps were performed using the Nucleobond Xtra Maxi kit (Macherey Nagel GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Düren, Germany).

<title>LC-MS-based metabolomics</title>
<p>Formic acid, acetic acid, acetonitrile and methanol of Ultra LC-MS grade were supplied by Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). Ammonium hydroxide solution (Suprapur® quality 28.0 - 30.0% NH<sub>3</sub> basis) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck, Taufkirchen, Germany). Deionized water was purified by a Purelab ultrapurification system (ELGA LabWater, Celle, Germany). Uniformly (U-) <sup>13</sup>C-labeled yeast extract of more than 2 × 109 Pichia pastoris cells (∼15 mg; strain CBS 7435) was obtained from ISOtopic Solutions (Vienna, Austria). All standards used were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH. Stock solutions of the individual calibrants were prepared at concentrations of 1 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> and used for further dilution. The individual stocks were stored at -80°C until use.</p>
<p>Targeted LC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II series UHPLC system from Agilent Technologies (Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a binary pump, autosampler, thermostated column compartment and a QTrap 4500 mass spectrometer with a TurboIonSpray Source from SCIEX (Ontario, Canada). The samples were filled into homogenization tubes. Internal standards were added prior to sample preparation. For the extraction of the analytes, 1 mL of the ice-cold extraction solvent (50% methanol and 50% water) and 0.15 g of zirconia/glass beads were added to the cell pellets (which were slowly thawed on ice). The samples were homogenized (6,800 rpm, 1 min at 4 °C, 10 × 10 s, pause 30 s) with Cryolys Evolution using dry ice cooling (Bertin Technologies, France). The samples were then spun down for 5 min (16,100xg at 4 °C). The supernatant was carefully removed, transferred into fresh tubes and evaporated to dryness overnight under nitrogen using a high-performance evaporator (Genevac EZ-2) (Genevac, Ipswich, UK). The dry residue of the extract was reconstituted in 10 µL water and 90 µL acetonitrile, followed by 3 cycles of vortexing and sonication (30 seconds each). The samples were centrifuged at 18928xg for 5 min and the supernatant was used for further analysis.</p>
<p>Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters (Eschborn, Germany) Premier BEH Amide column (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm). For metabolite analysis in ESI<sup>+</sup> mode, mobile phases A and B were adjusted to a pH of 3.5 with formic acid and consisted of 20 mM ammonium formate in water and acetonitrile, respectively. In ESI-, the chromatographic conditions differed. Mobile phase A and B were adjusted to a pH of 7.5 with acetic acid and consisted of 20 mM ammonium acetate in water and acetonitrile, respectively. The gradient elution profile was the same for both positive and negative ionization modes (0.0 min, 100% B; 13 min 70% B; 15 min 70% B; 15.1 min 100% B; 20 min 100% B) and was carried out at a flow rate of 0.25 mL min<sup>-1</sup> and a constant column temperature of 35 °C. The injection volume was 5 µL. The autosampler was kept at 4°C. Ion source parameters were as follows: nebulizer gas (GS1, zero grade air) 50 psi, heater gas (GS2, zero grade air) 30 psi, curtain gas (CUR, nitrogen) 30 psi, source temperature (TEM) 450 °C, ion source voltage +5,500 V (positive mode) and - 4,500 V (negative mode). Due to the large number of transitions monitored simultaneously, the Scheduled-MRM function was enabled. A window of 30 seconds was set around the designated metabolite-specific retention time and the total cycle time was 1 s. Blank solvents (mobile phase A and B) followed by QCs were injected in the beginning of the chromatographic batch to ensure proper column and system equilibration.</p>

<title>Plasma- and mitochondrial membrane potential measurements</title>
<p>DY<sub>PM</sub> was determined using Bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (Dibac4(3)) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultivated on 30 mm glass coverslips. On the day of analysis, cells were equilibrated in cell equilibration buffer containing Dibac4(3) at a concentration of 0.25 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> for 30 minutes and subsequently analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using 485/20 excitation at the Zeiss Axiovert 200m microscope. Emission was captured at roughly 525 nm.</p>
<p>DY<sub>mito</sub> was assessed using Tetramethylrhodamin-Methylester (TMRM) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After cell cultivation on 30 mm glass coverslips in the presence or absence of paxilline, iberiotoxin or DMSO for 12 hours, the cell culture medium was replaced with cell equilibration buffer containing 200 nM TMRM and cells were incubated in ambient environment for 30 minutes. Subsequently, cells were washed with physiologic buffer containing 2 mM or 25 mM glucose and 200 nM TMRM, and cells were equilibrated for further 30 minutes. The glass coverslips were transferred to the PC30 perfusion chamber and experiments were started using the gravity-based perfusion system (NGFI GmbH). Paxilline, iberiotoxin or DMSO (control) and 200 nM TMRM remained present throughout the experiment. Mitochondrial depolarization was induced by the perfusion of a buffer containing 200 nM FCCP. For analysis, the fluorescence emission at ≥600 nm upon excitation at 575/15 nm of a region of interest (ROI) above mitochondria was divided by a ROI in the nucleus (mitochondria free area) and the ratio was plotted over-time, or basal values were given.</p>

<p>Glucose uptake was assessed using 2-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2- NBDG) (Biomol GmbH). Therefore, cells were seeded on 30 mm glass coverslips (Marienfeld GmbH) in 6-well plates (Corning) and cultivated over-night at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. The next day, cells were taken from the incubator, cell culture medium was replaced for cell equilibration buffer and cells were equilibrated for 30 minutes at ambient environment. Subsequently, cells were washed 3x with glucose free physiologic buffer, and glucose free physiologic buffer containing 100 µM 2-NBDG, with or without paxilline and 200 nM FCCP or an equivalent amount of DMSO, was added to the cells, followed by incubation at 37°C for 30 minutes. Next, cells were washed 3x with glucose free physiologic buffer to remove any residual 2-NBDG and were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using 485/20 excitation light. Emission was captured at roughly 525 nm (Zeiss Axiovert 200m).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial single-channel patch-clamp measurements</title>
<p>For mitoplast electrophysiology, mitochondria were isolated from BCC grown to confluency (&gt;90%). Adherent cells were washed 2x with PBS, scraped from the dish, collected in a tube and centrifuged at 400xg for 5 minutes. Subsequently, the cell pellet was resuspended in preparation solution, followed by homogenization using a glass-glass homogenizer. Next, the homogenate was centrifuged at 9,200xg for 10 minutes. The resulting pellet was resuspended in preparation solution and centrifuged at 780xg for 10 minutes. The supernatant was collected, followed by centrifugation at 9,200xg for 10 minutes and resuspension of the mitochondrial fraction in the mitochondrial storage buffer. All procedures were performed at 4°C.</p>
<p>An osmotic swelling procedure was used for the preparation of mitoplasts from the isolated mitochondria. Therefore, mitochondria were added to the hypotonic buffer for ∼1 minute to induce swelling and breakage of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Subsequently, isotonicity of the solution was restored by the addition of hypertonic buffer at a dilution of 1:5.</p>
<p>Patch-clamp experiments on mitoplasts were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bednarczyk et al., 2013</xref>). The experiments were carried out in mitoplast-attached single-channel mode using borosilicate glass pipettes with a mean resistance of 10-15 MΩ. The patch-clamp glass pipette was filled with mitochondrial storage buffer. This isotonic solution was used as a control solution for all experiments. The size of the pipettes and the formation of the gigaseal were monitored by measuring electrical resistance. Connections were made with Ag/AgCl electrodes and an agar salt bridge (3 M KCl) for the ground electrode. The current was recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Molecular Devices, California, USA). To apply substances, a self- made perfusion system containing a holder with a glass pipe, a peristaltic pump, and Teflon tubing was used. All channel modulators were added as dilutions in the isotonic solution containing 100 μM CaCl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The presented single-channel current-time recordings are representative for the most frequently observed conductances under the given conditions. The conductance was calculated from the current-voltage relationship. The probability of channel openings and the current amplitude were determined using the Single-Channel Search mode of the Clampfit 10.7 software (Molecular Devices).</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Mitochondria for western blotting were prepared as described earlier(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pallotti and Lenaz, 2007</xref>) with some modifications. Cells were washed and collected in PBS and centrifuged at 500xg for 10 min. The pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The next day, pellet was resuspended in ice-cold isolation buffer containing (in mM): 210 mannitol, 70 sucrose, 1 PMSF, 5 HEPES and bovine serum albumin (2.5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>), pH 7.2. Digitonin was added to a final concentration of 0.02–0.04% for additional membrane permeabilization. After 1 min of incubation, digitonin was diluted with isolation buffer and the cells were centrifuged at 3,000xg for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold isolation buffer. The cells were homogenized using a glass/glass homogenizer and centrifuged at 1,000xg for 5 min at 4°C followed by another homogenization. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000xg for 5 min at 4°C to remove cell remnants. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged for 60 min at 10,000xg, at 4°C. Next, the pellet was resuspended in the isolation buffer without BSA and centrifuged at 10,000xg for 30 min at 4°C, followed by resuspension in isolation buffer without BSA and centrifugation at 10,000xg for 15 min at 4°C. This step was repeated once more. The pellet containing crude mitochondria was resuspended in 0.8 mL of 15% Percoll (in isolation buffer without BSA) and layered on top of a Percoll step gradient (23% and 40% Percoll layers). The suspension was centrifuged at 30,000xg for 30 min at 4°C. Mitochondrial fraction located between the 23% and 40% Percoll layer was collected, diluted with isolation buffer without BSA and centrifuged at 10,000xg for 15 min at 4°C. The final mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in storage buffer containing 500 mM sucrose and 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.2. Each mitochondrial isolation was performed using between 15-30 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells.</p>
<p>A given amount of sample solubilized in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) was separated by 10% Tris-tricine- SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). After protein transfer, the membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk solution in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 and exposed to one of the following antibodies: anti-BKα antibody (NeuroMabs, USA, clone L6/60, diluted 1:200), anti-COXIV (Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, Netherlands, no. 4844, 1:1,000), or anti-alpha 1 sodium potassium ATPase (Abcam, Berlin, Germany, no. ab7671, 1:1,000). This was followed by incubation with a secondary anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, no. 31460) or anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, no. SA1-100) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence solution (GE Healthcare). To estimate the molecular weight of the analyzed proteins PageRuler Prestained Protein Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used.</p>

<title>Proliferation assays</title>
<p>Proliferation assays were performed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) assay. For the assay, 2.500 MMTV-PyMT WT and BK-KO cells or 7.500 MDA-MB-453 cells were seeded per well in flat bottom 96-well cell culture plates (Corning) in their respective cell culture medium. Per run, condition, and time-point, 7 technical replicates were performed. One well served as a blank per time-point and condition and did not contain cells. The next day, medium was exchanged for fresh cell culture medium either containing 5 µM paxilline, 30 nM iberiotoxin or an equivalent amount of DMSO as a control and the MTT assay was started for time-point 24 hours directly thereafter. For each time-point (24, 48, 72 and 96 hours), MTT reagent was added with a medium change (10 µL + 100 µL / well) at a final concentration of 455 µg mL<sup>-1</sup> and cells were incubated for 4 hours. Subsequently, 85 µL of medium were removed from each well, 85 µL of DMSO (Carl Roth GmbH) was added and wells were mixed by pipetting thoroughly. 85 µL of this mixture were transferred to a new 96-well plate (Corning) and absorbance was measured at 540 nm using a TECAN microplate reader (TECAN Group Ltd.).

<p>For colony formation assays, cell suspensions containing 400 cells mL<sup>-1</sup> of MMTV-PyMT WT or BK-KO cells were prepared. 1 mL of this suspension was spread drop-per-drop per well of a 6-well cell culture plate (Corning) already containing 1 mL of cell culture medium using 1 mL syringes and 23G needles. Culture plates were gently moved left/right and back/forth to equally distribute the cells across the well, plates were kept at room temperature for 20 minutes to ensure uniform cell settling, and cells were subsequently cultured over-night at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified incubator. The next day, medium was exchanged for 2 mL of fresh cell culture medium, and cells were kept in the presence or absence of O<sub>2</sub> at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in humidified incubators for 7 days. After 7 days, cells were washed carefully 2x with PBS and fixed for 30 minutes on ice using 2% PFA in PBS. Meanwhile, a solution of crystal violet (0.01% w/v) was prepared in ddH<sub>2</sub>O, cells were washed 2x with PBS and incubated in the crystal violet solution (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH) for 60 minutes after fixation, followed by excessive washing with ddH<sub>2</sub>O until a clear background was obtained.

<title>Nanostring nCounter gene expression analysis</title>
<p>Gene expression analysis was performed according to manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, total RNA from human primary tumors of the IKP211 study (Quick-DNA/RNA FFPE, ZymoResearch, Freiburg, Germany) was extracted from 10 µm sections of FFPE tissues with at least 20% tumor cell content. Samples were enriched for tumor tissue by microdissection. A total of 250 ng RNA was subsequently hybridized with target-specific capture and color-coded reporter probe sets in a pre-warmed thermal cycler at 65°C for 20 h. In the post-hybridization process, the total volume was increased to 32 µl with RNase- free water. Fluorescence count measurements were immediately conducted in the Nanostring nCounter System.

<p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism8 software (GraphPad Software, Boston, USA). All data were tested for normal distribution using D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test. A two-tailed Unpaired t-test or Welch’s t-test were used for statistical comparison of normally distributed data, depending on whether the variances of the populations were comparable or significantly different as tested by an F-test. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparison of non-normally distributed data. Comparison of &gt;2 data sets was done either using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison (MC) test or Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test followed by Games-Howell’s MC test for normally distributed data, depending on whether the variances were comparable or significantly different. A Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s MC test was performed if data were not normally distributes. The statistical tests used are indicated in the figure legends. p-values of ≤0.05 were considered as significant, where * or #p≤0.05, ** or †p≤0.01 and *** or ‡p≤0.001.

(<bold>H</bold>) Schematic representation of processes involved in 2-NBDG uptake. 2-NBDG is taken up via glucose transporters (GLUTs, green), and ATP-dependently phosphorylated by hexokinase isoforms (HKs, red) to 2-NBDG-6-phosphate (2-NBDG-6P). Under basal conditions, if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase is running in forward mode (left panel), mitochondria contribute to 2-NBDG uptake by ATP generation and delivery to HKs via the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT, yellow), and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC, violet). Contrary, under basal conditions, if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase activity is reversed (right panel) it competes with HKs for ATP. Subsequent inhibition of mitochondria due to their depolarization with FCCP (red) stops ATP-synthase activity. Under these conditions, 2-NBDG uptake will decrease if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase operates in forward mode (left panel), but will increase if F<sub>O</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP-synthase shows reversed activity (right panel).

<p>Bischoff et al present a carefully prepared study on a very interesting and relevant topic: the role of ion channels (here a Ca2+-activated K+ channel BK) in regulating mitochondrial metabolism in breast cancer cells. The potential impact of these and similar observations made in other tumor entities has only begun to be appreciated. That being said, the authors pursue in my view an innovative approach to understanding breast cancer cell metabolism.</p>
<p>Considering the following points would further strengthen the manuscript:</p>
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>1. The authors use an extracellular Ca2+ concentration (2 mM) in their Ringer's solutions that is almost twice as high as the physiologically free Ca2+ concentration (ln 473). Moreover, the free Ca2+ concentration of their pipette solution is not indicated (ln 487).</p>
<p>2. Ca2+I measurements: The authors use ATP to elicit intracellular Ca2+ signals. Is this then a physiological stimulus for Ca2+ signaling in breast cancer? What is the rationale for using ATP? Moreover, it would be nice to see calibrated baseline values of Ca2+i.</p>
<p>3. Membrane potential measurements: It would be nice to see a calibration of the potential measurements; this would allow us to correlate the IV relationship with membrane potential. Without calibration, it is hard to compare unless the identical uptake of the dye is shown.</p>
<p>Does paxilline or IbTx also induce depolarization?</p>
<p>4. Mito-potential measurements: Why did the authors use such a long time course and preincubate cells with channel blockers overnight? Why did they not perform paired experiments and record the immediate effect of the BK channel blockers in the mito potential?</p>
<p>5. MTT assays are also based on mitochondrial function - since modulation of mito function is at the core of this manuscript, an alternative method should be used.</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>1. Fig. 5G: The number of BK &quot;positive&quot; mitoplasts is surprisingly low - how does this affect the interpretation? Did the authors attempt to record mitoBK current in the &quot;whole-mitoplast&quot; mode? How does the mitoBK current density compare with that of the plasma membrane? Is it possible to theoretically predict the number of mitoBK channels per mitochondrion to elicit the observed effects? Can these results be correlated with the immuno-localization of mitoBK channels?</p>
<p>2. There are also reports about other mitoK channels (e.g. Kv1.3, KCa3.1, KATP) playing an important role in mitochondrial function. Did the authors observe them, too? Can the authors speculate on the relative importance of the different channels? Is it known whether they are expressed organ-/tumor-specifically?</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The large-conductance Ca2+ activated K+ channel (BK) has been reported to promote breast cancer progression, but it is not clear how. The present study carried out in breast cancer cell lines, concludes that BK located in mitochondria reprograms cells towards the Warburg phenotype, one of the metabolic hallmarks of cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of a wide array of modern complementary techniques, including metabolic imaging, respirometry, metabolomics, and electrophysiology. On the whole, experiments are astute and well-designed and appear carefully done. The use of BK knock-out cells to control for the specificity of the pharmacological tools is a major strength. The manuscript is clearly written. There are many interesting original observations that may give birth to new studies.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main conclusion regarding the role of a BK channel located in mitochondria appears is not sufficiently supported. Other perfectible aspects are the interpretation of co-localization experiments and the calibration of Ca2+ dyes. These points are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs:</p>
<p>1. May the metabolic effects be ascribed to a BK located in mitochondria? Unfortunately not, at least with the available evidence. While it is clear these cells have a BK in mitochondria (characteristic K+ currents detected in mitoplasts) and it is also well substantiated that the metabolic effects in intact cells are explained by an intracellular BK (paxilline effects absent in the BK KO), it does not follow that both observations are linked. Given that ectopic BK-DEC appeared at the surface, a confounding factor is the likely expression of BK in other intracellular locations such as ER, Golgi, endosomes, etc. To their credit, authors acknowledge this limitation several times throughout the text (&quot;...presumably mitoBK...&quot;) but not in other important places, particularly in the title and abstract.</p>
<p>2. MitoBK subcellular location. Pearson correlations of 0.6 and about zero were obtained between the locations of mitoGREEN on one side, and mRFP or RFP-GPI on the other (Figs. 1G and S1E). These are nice positive and negative controls. For BK-DECRFP however, the Pearson correlation was about 0.2. What is the Z resolution of apotome imaging? Assuming an optimum optical section of 600 nm, as obtained by a 1.4 NA objective with a confocal, that mitochondria are typically 100 nm in diameter and that BK-DECRFP appears to stain more structures than mitoGREEN, the positive correlation of 0.2 may not reflect colocalization. For instance, it could be that BK-DECRFP is not just in mitochondria but in a close underlying organelle e.g. the ER. Along the same line, why did BK-RFP also give a positive Pearson? Isn´t that unexpected? Considering that BK-DEC was found by patch clamping at the plasma membrane, the subcellular targeting of the channel is suspect. Could it be that the endogenous BK-DEC does actually reside exclusively in mitochondria (a true mitoBK), but overflows to other membranes upon overexpression? Regarding immunodetection of BK in the mitochondrial Percoll preparation (Fig. S5), the absence of NKA demonstrates the absence of plasma membrane contamination but does not inform about contamination by other intracellular membranes.</p>
<p>3. Calibration of fluorescent probes. The conclusion that BK blockers or BK expression affects resting Ca2+ levels should be better supported. Fluorescent sensors and dyes provide signals or ratios that need to be calibrated if comparisons between different cell types or experimental conditions are to be made. This is implicitly acknowledged here when monitoring ER Ca2+, with an elaborate protocol to deplete the organelle in order to achieve a reading at zero Ca2+.</p>
<p>4. Line 203. &quot;...solely by the expression of BKCa-DECRFP in MCF-7 cells&quot;. Granted, the effect of BKCa-DECRFP on the basal FRET ratio appears stronger than that of BK-RFP, but it appears that the latter had some effect. Please provide the statistics of the latter against the control group (after calibration, see above).</p>

<p>The original research article, titled &quot;mitoBKCa is functionally expressed in murine and human breast cancer cells and promotes metabolic reprogramming&quot; by Bischof et al, has demonstrated the underlying molecular mechanisms of alterations in the function of Ca2+ activated K+ channel of large conductance (BKCa) in the development and progression of breast cancer. The authors also proposed that targeting mitoBKCa in combination with established anti-cancer approaches, could be considered as a novel treatment strategy in breast cancer treatment.</p>
<p>The paper is clearly written, and the reported results are interesting.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Rigorous biophysical experimental proof in support of the hypothesis.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>A combinatorial synergistic study is missing.</p>
