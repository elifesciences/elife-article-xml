<title>Abstract</title><p>A hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides across distinct brain regions. Anti-Aβ antibodies (Aβ-Abs) that bind specific Aβ variants are essential research tools. Furthermore, the monoclonal Aβ-Abs Aducanumab, Lecanemab, and Donanemab have recently gained approval as the first disease-modifying therapeutics for early AD. In this study, we systematically determined on peptide microarrays the exact binding epitopes of 20 Aβ-Abs, including biosimilars of Aducanumab, Lecanemab and Donanemab. Precise Aβ-sequence and modification requirements were resolved through deep mutational scans and synthetically modified peptide libraries. To address the potential limitations of peptide microarrays employing short Aβ fragments, the observed monovalent Aβ-Ab reactivities were further studied using biochemical approaches, complementary in vitro analysis of Aβ-Ab binding to oligomeric and aggregated Aβ, as well as immunohistochemical staining of patient-derived AD brain samples. The data identifies Aβ-Abs that preferentially recognize critical truncation and modification variants as well as gain and loss of binding mutants in familial AD. Our work provides insights into the mode of binding of currently available Aβ-Ab biosimilars and further classifies the immunological tools for detecting and discriminating distinct Aβ truncations, mutational variants and post-transcriptionally modified derivatives. We expect that this comprehensive resource on Aβ-Ab sequence and modification selectivity will not only advance fundamental research on AD but potentially also support the development of improved diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and tau tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline and dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Aβ peptides are generated under physiological conditions from Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by sequential proteolytic cleavages by beta- and gamma-secretase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. The initial β-secretase cleavage of APP results in the release of soluble sAPPβ and the generation of a 99 amino acids (AA) long carboxy (C)-terminal APP fragment (C99) with an amino (N)-terminal Asp-residue. Aβ peptides are generated by subsequent gamma-secretase cleavage of C99 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>].</p>
<p>In human cerebrospinal fluid, a conserved pattern of soluble Aβ1-37, Aβ1-38, Aβ1-39, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]. Aβ peptides isolated from amyloid plaques have been shown to include several variants differing in length, their N- and C-termini, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], such as cyclization of N-terminal Glu(3) or Glu(11) into pyroglutamate (pE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], and racemization or isomerization of Asp(1) and Asp(7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, phosphorylated forms of Aβ (pSer(8) and pSer(26)) have been reported in amyloid plaques based on studies employing phospho-selective anti-Aβ antibodies (Aβ-Abs), although these findings have not yet been conclusively confirmed by mass spectrometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. In extracellular senile plaques in the brain’s functional tissue, the parenchyma, Aβ1-42 is more prevalent than Aβ1-40, and various N- and C-terminally truncated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>] as well as N-terminally elongated variants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]. In particular, those starting with a cyclized pE (3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] or Phe at position 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>], are highly abundant in AD brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Genetic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>] further multiply Aβ amino acid sequence variability. The study of the structural polymorphisms of the Aβ peptide resulting from PTMs or mutations and the potential impact on the formation of pathophysiological oligomeric forms and fibrillar aggregates is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. The majority of PTMs occur in the flexible N-terminal region of the fibrils, encompassing residues 1–16, and were proposed to trigger or accelerate the fibrillation of Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The same region is also responsible for metal ion coordination which may influence fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Similarly, several pathogenic APP mutations within Aβ are associated with altered folds, higher aggregation propensities, and toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].</p>
<p>Importantly, this complexity requires molecular tools with appropriate molecular specificity and sensitivity and poses enormous challenges in designing sensitive diagnostic readouts and effective targeted therapies. Passive immunotherapy using monoclonal Aβ-Abs has been investigated extensively as an approach for AD treatment resulting in Aβ-Abs with several different Aβ selectivity profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. For example, Aducanumab, a recombinant human antibody, was developed after screening human memory B-cells for reactivity towards aggregated Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. Bapineuzumab, the humanized form of the murine antibody 3D6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>] has been reported to bind to both monomeric and aggregated Aβ.</p>
<p>Aβ-Abs are the primary means for the detection and targeting of specific Aβ variants within the outlined Aβ-sequence and -modification space. The precise molecular binding epitopes of Aβ-Abs are fundamental to Aβ research. However, the immunogens used to raise and select Aβ-Abs may not represent precise and reliable predictors of the actual sequence and modification requirements. Furthermore, epitope requirements reported by different mapping methodologies may differ and may thus render a comparison difficult. Here we addressed the range and limitations of the sequence and modification specificity by side-by-side comparison in complementary assays for a panel of Aβ-Abs central to AD research and therapy.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>The Aβ-Abs investigated in this study are listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The panel encompasses biosimilars of the currently FDA-approved drugs (i) Aducanumab (Biogen), initially approved for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>] but discontinued in 2024 (ii) Lecanemab (Biogen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>], which in contrast to Aducanumab, has been approved via regular approval track and (iii) Donanemab (Eli Lilly) as the most recent expansion of the AD-drug arsenal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. The set of Aβ-Abs further encompasses selected antibodies directed against specific Aβ variants such as Aβ1-x with a free N-terminal-Asp(1) (3D6, 82E1, 11H3, 80C2), N-truncated Aβ starting with pE(3) (AβpE3-X) (pE3-Aβ, 2-48 and Donanemab<sub>bs</sub>) and phosphorylated Aβ forms (1E4E11, 5H11C10). Furthermore, the panel covers Aβ-Abs against the N-terminal region of Aβ and a central epitope, as well as antibodies selective for N-terminally elongated and truncated Aβ variants.</p>

<title>Pre-screening of Aβ-Ab Epitopes</title>
<p>Information regarding binding epitopes and /or immunogens for most of the tested Aβ-Abs has been published and is summarized in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, the binding epitope information was derived with varying methodologies. To provide an initial side-by-side comparison we pre-screened all of the listed Aβ-Abs in array format using copies of peptide libraries and standard antibody concentrations of 0.5-1 µg/mL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). The library comprised the amyloid precursor protein (APP770) residues 649-722, corresponding to the canonical Aβ1-42 amino acid sequence with additional 23 amino terminal and 9 carboxy terminal residues. To enable single amino acid resolution, 60 peptides with a length of 15AA and overlapping by 14AA were synthesized and displayed as cellulose-conjugates incapable of oligomerization (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). We first focused on Aβ-Abs with known preference for Aβ starting with a free Asp(1) and initially found that 3D6 and 82E1 also detected Aβ(2-x) and several N-terminally elongated Aβ-related peptides in addition to Aβ(1-x), at least under the generic pre-screening conditions with presumably suboptimal Ab concentrations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Thus, it is clear that antibodies must be titrated for each specific application to obtain selectivity and to reduce non-specific binding. Forfor optimal signal to noise ratios and ideal selectivity profiles on the microarrays, the Aβ-Ab concentrations were adjusted for 3D6, 82E1, 11H3, 80C2 and 7H3D6 (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 – figure-supplement 1</xref>) and (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix 1</xref>-<xref rid="s7g" ref-type="sec">7</xref>). This setup allowed to determine the general location of the binding epitopes within the Aβ sequence for all tested Aβ-Abs as shown by the heatmap in (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). Similarly, Donanemab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], 1E4E11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], and 5H11C10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>], which have been previously reported as selective for AβpyGlu3, pSer8-Aβ, AβpE3, pSer8Aβ, and pSer26-Aβ, respectively, produced detectable signals in this pre-screening with unmodified Aβ-related peptides. Again, these findings demonstrate the need for further investigation to confirm selectivity under more appropriate assay conditions, i.e. optimized antibody concentrations and presentation of modified Aβ-fragments as binding partners. The side-by-side determined epitopes are summarized together with their immunogen in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Epitope mapping recapitulated previously reported data, but also further confines (pAb77, 4G8, 14-2-4, 101-1-1, 6E10, 1E8, 7H3D6, 1E4E11, 5H11C10) or even expands (Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub>) the required residues for binding. However, although this initial microarray only contained unmodified Aβ sequences, we also observed binding for Aβ-Abs known as PTM-selective. (3)pE(3)Specifically, Donanemab<sub>bs</sub>, 2-48 and Aβ-pE3 were raised against AβpE3-x (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and were expected to show preference for Aβ peptides starting with a pE(3). In the pre-screening with unmodified Aβ sequences, however, Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> detected Aβ(3-x) starting with non-cyclized Glu(3), Aβ(-3-x) as well as several other N-terminally elongated Aβ-related peptides and Aβ1-x. Since the primary binding mode for AβpE3-x had not yet been tested at this stage these initial screening observations remain preliminary. Similarly, 1E4E11 and 5H11C10, which were reported to have high selectivity for phosphorylated Aβ peptides at Ser8 and Ser26 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], both displayed strong signals with several non-phosphorylated Aβ variants in the pre-screening. Although the findings with the modification-selective Aβ-Abs are indicative of cross-reactivity due to the presence of epitopes resembling their target and/or the effect of suboptimal binding conditions, the unbiased microarray screening provided valuable initial information regarding the sequence regions and modifications of interest to be investigated in more detail in the course of our study.</p>

<p>(a) Schematic of the microarray workflow. The library comprised the amyloid precursor protein (APP) residues 649-722 (APP770 numbering), corresponding to Aβ residues -23 to 51, as a library of 15-mer peptides overlapping by 14AAs, copied in dozens, and probed for Aβ-Abs binding followed by analysis in MARTin. (b). The epitope screening binding data are summarized as a heatmap. The antibody-binding peptides were presented in a semi-quantitative manner.

The blue – red scale is visualizing the normalized binding intensity for each antibody individually. The applied antibody concentrations ranged between 0.5-1 µg/mL. Note: Among the 20 tested antibodies, 1E4E11, 5H11C10, 2-48, Aβ-pE3, and Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> have known PTM-selectivity, which could not be fully addressed with the initial microarray consisting of unmodified Aβ fragments only.</p></caption>

<title>Titration and Selectivity Assessment of Aβ Abs Directed Against the Aβ N-terminus</title>
<p>The sensitivity and selectivity profiles of Aβ-Abs 80C2, 11H3, 3D6, 82E1, which were expected to show preferential binding to Aβ with a free N-terminal Asp(1), and mAb 7H3D6 were explored in more detail. The canonical Aβ peptide is typically 40-42 amino acids long. In addition, various N-terminal variants have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Several truncated forms have been detected in brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]. Notably, N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides, particularly those starting with Phe at position 4, are abundant in AD brains. The metalloproteinase ADAMTS4, which is expressed in oligodendrocytes, has been linked to APP processing and the generation of Aβ4-X peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Additionally, N-terminally elongated Aβ peptides, such as Aβ(-3-X), which can be generated by the same enzyme in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>], may be of interest in the context of AD biomarker research: Aβ(-3-40) can serve as a reference in a composite blood based biomarker of AD for cerebral Aβ accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>]. Highly sensitive and selective Aβ-Abs for N-terminal Aβ variants are a prerequisite for studying their specific roles in detail. In our microarray experiments, the titration of Aβ-Abs expected to prefer Aβ1-x variants with a free N-terminal Asp (mAbs 80C2, 11H3, 3D6, 82E1) plus the rat monoclonal 7H3D6 (<xref rid="fig1-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1 Supplement 1</xref>) (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix 1</xref>) broadly classifies the tested mAbs into two groups. One group (80C2 and 11H3) that, on microarray under the tested experimental conditions, displayed exclusive binding towards Aβ1-x over the entire titration range albeit with limited sensitivity. A second group showed high sensitivity but concentration-dependent and limited Aβ1-x selectivity over related Aβ variants under the tested conditions (3D6, 82E1 and 7H3D6). Among the 20 tested antibodies, 1E4E11, 5H11C10, 2-48, Aβ-pE3, and Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> exhibited the previously reported preferences for PTMs, which will be addressed in detail in the following paragraphs.</p>

<title>Deep Mutational Scans Provide Information on Aβ-Abs Binding Requirements</title>
<p>Next, we further explored the reactivities observed during the epitope pre-screening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) and probed in total 14 selected monoclonal antibodies with matched deep mutational libraries. Apart from the biosimilar Abs and the Abs directed against the Aβ N-terminus described above, we also selected three generic Aβ Abs as references (IC16, 1E8, 6E10) and two Abs selective for N-terminally elongated Aβ variants (14-2-4, 101-1-1), the core epitope of which we have described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. Display and binding evaluation of all possible point-mutants systematically resolved the sequence requirements for these 14 Aβ-Abs towards the binding region corresponding to the Aβ(-10-18) amino acid sequence (<xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A - figure supplement 1</xref>) in three different 18-meric positional scans. Peptides covering Aβ(-10-8) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>), Aβ(-3-15) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>) and Aβ1-18 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>) regions were generated. As these three peptide regions showed binding to most of the N-terminal antibodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), we postulated that these 18-mers should cover the main antigen-antibody (Ag/Ab) contact regions. The three Aβ-related wild-type sequences were sequentially scanned from N-terminus to C-terminus by replacing each position by every proteinogenic amino acid (342 different peptide sequences in total). A customized criterion was utilized to identify the core motif for each monoclonal antibody tested. While the identified core motifs are essential for binding, they may not fully represent the specificity of the antibodies but rather indicate where the majority of the Ag/Ab contact takes place. Specifically, the raw mean intensities for all peptide variants were measured and normalized against the corresponding wildtype sequence. Amino acid exchanges that reduced binding by &gt;50% were designated as dominant negative. This process was reiterated for each exchange at that position. Positions were considered as major contributor to the core motif when more than 50% of the exchanges were marked as dominant negative. The resulting core motifs are summarized in <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – figure supplement 1D</xref>. The findings highlight both similarities and differences in the binding mode of different Aβ-Abs, affirming binding to epitopes located in the N-terminal region of the Aβ sequence. Overall, this comprehensive binding data provides guidance for sorting monoclonal Aβ-Abs based on epitope properties. For two of the tested antibodies, namely 3D6 and Aducanumab, crystal structures are publicly available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], and indicate binding in the regions Aβ1-5 (3D6) and 3-7 (Aducanumab), respectively. Here, the microarray results recapitulated the epitope of 3D6 (murine precursor of Bapineuzumab) and expanded the binding interface for Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> binding to monomeric short Aβ fragments by two residues, namely Asp(1) and Ala(2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Donanemab is known to recognize Aβ starting with cyclized pE3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>], however, on our initial microarray screen, Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> showed clear signals with AβpE3-x and several other Aβ related peptides starting N-terminally of Glu(3), including Aβ1-x (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). To further explore this unexpected observation, Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> was tested on the Aβ (1-18) deep mutational scan. Consistent with its expected preference for the Aβ3-x region, the primary Ag/Ab contacts for the binding to Aβ1-18 involved the amino acids <italic>EFRHDSGY.</italic> Asp(1) and Ala(2) were not highly conserved. Importantly, the murine precursor antibody mE8 from which Donanemab was derived was previously shown to have a very strong preference for truncated AβpE3(starting with pyroglutamate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. This particular point is further addressed in detail in the paragraph “Modification selectivity of monoclonal Aβ-Abs mAbs” (see below). The monoclonal Ab 1E4E11, which was previously reported to be highly selective for phosphorylated pSer(8)-Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>], bound to unphosphorylated Aβ2-16 and several other unphosphorylated Aβ-related peptides on the initial screen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, the profiling of Ser(8) did not show elevated binding to the phospho-mimetic exchanges (Asp or Glu) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). The effect of phosphorylation at Ser(8) is also addressed in detail in the paragraph “Modification selectivity of monoclonal Aβ-Abs” mAbs(see below). As shown in (<xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - supplement 2D</xref>), several Aβ-Ab exhibited altered binding strength with exchanges R5G or Y10F which may be valuable information when studying the co-aggregation dynamics between exogenous (human) and endogenous (mouse) Aβ in transgenic models.</p>

<title>Hereditary APP Mutations Affect Antibody Binding</title>
<p>Next, we studied the impact of some reported hereditary mutations in the <italic>APP</italic> gene resulting in amino acid exchanges within the Aβ sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Specific familiar <italic>APP</italic> gene mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>] are reported to either lead to aggressive forms of AD or to exert a protective effect. Several mutations in the Aβ peptide have been reported to cause familial AD (fAD), with all but two having a dominant pattern of inheritance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>]. These alterations can lead to enhanced aggregation and increased cytotoxicity, contributing to the onset and progression of early-onset AD. The following APP mutations within the Aβ amino acid sequence were included in the microarray screen: D7H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>], D7N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>], H6R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>], A2V[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>], A2T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>], K16Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], L17V [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>].</p>
<p>Our analysis indicates that genetic mutations causing amino acid exchanges in or close to the Aβ sequence can affect antibody binding. Regarding the biosimilar antibodies Lecanemab<sub>bs</sub>, Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> and Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub>, this may potentially have relevance for rare fAD and their therapeutic implications. The APP mutants D7H/7N, H6R and A2T/V, K16Q and L17VL17V are highlighted in the deep mutational scan data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig2-1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - Supplement 1</xref>), as they were identified within the core motifs of the Aβ-Abs. The mutations A2V, D7H, D7N, and H6R can lead to an increased aggregation propensity of Aβ and contribute to early onset fAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Specifically, D7H (Taiwan), D7N (Tottori), and H6R (English) mutations may alter the structural features and thermodynamics of Aβ42, leading to increased β-sheet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>] content For confirmation and for highlighting the importance of considering genetic variability to therapeutic responses, we next paradigmatically explored the effects of the D7H, D7N, H6R, A2V and A2T APP mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] on Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> binding to short monomeric Aβ-related peptides on microarray.</p>

<title>The Mutation H6R Abolishes Aducanumab Binding</title>
<p>Consistently across the two deep positional scans, Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> and 6E10 showed significantly reduced binding intensity to 18-mer peptides on the array in case of the fAD H6R mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. This aligns closely with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], which identified <italic>RXD</italic> as the minimal sequence required for 6E10 binding via phage mapping (present in 53% of immunoprecipitated sequences). Our data indicate that 6E10 exhibits binding to a broader motif, <italic>EFRHD</italic> and shows that H6 is necessary for binding. To confirm our findings and underscore the potential significance of genetic variability in possible therapeutic strategies, we subsequently measured the binding affinity of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> to Aβ1-15 H6R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. First, we spotted the corresponding purified peptides <italic>DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQ</italic> and <italic>DAEFRRDSGYEVHHQ</italic> (<xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 - supplement 2a</xref>) (<xref rid="s7h" ref-type="sec">Appendix 8</xref>) at 2-fold dilutions. The semi-quantitative on chip titration confirmed a reduced binding strength of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> for the H6R Aβ1-15 variant. For complete quantification including kinetic evaluation, we next conducted Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) experiments (<xref rid="fig2-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 – supplement 2b</xref>). The BLI response of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> for the H6R was completely abolished when compared with the wildtype sequence. These data confirm the array profiling and, in broader context, highlight a possible gap in efficacy for monoclonal Aβ-Abs in individuals with certain rare hereditary mutations associated with AD, which may have implications for personalized treatment approaches. However, whether or not the H6R amino acid replacement could impact also the binding of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> to aggregated Aβ is still unclear.</p>

<title>Modification Selectivity of Monoclonal Aβ-Abs MAbs</title>
<p>PTMs of Aβ can significantly impact aggregation propensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>], clearance mechanisms, and toxicity in AD. Specific PTMs might be associated with different stages of AD progression and severity, offering potential biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Targeting PTMs represents a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent Aβ aggregation and neurotoxicity, thereby slowing disease progression. <italic>In vitro</italic>, Aβ cyclization of N-terminal Glu into pE, and racemization/isomerization of Asp were shown to increase the aggregation propensity and neurotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. Therefore, a selected group of PTM-carrying Aβ peptides (PTM-Aβ) were incorporated to the Aβ chip to explore the potential binding preference of selected Aβ-Abs, under optimized concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). The antibodies were tested with both PTM-Aβ and the corresponding unmodified variants to provide a head-to-head comparison. This screening was performed in the presence of phosphorylated Aβ at positions Ser(8) or Ser(26), N-terminal pE at position 3, racemization/isomerization of Asp at position 1, and unmodified N-terminal variants. The dataset is divided into sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 a-f</xref>) for enhanced visualization, where each antibody was screened simultaneously against all peptides to locate their epitope preferences. Post-hoc mass spectrometry (MS) analysis validated the correct display of the PTM variants included in the microarray (<xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix 1</xref>-<xref rid="s7f" ref-type="sec">6</xref>). A set of antibodies without reported PTM preference was applied here as controls (refer to <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), namely 11H3, 101-1-1, IC16, 82E1 and 3D6. Antibody 6E10 has been previously shown to be unable to detect Aβ-pSer(8) and was included as a control antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref>]. On the microarray and under the tested experimental conditions, Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> and 1E4E11 (<xref rid="s7j" ref-type="sec">Appendix 10</xref>) showed preference for Aβ peptide fragments phosphorylated at Ser(8) (pSer(8)).

In contrast, mAb IC16 showed weaker binding to AβpE3-x than to Aβ3-x. MAbs 7H3D6 and 11H3 did not recognize Iso-Asp(1), while 11H3 interestingly showed no affinity for D-Asp(1)-modified Aβ peptides. As expected, all of the tested antibodies, which are directed against the N-terminal Aβ region, did not show appreciable binding, and only 5H11C10 bound to the phosphorylated Ser(26) within Aβ19-32 to mid-region peptides (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>),</p>

<title>A pSer8-Preference of Aducanumabbs?</title>
<p>Aducanumab has been reported to preferentially target aggregated Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>] and bind monomeric Aβ with low micromolar affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], tetrameric Aβ1-15 with low nanomolar affinity and aggregated Aβ with sub-nanomolar affinity corresponding to a roughly 10.000-fold enhanced affinity for Aβ aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. However, in our hands, on microarray and under the tested experimental conditions, we observed appreciable binding of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> to short, monomeric Aβ-related peptides (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), which we followed up by studying some molecular details. Prompted by the observed preference of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> for phosphorylated pSer8-Aβ(−(-1-14) and pSer8-Aβ1-15 over unphosphorylated Aβ-related 15-mers on our microarrays (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - supplement 2A</xref>), we sought to quantify the underlying relative affinity differences using the purified epitope variants in BLI as a proof-of-concept experiment with the caveat that the assay may affect the absolute affinity due to multivalency and high-density effects. As a reference, mAb 1E4E11 was titrated over the immobilized phosphorylated Aβ variant (<xref rid="fig3-2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 3A S2 - top</xref>) (<xref rid="s7i" ref-type="sec">Appendix 9</xref>). As expected, mAb 1E4E11 showed a strong response in the nanomolar affinity range with fast on rates and very slow off rates, resulting in a K<sub>D</sub> of 4.1nM (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> <xref rid="fig3-2" ref-type="fig">S2 – bottom</xref>). In contrast, the overall response was at least within an order of magnitude lower with the unphosphorylated peptide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4BS2 – top</xref>) and showed fast off rates, resulting in a quantified K<sub>D</sub> of only 1.3μM for mAb1E4E11 binding (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4BS2 – bottom</xref>).

<p>Henceforth, we applied this methodology to Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> (<xref rid="fig3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - supplement 2</xref>) and observed a preference for monomeric Aβ1-15 phosphorylated at Ser(8) over unphosphorylated Aβ1-15. Initially, both modified and unmodified Aβ1-15 peptides were loaded onto the BLI sensors and tested with different antibody concentrations. The affinity for the phosphorylated variant was at least 6 times higher than for the unmodified peptide, however, on microarray, the EC50 for the pSer8-Aβ1-15 was 300 times lower than that for the corresponding unphosphorylated peptide (<xref rid="s7j" ref-type="sec">Appendix 10</xref>). Importantly, this was only detectable on semi-quantitative array analysis, which can be explained by multivalency effects that may lower the observed antibody off-rate. Overall, the affinity quantification in BLI did not result in a large difference between the two variants and we thus concluded that Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> has agnostic preference for a negative charge, either provided by a carboxylic (Asp or Glu – see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>) or phosphoserine group (<xref rid="fig3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – Supplement 2</xref>), as it was not selective for the latter.

<p>To further explore the relevance of the observed interaction between Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> and the N-terminal phosphorylated Aβ fragment, we conducted molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref rid="fig3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - supplement 3</xref>) using the published crystal structure of Aβ2-7 and Aducanumab Fab complex (PDB: 6CO3). These simulations were performed using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software. Specifically, we investigated two different short Aβ peptide sequences, <italic>AEFRHDS</italic> and <italic>AEFRHDpS</italic>, to examine how phosphorylation at Ser(8) affects the binding stability of the antibody-antigen complex.</p>
<p>By assuming that fewer fluctuations in the system correlate with a higher affinity, these data provide insights into the preferential binding mode of Aducanumab to phosphorylated short N-terminal Aβ fragments. By assuming that fewer fluctuations in the system lead to higher affinity, the root mean square deviation (RMSD) diagrams indicate greater stability (average conformation over 600ns) for the phosphorylated peptide due to its reduced fluctuations (<xref rid="fig3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, the phospho group enhances the interaction with extra hydrogen bonds compared to the unmodified peptide (<xref rid="fig3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - supplement 3</xref>). Conversely, the non-phosphorylated peptide exhibits more fluctuations (<xref rid="fig3-3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 - supplement 3</xref>). Thus, under these conditions, the MD simulation results confirm the findings from the microarray and BLI analyses.</p>

<p>Comparison of MD simulations with the structural data. The MD simulation was conducted with the resolved epitope peptide <italic>EFRHDS,</italic> but no additional ions predict a largely altered binding mode characterized by over 10 Å movements of R317 and R318. In contrast, the crystal structure (PDB 6CO3) harbors a sulfate ion that neutralizes the positive charge introduced by R317 and R318. Strikingly the MD of the pSer(8) modified peptide recapitulates the resolved X-ray binding mode to monomeric Aβ.

</fig>
<p>Taken together, the MD simulations rationalize the unexpected preference of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> towards monovalent pSer8Aβ1-15 we observed on microarray. The observation underscores the complexity of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> binding to Aβ. This is further substantiated by comparing the previously resolved structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] with the MD simulation for short non-phosphorylated and pSer(8) Aβ-related peptides. Here, pSer8-Aβ2-8, unlike the corresponding non-phosphorylated Aβ, replicates the structurally determined binding mode. In the MD simulation, using the resolved epitope peptide EFRHDpS allows for the binding mode that has R317 and R318 contributing to the paratope. Similarly, the crystal structure (PDB 6CO3) includes a sulfate ion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] that neutralizes the positive charges of R317 and R318 (<xref rid="fig3-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – supplement 4</xref>). In summary, the monomeric binding mode benefits from the neutralization of a positive patch on Aducanumab Fab, which likely explains the phospho-preference.</p>

<title>IP-MS characterization of Biosimilar Aβ-Abs</title>
<p>Our next goal was to further elaborate the screening results obtained with short Aβ fragments and extend the analyses to intact AβX-40 and X-42 variants. To this end, we tested the monoclonal Aβ-Abs 4G8, Donanemab<sub>bs</sub>, Lecanemab<sub>bs</sub>, Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub>, and 1E4E11 as representative examples in terms of their capacity in selecting specific Aβ variants out of a mixture of ten synthetic Aβ peptides on immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="s7k" ref-type="sec">Appendix 11</xref>-<xref rid="s7l" ref-type="sec">12</xref>). The mixture included Aβ1-40 and 1-42, N-terminal truncated Aβ(2-40, 3-40, pE3-40, 4-40, 5-40, 11-40), N-terminal elongated Aβ(-3-40) and phosphorylated pSer8-Aβ1-40 (amidated C-terminal carboxyl group). The antibodies were covalently coupled to magnetic beads and incubated, separately, with aliquots of the Aβ peptide mixture. After washing the magnetic bead immune complexes, the bound Aβ peptides were eluted, and the immunoprecipitated products were analyzed using MALDI-TOF-MS on TOPAC matrix (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). As previously established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>], the TOPAC matrix allows for improved detection of phosphorylated Aβ with minimal phosphate loss. Two control antibodies, 4G8 (core epitope 17-21 according to our microarray data) and 1E4E11, were used to set up the system, representing respectively, “pan-Abeta” and pSer8-Aβ1-40 profiles.</p>
<p>The IP-MS signature of 4G8, after incubation with the 10 peptide mix, showed signals from all constituents thus acting as positive control, with major intensities for Aβ5-40, intermediate signals for Aβ4-40, Aβ3-40, Aβ2-40, and Aβ1-40, and only minor signals for Aβ1-42, Aβ(-3-40) and pSer8 Aβ1-40 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, pyroglutamate AβpE3-40 was clearly recognized by mAb 4G8. As expected from its central epitope 17-21, 4G8 was the only Ab that showed an intense signal for N-terminally truncated Aβ11-40. The monoclonal antibody 1E4E11 preferentially precipitated pSer8-Aβ1-40-amide and, additionally, Aβ2-40, Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40. The phosphorylated pSer8-Aβ1-40-amide produced the highest signal, suggesting a certain degree of preference (but not specificity) of 1E4E11 for phosphorylated pSer8-Aβ-amide under the tested conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with the PTM-microarray screening (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>), Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> exhibited highly preferential binding to AβppE3-40, with only minor signals for Aβ3-40 and Aβ2-40 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The IP-MS spectra obtained with Lecanemab<sub>bs</sub> showed predominant peaks for Aβ2-40, Aβ1-42, and Aβ1-40 confirming the location of the epitope in the N-terminal region of Aβ (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). For Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub>, we observed clear signals for Aβ2-40, Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, but not for phosphorylated pSer8-Aβ1-40-amide (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This was in contrast to the binding data from array and BLI towards the minimal monovalent epitopes (<xref rid="fig3-2" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – supplement 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3-3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p>
<p>For Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub>, microarray, BLI and IP-MS data suggest three binding modalities. One presumably aggregation specific site (<italic>EFRHDS</italic>) as predicted by previous molecular dynamics studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], primarily via neutral V<sub>L</sub>, where the Ser(8) would only contact the Tyr-92 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>], in line with previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. A second, binding site (EFRHDpS) relevant for the binding of short synthetic N-terminal Aβ fragments as resolved by our pSer(8) MD primarily contacting the positively charged V<sub>H</sub> chain paratope via Arg-317-318 and in agreement with the sulfate-ion containing structure (<xref rid="fig3-4" ref-type="fig">Figure 3 – supplement 4</xref>). Lastly, in a similar way the binding of Aducanumab to monomeric A<italic>EFRHDS</italic> (Aβ2-8) can benefit from the presence of negatively charged sulfate ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] (pdb: 6CO3). Of note, a recent molecular dynamics study suggested the presence of an N-terminal neutral domain in Aβ protofibrils (Aβ:Fab contact Ser8:Tyr92) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>], which may contribute for the preferential binding of Aducanumab to aggregated forms of Aβ.</p>

<title>Biosimilar Binding to Monomeric and Aggregated Aβ Variants</title>
<p>To further complement the characterization of the biosimilar Aβ-Abs, we applied gel electrophoretic separations of Aβ peptides followed by Western blotting, automated Capillary Isoelectric Focusing immunoassays with charge-based separation of Aβ peptides (CIEF-immunoassay), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments on brain tissue with pre-adsorption of Aβ-Abs.</p>
<p>Aducanumab and Lecanemab are known to have a clear preference for aggregated forms of Aβ over monomeric forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]. In agreement with these reports, our analysis showed that Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> clearly detected highly aggregated fibrillar Aβ1-42 on Bistris-SDS gradient PAGE/Western blot. In contrast, it generated essentially no appreciable signals with monomerized hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)-treated or oligomeric Aβ1-42 preparations under the tested conditions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). On peptide Bicine-Tris SDS-PAGE/Western blot and on CIEF-immunoassays we observed substantial variances with Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> between different experiments (data not shown), making reliable interpretations difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. The observed high variance of the Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> results on CIEF-immunoassay and peptide SDS-PAGE/Western blot might be related to the low affinity of Aducanumab for monomeric Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>] and the possibility that Aβ dimers or low order oligomers might form during the experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">82</xref>]. In good agreement with the strong preference of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> for highly aggregated fibrillar Aβ (see above), pre-adsorption with fibrillar Aβ1-42 largely blocked Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> immunoreactivity of vascular and parenchymal Aβ deposits in AD brain tissue, in contrast to pre-adsorption with an excess of Aβ1-42 monomers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Aβ-Abs are pivotal in AD research, in particular those which have the capacity to selectively target specific Aβ variants. Our systematic microarray analysis combined with complementary methodologies provided a comprehensive data set for a panel of research and biosimilar Aβ-Abs. By leveraging the resolution and throughput of microarrays for screening of Aβ fragments in the form of 20.000 peptide-antibody interactions, the individual epitope specificities, and the influence of PTMs or point-mutants at single amino acid resolution were investigated. While Aβ microarrays have proven useful for antibody screening and determining the localization of monomeric binding regions, complementary studies with additional methodologies, including IP-MS, CIEF immunoassay, SDS-PAGE/Western blot, and immunohistochemistry applied here, are necessary since different methods may yield different insights into Aβ-Ab binding requirements and thus into the Abs’ mode of action.</p>
<p>In view of the biosimilar Abs studied here, our findings recapitulated the strong selectivity of Donanemab<sub>bs</sub> for Aβ fragments starting with a cyclized AβE3-X and comprising a core epitope at residues 3-10. The core epitope of Lecanemab<sub>bs</sub> for an N-terminally truncated Aβ2-x fragment was identified at residues 3-7. Also, in the case of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub>, the microarray experiments provided very detailed insights into the antibody-antigen interactions in this specific setup. However, as these findings were obtained with short monomeric Aβ fragments, they do not seem to fully reflect and explain the preferential binding of Aducanumab to aggregated Aβ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>], which was confirmed here. Nevertheless, our microarray data can still generate hypotheses as to the molecular details underpinning the observed selectivity for short phospho-Aβ fragments, even if this may not be directly relevant for the mode of aggregate binding. Moreover, the reduced binding strength of Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> on microarray to N-terminal Aβ fragments carrying the rare H6R mutation exemplifies that genetic variability might affect therapeutic responses. Finally, the Aducanumab<sub>bs</sub> specificity profiling provides experimental evidence for different mono- and multivalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">81</xref>] Aβ binding modes, offering valuable insights that could guide the design of novel monoclonal antibodies.</p>
<p>In summary, we have systematically compared the binding requirements of 20 Aβ-Abs commonly used for research, diagnostic and therapeutic applications by addressing sequence (including genetic and species variants), PTM, and structural aspects. Our work may not only serve the purpose of a resource facilitating the selection of Aβ-Ab for particular research applications, but also provides systematic insights into the mode of action of biosimilars of the currently available therapeutic Aβ-Abs, which may help to improve the benefit-risk ratio of future generations of this new class of therapeutics for AD.</p>

<p>Paper functionalization was performed by introducing some variations to the previous protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref>] aimed at increasing the output of discs per session. In brief, Whatman paper grade 50 (45 × 25 cm) was cut into 4mm diameter discs using an OMTech 50-watt CO2 laser at 7.8% power and 150 mm/s speed. To reduce mechanical stress and facilitate transfer into a 384-plate, each disc was cut with a semi-circular pattern. The pre-cut layout (15 x 10 cm) was then treated for 3 hours with a solution of 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl-β-alanine (Fmoc-β-Ala-OH), diisopropylmethanediimine (DIC) and 1-Methylimidazole (NMI). The Fmoc absorption of each batch of functionalized cellulose membrane was determined at 290nm after 20 minutes of deprotection with 20% (v/v) piperidine (pip) in DMF. The average loading was 130nmol/disc.</p>

Peptide chains were elongated using a coupling solution consisting of amino acids (0.5M) with oxyma (1M) and DIC (1M) in DMF (1:1:1). Coupling steps were carried out 3 times (30min), followed by capping (4% acetic anhydride in DMF). Discs were transferred into 96 deep-well plates for the work-up. Side chains were deprotected using 90% trifluoracetic acid (TFA), 2% dichloromethane (DCM), 5% H<sub>2</sub>O and 3% triisopropylsilane (150μL/well) for 1h at room temperature (RT). Afterward, the deprotection solution was removed, and the discs were solubilized ON at RT, while shaking, using a solvation mixture containing 88.5% TFA, 4% trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA), 5% H2O and 2.5% TIPS (250μL/well). The resulting peptide-cellulose conjugates (PCCs) were precipitated with ice-cold ether (700μL/well) and spun down at 2000×g for 10min at 4°C, followed by two additional washes of the formed pellet with ice-cold ether. The resulting pellets were dissolved in DMSO (250μL/well).</p>

<title>Microarray Quality Control</title>
<p>LC-MS was carried out using peptide quality controls that were cleaved from the solid support. To ensure cleavage, a Rink amide linker (Iris) suitable for SPPS on cellulose support was introduced during the first coupling cycle. In an acidic environment, the quality controls were cleaved off the solid support. To isolate the quality controls, 150 µL of the supernatant (SN) was transferred to 1.5 mL reaction tubes, followed by the addition of 700 µL of diethyl ether. The samples were then vortexed, and the peptides were allowed to precipitate by incubation at -20°C overnight. After centrifugation at 13,300 × g and 4°C for 10 min, the SN was discarded, and 500 µL of diethyl ether was added. The mixture was vortexed, centrifuged for 10 min, and the supernatant was decanted. This process was repeated twice, and the peptides were left to dry for 60 min. Finally, the Rink amides were dissolved in 50 µL of 50% acetonitrile; 0.1% formic acid (v/v) and vortexed briefly before centrifugation at 13,300 × g and room temperature. For analysis, the quality controls were diluted 1:3 and sent to LC-MS (Agilent technologies).</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
<p>For molecular dynamic (MD) simulations the crystal structure of the aducanumab Aβ complex structure (PDB: 6CO3) was used. The complex structure was prepared using MOE (Molecular Operating Environment, 2022.02, Chemical Computing Group ULC, 1010 Sherbooke St. West, Suite #910, Montreal, QC, Canada, H3A2R7, 2023) structure preparation tools with default values. For producing the MD-starting structure the experimentally resolved residues of the Aβ were prolonged by either a serine or a phosphorylated serine in MOE.</p>
<p>The MD simulations were conducted using AMBER22 suite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref>]. Topology and parameter files were generated in tleap module using the AMBER ff14sb. The simulations were set up in the following way: The peptide-aducanumab complex was energy minimized for 2000 steps using a generalized Born implicit solvent model, neutralized, and solvated using the TIP3P water model. The system was equilibrated by heating the solvent from 100 K to 300 K within 500 ps under constant volume conditions with non-solvent atoms assigned with harmonic constraints of 100 kcal· mol-1·Å-2. Cooling the system back to 100 K within 250 ps and lowering the harmonic constraints on non-solvent atoms to 1 kcal·mol-1·Å-2, followed by heating to 300 K within 500 ps period. Afterwards, the non-solvent atoms constraints were set off and the pressure was adjusted to 1 bar using the Berendsen barostat. Each complex (unmodified and phosphorylated) was simulated in triplicates for 200 ns at constant pressure and temperature. All simulations were carried out using periodic boundary and particle mesh Ewald (PME) methodology to handle long-range electrostatics. 2 fs-time steps were used for integration and coordinates of were saved every 500 steps (1 ps). The trajectories were further analysed with CPPTRAJ (4.14.0).</p>

<title>Bistris-SDS Gradient PAGE/Western Blots Analysis of Different Aβ Aggregation States</title>
<p>For the assessment of antibody binding to different Aβ aggregation states, we used Aβ1-42 monomers (Cat. No SPR-485B), Aβ1-42 oligomers (Cat. No SPR-488B) and preformed Aβ1-42 fibrils (Cat. No SPR-487B) (StressMarq biosciences, Victoria, BC, Canada). The samples for electrophoresis were prepared (starting from stock solutions) with final concentrations of 0.1 µg/µL) in LDS sample buffer (247.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate (LDS), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.22 mM Brilliant Blue G250, 0.175 mM Phenol Red) and denatured by heating at 70°C for 10 min. Per lane, 0.361, 0.722 or 1.44 µg of the different Aβ1-42 forms were loaded on a 4-12% Bistris-gel (1mm, 12 wells, Anamed Electrophorese GmbH, Groß-Bieberau / Rodau, Germany) and separated at 200 V using MES-SDS running buffer. Following recommendations provided by the manufacturer of the different Aβ1-42 aggregation forms, electroblotting onto nitrocellulose was done at 100 V for 1 hour with a Biorad mini tank blot. The prechilled transfer buffer contained 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol and 0.0375 % Tween-20. After blotting, the membrane was washed for 10 min at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) followed by blocking for 30 min with 5% powdered milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T). The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies in 5% milk in TBS-T over night at 4°C and washed 3 x for 10 min with TBS-T at room temperature.

After 1 h incubation with the secondary antibodies, the blots were washed 3 x for 10 min with TBS-T and incubated for 5 min with ECL-Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Cytiva Amersham, Little Chalfont, England). Images were recorded on a Vilber-Loumart Fusion SL blot imager. To confirm successful blotting of all Aβ variants, the blot membranes were reprobed without prior stripping with mAb4G8 (0.5 µg/mL in 5% milk in TBS-T over night at 4°C or 1-2 h at room temperature) followed by anti-mouse IgG-POD (1:10000 in TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature.

After the electrophoresis, the gel was shortly rinsed with 50 mM Tris –HCl, pH 8.0, followed by blotting the peptides on PVDF using a Gravity Blotter (Serva Electrophoresis GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). The blotting sandwich was assembled on the Gravity blotter from bottom to top by first placing the gel on the lower plate, followed by a precut PVDF membrane (activated with methanol and equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), one filter paper Whatmann 3mM equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, three dry filter papers (Sartorius BF4 blotting paper) and, finally, three 2.25 kg Gravity Blotter metal plates. The gravity/press blotting was done overnight at room temperature. On the next morning, the blot sandwich was disassembled and the PVDF membrane was boiled in PBS for 3min in a microwave oven with the protein side facing downwards. After blocking for 30 min at room temperature with 2% ECL Prime blocking reagent (Cytiva) in PBS containing 0.075% Tween-20 (PBS-T), the blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies (0.5 µg/mL in 2% ECL-Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent in PBS-T).

<p>Antibodies that selectively bind distinct amyloid-beta variants are vital tools for Alzheimer's disease research. This <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript aims to delineate the epitope specificity in a panel of anti-amyloid-beta antibodies, including some with clinical relevance. The experiments were rigorously conducted, employing an interesting combination of established and state-of-the-art methodologies, yielding mostly robust findings. While the data regarding antibody sequence preferences for distinct amyloid-beta regions and aggregation states are <bold>convincing</bold>, a thorough revision of the manuscript would help to highlight the key results.</p>

<p>The manuscript by Ivan et al aimed to identify epitopes on the Abeta peptide for a large set of anti-Abeta antibodies, including clinically relevant antibodies. The experimental work was well done and required a major experimental effort, including peptide mutational scanning, affinity determinations, molecular dynamics simulations, IP-MS, WB, and IHC. Therefore, it is of clear interest to the field. The first part of the work is mainly based on an assay in which peptides (15-18-mers) based on the human Abeta sequence, including some containing known PTMs, are immobilized, thus preventing aggregation. Although some results are in agreement with previous experimental structural data (e.g. for 3D6), and some responses to disease-associated mutations were different when compared to wild-type sequences (e.g. in the case of Aducanumab) - which may have implications for personalized treatment - I have concerns about the lack of consideration of the contribution of conformation (as in small oligomers and large aggregates) in antibody recognition patterns. The second part of the study used full-length Abeta in monomeric or aggregated forms to further investigate the differential epitope interaction between Aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab (Figures 5-7). Interestingly, these results confirmed the expected preference of these antibodies for aggregated Abeta, thus reinforcing my concerns about the conclusions drawn from the results obtained using shorter and immobilized forms of Abeta. Overall, I understand that the work is of interest to the field and should be published without the need for additional experimental data. However, I recommend a thorough revision of the structure of the manuscript in order to make it more focused on the results with the highest impact (second part).</p>

<p>This paper investigates binding epitopes of different anti-Abeta antibodies. Background information on the clinical outcome of some of the antibodies in the paper, which might be important for readers to know, is lacking. There are no references to clinical outcomes from antibodies that have been in clinical trials. This paper would be much more complete if the status of the antibodies were included. The binding characteristics of aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab should be compared with data from clinical phase 3 studies.</p>
<p>Aducanumab was identified at Neurimmune in Switzerland and licensed to Biogen and Eisai. Aducanumab was retracted from the market due to a very high frequency of the side-effect amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E). Gantenerumab was developed by Roche and had two failed phase 3 studies, mainly due to a high frequency of ARIA-E and low efficacy of Abeta clearance. Lecanemab was identified at Uppsala University, humanized by BioArctic, and licensed to Eisai, who performed the clinical studies. Eisai and Biogen are now marketing lecanemab as Leqembi on the world market. Donanemab was developed by Ely Lilly and is sold in the US as Kisunla.</p>
<p>Limitations:</p>
<p>(1) Conclusions are based on Abeta antigens that may not be the primary targets for some conformational antibodies like aducanumab and lecanemab. There is an absence of binding data for soluble aggregated species.</p>
<p>(2) Quality controls and characterization of different Abeta species are missing. The authors need to verify if monomers remain monomeric in the blocking studies for Figures 5 and 6.</p>
<p>(3) The authors should discuss the limitations of studying synthetic Abeta species and how aggregation might hide or reveal different epitopes.</p>
<p>(4) The authors should elaborate on the differences between synthetic Abeta and patient-derived Abeta. There is a potential for different epitopes to be available.</p>
