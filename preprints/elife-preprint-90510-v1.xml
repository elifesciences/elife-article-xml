<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is a rare disease that is characterized by cerebellar dysfunction. Patients have progressive motor coordination impairment, and postmortem brain tissue reveals degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje cells and a reduced level of cerebellar brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However, the pathophysiological changes underlying SCA6 are not fully understood. We carried out RNA sequencing of cerebellar vermis tissue in a mouse model of SCA6, which revealed widespread dysregulation of genes associated with the endo-lysosomal system. Since disruption to endosomes or lysosomes could contribute to cellular deficits, we examined the endo-lysosomal system in SCA6. We identified alterations in multiple endosomal compartments in the Purkinje cells of SCA6 mice. Early endosomes were enlarged, while the size of the late endosome compartment was reduced. We also found evidence for impaired trafficking of cargo to the lysosomes. As the proper functioning of the endo-lysosomal system is crucial for the sorting and trafficking of signaling molecules, we wondered whether these changes could contribute to previously identified deficits in signaling by BDNF and its receptor tropomyosin kinase B (TrkB) in SCA6. Indeed, we found that the enlarged early endosomes in SCA6 mice accumulated both BDNF and TrkB. Furthermore, TrkB recycling to the cell membrane in recycling endosomes was reduced, and the late endosome transport of BDNF for degradation was impaired. Therefore, mis-trafficking due to aberrant endo-lysosomal transport and function could contribute to SCA6 pathophysiology through alterations to BDNF-TrkB signaling, as well as mishandling of other signaling molecules. Deficits in early endosomes and BDNF localization were rescued by chronic administration of a TrkB agonist, 7,8-DHF, that we have previously shown restores motor coordination and cerebellar TrkB expression. The endo-lysosomal system is thus both a novel locus of pathophysiology in SCA6, and a promising therapeutic target.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is an inherited ataxia which presently has no cure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Solodkin and Gomez, 2012</xref>). It is caused by a CAG expansion mutation that generates an expanded polyglutamine tract in the translated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhuchenko et al., 1997</xref>). The affected gene is <italic>CACNA1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Zhuchenko et al., 1997</xref>), which encodes both the alpha subunit of voltage-gated calcium P/Q channels, as well as a putative transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Du et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">2013</xref>). The cellular dysfunction giving rise to disease in SCA6 is poorly understood. Here we examine the role of the endo-lysosomal system in SCA6 pathophysiology.</p>
<p>The endo-lysosomal system comprises of a series of membrane-bound compartments that sort and transport endocytosed molecules destined for recycling or degradation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). These compartments are highly dynamic and regularly interact and fuse with each other as cargo is sorted and trafficked. Each compartment has a characteristic pH mediated by ATP-dependent acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hu et al., 2015</xref>), and is characterized by the presence of specific proteins that allow them to carry out their functions. Rab GTPases regulate trafficking of cargo, and each compartment is associated with a specific signature of Rab family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). Endocytosed cargo arrives first at the early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ludwig et al., 1991</xref>), where the slightly acidic pH leads to dissociation of ligands from their receptors. Here the cargo will undergo sorting: those that are destined for recycling such as receptors, will be returned to the cell surface. Cargo that is destined for further sorting or degradation will move to the late endosomes, which are characterized by an increasingly acidic pH and increased enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). The lysosome is the final destination of cargo that is to be degraded. This compartment is the most acidic and contains over 50 hydrolases that carry out rapid degradation of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">de Duve, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lawrence and Zoncu, 2019</xref>).</p>

<p>Endosome dysfunction plays a role in the pathophysiology of several neurological diseases. A notable example is Alzheimer’s disease, where postmortem brain tissue from patients displays increased early endosome size and accumulation of cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cataldo et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tate and Mathews, 2006</xref>). Similar early endosome changes are seen in Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cataldo et al., 2000</xref>) and Niemann Pick C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). In the cerebellum, endo-lysosomal dysfunction can lead to cerebellar dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Akizu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mannan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sterling et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Vanier, 2010</xref>), and has been identified in cerebellar diseases with diverse disease-causing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). As endosomes are the site of disassociation of ligands from their receptors, mediating both the recycling of receptors back to the cell surface and the sorting of ligands for further signaling or degradation, dysfunction can disrupt signaling pathways due to mis-trafficking of signaling molecules.</p>
<p>Previously, lysosomal accumulation of protein aggregates has been observed in a mouse model of SCA6 (118Q) that features a hyperexpanded polyglutamine repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Unno et al., 2012</xref>). This suggests that lysosomes may play a role in SCA6. Cerebellar pathology in this model was worsened when lysosomal function was impaired by the loss of the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Unno et al., 2012</xref>). However, it has been unknown whether endo-lysosomal pathway dysregulation is implicated in the natural disease progression of SCA6, or whether other endosomal compartments may be involved.</p>
<p>We have recently found that deficits in the BDNF-TrkB-Akt signaling pathway contribute to SCA6 pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>), with both BDNF and TrkB expression reduced in the cerebellar vermis. However, the underlying causes of the reduced levels of BDNF and TrkB remained unknown. Since both BDNF and TrkB are dynamically trafficked through the endo-lysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Moya-Alvarado et al., 2023</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yamashita and Kuruvilla, 2016</xref>), we wondered whether dysfunction in this system could underlie BDNF and/or TrkB mislocalization, contributing to subsequent cellular dysfunction in SCA6.</p>
<p>To address whether alterations in the endo-lysosomal system give rise to cellular dysfunction in SCA6, we examined endo-lysosomal compartments in the cerebellum of male and female SCA6<sup>84Q/84Q</sup> mice (referred to as SCA6 mice) in the early stages of SCA6 progression. In addition to observing abnormalities in endosomal compartments, we found that BDNF and its receptor TrkB accumulated in early endosomes instead of undergoing normal sorting and recycling. These abnormalities were present in SCA6 mice between 7 and 12 months of age, coincident with the onset of motor impairment and long before Purkinje cell degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jayabal et al., 2015</xref>). These changes therefore represent an early driver of SCA6 pathology. We were able to rescue the deficits in early endosomes with chronic administration of the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF, a treatment that we previously found could also rescue behavioural and Purkinje cell firing deficits in the SCA6 mice. Our findings argue that endo-lysosomal dysfunction is a novel locus of pathophysiology in spinocerebellar ataxia and a potential therapeutic target to investigate further.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The endo-lysosomal system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) is critical for proper cellular function and its dysregulation is associated with mis-trafficking of important cargo. Here we address whether endo-lysosomal dysfunction contributes to SCA6, using a mouse model (SCA6<sup>84Q/84Q</sup> mice, referred to as SCA6 mice) that robustly models the mid-life onset of motor deficits and cerebellar dysfunction seen in SCA6 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jayabal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Watase et al., 2008</xref>). We have previously shown that around 7 months of age, SCA6 mice develop deficits in motor coordination that progressively worsen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jayabal et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">2016</xref>) and display cellular deficits, including aberrant Purkinje cell firing and disrupted BDNF-TrkB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jayabal et al., 2016</xref>). But the cellular alterations that lead to the reduction of BDNF and TrkB in the SCA6 cerebellum remained unknown, so we conducted further investigation into potential causes.</p>
<p>We carried out RNA sequencing on cerebellar vermis tissue from 12-month-old litter-matched wildtype (WT) and SCA6 mice (N=5 for each genotype) during the course of another investigation. This sequencing revealed that many genes involved in the endo-lysosomal system, as defined by the gene ontology (GO:CC) terms “Endosome” (GO:0005768) and “Lysosome” (GO:0005764), were significantly dysregulated in the SCA6 cerebellum (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, Padj &lt; 0.05, see Supplementary Table 1 for a full list). The expression levels of these genes were altered by between 10% and 200% in SCA6 compared to WT. Endosomal genes were found to be both up- and down-regulated in SCA6, but the genes covered by the Lysosome GO term were mostly upregulated compared to WT. The affected genes are associated with multiple endosomal compartments, meaning that the cellular consequences could be wide reaching. We therefore aimed to determine whether different compartments of the endo-lysosomal system (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) are altered in the cerebellum of SCA6 mice, and whether this could contribute to previously described BDNF and TrkB deficits, via mis-trafficking through the endo-lysosomal system.</p>

<title>Early endosomes are enlarged and accumulate BDNF and TrkB in Purkinje cells in SCA6 mice</title>
<p>Early endosomes are the first stop for newly endocytosed cargo. There, cargo undergoes sorting as the slightly acidic pH facilitates ligand release from receptors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We carried out immunohistochemistry (IHC) against early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) on sections of cerebellar vermis from 7–8-month WT and SCA6 mice and found that EEA1 staining is present in the cerebellum, particularly in Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). We imaged Purkinje cells and could identify large tubular early endosomes in Purkinje cell somas of both WT and SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, c</xref>). The early endosome marker in SCA6 Purkinje cells covered a larger area, showing that the early endosome compartment is enlarged in SCA6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). A similar enlargement of early endosomes has been seen in other neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cataldo et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jin et al., 2004</xref>). Using the EEA1 marker to delineate early endosomes, we were able to analyze BDNF and TrkB localized within the early endosome compartment. There was a higher amount of BDNF staining within the early endosomes of Purkinje cells from SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e, f</xref>). This was intriguing as we have previously shown that BDNF levels in the cerebellar vermis as a whole are decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>), so BDNF accumulates specifically in this compartment despite depressed levels overall in the cerebellum. We found the same was true for TrkB, as TrkB immunoreactivity was increased within the EEA1 positive early endosome compartment in SCA6 Purkinje cells compared to WT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g, h</xref>). Nearly all of the TrkB staining within SCA6 Purkinje cells colocalized with the EEA1 marker (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>, arrowheads), whereas the tissue from WT mice showed abundant TrkB staining outside the early endosome compartment of Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>, arrowheads). Thus, early endosomes are enlarged and accumulate BDNF and TrkB in SCA6, despite decreased levels of both proteins in the SCA6 cerebellum as a whole. This cargo mis-trafficking could lead to a decrease in the amount of free BDNF available to signal, as well as the amount of TrkB recycled to the cell surface, thereby contributing to previously described BDNF-TrkB signaling deficits in SCA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Recycling endosomes are morphologically normal in SCA6</title>
<p>Since we identified an accumulation of TrkB in early endosomes, we wondered whether this would affect the amount of TrkB recycled back to the cell surface. Recycling endosomes return receptors to the plasma membrane for further signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">O’Sullivan and Lindsay, 2020</xref>). Syntaxin 12/13 involved in recycling of endocytosed proteins back to the plasma membrane and is located in recycling endosomes and some tubular protrusions from early endosomes that are also involved in recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Prekeris et al., 1998</xref>). We used two different antibodies for Syntaxin 12/13 (Stx13) as a marker for recycling endosomes. Staining with both antibodies revealed a large network of small recycling endosomes in Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>, Supp. Fig 1). Analysis revealed that recycling endosome area was unchanged in SCA6 Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>, Supp. Fig. 1). We noted colocalization between TrkB and Stx13, showing TrkB being recycled back to the cell surface after dissociation from bound BDNF in the early endosomes. The TrkB staining within the recycling endosome compartment marked by Stx13 was decreased in Purkinje cells in SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). Combined with the increased levels of TrkB in the early endosomes of Purkinje cells in SCA6 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>), these data argue that TrkB is stuck in early endosomes in SCA6, rather than being recycled to the cell surface to the same extent as in WT Purkinje cells. This mislocalization may contribute to the depressed levels of BDNF-TrkB signaling previously described in SCA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Late endosomes</title>
<p>Early endosomes undergo maturation into late endosomes in order to transport cargo destined for degradation to the lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Neurons use this degradative pathway as a way to regulate BDNF levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Evans et al., 2011</xref>). We used Rab7 as a marker for late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Vitelli et al., 1997</xref>), and identified numerous late endosomes in Purkinje cells of both WT and SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The Rab7 staining covered a smaller area in the Purkinje cells of SCA6 mice compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>), indicating a reduction in the size or number of late endosomes. Most of the BDNF staining within the Purkinje cells did not colocalize with Rab7 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), which was expected as we had previously found high levels of colocalization of BDNF with the early endosome marker EEA1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). The BDNF staining that was present within the Rab7 positive late endosome compartment was significantly reduced in SCA6 compared to WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>), suggesting that BDNF accumulates in the early endosomes earlier in the endosomal pathway (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), preventing its progression through the late endosomal stage. Late endosomes transport cargo to lysosomes for degradation, so less BDNF may reach the lysosome in SCA6. This could have implications for the regulation of BDNF within Purkinje cells, as neurons tightly regulate BDNF levels via degradative pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Evans et al., 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Lysosomal morphology is unchanged in SCA6</title>
<p>We next aimed to determine whether lysosomes were altered in SCA6, using a dual strategy to visualize the lysosomes in cerebellar slices. We first used a pH sensitive dye, LysoTracker Red DND 99, to visualize the acidic lysosomes (Fig, 5a, b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chazotte, 2011</xref>). As LysoTracker labels all acidic compartments, it is not sufficient to confirm the identity of lysosomes. This may be particularly problematic if other intracellular compartments undergo inappropriate acidification, which has been observed in other neurological diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pescosolido et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, after staining acute cerebellar slices with LysoTracker, we performed immunohistochemistry for Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1), a glycoprotein localized at the membranes of lysosomes. Because even Lamp1 can be localized outside of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>), we used both LysoTracker and Lamp1 to identify lysosomes in Purkinje cells. We found that both stains labelled lysosomes within Purkinje cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). As expected, the Lamp1 staining appeared as ring like structures, marking the membranes of the lysosomes, while LysoTracker staining marked the acidic lumen of the lysosomes, in the center of these rings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, see zoom). While Lamp1 staining identified a large number of lysosomes of varying size, the LysoTracker stain was present only in the largest. This discrepancy has been noted previously, as LysoTracker does not label the smallest lysosomes in cerebellar slices or other cell preparations that are fixed after staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chazotte, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Song et al., 2008</xref>). We found that the total area covered by the Lamp1 and LysoTracker stains was not significantly different between Purkinje cells from WT and SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c, d</xref>). The area of colocalization between the two stains was also unchanged (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To investigate further and determine whether the two stains label the same population of lysosomes in the two genotypes, we counted the number of lysosomes labelled by different combinations of the two markers. The lysosomes labelled by these two strategies could be divided into 3 groups. (1) Compartments stained by both Lamp1 and LysoTracker, confirming that they are indeed lysosomes. The number of these lysosomes was indistinguishable between WT and SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), indicating that Lamp1 positive lysosomes are present in normal quantities and are appropriately acidified in SCA6 Purkinje cells. In agreement, the area covered by each stain per lysosome, a proxy for the size of the lysosomes, was unchanged in SCA6 (Supp. Fig. 2). (2) Lysosomes labelled by Lamp1 but not LysoTracker (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g</xref>) represent small lysosomes unable to retain the LysoTracker dye after fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chazotte, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Song et al., 2008</xref>). This number was not significantly different between WT and SCA6 mice and so Lamp1 appears to be present at normal levels and is appropriately localized to lysosomes in SCA6. (3) Organelles labelled by LysoTracker but not Lamp1 could include maturing late endosomes or other endosomal compartments that are inappropriately acidified. Late endosomes have an acidic pH and Rab7 positive late endosomes can be LysoTracker positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Majzoub et al., 2016</xref>). Late endosomes fuse with lysosomes to complete cargo degradation, but first they mature into an intermediate compartment called an endolysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). Therefore, these LysoTracker-positive Lamp1-negative organelles could be late endosomes or intermediate endolysosomes that have not yet fused with the Lamp1 positive lysosomes. The number of these compartments was low in Purkinje cells in both genotypes but was significantly lower in SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5h</xref>). This agrees with our finding of a reduction in the size of the late endosome compartment in SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>). A reduction in the late endosome compartment suggests that there are fewer late endosomes available to mature and fuse with lysosomes. Therefore, the Lamp1 positive lysosomes are morphologically normal in the Purkinje cells of SCA6 mice while the small alteration in Lysotracker staining likely represents a deficit in the maturation of late endosomes before fusion with lysosomes.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that although lysosomes are present in normal numbers, the trafficking of endocytosed cargo to the lysosome for degradation is impaired in the SCA6 cerebellum. Our transcriptomic data furthermore shows that genes encoding lysosomal proteins are abnormally expressed in SCA6 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), suggesting that lysosomal dysfunction is present in SCA6. Lysosomes are enzymatically active sites of degradation and contain multiple proteases that rapidly break down proteins. However, lysosomal proteolysis depends not just on enzymatic activity, but on the correct transport of proteins to the lysosomes through endosomal compartments. We wondered whether the deficits we identified in early and late endosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), or other deficits in lysosome activity, might impair the ability of lysosomes to degrade endocytosed cargo in SCA6. We assayed this by incubating acute cerebellar slices with BODIPY FL Pepstatin A, an exogenous peptide that can be endocytosed and transported to the lysosome, where it binds to the active form of the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chen et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). We could visualize Pepstatin A signal within Lamp1 positive puncta, demonstrating Cathepsin D enzymatic activity within lysosomes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). The Pepstatin A signal within Purkinje cells was significantly reduced in SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>, d), revealing a lower level of either the endocytosed construct, or of active Cathepsin D. The identification of alterations in the early and late endosomes that transport cargo to the lysosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), suggests that SCA6 Purkinje cells have endosomal deficits that reduce transport of the endocytosed Pepstatin A construct to the lysosome where it can bind active Cathepsin D. This finding is therefore consistent with an overall impairment of endo-lysosomal trafficking. The reduction in Pepstatin A signal would also be consistent with a reduction in Cathepsin D enzymatic activity that could further contribute to aberrant handling of endocytosed cargo in SCA6. RNA-sequencing identified an upregulation of lysosomal enzyme transcripts in the SCA6 cerebellum, including the <italic>CTSD</italic> gene encoding Cathepsin D (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). However, this would not necessarily lead to an increase in enzyme activity as the RNA must first be translated, and then undergo post-translational proteolytic processing in order to produce the active form of Cathepsin D that binds Pepstatin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zaidi et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that in SCA6, there is an upregulation in <italic>CTSD</italic> and other lysosomal genes that does not lead to an increase in functional enzymes. This may be a compensatory mechanism for trafficking deficits of cargoes to the lysosomal compartment, or an attempt to compensate for deficits in the production of the active form of Cathepsin D. In summary, our results illustrate that Purkinje cells in SCA6 mice have an impaired ability to degrade other endocytosed cargo beyond BDNF and TrkB. This likely arises from trafficking deficits that result in a disruption in the transport of cargo to the lysosomes, along with lysosomal dysfunction.</p>

<title>TrkB activation with 7,8-DHF rescues deficits in early endosomes</title>
<p>We have previously shown that the TrkB agonist 7,8-DHF rescues deficits in motor coordination and Purkinje cell firing in SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>). One interpretation of this rescue is that the TrkB agonist compensates for reduced levels of BDNF in the SCA6 cerebellum, thereby activating downstream signaling cascades to restore cerebellar function. However, we have also previously shown that TrkB activation with 7,8-DHF led to increased levels of TrkB in the SCA6 cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting a role of autocrine signaling in the rescue, as TrkB activation appears to regulate its own expression. Given that TrkB signaling is known to be involved in the regulation and trafficking of endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>), we wondered whether chronic oral administration of 7,8-DHF to SCA6 mice would rescue the deficits in early endosome size. We used the same treatment regimen of 7,8-DHF that had previously been shown to rescue deficits in behaviour and Purkinje cell firing, which comprised of 1 month of oral administration of the drug to peri-onset (6–7-month-old) SCA6 mice (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7a</xref>). Half of the mice received control solution with no drug added. After one month of 7,8-DHF administration, cerebellar vermis sections were stained for BDNF and EEA1 as an early endosome marker, as previously described (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). 7,8-DHF administration rescued the size of the early endosomes, with the total EEA1 area within Purkinje cells reducing to the WT level previously described (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b, c</xref>). The level of BDNF accumulation within the early endosomes was also restored (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>), suggesting that in addition to autocrine upregulation of TrkB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>), TrkB activation can normalize intracellular localization and trafficking of its endogenous ligand, consistent with its role in regulating endosome trafficking and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Scott-Solomon and Kuruvilla, 2018</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have identified multiple novel deficits in the endo-lysosomal pathway that could contribute to BDNF-TrkB signaling alterations in SCA6 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Early endosomes were enlarged in SCA6 and accumulate BDNF and TrkB. Recycling endosomes were morphologically normal but carried less TrkB, and late endosomes were reduced in size and carried less BDNF. This suggests that cargo is getting stuck in the enlarged early endosomes in SCA6. The involvement of lysosomal pathology in SCA6 is less clear. Lysosomes appear morphologically normal with normal pH, but RNA-sequencing revealed upregulation of lysosomal genes in SCA6. SCA6 Purkinje cells also showed a reduction in exogenous cargo binding to the lysosomal enzyme Cathepsin D, indicating either a deficit in lysosomal enzyme activity, defects in endocytosis and cargo trafficking to lysosomes, or both. Taken together, these deficits could lead to cellular dysfunction in SCA6. This work further highlights how BDNF and TrkB deficits manifest in SCA6, and the potential of targeting this pathway therapeutically.</p>

</fig>
<p>Excitingly, both the enlargement of early endosomes and the accumulation of BDNF in early endosomes could be rescued by the TrkB agonist, 7,8-DHF. There is evidence that TrkB can regulate its own expression and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Haapasalo et al., 2002</xref>) and we had previously shown that TrkB activation with the agonist 7,8-DHF increased levels of TrkB in the cerebellum of SCA6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>). This new finding demonstrates that not only does TrkB activation with 7,8-DHF regulate the expression of TrkB in the SCA6 cerebellum, but also the localization of its ligand within endosomal compartments. This provides insight into the mechanisms by which BDNF and TrkB are regulated in the cerebellum. Furthermore, the finding that 7,8-DHF can rescue endosomal deficits in SCA6 supports the promise of 7,8-DHF and other TrkB agonists as potential treatments for SCA6 and raises the possibility of their use for treatment of other disorders displaying early endosome deficits.</p>
<p>This is important as early endosome deficits are not unique to SCA6. Enlargement of early endosomes is a hallmark of dysfunction in the endosomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kaur and Lakkaraju, 2018</xref>) and has been observed in multiple diseases including Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cataldo et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tate and Mathews, 2006</xref>), Down syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cataldo et al., 2000</xref>), models of macular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kaur et al., 2018</xref>), Charcot-Marie-Tooth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bucci et al., 2012</xref>) and Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Vidyadhara et al., 2019</xref>). Early endosome abnormalities can arise from deficits in maturation or fusion of early endosomes, or alterations in the microtubule networks that govern endosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Skjeldal et al., 2012</xref>). Purkinje cells may be particularly susceptible to early endosome enlargement, as in postmortem tissue from Niemann Pick type C patients, Purkinje cells had enlarged early endosomes which accumulated amyloid precursor protein, whereas in the hippocampus, pathology mostly concerned late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Jin et al., 2004</xref>). However, endosomal pathology in SCA6 and other diseases is not limited to early endosomes, and other endosomal compartments can be targeted therapeutically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bonam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tate and Mathews, 2006</xref>). In addition to identifying TrkB activation as a therapeutic strategy for endosome deficits, our work opens the door for the development of additional endosome-targeting treatment strategies for SCA6.</p>
<p>Our findings provide the first evidence for endosomal dysfunction contributing to signaling deficits in spinocerebellar ataxias. Other ataxias like SCA1 also have reduced BDNF protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Mellesmoen et al., 2019</xref>), so it would be interesting to determine whether early endosome deficits could contribute to disrupted BDNF signaling in other ataxias. Polyglutamine diseases in general are thought to have disruption in protein degradation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chai et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cortes and La Spada, 2015</xref>), and SCA7 patients and mouse models display alterations in lysosome pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alves et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, similar abnormalities could be a common feature of similar diseases.</p>
<p>There remain, however, some unanswered questions from our study. What is the specific deficit that leads to early endosome enlargement and other deficits? Is it the same as in other neurological diseases? Future work to identify this will further aid in the development of endosome-targeting therapies. There is also the question of the effect on other cargo. Sorting and recycling happens in a cargo-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hu et al., 2015</xref>) and so other cargo could be handled differently. Here we investigated endosomal trafficking of BDNF and TrkB as we have previously shown this pathway to be both dysregulated in SCA6, and amenable to therapeutic targeting. However, our experiments with BODIPY FL Pepstatin A suggest that even exogenous cargo could be transported differently in SCA6. Future research should consider whether other cargo accumulate in early endosomes and how this affects cell physiology. Furthermore, in parallel to endocytosis and endosome trafficking, cells transport proteins for degradation in lysosomes via autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Klionsky, 2005</xref>). There are therefore two pathways with a common destination of degradation in lysosomes, both of which are important for cell function, and abnormalities in one pathway can lead to disruption in the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Birgisdottir and Johansen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mahapatra et al., 2019</xref>). Future work should therefore investigate whether autophagy is disrupted in SCA6.</p>
<p>In summary, we have identified a dysregulated cellular trafficking pathway that contributes to cerebellar pathophysiology that is novel not just in SCA6, but in SCAs in general. We found that several components of the endo-lysosomal system show abnormalities in Purkinje cells in SCA6 mice. These deficits could contribute to BDNF-TrkB signaling deficits in SCA6, as BDNF and TrkB accumulate in early endosomes and there is a reduction in TrkB being recycled to the cell membrane for further signal transduction. The endo-lysosomal system is therefore a promising therapeutic target for SCA6.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>As previously described, the SCA6<sup>84Q/84Q</sup> mouse model is a knock-in mouse with a humanized 84 CAG repeat expansion mutation at the <italic>CACNA1A</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jayabal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Watase et al., 2008</xref>). We bred heterozygous mice to generate SCA6<sup>84Q/84Q</sup> and litter-matched WT control mice. Breeding mice were originally purchased from Jackson laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine; strain: B6.129S7-Cacna1atm3Hzo/J; stock number: 008683) and primer sequences for genotyping were provided by Jackson laboratories. This breeding setup allowed us to use experimental cohorts that contained litter- and sex-matched mice randomly assigned to experimental groups. Both male and female mice were included in all experiments, and we did not exclude any experimental animals from analysis. The only experiment that included pre-selection of mice was for RNA Sequencing where mice were selected for tissue collection based on rotarod performance, to include animals that were representative of their genotype. For all other experiments mice were selected at random and none were excluded. Animal husbandry and procedures were approved by the McGill Animal Care Committee in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines. All staining experiments were carried out on tissue from mice aged 7-8 months of age, except the Lamp1 and Lysotracker staining which was carried out at 12 months of age.</p>

<title>RNA extraction and sequencing</title>
<p>RNA extraction was performed on tissues from 5 WT (2 male, 3 female) and 5 SCA6 (3 male, 2 female) mice at 12 months of age. Experimental mice were selected based on rotarod performance in order to identify mice that were phenotypically representative of their genotype. The experimental area and tools were cleaned with RNAseZap (Sigma #R2020) to remove RNAse contamination prior to starting experiments. Mice were anesthetised with isoflurane until the loss of toe pinch reflex, decapitated and the cerebellar vermis was dissected, separated into anterior and posterior sections, flash frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. RNA extraction proceeded as follows, with all procedures carried out on ice or at 4°C. Cerebellar vermis tissue sections were mechanically homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen #15596026) by passing the lysate repeatedly through a series of needles, starting at 18-gauge, followed by 23-gauge. Chloroform (Sigma #288306) was added to the homogenate to separate total RNA in the aqueous phase, and RNA was recovered by precipitation with ethanol (70%). RNA extracts were purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen #74104) with DNase I treatment as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
<p>The RNA integrity of samples was quantified with capillary electrophoresis (Agilent BioAnalyzer 2100) in order to generate an RNA integrity number (RIN). All samples had an RIN over 7.5 and therefore were assessed to have high RNA quality. Library preparation and sequencing was carried out by Genome Quebec (Montreal, Quebec, Canada) using NEB stranded mRNA library prep, sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 generating 100bp paired-end reads. Samples had a median of 53 million reads (IQR, 42-64 million reads), and a median of 92% mapping rate (IQR, 92%-92%).</p>

Intracardiac perfusion comprised of a flush with 40mL of heparin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7) followed by 40mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB). Brains were rapidly removed and incubated in 4% PFA for a further 24 hours of fixation at 4°C on an orbital shaker at 70RPM. Brains were dissected to separate the cerebellum and sliced using a vibrating microtome (5100mz Vibrotome, Campden Instruments, Loughborough, UK) into sections of 75 or 100μm thickness. Slices were kept at 4°C in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide to inhibit microbial growth before staining.</p>
<p>Free-floating slices were rinsed with PBS and incubated in primary antibody (Supplementary Table 2) and blocking solution with BSA for 3 days, then rinsed in PBS and incubated for 90 minutes with secondary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2). For experiments involving anti-mouse secondary antibodies, an additional incubation with Fab fragments (AffiniPure Fab Fragment Anti-Mouse IgG, Jackson Immunoresearch 715-007-003) was added prior to secondary antibody incubation. After a final PBS wash, stained slices were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and stored at 4°C and protected from light prior to imaging.</p>
<p>For BDNF and TrkB staining, cerebellar slices were pre-treated with a heat-induced epitope retrieval step involving heating the slices in PBS to 95°C for ten minutes immediately prior to staining. Slices were allowed to cool and IHC procedures were carried out as normal.</p>
<p>Purkinje cells sometimes contained auto-fluorescent granules that were visible under excitation from a 561nm or 488 nm laser even without primary antibody incubation (Supp. Fig. 3). In order to ascertain that these granules were not interfering with the identification of endosomes or lysosomes, staining batches included a negative control slice from each animal where applicable. These slices underwent all of the usual blocking steps except primary antibodies were not added, while secondary antibody incubation and mounting proceeded as usual. In the case of the Pepstatin A negative controls, slices were incubated in ACSF without Pepstatin A BODIPY FL, and all other steps proceeded as usual. We found that although there was some background fluorescence signal in Purkinje and other cells, the intensity of the signal was lower than the staining from the antibodies of interest and was unlikely to interfere significantly with image analysis. This can be seen in side-by-side comparisons of raw images from the same mice in Supplementary figure 3.</p>

<title>Lysotracker</title>
<p>Lysotracker staining was carried out on acute cerebellar slices. Mice were anesthetised with isoflurane until the loss of toe pinch reflex and then were decapitated into ice cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM NaHCO3, and 20 mM glucose, bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (carbogen) to maintain pH at 7.3; osmolality ∼316 mOsm). The brain was removed and dissected, and the cerebellar vermis was sectioned into 150μm sagittal slices using a VT 1200S vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) in ice cold ACSF. Slices were transferred to a slice chamber filled with 37°C ACSF bubbled with carbogen for 40 minutes before staining. Slices were then incubated in LysoTracker™ Red DND-99 (ThermoFisher L7528) that was dissolved in room temperature ACSF at a concentration of 1:3000. Incubation occurred at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 70RPM. After 5 minutes of incubation the slices were transferred to 4% PFA in PB for post-fixation at 70RPM for one hour. Slices were then washed in PBS and prepared for immunohistochemistry as outlined above.</p>

<title>Pepstatin A</title>
<p>Pepstatin A imaging was carried out on acute cerebellar slices prepared in the same way as for the Lysotracker imaging outlined above. After slices were kept in 37°C ACSF bubbled with carbogen for 40 minutes they were incubated in Pepstatin A fl BODIPY (Thermofisher P12271) that was prepared at a concentration of 1μg/ mL in room temperature ACSF. A stock solution of 1μg/ 1μl pepstatin A in DMSO was prepared, to improve solubility, giving a final concentration of 0.001% DMSO in the incubation solution. Incubation lasted 30 minutes at room temperature on an orbital shaker at 70 RPM. Slices were then rinsed twice with PBS and transferred to 4% PFA for post-fixation at 70RPM for 30 minutes. Slices either underwent further staining with immunohistochemistry for Lamp1 and calbindin or were mounted onto slides immediately using ProLong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) and stored at 4°C and protected from light.</p>

<title>Image acquisition</title>
<p>Imaging was performed using an LSM800 confocal microscope (Zeiss) equipped with Zen Blue software. Images were acquired using 63x and 40x objectives at 1024 × 1024-pixel resolution. Imaging was carried out by an experimenter who was blinded to the experimental condition of the slides. All imaging and analysis was carried out in lobule 3 of the anterior vermis, a region of the cerebellum that we have previously shown to display cellular deficits in SCA6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jayabal et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>Image Analysis</title>
<p>Image analysis was performed in FIJI (ImageJ; US National Institutes of Health) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rueden et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Purkinje cell bodies were delineated by hand using calbindin or BDNF as a marker so that the Purkinje cell soma area could be isolated for further analysis. To calculate the area of the endosomes or lysosomes, an Otsu thresholding function of the endosomal marker was used. Despeckle and watershed functions were applied to create a region of interest consisting of the relevant endosomal compartment within the cell. This was subsequently used as a mask to measure fluorescence intensity levels of the cargo of interest. The cargo level was calculated using the integrated density measurement in ImageJ within the region of interest delineating the compartment of interest, and all values were normalized to the mean WT value. In <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">figure 6</xref> values were normalized to the mean SCA6 control value. Analysis was carried out using custom ImageJ macros alongside manual verification.</p>
<p>For additional analysis of the lysosomes, we performed manual counts of Lamp1 and Lysotracker positive organelles within individual Purkinje cells.</p>
<p>To improve the legibility of figure panels, linear adjustments of the brightness and contrast were applied to some representative image sets. Adjustments were kept to a minimum and identical adjustments were applied to images from all conditions, occurring after image analysis. Image analysis was performed on raw images by an experimenter blinded to the experimental condition of the slides.</p>

<title>7,8-DHF administration</title>
<p>7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) administration was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>), as we had previously found this treatment regimen to be both well tolerated and effective at restoring TrkB-Akt signaling in SCA6 mice. Briefly, single-housed mice were provided with ad libitum access to drug solutions in place of their drinking water for 1 month. These solutions contained either 157.3 μM 7,8-DHF (TCI America) dissolved in 0.04% DMSO vehicle (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) or 0.04% DMSO only as a control, dissolved in autoclaved water with 10% sucrose (Sigma, Oakville, ON, Canada) added to make the solutions palatable and disguise any taste of the drug. Solutions were prepared fresh at least twice weekly and replenished daily. It has been shown by us and others that oral administration of 7,8-DHF is sufficient to induce signaling changes in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cook et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Parrini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and the drug has been shown to be orally bioavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2013</xref>).</p>

<p>This manuscript provides <bold>valuable</bold> findings that the underlying mechanism for the reduction in BDNF-TrkB signaling in Spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6) is due to defective endolysosomal trafficking. The findings will be significant in understanding underlying pathology, but the data supporting the hypothesis is not comprehensive and the strength of the data is <bold>incomplete</bold> in some instances, in that there may be multiple mechanisms that explain the findings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Cook, Watt, and colleagues previously reported that a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) displayed defects in BDNF and TrkB levels at an early disease stage. Moreover, they have shown that one month of exercise elevated cerebellar BDNF expression and improved ataxia and cerebellar Purkinje cell firing rate deficits. In the current work, they attempt to define the mechanism underlying the pathophysiological changes occurring in SCA6. For this, they carried out RNA sequencing of cerebellar vermis tissue in 12-month-old SCA6 mice, a time when the disease is already at an advanced stage, and identified widespread dysregulation of many genes involved in the endo-lysosomal system. Focusing on BDNF/TrkB expression, localization, and signaling they found that, in 7-8 month-old SCA6 mice early endosomes are enlarged and accumulate BDNF and TrkB in Purkinje cells. Curiously, TrkB appears to be reduced in the recycling endosomes compartment, despite the fact that recycling endosomes are morphologically normal in SCA6. In addition, the authors describe a reduction in the Late endosomes in SCA6 Purkinje cells associated with reduced BDNF levels and a probable deficit in late endosome maturation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The article is well written, and the findings are relevant for the neuropathology of different neurodegenerative diseases where dysfunction of early endosomes is observed. The authors have provided a detailed analysis of the endo-lysosomal system in SCA6 mice. They have shown that TrkB recycling to the cell membrane in recycling endosomes is reduced, and the late endosome transport of BDNF for degradation is impaired. The findings will be crucial in understanding underlying pathology. Lastly, the deficits in early endosomes are rescued by chronic administration of 7,8-DHF.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The specificity of BDNF and TrkB immunostaining requires additional controls, as it has been very difficult to detect immunostaining of BDNF. In addition, in many of the figures, the background or outside of Purkinje cell boundaries also exhibits a positive signal.</p>
<p>One important concern about the conclusions is that the RNAseq experiment was conducted in 12-month-old SCA6 mice suggesting that the defects in the endo-lysosomal system may be caused by other pathophysiological events and, likewise, the impairment in BDNF signaling may also be indirect, as also noted by the authors. Indeed, Purkinje cells in SCA6 mice have an impaired ability to degrade other endocytosed cargo beyond BDNF and TrkB, most likely because of trafficking deficits that result in a disruption in the transport of cargo to the lysosomes and lysosomal dysfunction. Moreover, the beneficial effects of 7,8-DHF treatment on motor coordination may be caused by 7,8-DHF properties other than the putative agonist role on TrkB. Indeed, many reservations have been raised about using 7,8-DHF as an agonist of TrkB activity. Several studies have now debunked (Todd et al. PlosONE 2014, PMID: 24503862; Boltaev et al. Sci Signal 2017, PMID: 28831019) or at the very least questioned (Lowe D, Science 2017: see Discussion: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/those-compounds-aren-t-what-you-think-they-are">https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/those-compounds-aren-t-what-you-think-they-are</ext-link> Wang et al. Cell 2022 PMID: 34963057). Another interpretation is that 7,8-DHF possesses antioxidant activity and neuroprotection against cytotoxicity in HT-22 and PC12 cells, both of which do not express TrkB (Chen et al. Neurosci Lett 201, PMID: 21651962; Han et al. Neurochem Int. 2014, PMID: 24220540). Thus, while this flavonoid may have a beneficial effect on the pathophysiology of SCA6, it is most unlikely that mechanistically this occurs through a TrkB agonistic effect considering the potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory roles of flavonoids in neurodegenerative diseases (Jones et al. Trends Pharmacol Sci 2012, PMID: 22980637).</p>

<p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their careful reading of the manuscript and for the positive feedback and constructive criticism that they have provided. We intend to incorporate this feedback into an improved and updated version of the manuscript. We will address the reviewer comments point by point when we submit an updated version but for now we would like to discuss the major points that we intend to address.</p>
<p>The first concern raised by the reviewers related to the specificity of the BDNF and TrkB staining. We agree that this is an important concern. We tested several antibodies and staining protocols and found that the optimal protocol involved the antibody used in this paper (abcam ab108319), in combination with a heat induced epitope retrieval (HIER) step. Together, this gave robust staining of BDNF in cerebellar tissue and the results of quantification of the staining were in agreement with a BDNF ELISA that we carried out to measure levels of BDNF in the cerebellar vermis of WT and SCA6 mice (Cook et al., 2022). We outline the epitope retrieval method briefly in the methods section of this manuscript but in a revised version we will include further details and data showing the troubleshooting and validation experiments that we have conducted.</p>
<p>Another concern raised by the reviewers is that 7,8-DHF may not be acting as a TrkB agonist. There has been controversy over the mechanism of action of 7,8-DHF and we welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue further in the present manuscript. We have some evidence that 7,8-DHF is acting via TrkB in this case, as we had previously shown that 7,8-DHF administration to SCA6 mice leads to increased cerebellar TrkB levels and phosphorylation of Akt, an activation event known to be downstream of TrkB (Cook et al., 2022). This implicates TrkB in the mechanism of rescue in this case, but we have not demonstrated this directly. We acknowledge that 7,8-DHF could be acting via a different mechanism, such as anti-oxidant or anti-inflammatory effects. This would be interesting and could be followed up on in the future, potentially providing further insights into the pathophysiology of SCA6. We plan to revise the manuscript and provide additional discussion of the potential mechanism of action of 7,8-DHF. Despite this uncertainty, we believe that the finding that 7,8-DHF rescues early endosome abnormalities is a valuable addition to the paper. Whatever the mechanism of 7,8-DHF, this compound holds promise for potential treatment of SCA6.</p>
<p>With further staining experiments and addition of information to the text, we feel confident that we can address the concerns of the reviewers and that an updated version will strengthen our manuscript and thereby provide valuable insight into the pathophysiology and potential treatment of SCA6.</p>
