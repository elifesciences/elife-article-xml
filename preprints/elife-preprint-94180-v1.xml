<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Cohesin is a multi-subunit protein responsible for holding sister chromatids together during mitosis and meiosis. Each subunit is functionally essential, and their deletion is always lethal. SCC3 is a highly conserved constituent of the cohesin complex. However, the exact mitotic and meiotic functions of SCC3 in rice remains to be elucidated. Here, we found null alleles of <italic>SCC3</italic> cause embryo lethality. Only <italic>scc3</italic> weak mutants could survive and show vegetative and reproductive defects. Specifically, the replication process of sister chromatids is disturbed in <italic>scc3</italic> during interphase both in mitosis and meiosis. Moreover, SCC3 has distinct localization patterns between mitotic and meiotic cells. The numbers of DMC1, RAD51 and ZIP4 foci are significantly decreased in <italic>scc3</italic>, and ZEP1 displays as an abnormal punctate foci during zygotene. Importantly, the <italic>scc3</italic> fails to synapse, but in this case chromosome fragmentation is absent. Thus, SCC3 seems to inhibit inter-sister chromatids repair (ISR), and this process is independent of DMC1-mediated ISR.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The correct segregation of sister chromatids is essential for mitotic cell stabilization and to generate haploid gametes during meiosis. The cohesin complex is a conserved multi-subunit protein system that guarantees the proper segregation of sister chromatids in mitosis and across living organisms. This complex is formed by four core subunits, including the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) subunits SMC1 and SMC3, and the sister chromatid cohesin (SCC) subunits SCC1 and SCC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bolanos-Villegas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moronta-Gines et al., 2019</xref>). The cohesin complex forms a ring encircling the sister chromatids and ensures genomic stability during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, cohesin also participates in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), homologous pairing, construction of the synaptonemal complex (SC), orientation of kinetochores, and regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Cohesin is established during the S phase, and includes arm and centromeric cohesin. Arm cohesin ensures sister chromatids bond together during mitotic prophase. Centromeric cohesin persists until the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, and is vital to resist the force exerted by spindle microtubules, allowing for the accurate segregation of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell. The dissociation of cohesin generally occurs in two steps, including through the dissociation of cohesin on chromosome arms during prometaphase, followed by the degradation of cohesin at the centromeres at the onset of anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Ishiguro and Watanabe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Watanabe, 2005</xref>). This allows sister chromatids to segregate in mitosis.</p>
<p>Meiosis contains a single round of DNA replication, but, in contrast to mitosis, is followed by two successive chromosome divisions. Nonetheless, while the loading mechanism of cohesin is very similar to the analogous process during mitosis, the cohesin degradation during meiosis occurs in two steps: from chromosome arms during the first meiotic division, and from the centromeres during the second meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Mercier et al., 2015</xref>). During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are linked by chiasmata that separate at metaphase I. At this stage, cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms while the two sister chromatids remain closely together because centromeres cohesin are preserved. Subsequently, the sister chromatids separate at anaphase II due to full cohesin disassociation at the chromosome arms and centromeres. During this process, sister chromatids cohesin is protected by shugoshin from cleavage by separase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), which determines the correct separation of sister chromatids during meiosis.</p>
<p>Notably, the cohesin complex plays additional functional roles in meiosis. Specifically, cohesin on chromosome arms is crucial for normal progression of meiosis I, while centromeric cohesin plays a more prominent role in meiosis II by geometrically orientating the sister chromatids. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are segregated in opposite directions to halve the chromosome number, but sister chromatids remain temporarily mono-oriented and move to the same pole. In meiosis II, sister chromatid pairs become bi-oriented and separate towards opposite spindle poles through similar mechanisms as those observed in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schvarzstein et al., 2010</xref>). In this process, centromeric cohesin plays a crucial role in establishing kinetochore geometry and thus determining sister kinetochore orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gryaznova et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, the cohesin complex impacts the formation of chromosome axial elements (AE) and the assembly of the synaptonemal complex (SC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agostinho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Fujiwara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Llano et al., 2012</xref>). Besides, the cohesin complex regulates gene expression in eukaryotes, acting as a transcriptional co-activator in humans that is recruited by sequence-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Casa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Kagey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Lara-Pezzi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Remeseiro et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, the cohesin complex is now emerging as a key player in DSBs repair pathway choice and efficiency. In yeast, cohesin and DMC1 may interactively modulate homologous recombination partner choice, with program-appropriate effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Hong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Phipps and Dubrana, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sanchez-Moran et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To date, there were many researches on cohesin subunits, which had different functions throughout the cell cycle. In yeast, SCC1 ensures sister chromatid cohesin in mitosis and is associated with chromosomes during the S phase, dissociating during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. The expression of SCC1 gradually decreases at the beginning of meiosis, whereby SCC1 likely plays a minor role during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>). Instead, REC8 is a special meiotic-specific cohesin component that replaces SCC1 in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Klein et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Watanabe and Nurse, 1999</xref>) and which is expressed in leptotene and decreases after pachytene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). REC8 also plays a crucial role establishing sister kinetochore orientation in yeast, mice and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ogushi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Toth et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, <italic>rec8</italic> mutants in flowering plants exhibit sticky chromosomes, which severely affects the localization of other key meiotic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, SCC3-SCC1 subcomplex is necessary for cohesin loading and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesin in mitosis in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>). SCC3 also being responsible for maintaining centromeric orientation during meiosis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kulemzina et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that cohesin is crucial for the stability of chromosome structure in mitosis and meiosis. However, does cohesin have other functions? such as participating in homologous recombination and DSBs repair process? Also, the mechanisms through which SCC3 regulates the assembly of sister chromatid cohesin in mitosis and its function in meiosis were not well investigated. SCC3 and REC8 are both meiotic cohesin, and what is the difference between them?</p>
<p>Here, we further investigated SCC3 functions, demonstrating its involvement in mitosis and meiosis. We observed the replication process of chromosome 12 during interphase confirming that SCC3 stabilizes chromosome replication process both in mitosis and meiosis, which is crucial for sister chromatids cohesin. Furthermore, we investigated the process of cohesin loading and degradation on chromosomes by using the antibody of SCC3 on chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. We also show the localization of SCC3 is regulated by REC8. Meanwhile, other meiotic proteins (COM1, DMC1, RAD51, PAIR2 and PAIR3) failed to localize in <italic>rec8</italic>. That is, REC8 is a fundamental meiotic protein which is prerequisite for the localization of other meiotic proteins. However, the meiotic components (DMC1, RAD51, ZIP4, HEI10 and ZEP1) could be present in <italic>scc3</italic> but apparently making no functional contribution to recombination and synapsis indicating that SCC3 participates in homologous pairing, synapsis, recombination progress and CO formation. More importantly, we found meiotic DSBs were well repaired in <italic>scc3</italic>, probably using sister chromatids as a template, which means SCC3, as a member of cohesin complex, could inhibit inter-sister chromatids repair during meiosis. Finally, we explore different roles of SCC3 and REC8 in meiosis. All findings are integrated into a coherent model.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>SCC3 causes both vegetative and reproductive growth defects</title>
<p>We performed a BLAST search in the Rice Genome Annotation Project database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgibin/gbrowse/rice">http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgibin/gbrowse/rice</ext-link>) and found a single hypothetical homologue of SCC3 proteins (<italic>A. thaliana</italic> SCC3, <italic>M. musculus</italic> STAG3 and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> SA1). This candidate protein is encoded by the <italic>Os05g0188500</italic> gene and shares the highest similarity with <italic>AtSCC3</italic>. The full-length cDNA of <italic>SCC3</italic> is 3755 nucleotides long and comprises 22 exons and 21 introns. SCC3 contains a 3345-nucleotide-long ORF that encodes a 1116aa protein. In higher eukaryotes, SCC3 is an evolutionary conserved protein that contains a highly conserved STAG domain (140-239aa), as predicted by SMART (Figure S1A). Multiple alignments of full-length SCC3 protein sequences and its homologs in other plants revealed the STAG domain is highly conserved across both monocotyledons and dicotyledons (Figure S1B). Homology modeling indicated SCC3 protein structures are strongly conserved in different species, which also possess similar STAG domains (Figure S2A). Additionally, a phylogenetic tree was constructed with full-length SCC3 amino acid sequences that confirmed this protein is conserved in eukaryotes (Figure S2B). We also did multiple sequence alignments of these proteins used in the evolutionary tree analysis (Figure S3).</p>
<p>A previous study in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>) identified a T-DNA insertion at the boundary between intron 5 and exon 6 of <italic>SCC3</italic> that caused lethality, whilst a weak allele was able to survive albeit with some developmental defects. To clarify SCC3 function in rice, we used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate three transgenic lines (Figure S4). The first allele (<italic>scc3-1</italic>) contains a frameshift âGAâ deletion in exon 2 and the second allele (<italic>scc3-2</italic>) contains a frameshift âACCGAâ deletion in exon 11. We tested for allelism between these two <italic>scc3</italic> mutants by crossing <italic>scc3-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> (male) and <italic>scc3-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> (female). Of the 78 F1 plants, 18 were <italic>scc3-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, 26 were <italic>scc3-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup>, 34 were wildtype for both loci. Thus, these two mutants are allelic and heterozygous <italic>scc3-1/scc3-2</italic> is lethal. We were unable to isolate homozygous mutants in these two allelic progenies (n=128, 87 plants were <italic>scc3-1</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and 41 were wildtype; n=116, 80 plants were <italic>scc3-2</italic><sup>+/-</sup> and 36 were wildtype). These results suggested that <italic>scc3-1</italic> and <italic>scc3-2</italic> mutants were both embryo-lethal.</p>
<p>In addition, we obtained a weak transgenic line (<italic>scc3</italic>) containing a frameshift âTâ insertion in exon 19 leading to premature termination of translation (Figure S4). We found the <italic>scc3</italic> weak mutant exhibits abnormal vegetative growth (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), and thus proceeded with further investigation of its other phenotypic effects, which revealed <italic>scc3</italic> decreases plant height, tiller number and panicle length (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and S5B-S5D). To investigate the patterns of <italic>SCC3</italic> expression, we employed RT-PCR in various tissues and found the gene is ubiquitously expressed, particularly in roots, leaves and small panicles (Figure S5A). Accordingly, the weak mutant of SCC3 causes severe vegetative growth defects in rice plants.</p>

<p>To elucidate whether <italic>SCC3</italic> is involved in meiosis, we performed cytological observation of anthers stained with 1% I<sub>2</sub>-KI, and found almost all pollen grains were shrunken and inviable (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1D</xref> and S5E). Our results also showed <italic>scc3</italic> flowers did not set seeds when pollinated with wild-type pollen, suggesting the mutant was sterile. We further observed heterozygous <italic>scc3</italic> plants produced progenies with a segregation ratio of 3:1 (normal: dwarf and sterile), indicating the <italic>scc3</italic> mutation is recessive and monogenic. These data suggest that <italic>scc3</italic> weak mutation dramatically interferes with plant vegetative and reproductive growth, which may be relevant to mitosis and meiosis.</p>

<title>SCC3 is required for sister chromatid cohesin during mitosis</title>
<p>To determine whether SCC3 is involved in sister chromatid cohesin in mitosis, we observed chromosome behavior in root tip cells of <italic>scc3</italic> and wildtype. DNA replicates and folds into an ordered structure during interphase in wildtype plants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). After this, the chromosomes condensed and formed short thread-like chromatids during prophase, which developed into further condensed sister chromatids in prometaphase that were aligned on the equatorial plate before separating to different poles of the cell.</p>
<p>In contrast, <italic>scc3</italic> exhibited âXâ-shaped chromosomes with distant arms and telomeres in prometaphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1G</xref>), indicating a loss of cohesin between sister chromatids. Approximately two-thirds of <italic>scc3</italic> root tip cells (70.6%, n=88) contained partially or completely separated sister chromatids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>), which were loosely arranged on either side of the equatorial plate during the anaphase-to-telophase transition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>), demonstrating the sister chromatids separated in advance as they were pulled to the spindle poles of the cell. But we did not observe any aneuploidy in anaphase, because mitotic tubulin was attached to centromeres of sister chromatids during prometaphase, and sister chromatids were still together at this time in <italic>scc3</italic>, which guarantee sister chromatids separated equally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we monitored the distance between centromeres using FISH probes with centromere-specific tandem repetitive sequence CentO in both wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic> somatic cells during prometaphase. We found the distance between sister centromeres also dramatically increased in <italic>scc3</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>, n=25). However, we also noted that, despite the distance between sister chromatids increased in <italic>scc3</italic> weak mutants, sisters were still observed side-by-side during prometaphase, suggesting that there may be other cohesin proteins to maintain sister chromatids associated. Our results demonstrated SCC3 is required for cohesin between sister telomeres, centromeres and arms during mitosis.</p>
<p>To explore whether SCC3 affects the replication process of sister chromatids, we performed full-length FISH assays to monitor the dynamic phenotype of chromosome 12 during interphase. In the wildtype, sister chromatids were replicating that could be observed during interphase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Subsequently, two chromosome clumps formed during prophase and developed into high-order linear chromosomes during prometaphase. During this time, two sister chromatids seemed overlapped and condensed into a short stick. However, in <italic>scc3</italic> an obvious chromosomes fragmentation was observed during interphase, which means the replicating chromatids are abnormally organized. During prophase, chromosome 12 were still into a lump and unable to condense into a stick phenotype. In prometaphase, these abnormal chromosomes finally form loosely-connected sister chromatids (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). These observations indicated that SCC3 is involved in the replication process of sister chromatids, which may be implicated as a regulator of the genome, influencing chromatin composition and dynamics, and crucially genome organization through folding chromosomes.</p>

<p>To investigate the localization of SCC3 during mitosis, we generated a mouse polyclonal antibody against C-terminal and performed immunostaining of root tip wildtype cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). We noted no SCC3 signal was present in <italic>scc3</italic> root tip cells, confirming the specificity of the SCC3 antibody utilized in mitosis (Figure S6A). We found SCC3 was uniformly distributed in the cells during interphase in most cases. From interphase to prophase, as chromosome replication completed, the centromere signals became brighter and SCC3 signals also become denser and brighter. SCC3 eventually converged into intact chromosomes at prometaphase. From metaphase to telophase, SCC3 signal disappeared (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). These observations suggested that SCC3 may enhance the interaction with DNA during the transition from interphase to prophase, and dissociated from chromosomes after prometaphase.</p>

<title>SCC3 acts as an axial element during meiosis</title>
<p>REC8 is a special axial protein indicating meiotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). To evaluate SCC3 localization in meiosis, we performed dual-immunolocalization between SCC3 and REC8 in wildtype meiocytes. REC8 signals were initially detected as foci in the nucleus at leptotene, while SCC3 was detectable simultaneously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). From leptotene to zygotene, SCC3 signals were detected as similar elongated foci that formed filamentous structures on the chromosomes. During pachytene and diplotene, constant SCC3 signals were distributed along chromosome axes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). At diakinesis, axial SCC3 signals became diffuse and centromeric signals gradually became clear. At metaphase I, only centromeres SCC3 antibody signals remained (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). However, REC8 signals were difficult to detect from diakinesis to metaphase I (Figure S7). In order to further clarify the localization pattern between SCC3 and REC8, we performed super-resolution imaging (SIM) on wildtype meiocytes, which showed REC8 and SCC3 were parallel and colocalized forming parallel axial elements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, central elements ZEP1 formed two parallel lines surrounded by SCC3 signals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We also noted no SCC3 signal was present in <italic>scc3</italic> meiocytes, confirming the specificity of the SCC3 antibody utilized in meiosis (Figure S6B).</p>

<title>SCC3 is required for sister chromatid cohesin in early meiosis</title>
<p>The interphase of meiosis is similar to mitosis, and sister chromatids replicate during interphase and are linked together by cohesin. To determine whether SCC3 is involved in sister chromatid cohesin during meiosis, we observed chromosome behaviors of meiocytes in <italic>scc3</italic> and wildtype before leptotene. Cytological phenotypes of meiosis initiation in rice have been reported in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). The first meiotic stage that can be distinguished is preleptotene, and sister chromatids should have completed replication during this time. In preleptotene, the meiocytes chromosomes were discrete and partially contracted during preleptotene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), and subsequently formed thin threads in the wildtype at leptotene. In <italic>scc3</italic>, chromosomes at preleptotene exhibited dispersed appearance with blurred outlines. During leptotene, chromosomes maintained a loose shape and no filamentous threads were present. These observations indicate SCC3 participates in sister chromatids replication process in early meiosis.</p>

These results indicate REC8 does not affect the early replication process of sister chromatids, and the chromosome defects in <italic>scc3 rec8</italic> double mutant may be caused by the mutation of SCC3. In addition, we performed full-length FISH assays to monitor chromosome 12 at preleptotene (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), and found that replicated chromosome 12 can form short rod-shaped threads in both wildtype and <italic>rec8</italic>, but appears as a diffuse structure in <italic>scc3</italic> and <italic>scc3 rec8</italic> mutants due to abnormal replication process.

<title>Homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis are disturbed in <italic>scc3</italic></title>
<p>To study the causes of sterility in <italic>scc3</italic>, we investigated male meiotic chromosome behavior of wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic> meiocytes. In the former, homologous chromosomes paired at early zygotene and fully synapsed at pachytene. Moreover, during metaphase I, 12 bivalents were orderly arranged on the equatorial plate, with homologous chromosomes separating at anaphase I (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, <italic>scc3</italic> chromosome behavior showed no differences at zygotene, with meiotic defects becoming apparent at pachytene, when most chromosomes dispersed as single threads with incomplete homologous paring (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We identified 24 univalents during diakinesis and metaphase I (n=161, 150 meiocytes have 24 univalents, 11 meiocytes have 1-2 bivalents), which were always pulled to opposite poles leading to sister chromatids separation at anaphase I. However, in <italic>spo11</italic> mutants containing 24 univalents, sister chromatids were separated randomly or still linked together (Figure S8A).

<p>The telomere bouquet is a prerequisite for homologous pairing at early zygotene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We performed a FISH assay to detect bouquet formation in wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic> meiocytes using a telomere-specific probe (pAtT4). As expected, the wildtype telomeres were attached to a confined region, forming a typical bouquet on the nuclear envelope at zygotene. Interestingly, the formation of telomere bouquets also occurred normally in <italic>scc3</italic> (Figure S8B). We then used 5S rDNA to monitor homologous pairing, and detected two overlapping 5S rDNA foci at pachytene in the wildtype, but two separated 5S rDNA foci in unpaired homologous chromosomes in <italic>scc3</italic> (n=52; Figure S8C), confirming SCC3âs role in homologous pairing.</p>
<p>Homologous chromosomes align and then become closely juxtaposed by a proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC), which is comprised of two parallel arrays of axial elements (AE), termed lateral elements (LE) prior to synapsis, that form the structural basis for the assembly of the SC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ren et al., 2021</xref>). Since SCC3 is a LE component, we monitored the assembly of the SC through immunostaining using an antibody against ZEP1 in <italic>scc3</italic> and wildtype meiocytes. In the wildtype, we observed ZEP1 gradually elongated and formed short linear signals during zygotene, which eventually extended along the paired homologous chromosomes at pachytene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). However, <italic>scc3</italic> mutants displayed ZEP1 as a few punctate foci during zygotene. These abnormal structures were also present at pachytene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting SCC3 plays a crucial role in the assembly of the SC. In addition, we also examined the localization of other LEs (PAIR2 and PAIR3), and these proteins behave normally in <italic>scc3</italic> (Figure S9).</p>

<p>Since homologous pairing was impaired in <italic>scc3</italic> meiocytes, we wondered whether recombination was normal in <italic>scc3</italic>. Î³H2AX is a marker that is used as a proxy to monitor DNA DSBs. Therefore, we investigated the number of Î³H2AX foci to explore the DSB formation. There was no significant difference in the number of Î³H2AX foci between the wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic> (265.4 Â± 8.6, n=31 for <italic>scc3</italic> meiocytes; 262.2 Â± 7.2, n=20 for wildtype meiocytes) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Additionally, we also examined the DSB resection factor (COM1), meiotic strand-invasion and exchange factors (RAD51, DMC1) and the Class I, interference-sensitive crossover (CO) marker (ZIP4) in both wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic>. Immunostaining results revealed that the number of COM1 foci (290.3 Â± 8.8, n=26 for <italic>scc3</italic> meiocytes; 293.8 Â± 9.4, n=23 for wildtype meiocytes) were not significantly different between the wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>).

By comparison, in <italic>scc3</italic> most HEI10 foci were sparse and did not present as large bright signals.

<title>SCC3 inhibits inter-sister chromatids repair during meiosis</title>
<p>It is worth noting that DSBs formation was normal in <italic>scc3</italic>, and inter-homolog strand-invasion is destabilized which leads to the defects in CO formation. Nevertheless, in <italic>scc3</italic>, the meiotic DSBs are reliably repaired as there is no chromosome fragmentation, most likely using sister chromatid as a repair template, leading to 24 univalents (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). These observations indicated that SCC3, as a member of cohesin complex, had the function of inhibiting inter-sister chromatids exchange during meiosis. We also observed chromosome behaviors of <italic>rec8</italic> and <italic>rec8 scc3</italic> double mutants from diakinesis to anaphase I (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Both of these mutants contained defective chromosomes displaying a highly sticky phenotype from diakinesis to metaphase I, which is similar to the phenotype of non-homolog end joining (NHEJ). Moreover, chromosome fragmentation appeared in anaphase I, illustrating that meiotic DSBs were not well-repaired in <italic>rec8</italic> and <italic>rec8 scc3</italic>. In addition, DMC1 is also responsible for inter-sister exchange during meiosis in both arabidopsis and rice(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kurzbauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).

<title>The loading of SCC3 onto meiotic chromosomes depends on REC8</title>

PAIR2 (n=28 for 3 <italic>rec8</italic> mutants) could only form short, interrupted stretches and few PAIR3 signals were detectable (n=32 for 3 <italic>rec8</italic> mutants).

<title>SCC3 interacts with RAD21.1</title>
<p>The cohesin complex is a ring-shaped protein complex where subunits interact with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Murayama and Uhlmann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Roig et al., 2014</xref>). To confirm this, we performed Y2H assays between several cohesin proteins. Surprisingly, we found SCC3 only interacts with RAD21.1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), which was further confirmed in BiFC assays (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). However, it is worth noting that SCC3 could not interact with other cohesin proteins, including REC8, SMC1 and SMC3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>), indicating that SCC3 could function directly in combination with RAD21.1 in the cohesin complex.</p>
<p>Previous studies showed cohesin regulates genes expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cuadrado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Gligoris and Lowe, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Remeseiro et al., 2012</xref>), we therefore investigated expression levels of cohesin-related genes in wildtype and <italic>scc3</italic> spikelets using RT-qPCR.

In contrast, the cohesin subunits SMC1 and SMC3, as well as lateral/central elements PAIR3 and ZEP1 showed no differences in gene expression.

<p>We then investigated cohesin gene expression levels in axial/lateral elements mutants (<italic>pair2</italic> and <italic>pair3</italic>) (Figure S10B), and found SMC3, SCC3 and SCC1 were significantly downregulated compared to the wildtype.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Chromosome segregation during mitosis and meiosis includes a series of highly organized events, such as the formation of a cohesin complex containing different subunits that play multiple functions (e.g., DSB repair, or gene expression regulation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Moronta-Gines et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nasmyth and Haering, 2009</xref>). Here, we show SCC3 is a conserved cohesin subunit affecting vegetative growth and sister chromatid assembly in both mitosis and meiosis. Crucially, our results also indicate SCC3 is a component of LE/AE that is required for homologous pairing and synapsis during meiosis, which is essential for the recombination process and CO formation. More importantly, SCC3, as a member of cohesin complex, may inhibit inter-sister chromatids repair during meiosis, which provides new insights between cohesin and inter-sister/homolog recombination partner choice in meiotic DSBs repair.</p>
<p>Current cohesin complex research mainly focuses on mitosis because the morphology of sister chromatids during meiosis is difficult to observe. In human cells, sister chromatids separate in mitosis in the absence of the SCC3 homologues SA1 and SA2. The former is required for telomere and arm cohesin, whereas the latter is essential for centromere cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Canudas and Smith, 2009</xref>). In rice, <italic>SCC3</italic> has only a single copy, therefore we observed these all kinds of defects in <italic>scc3</italic>. SCC3 is not only essential for the stability of sister chromatids cohesin but also plays a role in loading cohesin onto chromosomes. In yeast <italic>scc3</italic>, the cohesin trimer composed of SCC1, SMC1 and SMC3 remains intact. However, the trimer fails to localize to chromosomes, probably because SCC3 helps maintaining the stability of cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Orgil et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Pathania et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, SCC3 contains a conserved DNA binding domain in the SCC3-SCC1 subcomplex, which is required for cohesin association to chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Higashi et al., 2020</xref>). In yeast, the SCC3-SCC1 DNA-binding region recruits cohesin complexes to chromosomes and facilitates the function of cohesin during mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kulemzina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Li et al., 2018a</xref>). These studies implied that SCC3-SCC1 interaction is necessary for cohesin ring stability and for maintaining its association with DNA. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, SCC3 is also involved in vegetative growth of plants, but its role in mitosis remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>). Building from these previous observations, our study demonstrated that SCC3 is encoded by a single gene that participates in early cohesin formation in mitosis. In <italic>scc3</italic>, vegetative growth was severely inhibited. We found that the replication process of sister chromatids during interphase was abnormal in <italic>scc3</italic>, possibly because SCC3 is required for cohesin to stably bind to the chromosomes. Also, we observed an increased distance between sister chromatids in prometaphase, but sister chromatids remain partially dissociated not a complete separation, indicating other cohesin subunits are still functional. Taken together, our results suggest SCC3 is a conserved cohesin protein that plays a very important role in mitosis.</p>
<p>SCC3 is also involved in meiotic chromosome structure and plays a crucial role in homologous recombination and inter-sister chromatid repair during meiosis. In vertebrates, SCC3 is encoded by two genes paralogues, including the meiosis-specific subunit STAG3. In human <italic>stag3</italic>, SIM analysis showed the chromosome axes are regionally separated and the synaptonemal complex is largely reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Biswas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Fukuda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Hopkins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Llano et al., 2012</xref>). These observations suggest STAG3 is required for synapsis between homologous chromosomes. Compared to vertebrate cells, the morphology of meiocytes is more readily observed during plant meiosis. In <italic>Arabidopsis scc3</italic>, a total loss of fertility is associated with SCC3âs role in meiosis, with unstable homologous pairing at pachytene. SCC3 is also necessary for monopolar orientation of kinetochores at meiosis I and the maintenance of centromeric cohesin at anaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chelysheva et al., 2005</xref>). In other cohesin mutants, <italic>Atscc2</italic> is required for loading of the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit REC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting defects in cohesin-related genes might impact the ability of the cohesin complex to bind chromosomes. Accordingly, in meiosis, we found rice SCC3 has functions in the maintenance of replication process of sister chromatids in preleptotene. SCC3 localizes between homologous chromosomes as an important axial element during meiosis, ensuring correct homologous pairing and synapsis. Meanwhile, SCC3 is required for normal localization of DMC1, RAD51, ZIP4 and HEI10, which is essential for recombination progress and CO formation. Our working model proposes SCC3 is a part of the cohesin ring, and functions in specific association with SCC1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figures 8A</xref>). Considering SCC3âs role in cohesin and multiple meiotic functions, we speculate that SCC3 may act as LE to stabilize loop boundaries to promote sister chromatids cohesin during meiosis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). More importantly, meiotic homologous pairing and synapsis are defective in <italic>scc3</italic>, and 24 univalents could be observed at diakinesis and sister chromatids are completely separated at anaphase I with no chromosome fragmentation, which illustrates that meiotic DSBs are well repaired and could only use sister chromatids as a template to repair. Known meiotic components (COM1, DMC1 and RAD51) can be present in <italic>scc3</italic> but apparently making no functional contribution to homologous recombination, but these proteins could also have the effect of creating a leading end that can search for an available inter-sister partner, since DMC1 and RAD51 are also involved in inter-sister chromatids repair process. We propose that, when cohesin is present, meiotic recombination exhibits inter-homolog bias to repair. Nonetheless, when cohesin is absent and homologous pairing is defective, recombination exhibits inter-sister bias to repair (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). These observations imply that SCC3 acts as a component of cohesin complex, which could block inter-sister chromatids exchange during meiosis.</p>

<p>(A) Structure model of the cohesin complex. The SCC3 subunit is associated with the middle region of SCC1.</p>
<p>(B) During meiosis, SCC3âs localization pattern probably changes to the root of DNA loop with lateral elements (LE), which wraps synaptonemal complex (SC). This indicates SCC3 is a meiotic LE essential for homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis, also affects recombination progress and CO formation.</p>
<p>(C) Meiotic recombination exhibits an intrinsic and mechanistical default towards selection of homolog bias in wildtype. Cohesin is responsible for the connection of sister chromatids intervening in this mechanism to inhibit recombination into use of sisters. However, in <italic>scc3</italic>, sister bias is required, with the defects of homologous pairing and synapsis. This outcome may be achieved by the residue function of DMC1 and RAD51 promoting DSBs end association with sister. While this situation in <italic>rec8</italic> is quite different with most meiotic proteins fail to localize, thus forced to NHEJ repair pathway causing the sticky chromosomes and fragmentation.</p></caption>

<p>Cohesin is a multi-protein complex that plays a vital role establishing sister chromatid cohesin and high-order chromosome architecture in somatic and germ cells. However, distinct meiosis-specific subunits likely perform different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cuadrado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Ishiguro, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Schvarzstein et al., 2010</xref>). Our observations suggest that SCC3 and REC8 may play different roles during mitosis and meiosis. REC8 was considered a meiosis-specific protein, which played the role of SCC1 in meiosis to form cohesin complex. In this study, we found REC8 and SCC3 localization patterns were similar but not identical. Notably, REC8 was not present in mitotic cells. However, we found SCC3 is active in mitosis and meiosis, and may be involved in cohesin loading of the replication process of sister chromatids at preleptotene. Itâs worth noting that the mechanism of loading cohesin onto chromosomes in mitosis and meiosis was the same. Meiotic cohesin loaded onto chromosomes during interphase, probably when the sporogenous cell was replicating and acquired meiotic fate. This indicates REC8 is not involved in establishing cohesin at this instance. We also observed SCC3 signals at centromeres from diakinesis to metaphase I, but could not detect any REC8 at metaphase I. These different localization patterns also suggested they may have different functions in meiosis. Previous studies on Arabidopsis <italic>rec8</italic> mutants showed sticky chromosomes, and it was difficult to explain the reason of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lambing et al., 2020</xref>). Correspondingly, rice <italic>rec8</italic> meiocytes also contained defective chromosomes displaying a highly sticky phenotype from the diakinesis to metaphase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Shao et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we found the chromosomes in <italic>scc3</italic> was not sticky as observed in <italic>rec8</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Meanwhile, the majority of meiotic proteins (including SCC3) failed to localize in <italic>rec8</italic>. This indicates the normal localization of SCC3 and other meiotic proteins depends on REC8, which means REC8 may be a fundamental meiotic protein that is the prerequisite for other meiotic proteins loading. Also, the DSBs end processing and inter-sister/homolog strand-invasion are totally defective in <italic>rec8</italic>. Thus, we speculated that the sticky chromosomes in <italic>rec8</italic> may be caused by the NHEJ repair pathway (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). The presented results provide that SCC3 acts as cohesin and stabilizes sister chromatid replication process in both mitosis and meiosis, but REC8 only functions in meiosis. Both proteins are independent of each other in mitosis, but related in meiosis, with REC8 representing a more important player in meiosis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript describes the identification and characterization of rice SCC3, including the generation and characterization of plants containing apparently lethal null mutations in SCC3 as well as mutant plants containing a c-terminal frame-shift mutation. The weak scc3 mutants showed both vegetative and reproductive defects. Specifically, mitotic chromosomes appeared to partially separate during prometaphase, while meiotic chromosomes were diffuse during early meiosis and showed alterations in sister chromatid cohesion, homologous chromosome pairing, and recombination. The authors suggest that SCC3 acts as a cohesin subunit in mitosis and meiosis, but also plays more functions other than just cohesion.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The manuscript contains a large amount of generally high-quality data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Several of the conclusions drawn in the manuscript are not supported by the data. There are many examples where the authors either draw conclusions or make statements that are just not justified based on the data presented or present a conclusion as a new finding, which has already been demonstrated in the past by others. For example, they claim that SCC3 functions in the maintenance of replication. From my reading of the manuscript, nowhere did the authors examine DNA replication. Likewise, several of the conclusions drawn are in direct contrast with what is known about SCC3 in other organisms. Therefore, the conclusions are either groundbreaking or incorrect.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Prior research on SCC3, a cohesin subunit protein, in yeast and Arabidopsis has underscored its vital role in cell division. This study investigated into the specific functions of SCC3 in rice mitosis and meiosis. In a weakened SCC3 mutant, sister chromatids separating was observed in anaphase I, resulting in 24 univalents and subsequent sterility. The authors meticulously documented SCC3's loading and degradation dynamics on chromosomes, noting its impact on DNA replication. Despite the loss of homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis in the mutant, chromosomes retained double-strand breaks without fragmenting. Consequently, the authors inferred that in the scc3 mutant, DNA repair more frequently relies on sister chromatids as templates compared to the wild type.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The study presents exceptionally well-executed research in the field of rice cytogenetics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the paper's conclusions are generally well-supported, further substantiation is needed for the claim that SCC3 inhibits template choice for sister chromatids. To bolster this conclusion, I recommend that the authors perform whole-genome sequencing on parental and F1 individuals from two rice variants, subsequently calculating the allele frequencies at heterozygous sites in the F1 individuals. If SCC3 indeed inhibits inter-sister chromatid repair in the wild type, we would anticipate a higher frequency of inter-homologous chromosome repair (i.e., gene conversion). This should be manifested as a bias away from the Mendelian inheritance ratio (50:50) in the offspring of the wild type compared to the offspring of the scc3+/- mutant.</p>
