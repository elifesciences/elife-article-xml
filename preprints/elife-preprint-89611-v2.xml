<title>Summary</title><p>Brain microvessels possess the unique properties of a blood-brain barrier (BBB), tightly regulating the passage of molecules from the blood to the brain neuropil and vice versa. In models of brain injury, BBB dysfunction and the associated leakage of serum albumin to the neuropil have been shown to induce pathological plasticity, neuronal hyper-excitability, and seizures. The effect of neuronal activity on BBB function and whether it plays a role in plasticity in the healthy brain remain unclear. Here we show that neuronal activity induces modulation of microvascular permeability in the healthy brain and that it has a role in local network reorganization. Combining simultaneous electrophysiological recording and vascular imaging with transcriptomic analysis in rats, and functional and BBB-mapping MRI in human subjects we show that prolonged stimulation of the limb induces a focal increase in BBB permeability in the corresponding somatosensory cortex that is associated with long-term synaptic plasticity. We further show that the increased microvascular permeability depends on neuronal activity and involves caveolae-mediated transcytosis and transforming growth factor beta signaling. Our results reveal a role of BBB modulation in cortical plasticity in the healthy brain, highlighting the importance of neurovascular interactions for sensory experience and learning.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The intricate components comprising the blood-brain barrier (BBB) regulate the bi-directional transport of molecules between the brain and the circulatory system and maintain the extracellular environment needed for normal function of the neurovascular unit (NVU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Chow and Gu, 2015</xref>). Dysfunction of the BBB is common in many neurological disorders and is associated with impaired cross-BBB influx and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Obermeier et al., 2013</xref>). For example, seizures were shown to increase cross-BBB influx of serum albumin â in a process partially mediated by excessive release of neuronal glutamate and subsequent activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Emerging evidence suggests that cross-BBB influx/efflux may also change in response to physiological neuronal activity in the healthy brain: (1) whisker stimulation (1 hour, 2 Hz) was shown to increase BBB influx of insulin-like growth factor-I in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>); (2) physiological neuronal activity was shown to regulate BBB efflux transport in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>); and (3) circadian rhythms were shown to alter BBB efflux in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mechanisms and the role of these physiological changes in BBB properties are not known.</p>
<p>Here, we sought to test whether physiological BBB modulation may involve mechanisms previously linked to pathological BBB changes, e.g., transcytosis of serum albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seiffert et al., 2004</xref>) and transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-Î²) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">David et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Heinemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>). As TGF-Î² signaling has been linked to synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahlmanns et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Patel and Weaver, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>), we also explored the hypothesis that physiological BBB modulation may be associated with neuroplasticity. Lastly, we sought to provide the first evidence for physiological BBB modulation in humans.</p>

<title>Stimulation increases BBB permeability</title>
<p>To test for changes in BBB permeability in response to stimulation we combined electrophysiological recordings with BBB imaging using intravital microscopy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, see timeline of stimuli in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>). First, we localized vascular response to sensory stimulation using wide-field imaging of arterial diameter and monitoring change in total hemoglobin (HbT) signal during a 1 min stimulation of the limb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b-d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bouchard et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescent angiography before and immediately after 30 min of limb stimulation showed local extravasation of the tracer sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) around the responding blood vessels, indicative of BBB leakage (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1f-g</xref>). Histological analysis confirmed the presence of NaFlu in the extravascular space around small vessels in the somatosensory cortex, contralateral (and not ipsilateral) to the stimulated limb (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1m-n</xref>). Next, we intravenously injected a separate cohort of rats with either the albumin-binding dye Evans blue (EB) or albumin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Alexa488-Alb) without performing craniotomy. Brain extravasation of both dyes was found in the contralateral hemisphere, indicating the presence of serum albumin in the neuropil (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1h-k</xref>). ELISA performed in cortical tissue at different time points after stimulation confirmed a higher concentration of albumin in the stimulated sensorimotor cortex early after stimulation (30 min) compared to non-stimulated sham-controls, that declined 4- and 24-hours post-stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref>). As a positive control, brain tissues were also prepared from rats subjected to photothrombosis (PT)-induced ischemia (see methods). Albumin concentrations in the peri-ischemic cortex 24 hours following PT were significantly higher compared to sham and all time-points after stimulation (Figure S1d). These results suggest that the focal modulation of BBB permeability following stimulation is distinct from the extensive BBB dysfunction observed in injury models.</p>

<title>BBB permeability is associated with synaptic potentiation</title>
<p>To study changes in brain activity during repetitive stimulation of the limb, we measured somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) by averaging neuronal response to a 1 min test stimulation before and after the 30 min stimulation train (6 Hz, 2 mA). SEP amplitudes and area under the curve were increased in stimulated, but not in control cortices (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-e</xref>). Potentiation lasted until the end of each experiment (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>) and was therefore indicative of long-term potentiation (LTP).</p>

<p>To test whether stimulation-induced albumin extravasation has a role in LTP, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) before and after exposure of the cortex to 0.1 mM albumin (corresponding to 25% of serum concentration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Ivens et al., 2007</xref>). Albumin application increased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2g,k</xref>). Neuronal response to the stimulation showed synaptic potentiation in the presence of albumin compared to that recorded under aCSF (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2h-j</xref>), indicating that cortical exposure to serum albumin results in synaptic potentiation.</p>

<title>BBB modulation is activity-dependent</title>
<p>To test the neurotransmission pathways involved in regulation of BBB permeability during stimulation we exposed the cortical window to selective antagonists of ionotropic glutamate receptors (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>). The AMPA/kainate receptor blocker CNQX prevented the stimulation-induced BBB modulation, whereas the NMDAR blocker AP5 did not (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b-c</xref>). CNQX also reversibly blocked synaptic activity and prevented the vascular response to neuronal activation, indicated by the absence of vasodilation (AKA âneurovascular couplingâ; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e</xref>, Figure S2a, S3a,c). These results indicate that stimulation-induced BBB modulation was mediated by neuronal activation. In contrast, AP5 did not affect baseline SEP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e</xref>), nor the vascular response (Figure S2a, S3b). Synaptic potentiation was blocked under both CNQX or AP5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e, g-h</xref>, Figure S2a), consistent with the crucial role of AMPA and NMDA receptors in synaptic plasticity. Next, we tested for molecular correlates of synaptic strength by comparing postsynaptic density 95 (PSD-95) expression levels in the cortex at different time points. PSD-95 is known to increase following LTP and AMPAR trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">El-Husseini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>). Western blot analysis showed significantly higher levels of PSD-95 expression in stimulated rats as compared to sham, at both 30 min and 24 h after stimulation (Figure S2c-d).</p>

<title>Albumin extravasation and LTP require caveolae-mediated transcytosis</title>
<p>In endothelial cells, albumin is transported mainly via caveolae-mediated transcytosis (CMT) through binding to the gp60 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tiruppathi et al., 1997</xref>). To test whether CMT mediates stimulation-induced transcytosis of albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">John et al., 2003</xref>) we perfused the exposed cortex with methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (mÎ²CD), which inhibits albumin uptake by disrupting caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schnitzer and Oh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Skotland et al., 2020</xref>).

<title>BBB modulation and LTP involve TGF-Î² signaling</title>
<p>Under pathological conditions, synaptogenesis and pathological plasticity that follow BBB dysfunction are mediated by the activation of TGF-Î²R1 signaling in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>). TGF-Î²1 was also shown to directly induce BBB opening in endothelial cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McMillin et al., 2015</xref>), and to regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahlmanns et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>).

Cortical exposure to SJN prevented stimulation-induced BBB opening (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b-c</xref>) with no effect on neurovascular coupling (Figure S3e). SJN also prevented stimulation-induced LTP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f-h</xref>).

<title>Regulation of BBB transport and plasticity genes</title>
<p>To explore gene-expression changes related to our stimulation protocol, we conducted bulk RNA-sequencing transcriptome analysis of tissue dissected from the sensorimotor area of the cortex contralateral and ipsilateral to stimulated limb. Tissue harvested 1 and 24 h post-stimulation (30 min) showed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the contralateral (âstimulatedâ) compared to the ipsilateral (ânon-stimulatedâ) cortex (13.2% and 7.3% 24 and 1 h, respectively, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>, S4a). To assess the variability between paired samples of stimulated and non-stimulated cortex of each animal at two time points following stimulation (24 h vs 1 h) we used the JensenâShannon divergence metric (JSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sudmant et al., 2015</xref>). JSD calculations using normalized counts indicated that the RNA expression 24 h after stimulation was significantly different from that of rats 1 h after stimulation (Figure S4b). Gene Ontology (GO) pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs from stimulated rats indicated DEGs were primarily involved in synaptic plasticity processes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). A significantly higher number of DEGs related to synaptic plasticity was found in the contralateral cortex of stimulated rats compared to ipsilateral (p&lt;0.001, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). No significant differences were found in BBB or inflammation related genes between the hemispheres, suggesting that the stimulation protocol is not associated with the transcriptional change observed in BBB dysfunction under pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Cacheaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). In contrast, a larger amount of transporter genes such as solute carrier transporters (Slc) and ATP-binding cassette (ABCs) families were differentially expressed in the stimulated compared to the non-stimulated cortex (Figure S4c-d). Both DEG and enrichment analysis were consistent with activation of TGF-Î² signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). Analysis of vascular cell-specific DEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>) showed significantly more arterial smooth muscle cells specific genes in the stimulated cortex (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, Figure S4e).

<title>Physiological BBB modulation in the human brain</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study demonstrates that prolonged physiological stimulation modulates BBB permeability in the rat and human cortex. In rats, we show that prolonged paw stimulation results in increased cross-BBB extravasation of both low- and high-molecular weight tracers. We also show that this extravasation is: (1) focal and localized to the cortical area corresponding to the stimulation; (2) mediated by AMPA neurotransmission, TGF-Î² signaling, and caveolae transcytosis; and (3) associated with synaptic potentiation and increased postsynaptic density. In humans, we present the first evidence for increased BBB permeability in response to prolonged limb activity. Together, our results suggest that stimulation-induced BBB modulation may play a role in synaptic potentiation.</p>
<p>Physiological changes in cross-BBB transport have been previously reported in response to whisker stimulation, circadian rhythms, and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nishijima et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Pulido et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we examined whether the mechanisms involved in this process may include those identified in our studies of pathological BBB modulation. Previous studies from our group showed that brain injury is associated with albumin transcytosis, albumin binding to TGF-Î²R in astrocytes, and pathological TGF-Î²-mediated plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Salar et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that prolonged physiological sensory-motor activation is also associated with albumin extravasation (although at a significantly lower concentration than under pathological conditions, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1l</xref> and Figure S1d) and TGF-Î²R signaling. We further show that blocking caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis or TGF-Î²R signaling inhibits stimulation-evoked increase in BBB permeability and synaptic potentiation (without affecting the physiological hemodynamic response). These results suggest that caveolae albumin transcytosis and TGF-Î² signaling are key mediators of activity-dependent BBB modulation and subsequent synaptic plasticity. These findings are supported by reports linking TGF-Î² signaling to: synaptic plasticity induced by environmental enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Dahlmanns et al., 2022</xref>); enhanced spine and synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Patel and Weaver, 2021</xref>); and hippocampal neuroplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gradari et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, our finding of caveolae-mediated albumin transcytosis in pial arterioles is in line with previous studies showing: caveolae-dependent transcytosis of albumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Tecedor et al., 2013</xref>); caveolae abundance in arteriolar ECs and not capillary ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chow et al., 2020</xref>); and the contribution of caveolae transcytosis to neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andreone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chow et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, in our experiments, caveolae inhibition prevented BBB modulation yet did not significantly affect neurovascular coupling, likely due to the contribution of other vasodilatory pathways such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, albumin is a known activator of TGF-Î² signaling, and TGF-Î² has a well-established role in neuroplasticity. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that TGF-Î² also increases cross-BBB transcytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Betterton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaplan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">McMillin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Schumacher et al., 2023</xref>) Hence, we propose the following two-part hypothesis for the TGF-Î²/BBB-mediated synaptic potentiation observed in our experiments: (1) prolonged stimulation triggers TGF-Î² signaling and increased caveolae-mediated transcytosis of albumin; and (2) extravasated albumin induces further TGF-Î² signaling, leading to synaptogenesis and additional cross-BBB transport â in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. Future research is needed to examine the validity of this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Our study also shows that physiological BBB modulation requires AMPAR glutamate signaling and not NMDA. This finding is consistent with studies showing the dominant role of AMPAR in electrophysiological and hemodynamic responses to somatosensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Graves et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gsell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, the well-established role of AMPAR in neuroplasticity, long-term potentiation (LTP), and experience-dependent sensory cortical plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Daw et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Feldman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Watt et al., 2004</xref>) further supports the plasticity-related role of activity-dependent BBB modulation.</p>
<p>Our animal experiments show that a 30 min limb stimulation (at 6Hz and 2mA) increases cross-BBB influx, while a 1 min stimulation (of similar frequency and magnitude) does not. We believe that both types of stimulations fall within the physiological range because our continuous electrophysiological recordings showed no signs of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity. Moreover, the recorded SEP levels were similar to those reported in previous physiological LTP studies in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eckert and Abraham, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">MÃ©gevand et al., 2009</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">McGregor et al., 2016</xref>). Future studies are needed to explore the BBB modulating effects of additional stimulation protocols â with varying durations, frequencies, and magnitudes. Such studies may also elucidate the temporal and ultrastructural characteristics that differentiate between physiological and pathological BBB modulation.</p>
<p>In humans, skill acquisition often involves motor training sessions that last â¥30 minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bengtsson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Classen et al., 1998</xref>) and result in physiological plasticity of sensory and motor systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Classen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Draganski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sagi et al., 2012</xref>). We, therefore, believe that the experimental task of our human study (30 minutes of repetitive squeezing of an elastic stress-ball) represents physiological activity, with neuronal activation in primarily motor and sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Halder et al., 2005</xref>). We further propose that the activity-related increase in BBB permeability we observed may be associated with learning.</p>
<p>A key limitation of our animal experiments is the fact they were performed under anesthesia, due to the complex nature of the experimental setup (i.e., simultaneous cortical imaging and electrophysiological recordings). Anesthetic agents can potentially alter neuronal activity, SEPs, CBF, and vascular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aksenov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lindauer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Masamoto and Kanno, 2012</xref>). To minimize these effects, we used ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, which unlike other anesthetics, was shown to maintain robust BOLD and SEP responses to neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Franceschini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shim et al., 2018</xref>). Another limitation of our animal study is the potentially non-specific effect of mÎ²CD â an agent that disrupts caveola transport but may also lead to cholesterol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Keller and Simons, 1998</xref>). To mitigate this issue, we used a very low mÎ²CD concentration (10Î¼M), orders of magnitude below the concentration reported to deplete cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Koudinov and Koudinova, 2001</xref>). Lastly, our animal study is limited by the inclusion of solely male rats. While our findings in humans did not point to sex-related differences in stimulation-evoked BBB modulation, larger animals and human studies are needed to examine this question.</p>
<p>To conclude, our study suggests that BBB modulation in response to physiological neuronal activity involves mechanisms previously identified in pathology-induced BBB changes (despite the significantly smaller increase in cross-BBB influx under physiological conditions). Our findings further suggest that physiological modulation of cross-BBB influx may play a role in synaptic plasticity, calling for future research into the dynamics of BBB function in health and disease.</p>

<p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Ethical Committee at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.</p>
<p>Adult Sprague Dawley male rats (300-350 g; Harlan Laboratories) were kept under a 12:12 h light and dark regimen and supplied with drinking water and food ad libitum. Surgical procedures were performed as reported previously(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Prager et al., 2010</xref>). Rats were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of ketamine (100 mg/ml, 0.08 ml/100 g) and xylazine (20 mg/ml, 0.06 ml/100 g). The tail vein was cannulated, and animals were placed in a stereotactic frame under a SteREO Lumar V12 fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Body temperature was continuously monitored and kept stable at 37 Â± 0.5Â°C using a feedback-controlled heating pad (Physitemp). Heart rate, breath rate, and oxygen saturation levels were continuously monitored using MouseOx (STARR Life Sciences). A cranial section (4 mm caudal, 2 mm frontal, 5 mm lateral to bregma) was removed over the right sensorimotor cortex. The dura and arachnoid layers were removed, and the exposed cortex was continuously perfused with artificial CSF (aCSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Prager et al., 2010</xref>), containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 26 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 3 KCl, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4).</p>

<title>Stimulation protocol</title>
<p>The left forelimb or hind limb of the rat was stimulated using Isolated Stimulator device (AD Instruments) attached with two subdermal needle electrodes (0.1 ms square pulses, 2-3 mA) at 6 Hz frequency. Test stimulation consisted of 360 pulses (60 s) and delivered before (as baseline) and after long-duration stimulation (30 min, referred throughout the text as âstimulationâ). In control and albumin rats, only short-duration stimulations were performed. Under sham stimulation, electrodes were placed without delivering current.</p>

<sec id="s4c2">
<title>Analysis of electrophysiological recordings</title>
<p>Data acquisition was performed using PowerLab and LabChart (AD Instruments), for stimulation, and extracellular recordings. Signals were digitized (1 kHz) and filtered (high-pass 1 Hz, low pass 45 or 300 Hz). Analyses were performed using in house MATLAB scripts. Two measures were used to quantify synaptic plasticity: the maximal amplitude of the dominant negative peak and the absolute area under curve (AUC) of the SEP waveform (i.e., all positive and negative peaks between 10â160 ms post-stimulus period). For power analysis in albumin experiments, 10 min segments recorded before starting and after terminating albumin perfusion were used.</p>

<p>In some experiments the following blockers were added to the aCSF and continuously perfused to the cortical window for 50 min: D-(-)-2-Amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5, 50 Î¼M), 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX, 50 Î¼M), methyl-Î²-cyclodextrin (MÎ²CD, 10 Î¼M), or SJN2511 (SJN, 0.3 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Weissberg et al., 2015</xref>)). To simulate BBB opening, bovine serum albumin (Alb, 0.1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Seiffert et al., 2004</xref>)) was added to the aCSF and continuously perfused to the cortical window for 30 min.</p>

<title>In-vivo imaging</title>
<p>Dynamic imaging of regional cerebral blood flow, optical imaging of cortical oxygenation, neurovascular coupling (NVC), and vessel diameter measurements were carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bouchard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Levi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Prager et al., 2010</xref>).

Images were analyzed offline using in-house MATLAB (MathWorks) scripts.</p>
<p>Fluorescent angiography and BBB permeability measurements and analyses were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Prager et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>). The non-BBB permeable fluorescent dye sodium fluorescein (NaFlu) was injected intravenously (0.2 ml, 1 mg/ml). Images of cortical surface vessels were obtained before, during, and after tracer injection at 5 frames per second. Across all experiments, acquired images were the same size (512 Ã 512 pixel, â¼1Ã1 mm), centered above the responding arteriole. Images were analyzed offline using MATLAB as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Vazana et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, image registration and segmentation were performed to produce a binary image, separating blood vessels from extravascular regions. For each extravascular pixel, a time curve of signal intensity over time was constructed. To determine whether an extravascular pixel had tracer accumulation over time (due to BBB permeability), the pixelâs intensity curve was divided by that of the responding artery (i.e., the arterial input function, AIF, representing tracer input). This ratio was termed the BBB permeability index (PI), and extravascular pixels with PI &gt; 1 were identified as pixels with tracer accumulation due to BBB permeability.</p>

<p>To assess the degree of albumin extravasation following stimulation, forty adult Sprague Dawley male rats (200-300g) were randomly divided into five groups. Rats were anesthetized (ketamine (75 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg)) and underwent either a 30 min stimulation, sham stimulation (electrodes placed without current delivery), or photothrombosis stroke (PT) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lippmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schoknecht et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, Rose Bengal was administered intravenously (20 mg/kg) and a halogen light beam was directed for 15 min onto the intact exposed skull over the right somatosensory cortex. Then, rats were deeply anaesthetized and transcardially perfused with cold PBS, and brains were extracted at three time points following stimulation (immediately (real and sham), 4 and 24 h post stimulation) and 24 h post stroke. The ipsi- and contra lateral somatosensory cortices were dissected, weighed, and snap-frozen on dry ice. Fresh frozen samples were then homogenized in PBS + 1% Triton X-100 (v/v). Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 13000 g for 10 min and supernatants were stored at -80Â°C until further analysis. Albumin levels were determined in diluted samples, using the Rat Albumin ELISA kit (Bethyl Laboratories, TX, USA) according to the manufacturerâs instructions.</p>

<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Brain tissues were collected from stimulated and control rats as described above. Protein lysates were separated using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSâPAGE, Bio-Rad) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were washed with TBS + 0.1% Tween20 (TBST, 3 Ã 5 min), then blocked with 5% BSA in TBS for 1 h. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4Â°C with primary antibodies, followed by 2 h incubation with secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescent HRP substrate Crescendo Immobilon (Millipore). Analysis was performed in ImageJ, and band density levels were expressed as fold-changes to controls after normalization to Î²-actin and controls within the same blot. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-PSD-95 (1:1500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA1-045), anti-Î²-actin (Loading control, 1:2000, Abcam, ab8226). Secondary antibodies were Goat anti-mouse (1:4000, Abcam, ab205719) and Goat anti-rabbit (1:4000, Abcam, ab97051).</p>

<title>RNA Extraction &amp; Purification</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from 100-150 mg of flash-frozen rat somatosensory cortex tissue using TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific #15596026) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rio et al., 2010</xref>). Glycoblue (Invitrogen #AM9515) was added to assist with RNA pellet isolation. Pellets were washed with 75% ethanol and allowed to dry before being dissolved in 20 Î¼L of RNase-DNase free water. 2 Î¼L of 10x DNase I Buffer (New England Biolabs, #m0303s), 1 Î¼L of rDNase I (ThermoFisher Scientific, AM2235), and DNase Inactivation Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific, AM1907) were added to each RNA sample for purification.</p>

<title>RNA Sequencing &amp; Bioinformatics</title>
<p>Library preparation was performed by the QB3-Berkeley Functional Genomics Laboratory at UC Berkeley. mRNA selection was done with the oligo-dT beads. Both total RNA and oligo dT bead selected mRNA quality was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were prepared using the KAPA RNA Hyper Prep kit (Roche KK8540). Truncated universal stub adapters were ligated to cDNA fragments, which were then extended via PCR using unique dual indexing primers into full length Illumina adapters. Library quality was checked on an AATI (now Agilent) Fragment Analyzer. Libraries were then transferred to the QB3-Berkeley Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory, also at UC Berkeley. Library molarity was measured via quantitative PCR with the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche KK4824) on a BioRad CFX Connect thermal cycler. Libraries were then pooled by molarity and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell for 2 Ã 150 cycles, targeting at least 25M reads per sample. Fastq files were generated and demultiplexed using Illumina bcl2fastq2 v2.20. No other processing, trimming, or filtering was conducted. RNA-seq reads were aligned using STAR v2.9.1a against UCSC rat genome rn6. Downstream analysis was performed using FastQC v0.11.9, MultiQC v1.11, and featureCounts. R studio was used for data analysis, R v4.0.2. with the packages tidyverse v1.3.1, IHW, DESeq2. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of enriched genes in ipsi- and contra-lateral somatosensory cortices of stimulated rats was performed using Metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metascape.org/">http://metascape.org/</ext-link>).

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Male and female healthy individuals, aged 18-35, with no known neurological or psychiatric disorders were recruited to undergo MRI scanning while performing a motor task (n=6; 3 males and 3 females). MRI scans of 10 sex- and age-matched individuals (with no known neurological or psychiatric disorders) who did not perform the task were used as control data (n=10; 5 males and 5 females).</p>
<p>All procedures were approved by the Soroka University Medical Center Institutional Review Board. All participants gave their written informed consent before participation.</p>

<title>Data acquisition</title>
<p>MRI scans were performed in the imaging center at the Soroka Medical Center using a 3T Philips Ingenia MRI scanner. A high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical scan (3D gradient echo, TE/TR 3.7/8.2 ms, voxel size of 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, 256 Ã 256 acquisition matrix), followed by a T2-weighted scan (TE/TR = 90/3000 ms, voxel size 0.45 Ã 0.45 Ã 4 mm). Functional data were collected by using a gradient echo EPI, with voxel size of 3 Ã 3 Ã 3 mm, TE/TR = 35/2000 ms, 83 Ã 80 acquisition matrix, flip angle of 90Â°, and FOV 109 mm. For calculation of pre-contrast longitudinal relaxation times, variable flip angle method was used (3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR = 2/10 ms, acquisition matrix: 256 Ã 256, voxel size: 0.89 Ã 0.89 Ã 6 mm, flip angles: 5, 15, 20 and 25Â°). Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequence was then acquired (Axial, 3D T1w-FFE, TE/TR = 2/4 ms, acquisition matrix: 192 Ã 187 (reconstructed to 256 Ã 256), voxel size: 0.9 Ã 0.9 Ã 6 mm, flip angle: 20Â°, Ã½t = 10 s, temporal repetitions: 100, total scan length: 16.7 min). An intravenous bolus injection (0.1 mmol/kg, 0.5 M) of the gadolinium-based contrast agent gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem, Guerbet, France) was administered using an automatic injector after 5 dynamic scans at a rate of 1.5 ml/s.</p>

<title>Preprocessing of functional data</title>
<p>fMRI data preprocessing was performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM12; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, London, UK) for MATLAB. The first ten functional images of each run series were discarded to allow stabilization of the magnet. Functional images were realigned and co-registered to the T1-weighted structural image, followed by segmentation and normalization to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Spatial smoothing using Gaussian kernel (FWHM of 6 mm) was performed.</p>

<title>fMRI Localizer Motor Task</title>
<p>fMRI was used to localize the brain area activated in response to the experimental motor task. During the fMRI scan, participants were asked to squeeze the stress-ball on cue (with green screen indicating Go and red screen indicating Stop) for a total of 5 experimental blocks. Task-related activation was evaluated for each cue, and voxels with statistically significant activation (t-statistic) were used to construct an âactivation mapâ. The statistical threshold for clusters was set at p&lt;0.05 and corrected for multiple comparisons using family-wise error (FWE) over the whole brain (uncorrected threshold p&lt;0.001) to minimize detection of false positives (type I error).</p>

<title>BBB permeability quantification</title>
<p>Analysis was performed as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Serlin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Veksler et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, preprocessing included image registration and normalization to MNI space using SPM12. BBB permeability was calculated using in-house MATLAB script. A linear fit was applied to the later stage of the scan and the slope of contrast agent concentration changes over time was calculated for each voxel. Positive slopes reflected contrast agent accumulation due to BBB modulation. To compensate for physiological (e.g., heart rate, blood flow) and technical (e.g., injection rate) variability, slopes were normalized to the slope of each subjectâs transverse sinus. Values were considered to reflect modulated BBB when exceeding the 95th percentile of the corresponding mean cumulative distribution function from healthy young controls. Voxels that reflect modulated BBB values were color-coded and superimposed on the anatomical scans to illustrate the kinetics, localization, and extent of BBB pathology.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>All statistical tests were performed using Prism9 (GraphPad Software) and are indicated in the figure legends. Tests were two-tailed and corrected for multiple comparisons with two-stage linear step-up false discovery rate (FDR) procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli whenever applicable. Paired tests were used for inter-hemispheric comparisons. Non-parametric tests were used for data which was not normally distributed. Differences in fluorescence in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1j-k</xref> were tested using a nested t-test. Differences in BBB permeability index, area under the curve and maximum amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential before and after stimulation, were tested using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test. Differences between groups in ELISA, area under the curve and maximum amplitude of the SEP were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test with FDR correction. Differences in the amount of DEGs in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4c-d</xref>, S4c-e were analyzed using chi-square contingency test. Differences in BBB permeability across regions in the human brain were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with FDR correction. Pâ¤ 0.05 was defined as the statistical significance level.</p>

<p>This study used prolonged stimulation of a limb to examine possible plasticity in somatosensory evoked potentials and the role of the blood brain barrier (BBB). The significance is <bold>important</bold> because thus far BBB modulation of plasticity is mostly in the context of pathology.

<p>The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effect of neuronal activity on blood-brain barrier permeability in the healthy brain, and to determine whether changes in BBB dynamics play a role in cortical plasticity. The authors used a variety of well-validated approaches to first demonstrate that limb stimulation increases BBB permeability. Using in vivo-electrophysiology and pharmacological approaches, the authors demonstrate that albumin is sufficient to induce cortical potentiation and that BBB transporters are necessary for stimulus-induced potentiation. The authors include a transcriptional analysis and differential expression of genes associated with plasticity, TGF-beta signaling, and extracellular matrix were observed following stimulation. Overall, the results obtained in rodents are compelling and support the authors' conclusions that neuronal activity modulates the BBB in the healthy brain and that mechanisms downstream of BBB permeability changes play a role in stimulus-evoked plasticity. These findings were further supported with fMRI and BBB permeability measurements performed in healthy human subjects performing a simple sensorimotor task. There is literature to suggest that there are sex differences in BBB dysfunction in pathophysiological conditions and the authors have acknowledged the use of only males as a minor limitation of the study that should be addressed in the future. Future studies should also test whether the upregulation of OAT3 plays a role in cortical plasticity observed following stimulation. Overall, this study provides novel insights into how neurovascular coupling, BBB permeability, and plasticity interact in the healthy brain.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This study builds upon previous work that demonstrated that brain injury results in leakage of albumin across the blood brain barrier, resulting in activation of TGF-beta in astrocytes. Consequently, this leads to decreased glutamate uptake, reduced buffering of extracellular potassium and hyperexcitability. This study asks whether such a process can play a physiological role in cortical plasticity. They first show that stimulation of a forelimb for 30 minutes in a rat results in leakage of the blood brain barrier and extravasation of albumin on the contralateral but not ipsilateral cortex. The authors propose that the leakage is dependent upon neuronal excitability and is associated with an enhancement of excitatory transmission. Inhibiting the transport of albumin or the activation of TGF-beta prevents the enhancement of excitatory transmission. In addition, gene expression associated with TGF-beta activation, synaptic plasticity and extracellular matrix are enhanced on the &quot;stimulated&quot; hemisphere. That this may translate to humans is demonstrated by a break down in the blood brain barrier following activation of brain areas through a motor task.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This study is novel and the results are potentially important as they demonstrate an unexpected break down of the blood brain barrier with physiological activity and this may serve a physiological purpose, affecting synaptic plasticity.</p>
<p>The strengths of the study are:</p>
<p>1. The use of an in vivo model with multiple methods to investigate the blood brain barrier response to a forelimb stimulation.</p>
<p>2. The determination of a potential functional role for the observed leakage of the blood brain barrier from both a genetic and electrophysiological view point</p>
<p>3. The demonstration that inhibiting different points in the putative pathway from activation of the cortex to transport of albumin and activation of the TGF-beta pathway, the effect on synaptic enhancement could be prevented.</p>
<p>4. Preliminary experiments demonstrating a similar observation of activity dependent break down of the blood brain barrier in humans.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The authors adequately addressed most of my points. A few remain:</p>
<p>1. Although the reviewers have addressed the possible effects of anaesthesia on neuro-vascular coupling. They have not mentioned or addressed the possible effects of ketamine (an NMDA receptor antagonist) on synaptic plasticity. Indeed, the low percentage of SEP increase following potentiation (10-20%) could perhaps be explained by partial block of NMDA receptors by ketamine.</p>
<p>2. The experimental paradigms remain unclear to me. Now, it appears that drugs are applied for 50 minutes and that the stimulation occurs during the &quot;washout period&quot;. The more conventional approach would be to have the drug application during the stimulation period to determine if the drugs occlude or enhance the effects of stimulation and then washout the drugs. The problem is that drugs variably washout at different rates depending upon their lipid solubility.</p>
<p>3. It is still not clear to what extent the experimenters and those doing the analysis were blinded to group. If one or both were blind to group, then please put this in the methods.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study used prolonged stimulation of a limb to examine possible plasticity in somatosensory evoked potentials induced by the stimulation. They also studied the extent that the blood brain barrier (BBB) was opened by the prolonged stimulation and whether that played a role in the plasticity. They found that there was potentiation of the amplitude and area under the curve of the evoked potential after prolonged stimulation and this was long-lasting (&gt;5 hrs). They also implicated extravasation of serum albumin, caveolae-mediated transcytosis, and TGFb signalling, as well as neuronal activity and upregulation of PSD95. Transcriptomics was done and implicated plasticity related genes in the changes after prolonged stimulation, but not proteins associated with the BBB or inflammation. Next, they address the application to humans using a squeeze ball task. They imaged the brain and suggest that the hand activity led to an increased permeability of the vessels, suggesting modulation of the BBB.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of the paper are the novelty of the idea that stimulation of the limb can induce cortical plasticity in a normal condition, and it involves opening of the BBB with albumin entry. In addition, there are many datasets and both rat and human data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The conclusions are not compelling however because of a lack of explanation of methods. The explanation of why prolonged stimulation in the rat was considered relevant to normal conditions should be as clear in the paper as it is in the rebuttal. The authors need to ensure other aspects of the rebuttal are as clear in the paper as in the rebuttal too. The only remaining concern that is significant is that it is hard to understand the figures.</p>

<p>We agree with the reviewer regarding the importance of examining sex differences on stimulation-evoked BBB changes. To address this issue we have: (1) clarified in the methods section that the human study involved both males and females; (2) added a section to the discussion highlighting the male bias as a key limitation of our animal experiments; and (3) stated that future work should examine whether stimulation-evoked BBB changes differ between makes and females.</p>

To minimize these effects, we used ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, which unlike other anesthetics, was shown to generate robust BOLD and SEP responses to neuronal activation (Franceschini et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2018).â</p>

<p>There are both conceptual and experimental weaknesses.</p>
<p>1. The stimulation is in an animal anesthetized with ketamine, which can affect critical receptors (ie NMDA receptors) in synaptic plasticity.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the potential effects of anesthesia should be considered. The Discussion was revised to address this point: âA key limitation of our animal experiments is the fact they were performed under anesthesia, due to the complex nature of the experimental setup (i.e., simultaneous cortical imaging and electrophysiological recordings). Anesthetic agents can affect various receptors within the NVU, potentially altering neuronal activity, SEPs, CBF, and vascular responses (Aksenov et al., 2015; Lindauer et al., 1993; Masamoto &amp; Kanno, 2012).

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The stimulation protocol is prolonged and it would be helpful to know if briefer stimulations have the same effect or if longer stimulations have a greater effect ie does the leakage give a &quot;readout&quot; of the stimulation intensity/length.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this important comment. We are also very curious about the potential relationship between stimulation magnitude/duration and subsequent leakage and have added the following statement to the discussion:</p>
<p>âFuture studies should also explore the effects of stimulation magnitude/duration on BBB modulation, as well as the stimulation threshold between physiological and pathological increase in BBB permeability.â</p>
<p>Our current findings indicate that a one-minute stimulation does not affect vascular permeability or SEP and we aim to test additional stimulation paradigms in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. For some of the experiments (see below), the numbers of animals are low and the statistical tests used may not be the most appropriate, making the results less clear cut.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment and have revised the statistical analysis of Figure 1J,K. We now use a nested t-test to test for differences between rats (as opposed to sections). The differences remain significant (EB, p=0.0296; Alexa, p=0.0229). The text was modified accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The experimental paradigms are not entirely clear, especially the length of time of drug application and the authors seem to try to detect enhancement of a blocked SEP.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out. Figures 2&amp;3 were revised for clarification and a âDrug Applicationâ subsection was added to the methods section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. It is not clear how long the enhancement lasts. There is a remark that it lasts longer than 5 hours but there is no presentation of data to support this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this comment. As the length of experiments differed between animals, the exact length could not be specifically stated. To clarify this point, we revised the text to indicate that LTP was recorded until the end of each experiment (between 1.5-5 hours, depending on the condition the animal was in). We also added a panel to figure 2 (Figure 2d) with exemplary data showing potentiation 60, 90, and 120 min post stimulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The spatial and temporal specificity of this effect is unclear (other than hemispheric in rats) and even less clear in humans.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our animal experiments (using both in vivo imaging and histological analysis) showed no evidence of BBB modulation outside the cortical somatosensory area corresponding to the limbs. We looked at the entirety of the coronal section of the brain and found enhancement solely in the somatosensory area corresponding to limb. The right side of panels h and i in Figure 1 show an x20 magnification of the section, focusing on the enhanced area. The whole section was not shown, as no fluorescence was found outside the magnified area. Moreover, our quantification showed that the enhancement was specific to the contralateral and not ipsilateral somatosensory cortex (Figure 1 j-k).</p>
<p>We agree that temporal specificity needs to be further explored, and we have now stated that in the discussion: âFuture studies are needed to explore the BBB modulating effects of additional stimulation protocols â with varying durations, frequencies, and magnitudes. Such studies may also elucidate the temporal and ultrastructural characteristics that may differentiate between physiological and pathological BBB modulation.â</p>
<p>We also agree that larger studies are needed to better understand the specificity of the observed effect in humans, and to account for potential inter-human variability in vascular integrity and brain function due to different schedules, diets, exercise habits, etc.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The experimenters rightly use separate controls for most of the experiments but this is not always the case, also raising the possibility that the application of drugs was not done randomly or interleaved, but possibly performed in blocks of animals, which can also affect results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this lack of clarity. We have now highlighted that drug application was done randomly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin clears cholesterol so the effect on albumin transport is not specific, it could be mediating its effect through some other pathway.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that the effect of mÎ²CD may not be specific. To mitigate this issue, we used a very low mÎ²CD concentration (10uM). Notably, this is markedly lower than the concentrations reported by Koudinov et al, showing that cholesterol depletion is observed at 5mM mÎ²CD and not at 2.5mM/5mM (Koudinov &amp; Koudinova, 2001). This point was added to the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Since the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier can be inhibited by a TGF-beta inhibitor, then this implies that TGFbeta is necessary for the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier. This does not sit well with the hypothesis that TGF-beta activation depends upon blood-brain barrier leakage.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this lack of clarity. We have added a discussion paragraph that clarifies our hypothesis: âAs mentioned above, albumin is a known activator of TGF-Î² signaling, and TGF-Î² has a well-established role in neuroplasticity. Interestingly, emerging evidence suggests that TGF-Î² also increases cross-BBB transcytosis (Betterton et al., 2022; Kaplan et al., 2020; McMillin et al., 2015; Schumacher et al., 2023). Hence, we propose the following two-part hypothesis for the TGF-Î²/BBB-mediated synaptic potentiation observed in our experiments: (1) prolonged stimulation triggers TGF-Î² signaling and increased caveolae-mediated transcytosis of albumin; and (2) extravasated albumin induces further TGF-Î² signaling, leading to synaptogenesis and additional cross-BBB transport â in a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. Future research is needed to examine the validity of this hypothesis.</p>

<p>The conclusions are not compelling however because of a lack of explanation of methods and quantification. It also is not clear whether the prolonged stimulation in the rat was normal conditions. To their credit, the authors recorded the neuronal activity during stimulation, but it seemed excessive excitation. Since seizures open the BBB this result calls into question one of the conclusions. that the results reflect a normal brain. The authors could either conduct studies with stimulation that is more physiological or discuss the caveats of using a supraphysiological stimulus to infer healthy brain function.</p>

<p>We believe that the used stimulation protocol is within the physiological range (and relevant to plasticity, learning and memory) for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. In our continuous electrophysiological recordings, we did not observe any form of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity.</p>

<p>The discussion would benefit from additional discussion of the potential impacts of sex and anesthesia in their findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer and have added the following paragraph to the discussion:</p>
<p>âA key limitation of our animal experiments is the fact they were performed under anesthesia, due to the complex nature of the experimental setup (i.e., simultaneous cortical imaging and electrophysiological recordings). Anesthetic agents can potentially alter neuronal activity, SEPs, CBF, and vascular responses (Aksenov et al., 2015; Lindauer et al., 1993; Masamoto &amp; Kanno, 2012). To minimize these effects, we used ketaminexylazine anesthesia, which unlike other anesthetics, was shown to maintain robust BOLD and SEP responses to neuronal activation (Franceschini et al., 2010; Shim et al., 2018). Another limitation of our animal study is the potentially non-specific effect of mÎ²CD â an agent that disrupts caveola transport but may also lead to cholesterol depletion (Keller &amp; Simons, 1998). To mitigate this issue, we used a very low mÎ²CD concentration (10uM), orders of magnitude below the concentration reported to deplete cholesterol (Koudinov et al). Lastly, our animal study is limited by the inclusion of solely male rats. While our findings in humans did not point to sex-related differences in stimulation-evoked BBB modulation, larger animals and human studies are needed to examine this question.â</p>

<p>1. In Figure 2, there is a notable lack of controls eg the effect of sham stimulation and application of saline. These are important as the drift of response magnitude can be a problem in long experiments.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We did test for the potential presence of response drift, by examining whether SEPs of non-stimulated animals change over time (at baseline, 30 or 60 minutes of recording; n=6). No statistical differences were found. Our analysis focused on using each animal as its own control (i.e., comparing baseline SEP to SEP post albumin perfusion), because SEP studies highlight the importance of comparing each animal to its own baseline, due to the large inter-animal variability (All et al., 2010; MÃ©gevand et al., 2009; Zandieh et al., 2003).</p>

<p>1. In LTP-type experiments usually the antagonist is applied during the stimulation and then washed out. This avoids the problem in this figure in which CNQX effectively blocks transmission and so it is not possible to detect any enhancement if it were there. Eg in panel e, CNQX block transmission, and then the assessment is performed when the AMPA receptors are blocked after 30 minutes of stimulation. If receptors are blocked no enhancement will be detectable. Moreover, surely the question is the ratio of the effect of 30-minute stimulation on the SEP in the presence of CNQX and so the statistics should be done on the fold change in the SEP following 30-minute stimulation in the presence of CNQX.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. The protocol might have been misrepresented in the original figure. We modified Fig 3a to clarify that the antagonists were indeed washed out upon stimulation start to make sure the receptors are not blocked during the test stimulation following the 30 min stimulation. In addition, we tested for the difference in fold change between 30 min stim, and 30 min stimulation following antagonists wash-in (Fig 3f and Fig S2a).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Interesting in Figure f, stimulation, albumin, and AP5 all seem to have the same enhancement of the SEP. Is the lack of effect of 30-minute stimulation in the presence of AP5, a ceiling effect ie AP5 has enhanced the SEP, and no further enhancement from stimulation is possible.</p>

<p>The conclusions are not compelling however because of a lack of explanation of methods and quantification. It also is not clear whether the prolonged stimulation in the rat was normal conditions. To their credit, the authors recorded the neuronal activity during stimulation, but it seemed excessive excitation. Since seizures open the BBB this result calls into question one of the conclusions. that the results reflect a normal brain. The authors could either conduct studies with stimulation that is more physiological or discuss the caveats of using a supraphysiological stimulus to infer healthy brain function.</p>

<p>Histology that was performed to confirm extravasation needs clarification because if tissue was removed from the brain, and fixed in order to do histology, what is outside the vessels would seem likely to wash away.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the need to clarify this point. The Histology description in the Methods section was revised in the following manner:</p>
<p>âAlbumin extravasacon was confirmed histologically in separate cohorts of rats that were anesthetized and stimulated without craniotomy surgery. Assessment of albumin extravasacon was performed using a well-established approach that involves peripheral injection of either labeled-albumin (bovine serum albumin conjugated to Alexa Flour 488, Alexa488-Alb) or albumin-labeling dye (Evans blue, EB â a dye that binds to endogenous albumin and forms a fluorescent complex), followed by histological analysis of brain tissue (Ahishali &amp; Kaya, 2020; Ivens et al., 2007; Lapilover et al., 2012; Obermeier et al., 2013; Veksler et al., 2020). Since extravasated albumin is taken up by astrocytes (Ivens et al., 2007; Obermeier et al., 2013), it can be visualized in the brain neuropil after brain removal and fixation (Ahishali &amp; Kaya, 2020; Ivens et al., 2007; Lapilover et al., 2012; Veksler et al., 2020). Five rats were injected with Alexa488-Alb (1.7 mg/ml) and five with EB (2%, 20 mg/ml, n=5). The injections were administered via the tail vein. Following injection, rats were transcardially perfused withâ¦â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear why there was extravasacon contralateral but not ipsilateral if there are cortical-cortical connections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Interpersonally, we also did not observe ipsilateral SEP in response to limb stimulation, with evidence of SEP and  BBB permeability only in the contralateral sensorimotor region. This finding is consistent with electrophysiological and fMRI studies showing that peripheral stimulation results in predominantly contralateral potentials (Allison et al., 2000; Goff et al., 1962).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>After injection of Evans blue or Alexa-Alb, how was it shown that there was extravasacon?</p>

<p>Extravasalon in cortical sections was visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Figure 1 h-i).

Here is the relevant methods excerpt:</p>
<p>âCoronal sections (40-Î¼m thick) were obtained using a freezing microtome (Leica Biosystems) and imaged for dye extravasacon using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop 2; Zeiss) equipped with a CCD digital camera (AxioCam MRc 5; Zeiss).â</p>

<p>We have now revised the Methods section to provide a clearer description of the permeability index calculation and the choice of the imaging area:</p>
<p>âAcross all experiments, acquired images were the same size (512 Ã 512 pixel, ~1x1 mm), centered above the responding arteriole. Images were analyzed offline using MATLAB as described (Vazana et al., 2016). Briefly, image registration and segmentation were performed to produce a binary image, separating blood vessels from extravascular regions. For each extravascular pixel, a time curve of signal intensity over time was constructed. To determine whether an extravascular pixel had tracer accumulation over time (due to BBB permeability), the pixelâs intensity curve was divided by that of the responding artery (i.e., the arterial input function, AIF, representing tracer input). This ratio was termed the BBB permeability index (PI), and extravascular pixels with PI &gt; 1 were identified as pixels with tracer accumulation due to BBB permeability.â</p>

<p>To induce potentiation, 6 Hz 2 mA stimuli were used for 30 min. Please justify this as physiological.</p>

<p>Thank you for the comment. We believe that the used stimulation protocol is within the physiological range (and relevant to plasticity, learning and memory) for the following reasons:</p>
<p>1. In our continuous electrophysiological recordings, we did not observe any form of epileptiform or otherwise pathological activity.</p>
<p>2. Memory/training/skill acquisition experiments in humans often involve similar training duration or longer (Bengtsson et al., 2005), e.g., a 30 min thumb training session performed by (Classen et al., 1998).</p>

<p>The test stimulus to evoke somatosensory evoked potentials was 1 min. Was this 6 Hz 2 mA for 1 min? Please justify.</p>

<p>Yes. We chose these parameters as these ranges were shown to induce the largest changes in blood flow (with laserdoppler flowmetry) and summated SEP (Ngai et al., 1999), corresponding with our findings. We also show that these stimulation parameters do not induce changes in BBB permeability nor synaptic potentiation, therefore served as test control.</p>

<p>The location of the cranial window over the somatosensory cortex was the same in all rats. The location of the specific responding arteriole may change between animals, but the recording electrode was places around the responding arteriole in the same approaching angle and depth for all animals.</p>
<p>As the length of experiments differed between animals, the exact length could not be specifically stated. We therefore revised the text to clarify that LTP was recorded until the end of each experiment (depending on the animal condition, between 1.5-5 hours) and added a panel to figure 2 (Figure 2f) with exemplary data showing potentiation 120 min (2hr) post stimulation.</p>

<p>1. The low diffusion rate of albumin (Tao &amp; Nicholson, 1996).</p>

For quantification we always measured arterioles within the same diameter range.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>e. Sometimes CNQX did not block the response after 30 min stimulation. Why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>CNQX is washed out before the 30 min stimulation starts, so it is not expected to block the response to stimulation. However, in some cases the response to stimulation was lower in amplitude, likely due to residual CNQX that did not wash out completely.</p>

<p>Regarding DEGs, on the top of p 10 what are the percentages of?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In this analysis we tested in each hemisphere how many genes expressed differentially between 1 and 24 hours post stimulation (either up- or down- regulated). The results were presented as the percentages of differentially expressed genes in each hemisphere (13.2% contralateral, and 7.3% ipsilateral). The text was rephrased for clarity.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please add a ref for the use of the JSD metric methods and support for its use as the appropriate method. Other methods need explanation/references.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>References were added to the text to clarify. The Jensen-Shannon Divergence metric is commonly used to calculate the statistical pairwise distance among two distributions (Sudmant et al., 2015). From comparing a few different distance metric calculations including JSD, our results were similar irrespective of the distance metric applied. Therefore, we demonstrate the variability between paired samples of stimulated and non-stimulated cortex of each animal at two time points following stimulation (24 h vs. 1 h) using JSD.</p>

<p>What synaptic plasticity genes were selected for assay and what were not?</p>
<p>What does &quot;largely unaffected&quot; mean? Some of the genes may change a small amount but have big functional effects.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The selected genes of interest were taken from a large list compiled from previous publications (see (Cacheaux et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2017)) and are well documented in gene ontology databases and tools (e.g., Metascape, (Zhou et al., 2019)).</p>
<p>We agree that the term âlargely unaffectedâ is suboptimal, and we rephrased this section of the results to indicate that âNo significant differences were found in BBB or inflammation related genes between the hemispheresâ.  We also agree that a small number of genes can have big functional effects. Future studies are needed to better understand the genes underlying the observed BBB modulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Please note that Slc and ABCs are not only involved in the BBB.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you. We modified the text to no longer specify that these are BBB-specific transporters.</p>

<p>Please explain the choice of the stress ball squeeze task, and DCE.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>DCE is a well-established method for BBB imaging in living humans, and it is cited throughout the manuscript. The ball squeeze task was chosen as it is presumed to involve primarily sensory motor areas, without high-level processing (Halder et al., 2005). This is now stated in the discussion.</p>

<p>Gd-DOTA is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (gadoterate meglumine, AKA Dotarem). Text was revised for clarity. Please see the Methods section under âMagnetic Resonance Imagingâ - âData Acquisitionâ.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What does a higher percentage of activated regions mean- how was activacon defined and how were regions counted?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Higher percentage of activated regions refers to regions in which voxels showed significant BOLD changes due to the motor task preformed. The statistical approaches and analyses are detailed in the Methods section under âMagnetic Resonance Imaging - Preprocessing of functional data, and fMRI Localizer Motor Taskâ.</p>

<p>In the revised paper we added a grey shade over the stimulation period to better visualize the difference to baseline. In this panel we wanted to show that NMDA receptor antagonist did not block the SEP, while AMPA receptor antagonist did.</p>

<p>c. In the blot there are two bands for PSD95- which is the one that is PSD95? There is no increase in PSD95 uncl 24 hrs but in the graph in d there is. In the blot, there is a strong expression of PSD95 ipsilateral compared to contralateral in the sham-why?</p>
<p>What is the percent change fold?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The PSD-95 is the top and larger band. The lower band was disregarded in the analysis.
The example we show may not fully reflect the group statistics presented in panel d. Upon quantification of 8 animals, PSD-95 is significantly higher 30 min and 24 hours post stimulation in the contralateral hemisphere. No significant changes were found in sham animals.
The % change fold refers to the AUC change compared to baseline. This panel was now incorporated in Figure 3 (panel h), and the title was corrected to â|AUC|, % change from baselineâ.</p>

<p>Supplemental Fig. 4.</p>
<p>a. If ipsilateral and contralateral showed many changes why do the authors think the effects were only contralateral?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our gene analysis was designed to complement our in vivo and histological findings, by assessing the magnitude of change in differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This analysis showed that: (1) the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulus has significantly more DEGs than the ipsilateral hemisphere; and (2) the DEGs were related to synaptic plasticity and TGF-b signaling. These findings strengthen the hypothesis raised by our in vivo and histological experiments.</p>
