<title>Summary</title>
<p>A potent class of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) targets the envelope glycoprotein’s membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) through a proposed mechanism where hypervariable loops embed into lipid bilayers and engage headgroup moieties alongside the epitope. We address the feasibility and determinant molecular features of this mechanism using multi-scale modeling. All-atom simulations of 4E10, PGZL1, 10E8 and LN01 docked onto HIV-like membranes consistently form phospholipid complexes at key complementarity-determining region loop sites, solidifying that stable and specific lipid interactions anchor bnAbs to membrane surfaces. Ancillary protein-lipid contacts reveal surprising contributions from antibody framework regions. Coarse-grained simulations effectively capture antibodies embedding into membranes. Simulations estimating protein-membrane interaction strength for PGZL1 variants along an inferred maturation pathway show bilayer affinity is evolved and correlates with neutralization potency. The modeling demonstrated here uncovers insights into lipid participation in antibodies’ recognition of membrane proteins and highlights antibody features to prioritize in vaccine design.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>Considering reviewer suggestions, we slightly reorganized the results section into specific sub-sections with headings and changed the order in which key results were presented to allow the subsequent analysis more accessible for readers. Supplemental materials were redistributed into eLife format, having each supplemental item grouped to a corresponding main figure. Many slightly detail modifications were made to figures (mostly supplemental items) without changing their character, such as clearer axes labels or revised annotations within panels.
The major additions within the results sections based on the reviews were:
(1)An expanded the comparison between our simulation analyses to previous simulations and to existing cryo-EM structural evidence for MPER antibodies' membrane orientation the context of full-length antigen, resulting in new supplemental figure panels.
(2)New atomistic simulations of 10E8, PGZL1, and 4E10 evaluating the phospholipid binding predictions in a different lipid composition more closely modeling HIV membranes.
Minor edits to the analyses and interpretations include:
(1)Outlining the geometric components contributing to variance in substates after clustering the atomistic 10E8, 4E10, and PGZL1 simulations.
(2)Better defining the variance and durability of membrane interactions within and across systems in the coarse grain methods section.
(3)Removed interpretations in the original results sections regarding polyreactivity and energetics for MPER bnAbs that were not explicitly supported by data.
(4)More context of the prevenance of bnAb loop geometries in structural informatics section
(5)Rationale for the choice of the continuous helix MPER-TM conformation in LN01-antigen conformations, and citations to previous gp41 TM simulations.
(6)Removed language on the novelty of the coarse grain and steered pulling simulations as newly developed approaches; tempering the potential discriminating power and applications of those approaches, in light of their limitations.
The discussion was revised to provide more novel context of the results within the field, including discussing direct relevance of the simulation methods for evaluating immune tolerance mechanisms and into antibody engineering.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antibodies can target integral membrane proteins very near to the lipid bilayer surface, including at epitopes partially embedded within the headgroup region. During antigen engagement, antibodies complementarity-determining regions (CDR) may need to navigate lipid molecules to gain access to a concealed or dynamically buried site. Evolving tolerance or even affinity to lipid bilayers could be beneficial in recognition of membrane-proximal epitopes, potentially forming simultaneous cooperative interactions with antigen and membrane yielding additional avidity and specificity. Conversely, propensity to bind lipids or cell membranes poses a significant auto-immunity risk. B-cells producing antibodies targeting host membranes are downregulated in healthy organisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, rare antibodies with lipid affinity can emerge, particularly in cases of chronic inflammation and infection as in HIV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Maturation pathways of these rare events remain unclear, but must strike a careful balance of polyreactivity to avoid or overcome autoreactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. A better understanding of how antibodies develop membrane affinity and target membrane-proximal epitopes would be impactful for antibody therapeutics, auto-immunity, and vaccine development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We sought to address this phenomenon for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) 4E10, PGZL1, 10E8, and LN01 which stem from unique lineages and all target the semi-concealed membrane-proximal epitope region (MPER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env). Interestingly, these bnAbs show varying degrees of affinity for lipid components; some associate with lipid bilayers or cultured cells even in the absence of antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–819–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. This membrane interaction behavior appears to correlate with neutralization potency and is attributed to shared CDR loop features including a long hydrophobic CDR-H3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. The correlation between membrane association and neutralization has been established, given that mutations or chemical conjugations to solvent-exposed antibody loop residues which enhance association to phospholipid vesicles consequently boost efficacy of pseudovirus neutralization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Conversely, mutations reducing hydrophobicity drastically reduce neutralization activity while also weakening association to lipid bilayers, despite minimal impacts to antigen affinity (e.g. 4E10 CDR-H3 H100-H102 Trp-Trp motif; PGZL1 clone H4K3’s CDR-H1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, phospholipid membrane interactions evolved by MPER-targeting bnAbs appear critical for their mechanism of immune protection against HIV. Yet, the breadth of molecular features responsible for association with membranes and mode of lipid-embedded epitope engagement are not clear.</p>
<p>Structural characterization of MPER-targeting bnAbs with full-length Env trimer or gp41 fragments also indicate that the surrounding lipid bilayer plays a role in antibody access and epitope recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of Env trimers bound to bnAbs PGZL1, 4E10, and 10E8 within in different model membranes suggest their CDR loops form intimate contacts with surrounding lipids while engaging MPER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Antigen binding fragments (Fab) crystal structures of those bnAbs as well as LN01 soaked with short-chain phospholipids all revealed ordered headgroup moieties complexed within the CDR loops in the presence and absence of antigen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> suggesting the antibodies encode specific lipid interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, the molecular features mediating membrane affinity for these bnAbs appear critical to their maturation and mechanism of immune protection against HIV <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>These data support a 2-step bnAb neutralization mechanism proposed previously, wherein a population of bnAbs <italic>in vivo</italic> may first associate with membranes via embedding their CDRs, then laterally diffuse across the bilayer surface to subsequently engage Env at MPER<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. The reverse order, MPER binding followed by CDR membrane insertion, is also often posited. Here, we developed multi-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches suited to investigate these mechanisms and the unique maturation landscape these rare antibodies must navigate to avoid auto-immune consequences. For these MPER bnAbs, we focused on the <italic>in-silico</italic> capacity to characterize the molecular features mediating phospholipid affinity at atomic detail, not afforded by previous structural approaches. We find that unbiased all-atom MD simulations accurately and reproducibly predict <italic>ab initio</italic> binding of phospholipids stably bound at specific CDR binding sites previously identified in co-crystal structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Integrating coarse-grain (CG) simulations, we capture the full process of antibodies scanning and embedding into lipid bilayers to biologically relevant conformations. The simulations illuminate key molecular features tuning bnAbs’ lipid interaction and preferred membrane-bound geometry, advancing on previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, including surprising contributions from framework regions. Biased simulations provide rough estimates of membrane interaction strength, applied to demonstrate that <italic>in silico</italic> bilayer affinity correlates with neutralization efficacy of experimentally characterized PGZL1 variants along a pseudo-maturation trajectory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>This modeling platform provides an improved framework for navigating the proposed 2-step bnAb neutralization mechanism both for retrospective and proactive evaluation of antibody repertoires, which should have utility in vaccine design and therapeutic antibody engineering. Likewise, our results imply more generalized implications for the <italic>in vivo</italic> selection of antibodies targeting membrane proteins, beyond HIV, at partially concealed juxtamembrane regions – highly desirable epitope regions given their typically high protein sequence conservation. Reliable atomic detail views of antibody conformations at the membrane surface and loop phospholipid binding should be powerful for better understanding membrane protein epitope engagement, pathogen neutralization mechanism, and the checkpoints regulating self-sensing antibodies.</p>

<title>Atomic simulations accurately model MPER bnAb 4E10 and PGZL1 phospholipid interactions at HIV-like membrane surfaces</title>
<p>To assess the stability, organization, and spectrum of phospholipid interactions inferred from previous lipid-bound crystallography and cryo-EM experiments, we began by performing unbiased all-atom simulations of 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8 peripherally embedded to the surface of model lipid bilayers. Initial membrane-bound Fab conformations were computed using PPM2.0<sup>37<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, globally optimizing protein insertion based on per-residue hydrophobicity and solvation, each resulting in reasonable predictions with CDR-H3 embedded. Four 1 μs pseudo-replicate simulations were initiated per bnAb, with two replicates tilted by ±15 degrees to modestly vary the starting membrane-interacting pose, utilizing an explicit simplified HIV-like model anionic bilayer: 25% cholesterol, 5% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), 70% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>4E10 and PGZL1 are homologous (85% sequence identity, sharing IgG <italic>VH1-69, VH4-34</italic> and <italic>VH4-59</italic>), and have very similar affinities, breadth, and potency (especially comparing PGZL1.H4K3). 4E10 is notably more poly-reactive: binding to cultured cells, numerous isolated phospholipids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, and vesicles of most compositions even in the absence of antigen – whereas 10E8, LN01, and PGZL1 do not. PGZL1 and 4E10 crystal structures both bear putative lipid electron density at several surface loops, notably recurring within a CDR-H1 site – a region when mutation reduced the neutralization potency 10-fold for PGZL1-H4K3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Given their similarities, we first compared the lipid bilayer interaction mechanisms in 4E10 and PGZL1 simulations. Upon time-averaging phospholipid density from 4 independent trajectories, both bnAbs showed strong hotspots for a lipid phosphate bound within the CDR-H1 loops, with minimal phospholipid or cholesterol ordering around the proteins elsewhere. The simulated lipid phosphates bound within CDR-H1 have exceptional overlap with electron densities and atomic details of modelled headgroups from respective lipid-soaked co-crystal structures of 4E10 and PGZL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, with phosphate mean positions RMSDs of 0.6 and 0.7 Å, respectively, relative to the X-ray structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref><bold>; Figure Supplement 1A-D</bold>). Thus, our simulations reproduce <italic>ab initio</italic> with atomic accuracy the evidence of 4E10 and PGZL1 bnAbs’ mechanism of membrane association. These results validate the CDR-H1 antibody-lipid interactions proposed from previous co-crystal structures are not only feasible in the context of full biologically realistic HIV-like bilayers, but form very readily. The CDR-H1 lipid phosphate complexes appear to be specific interactions that anchor and orient CDR loops at the bilayer surface for antigen engagement, complementing protein-lipid interactions which are less geometrically specific, i.e., lipid tail solvation of apolar groups in the CDR-H loops such as CDR-H3 tryptophans.</p>

<p>We next characterized the stability and dynamics of the spontaneously forming antibody-phospholipid complexes which recurred across all trajectories. For both 4E10 and PGZL1, 3 of 4 replicates showed very rapid binding of a headgroup phosphate <italic>ab initio</italic> in the first 20 nanoseconds (ns) from lipids diffusing in from &gt;= 8 Å away) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>). In some cases, phospholipids bound as early as the protein-restrained equilibration (15 ns) where lipids can freely diffuse (<bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-E</bold>). For both 4E10 and PGZL1, one of each replicate simulation had delayed formation of the stable CDR-H1-mediated phospholipid complexes (within 200 ns) requiring minor Fab reorientation on the membrane surface given these replicates’ initialization from an artificially tilted orientation <bold>(Supp. Video 1)</bold>. Upon formation, most phospholipid complexes were highly stable, typically persisting for hundreds of nanoseconds with low mobility of the phosphate headgroup relative to CDR-H1 (&lt;1 Å RMSF) and high overall occupancy (both &gt;80% across 4 microseconds total). An extensive polar network coordinates the lipid phosphate oxygens within the CDR-H1 loop: hydrogen bonds donated from backbone amides of Phe29 and Ser30 and from sidechain hydroxyls of Ser29/Thr29 and Ser30 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C-D</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Notably, CDR-H loops in contact with the membrane maintained internally rigid backbone conformations during simulation with CDR-H1 having &lt; 1 Å RMSF (<bold>Figure 1–figure supplement 1C-D</bold>). One PGZL1 simulation captured a rare dynamic lipid exchange event (<bold>Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, Supp. Video 2</bold>). A POPC molecule, bound for ∼500 ns, dissociated from the CDR-H1 and was promptly replaced by a second nearby lipid, POPA. These observations, including the kinetic stability and high occupancy, suggest that 4E10 and PGZL1 family antibodies likely are predominantly bound to an anchoring phospholipid when intimately contacting the membrane surface, including during MPER engagement and in the neutralized complex. When CDR-H3 is inserted, CDR-H1 is presented as a rigid pre-formed binding site conveniently at the membrane’s headgroup layer for rapid formation of complexes, with those phospholipids likely in a steady-state equilibrium freely exchanging (nano-microsecond timescale) yet heavily favoring the bound state.</p>
<p>These results of reliably recovering experimentally determined CDR-phospholipid complexes bolsters confidence that antibody behaviors within the simulations are biologically relevant, motivating our deeper analysis of features driving the bnAbs’ protein-lipid interactions and global membrane surface conformations. Characterizing the cumulative per-residue interaction profiles of 4E10 and PGZL1 with bilayer lipids categorized into headgroup, glycerol, or hydrocarbon layers illustrates the deep immersion of heavy-chain loops, with the light-chain making some peripheral polar headgroup contacts (namely CDRs L1 and L3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). The patterns of lipid interactions compare well with previous 4E10 simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, yet are more expansive here – possibly due to the sustained phospholipid-CDR-H1 complex and greater simulation length.</p>
<p>Aligning interaction profiles with corresponding primary sequences contextualizes the amino acid molecular features responsible and their origin in antibody maturation. One novel observation consistent between our 4E10 and PGZL1 simulations was that heavy-chain framework region 3 (FR-H3) extensively intercalates into the bilayer surface. This finding demonstrates that predominantly germline encoded antibody surface features can provide significant contributions to the membrane binding mechanism and surface orientation of antibodies – a key insight for invoking and honing antibody-lipid interactions in vaccine design. For the light-chain loops and FR-H3 of PGZL1 and 4E10, charged residues mediate their shallower headgroup surface interactions <bold>(Figure 1-figure supplement 2A-B)</bold>, whereas the CDR-H loops bare neighboring stretches of hydrophobic and lipophilic polar residues facilitating their deeper embedding. Compared to PGZL1, 4E10’s CDR-H loops are further buried, more extensively contacting lipid aliphatic tails – which may in part explain 4E10’s higher tendency for poly-specificity. The comprehensive protein-lipid atomic-detail maps further detail that the mechanisms for membrane interaction and antibody maturation driven are largely by the solvation for apolar surface loops – the extent of hydrophobic burial – complemented by compatible polar residue electrostatics. The majority of bnAb protein-lipid interactions arise from surface residues’ macroscopic chemical properties, contrasting the much more sequence and conformationally specific phospholipid binding sites constructed at CDR-H1. Thus, the multivalent combination of surface features combined with highly specific lipid anchoring sites may be a convergent theme for maturation and mechanism for MPER-targeting bnAbs, including the previously undervalued contribution from germline-encoded framework regions to lipid association.</p>

<title>Phospholipid complex formed in the CDR Light Chain groove of 10E8 bound to membrane surfaces</title>
<p>We similarly investigated bnAb 10E8, which differs in its genetic origins and expected light-chain-mediated membrane binding mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. In all 4 replicate simulations, we observed a POPC complexed at a groove between CDR-L1 and FR-L3 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B</xref>) which had had significant non-protein electron density in previous 10E8 X-ray structures with and without lipids, which had been modelled as headgroup phosphoglycerol anions, glycerol, or free dihydrogen phosphate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. In our simulations, the stably bound POPC phosphate was slightly offset (2.7 Å) from the proposed CDR-L1 crystallographic site <bold>(Figure 2-figure supplement 1B)</bold>, and instead localized to FR-L3 stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network from Ser83 hydroxyl, Gly84 backbone amide, and Asn85 C-alpha proton (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Simultaneously, the POPC choline moiety occupied the precise crystallographic CDR-L1 site, wherein the choline cation was coordinated by four pre-organized unpaired backbone carbonyls stemming from the specific CDR-L1 short loop helix conformation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). We find these bivalent complexes engaging both moieties of the lipid phosphocholine (PC) zwitterion at this CDR-L1 FR-L3 groove with &gt;70% occupancy overall across replicate simulations with high stability: 0.5 Å RMSF for CDR-L1–choline site and 0.5 Å RMSF for FR-L3–phosphate site (<bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 1C-D</bold>). These 10E8 loops were conformationally rigid (RMSF &lt; 1.0 Å, <bold>Figure 2-figure supplement 1E)</bold>, presenting a pre-formed binding site analogous to CDR-H1 in 4E10 and PGZL1. Previous experiments highlight the importance of CDR-L1 phospholipid binding site features in 10E8’s neutralization mechanism, given that the double mutant of R29 and Y38 to alanine exhibited vastly decreased neutralization (&gt;500 fold) across HIV strains with negligible impact to MPER affinity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The time-averaged per-residue lipid interaction profile demonstrates how 10E8 uses both heavy (CDR-H3) and light chain loops (CDRs L1, L2, L3; FR-L3) to orient the antibody geometry on the membrane surface to position 10E8’s phospholipid binding groove site at the headgroup-rich bilayer region <bold>(Figure 2-figure supplement 1F)</bold>. These simulations supplement experimental findings with novel atomic details to establish that genetically distinct MPER antibodies share a consistent mechanism of utilizing CDR loops and framework to mediate bilayer interactions, with 10E8 utilizing FR-L3 for phosphate specificity in a stable lipid complex to anchor this bnAb at the membrane surface.</p>

<title>Phospholipid binding modes in complex high cholesterol lipid bilayers</title>
<p>We next evaluated whether such bnAb conformations and <italic>ab initio</italic> phospholipid binding are robust to distinct lipid compositions in more complex high cholesterol bilayers matching lipidomics studies for HIV particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. New simulations were initialized for similar 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8 Fab conformations in membranes having a 9.5:19:8.5:18:45 ratio of POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS), palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM), Cholesterol. In a 500 ns trajectory for each, stable phospholipid complexes rapidly formed within the respective CDR loop sides with atomic accuracy to the expected position – now having more diversity in lipid headgroup chemistries <bold>(Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-C)</bold>. Although 4E10 bound only POPC at its CDR-H1 site, in PGZL1 simulations CDR-H1 coordinated a PSM molecule (PC headgroup) in precisely the same binding mode as observed for POPC despite PSM’s substitution of two lipid tails off the glycerol backbone. Likewise, 10E8 bound a POPE at its light chain groove site, with the PE (phosphate and cation) forming analogous interactions (&lt;1 Å RMSD to POPC), including coordination of the cationic ethanolamine by the ring of backbone carbonyls capping CDR-L1’s loop helix. Thus, these bnAb phospholipid binding sites can accommodate a broader scope of lipid tail and headgroup chemistries than we have investigated here and can readily form stable phospholipid anchoring complexes in bilayers of HIV-like cholesterol-rich composition. One shared conformational difference observed for these bnAbs the higher cholesterol bilayers was slightly more extensive and broader interaction profiles as well as modestly deeper embedding of the relevant CDR and framework surfaces loops <bold>(Figure 2– figure supplement 1D-F)</bold>. These results bolster the feasibility for using all-atom MD as an in silico platform to explore differential phospholipid affinity at these sites (i.e., specificity studies) and influence on antibody preferred conformation as membrane composition and lipid chemistry are systematically varied. More thorough simulation techniques such as potential of mean force are needed to make those predictions and could better guide experiments concerning how to incorporate the antibody-lipid interaction in neutralization and maturation of bnAbs via vaccine.</p>

<title>Structural bioinformatics contextualizes bnAb interactions at the membrane</title>
<p>We sought to interrogate the biological relevance and <italic>in silico</italic> predictability of these observed CDR-lipid polar interactions using an orthogonal bioinformatics approach. We mined protein-ligand interactions to assess whether phosphate complexes of similar geometries have been observed in Nature, positing that the occurrence of analogous phosphate interactions outside the context of MPER bnAbs, i.e., within critical structural or functional regions of other protein families, can differentiate common proteome-wide functional motifs from simulation artifacts. Structural searches querying the lipid-binding loop backbone conformation of each Fab (as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>) identified between 10<sup>5</sup> to 2·10<sup>6</sup> geometrically similar sub-segments within natural proteins (&lt;2 Å RMSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, reflecting they are relatively prevalent (not rare) in the protein universe, comparing well with frequency of other surface loops of similar length in antibodies (<bold>Supplementary Table 4</bold>). The structurally similar loops found in distinct proteins were subsequently mined for nearby phosphate/phosphoryl and sulfate/sulfo ligands <bold>(Figure 2–figure supplement 3; Supplementary Table 1)</bold>. When searching for loops similar to the CDR-H1 of 4E10 and PGZL1, only 4 cases of phosphate-type ligand binding motifs were identified. Thus, this CDR-H1 site is a realistic but rare protein-phospho-ligand structural motif <bold>(Figure 2–figure supplement 3A-B)</bold>.</p>
<p>For 10E8’s CDR-L1 site, only 1 phosphate-type ligand was observed: a solvent-exposed surface crystallographic ion. By contrast, 10E8’s FR-L3 beta-turn site was a hot spot for phosphate-type ligands, with 23 natural protein cases <bold>(Figure 2–figure supplement 3C)</bold>. Thus, while both CDR-L1 and FR-L3 10E8 loops sites can bind phosphate ligands, the much greater natural prevalence of phosphates ligated at FR-L3 supports that the newly proposed 10E8 POPC complex observed in our simulations is biologically realistic, rather than a simulation artifact. Barring experimental validation, existence of this FR-L3 site establishes precedent for how important framework regions can be for mediating protein-membrane interactions, including hosting stable and specific phospholipid complexes. This bioinformatics analysis illuminates the sophisticated molecular recognition mechanism in which 4E10, PGZL1 and 10E8 Fab domains incorporate recurring structural features from Nature to coordinate specific phospholipid binding interactions.</p>

<title>Global geometries of membrane-bound bnAb and implications for tilted Env engagement</title>
<p>Given the emphasis on antibody tilt relative to the bilayer and antigen in discerning neutralization mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, we compared the geometries of membrane-bound conformational ensembles for our 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8 simulations to those of Fab-bound Env trimer cryo-EM structures in membrane mimics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. Simulated antigen-free Fabs favor similar orientations on lipid bilayer surfaces as in bnAb-bound tilted Env experimental structures, likely facilitated by the anchoring phospholipid complexes (<bold>Figure 1–figure supplement 1A; Figure 2–figure supplement 1A</bold>). The primary difference is Env-bound Fabs in cryo-EM adopt slightly more shallow approach angles (∼15<italic>°</italic>) relative to the bilayer normal. The simulated bnAbs in isolation prefer slightly more upright orientations, but present CDRs at approximately the same depth and orientation. Thus, these bnAbs appear pre-disposed in their membrane surface conformations, needing only a minor tilt to form the membrane-antibody-antigen neutralization complex. The apparent barrier for re-orientation is likely much less energetically constraining than shielding glycans and accessibility of MPER. Recent studies documenting Env’s inherent stalk flexibility and wide range of ectodomain tilt also suggests looser steric restriction from Env’s soluble domain for an antibody’s bilayer and MPER access than previously thought<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Investigating free antibodies’ membrane-bound conformational preferences, e.g., during maturation or for targeting privileged germlines, may be an informative approach to help illicit bnAbs via vaccine with similar lipid-dependent neutralization mechanism. Thus, we characterized the geometric range of 10E8, 4E10, and PGZL1 ensembles within our simulations via structural clustering and analyzed orientation-dependence of their CDR-phospholipid complexes. Fab surface geometries were defined by immersion depths of each CDR loop and 2 global domain angles relative to membrane plane and thresholded to distinguish 7 substates, distributing well into population fractions from 5-35% (<bold>Figure 2–figure supplement 4A-H)</bold>. Clustering of all bnAb simulation time together expectedly resulted in 4E10 and PGZL1 mapping to shared macroscopic states while the more light-chain directed 10E8 clustered separately (<bold>Figure 2–figure supplement 4B-C)</bold>, reflecting the large differences to CDR-H1 depth and approach angle <bold>(Supplementary Table 2).</bold> Upon clustering the 4E10 ensemble, interestingly, all substates maintained 86-98% occupancy of the CDR-H1 phospholipid complex whereas 10E8 and PGZL1 ensemble substates showed more conformation-specific variance in their respective phospholipid binding (<bold>Figure 2–figure supplement 4E,G,I)</bold>. For example, two 10E8 substates exhibit low CDR-L1 PC headgroup occupancy (23%, 33%) due to a domain rotation (20-30<italic>°</italic>) resulting in more CDR-H contacts at the expense of the more typical CDR-L interactions typically observed for 10E8 (<bold>Figure 2–figure supplement 4I</bold>). These findings highlight the important interplay between bnAbs’ preferred surface orientation and loop composition to form these conformationally sensitive anchoring complexes through positioning of the key phospholipid-binding loops. Loop composition and conformational ensembles are likely honed together during the maturation process.</p>

<title>Antigen influence on membrane bound conformations and lipid binding sites for LN01</title>
<p>We next studied bnAb LN01 to interrogate differences in the antibody surface-bound conformational ensemble and phospholipid interactions in the context of a transmembrane (TM) antigen, utilizing the availability of Fab crystal structures complexed with an MPER-TM fragment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. MPER-bound LN01 structures bind one phospholipid and one dodecyl-PC detergent in its CDRs, implying possible paratope-epitope-membrane cooperativity in the neutralization mechanism and two putative phospholipid sites anchoring the bnAb to membrane surfaces (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 1A)</bold>. The PC headgroup binding site resides in the CDR-H3-L1-L2 inter-chain groove, with the lipid phosphate engaged by L1 Lys31 via salt bridge and the choline moiety interacting in a cation-pi cage with Tyr32 and CDRH3 Tyr100g. When present, MPER contributes additional choline-aromatic stacking (Trp680, Tyr681). The second more solvent-exposed site lies between CDR-H1 and - H2, ordering PS or PC headgroups in crystal structures. We chose to retain the MPER-TM fragment (668-709) as a monomeric continuous helix from the LN01-bound structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. This conformation has been observed for a similar MPER-TM peptide by NMR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> and within bnAb-bound Env by cryo-EM for TM domains in both crossing (dimeric) or separated (monomeric, “tripod”) arrangements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. We recognize the caveat that the model MPER-TM antigen fragment studied here does not encompass the full structural breadth of MPER display observed or hypothesized for antigen fragments or full-length Env conformational states.

<p>Simulations of LN01 were prepared analogously to the other bnAbs with simplified model membranes, replacing 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DOPS) in place of POPA to provide opportunity to reconstitute LN01’s crystallographic PS binding site. Initial membrane surface geometries for apo and MPER-bound states predicted using PPM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, which accounted for solvation of the MPER-TM fragment, lead to similar embedded configurations having CDR-H3 deeply inserted with surface contacts from framework H3, light chain (CDR-L1, L3), and heavy chain (CDR-H1, L2). Across three 1 μs replicates each, those loops remained inserted and adopt ensembles similar to the starting conformations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-B,K-L</xref>). The MPER-antibody interface including key interactions (e.g., Trp100H to Thr676 H-bond) remained stable. The TM domain maintains a continuous helix through MPER without kinking in a stable tilted geometry (minimal rotation about helix axis) that enables the previously observed snorkeling and hydration of TM Arg686<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. In both apo and MPER-TM-bound replicates, several POPC binding events were observed within the CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove at atomic accuracy when compared to dodecyl-PC headgroup position in LN01 X-ray structures, with the same sidechain interactions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-J</xref>). In contrast to PGZL1, 4E10, and 10E8 simulations, phospholipids in LN01’s CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove site has much lower kinetic stability and occupancy: ∼30% and ∼40% aggregate occupancy for MPER-TM-bound and apo, respectively (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 1C-D</bold>). Occupancy at the second crystallographic CDR-H1-H2 PS/PC site was negligible within any trajectory. Thus, unbiased MD identifies the CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove as the primary phospholipid anchoring site for LN01 in biologically realistic membranes both alone and when bound to TM-embedded MPER, and further emphasizes the importance of lipid in LN01’s maturation and neutralization mechanism.</p>
<p>Two interesting behaviors stood out in LN01 simulations. First, an additional new CDR-phospholipid binding site was observed reproducibly across apo and MPER-TM-bound trajectories at an alternative groove comprised of and CDR-H2, CDR-H3, and FR-L2 we termed the Loading Site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-J</xref>). Phospholipids appeared to readily exchange the ∼7 Å distance between this Loading Site and the primary “X-ray” CDR-H3-L1-L2 groove phospholipid binding site (<bold>Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</bold>). Although, the two sites were often simultaneously occupied. In the Loading Site, lipid headgroup phosphate oxygens were coordinated by hydrogen bonds to LN01 Tyr100g, Tyr49, and Tyr52 – and optionally to gp41 Trp680 if present (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3E-H</xref>). Bivalent interaction with the headgroup choline occurs simultaneously via a similar electrostatic interactions and cation-pi cage motif from Tyr49, Tyr52, Thr53, Thr100c, Ser100d, and Tyr100g sidechains. The Loading site was occupied more often than the X-ray site: 78% and 58% simulation time for MPER-TM-bound and apo LN01 replicates respectively <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3I,J</xref><bold>; Figure 3-figure supplement 1C-D)</bold>.</p>
<p>The second notable behavior observed was that antigen-free LN01 sampled a broader range of geometries at the membrane surface, characterized by two angles describing the Fab relative to the membrane (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-D</xref>). LN01 complexed with MPER-TM was more deeply and extensively embedded than LN01 alone and resulted in a more focused conformation landscape – aligned with the minimal dynamics of the MPER-TM orientation. Protein-lipid interaction profiles reflect consistency in the protein features mediating membrane association between apo and MPER-TM-bound trajectories (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K-L</xref>), with CDR-L and FR-L3 more inserted upon TM antigen engagement upon the minor rearrangement to engage transmembrane antigen. Critically, while apo LN01 favors a different geometry (positive Rotation angle) its membrane surface ensemble heavily samples the major conformation adopted in MPER-TM bound state (negative Rotation angle) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B,D</xref>). This observation that LN01’s surface-bound geometry is predisposed for transmembrane antigen engagement suggests that maturing bnAbs’ sequences and structures are primed for the membrane interaction key to access MPER and form the neuralization complex.</p>

<title>Coarse-grain <italic>ab initio</italic> insertion simulations capture biologically relevant membrane-bound conformations</title>
<p>Next, we used extended sampling time afforded by Martini coarse-grained (CG) simulations to more thoroughly explore the process of antibody insertion to lipid bilayers and landscape of feasible bnAb surface-bound conformations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Fab’s simulated in CG representation with elastic network restraints maintained the protein fold (&lt;2 Å backbone RMSD) and retained key heavy-light inter-domain contacts, informing that this polar bead model rigidly presents the Fab macroscopic surface features critical for mediating bilayer surface interactions, i.e., hydrophobic patches, charge, polarity (<bold>Figure 5-figure supplement 1A</bold>). Thus, CG simulations might be useful for evaluating bnAbs’ propensity for membrane insertion and approximate preferred conformations, a hypothesis we probed by two distinct simulation approaches.</p>
<p>The first “spontaneous insertion” approach placed a Fab at distinct random initial orientations and distances (0.5 – 2 nm) above a pre-assembled HIV-like anionic lipid bilayer, allowing Fabs free diffusion for 14 µs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). In 18 replicate simulations for each of 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, we observed CDR-directed association stable within the lipid bilayer (&gt;1 µs) within 10, 14, and 12 trajectories, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-D</xref><bold>, Supplementary Table 3</bold>). Simulations captured bilayer surface scanning behavior preceding insertion and numerous dissociation events, pointing to the reversibility and dynamics of the process. As a reference, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was tested similarly. BSA’s documented weak affinity for lipid bilayer association (low millimolar)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup> aligns with the drastically reduced membrane contact events (2/18) and lack of sustained insertion observed (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Non-neutralizing anti-gp41 antibody 13h11 having no detectable lipid bilayer interaction by bilayer interferometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> also exhibited negligible insertion and only sparse ‘scanning’ events, starkly contrasting the bnAbs’ behaviors.

<p>A second “co-assembly” CG approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> aimed to enhance sampling bnAbs insertion and conformations through spontaneous assembly a lipid bilayer around a randomly oriented Fab in a simulation box amongst mixed water, ion, and lipid particles (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Predisposition for Fab-lipid interactions and insertion events were increased, particularly for 10E8 and PGZL1, while time wasted sampling Fab in bulk water was reduced. We combated potential biases of this method for possibly enriching insertion in less favorable conformations and skewing distributions by running more replicates (n=40) of shorter 5 µs simulations.

<p>We compared the spectrum of membrane-bound conformations sampled from ab initio CG membrane insertion and with pre-inserted all-atom simulations for each bnAb to characterize correlation. Relative Fab orientation was tracked via two global domain angles: the canonical “angle of approach” (Fab long axis intersecting the membrane normal vector) and an internal “rotation angle” from the vector orthogonal to this long axis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Fab conformational ensembles and protein-lipid interaction patterns from both CG approaches heavily overlapped with the primary geometry observed for each respective bnAb all-atom trajectories, showing consistency between the two simulation models <bold>(</bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref><bold>, Figure 5-figure supplement 1B-C)</bold>. CG 4E10 insertions across both methods adopted single conformations which were similar and all-atom-like. PGZL1 and 10E8 showed more promiscuity by sampling alternative <italic>ab initio</italic> membrane-inserted geometries alongside their respective all-atom-like conformations, with these states appearing consistently in both CG approaches but at different frequencies. The apparent deeper energy well for 4E10’s primary geometry in CG simulations could reflect greater conformational specificity, but could also be a result of the Martini model’s overestimation of hydrophobic interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>Overall, these CG simulations facilitate study of <italic>ab initio</italic> membrane insertion for MPER bnAbs, wherein we find all sustained events are CDR-directed, ruling out contributions from other Fab surface features. For each bnAb, a state we deem to be biologically relevant, based on similarity to geometries observed in all-atom trajectories forming key phospholipid complexes, was either the primary conformation or one of the top 2 sampled. Given that non-CDR directed and alternative CDR-embedded orientations readily dissociate, we conclude that course-grained models can distinguish unfavorable and favorable membrane-bound conformations to an extent that provides utility for characterizing antibody-bilayer interaction mechanisms.</p>

<p>For 4E10, trajectories initiated from all three geometries drifted back to conformations very similar to those of our initial pre-inserted all-atom trajectories and bound phospholipids at the CDR-H1 site (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-E</xref>). Interestingly, the trajectory back-mapped from cluster A adopted deeper insertion and higher CDR-H1 phospholipid binding occupancy (&gt;60%) compared to ensembles of clusters B and C trajectories, which were slightly tilted (rotation angle &gt; 0°) and less extensively inserted, indicating the latter geometries are likely less ideal (<bold>Figure 6-figure supplement 1B</bold>). For PGZL1, all-atom trajectories starting from CG clusters B and C similarly converge to CDR-H-inserted conformations analogous to our previous all-atom MD, and stably bind phospholipid headgroups at CDR-H1 (&gt;50% occupancy) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-E</xref>). For 10E8, Cluster C started and finished in membrane-bound orientations analogous to the pre-inserted simulations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>); although the Fab adopted a slightly different protein-lipid interaction pattern with much shallower CDR-H3 insertion, the bivalent CDR-L1 phospholipid complex still readily formed with high occupancy (&gt;70%) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D-E</xref>). Thus, these multi-scale simulations demonstrate that unbiased CG modeling can generate stable membrane-bound conformations <italic>ab initio</italic> that integrate smoothly into atomistic simulations which are biologically relevant, in that they capture key phospholipid complexes seen in laboratory experiments inferred to be critical for bnAb function.</p>
<p>CG sampling also explored additional alternative membrane-bound geometries, which we assessed for kinetic stability in integrative atomic simulations to discern secondary protein binding modes or intermediate conformations or aiding membrane association (e.g., preliminary surface-scanning) from simple artifacts. The trajectory initiated from PGZL1’s CG cluster A adopts a novel conformation stable on the 500 ns timescale with CDR-H3 inserted, favoring lipid-CDR-L interactions over CDR-H, that was not competent to complex phospholipids at CDR-H1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-D</xref>). All-atom simulation from one alternate conformation of 10E8, CG cluster A, rapidly dissociated from the membrane within 50 ns <bold>(Figure 6-figure supplement 1C)</bold>, showing this integrative MD distinguishes this state as an unstable likely artifact. Interestingly, the all-atom trajectory starting from CG cluster B trended towards the same novel conformation as cluster A, but remained stably inserted and bound phospholipid at the CDR-L1 site at high occupancy (70 %), albeit having shallower CDR-H3 insertion alongside canonical 10E8 CDR-L embedding (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-D</xref>). These simulations hint at the feasibility to study compatibility of these lipid complex with broader Fab-membrane geometries, and reveal the need for orthogonally evaluating these conformations such as by biased simulations (e.g., potential of mean force, PMF) which we address later in this manuscript.</p>
<p>Additionally, we modelled the orientation of a full-length IgG based on the simulated position of each bnAb Fab to ascertain how sterically feasible a bivalent Fab-membrane interaction could be and possibility of avidity effects in mechanism. The resulting full-length IgG geometries shows that with one membrane-bound Fab, it is very unlikely a second Fabs can simultaneously engage the bilayer due to restriction from the IgG hinge – except for the case an extraordinarily flexible hinge (<bold>Figure 6-figure supplement 1D</bold>).</p>

<title>Biased pulling simulations distinguish experimentally characterized affinity differences</title>
<p>Finally, we applied biased constant velocity atomistic simulations to compute the force required to dissociate a Fab bound to lipid bilayers – providing a binding strength estimate akin to force spectroscopy (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Doing so tested whether this approach could connect the observed bnAb anchoring phospholipid complexes and membrane-bound conformations with physiological properties such as lipid bilayer affinity and neutralization potency. If informative, this method offers an expedient alternative to canonical free energy calculations such as PMFs that demand tens of µs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>, prohibitive for characterizing many antibody variants.

<p>We first assessed suitable pulling velocities through dissociating 4E10 poses from simplified anionic HIV-like lipid bilayers to a fixed 1.5 nm distance over different intervals (10, 50, 100, 200 ns; n=3 unique starting conformations). Interestingly, 2 of 3 starting poses adopt the CDR-H3 rotamer conformation of Trp100b projecting down towards lipid tails (“Trp-Down” state) while the third starting pose has Trp100b in a flipped rotamer pointing towards the lipid-water interface (“Trp-Up” state) (<bold>Figure 7-Figure supplement 1A)</bold>. As expected, rupture forces decrease with increasing simulation time (slower pulling velocity), plateauing between 100 and 200 ns (<bold>Figure 7-Figure supplement 1B</bold>). Surprisingly, the rupture forces from trajectories starting in the Trp-Down state were nearly identical (&lt; 2% difference), and rupture forces from trajectories starting from the Trp-Up state were consistently lower (27 and 47% greater) for 50 and 100 ns, respectively. This cursory trial exhibited promising conformational sensitivity in distinguishing different protein-lipid interactions in a CDR loop and precision from similar initial Fab conformations.</p>
<p>We next by compared behavior of 4E10 with its well-studied CDR-H3 WAWA variant, the W100aΔA-W100bΔA double mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). WAWA has similar K<sub>d</sub> to MPER as 4E10, but significantly reduced affinity to empty HIV-like liposomes and neutralization efficacy (&gt;100 fold higher IC<sub>50</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Across replicates from different starting states for 4E10 (n=9) and WAWA (n=11), rupture force calculations showed average forces (± S.E.M.) of 63.8 ± 2.8 kJ/nm/mol and 48.0 ± 2.6 kJ/nm/mol respectively (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figures 7D-E</xref>), correctly indicating the 4E10 ensemble has a stronger membrane interaction (32 ± 13 %; p-value &lt; 0.001). Thus, this <italic>in silico</italic> estimation effectively discerns antibody variants whose high and low lipid bilayer affinities have been previous measured and reinforces the molecular link between WAWA’s reduced membrane binding and neutralization.</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluated experimentally characterized PGZL1 variants that recapitulate possible stages of a germline maturation pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). Mature PGZL1 has relatively high affinity to the MPER epitope peptide (K<sub>d</sub> = 10 nM) and demonstrates great breadth and potency, neutralizing 84% of a 130-strain panel. An “Intermediate” PGZL1 with V-gene germline reversion (gVmDmJ, 100% CDR-H3 identity) showed a modest affinity loss (K<sub>d</sub> = 64 nM), while neutralization potency and breadth (12%) were more substantially reduced than expected due to affinity alone – attributed to impaired lipid bilayer interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. The fully “Germline” reverted variant (gVgDgM) had no detectable MPER peptide affinity or neutralization. Ensembles for Germline and Intermediate Fab pulling simulations were prepared from unbiased all-atom trajectories, starting from predicted hydrophobicity-optimized inserted poses. The variants adopt insertion geometries like the mature Fab, facilitated by the mostly conserved CDR-H3 <bold>(Figure 7-figure supplement 1C)</bold>, but did not form CDR-H1-phospholipid complexes. Significantly lower pulling forces were required to dissociate Intermediate and Germline PGZL1 from bilayers, 37.5 ± 14.9 kJ/nm/mol and 41.2 ± 11.7 kJ/nm/mol respectively, than for mature PGZL1, 56.1 ± 11.6 kJ/nm/mol (p &lt; 0.003) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7E</xref>). Germline PGZL1 likely reflects kinetically stable but low affinity interactions, representing baseline of rupture forces required to dissociate CDR-inserted antibodies. While the difference in Germline and Intermediate force distributions was not significant (p &gt; 0.4), more higher force events were observed for the Intermediate. These results provide further evidence that bnAb phospholipid binding features are acquired and honed along the maturation pathway, entrenching the connection between positive selection of antibody-lipid interactions and neutralization efficacy.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we present a roadmap for applying multi-scale molecular simulations to characterize the biophysical underpinning of lipid membrane interactions within the mechanism of HIV MPER bnAbs. The approaches demonstrated and principles discerned improve understanding of maturation pathways for antibodies targeting membrane-proximal epitopes and should enrich data-driven design of HIV immunogens. Our detailed simulations supplement <italic>in vitro</italic> binding and crystallographic evidence in establishing that bnAbs develop highly specific phospholipid interactions that facilitate access to the MPER epitope and can participate in epitope-paratope interface in context of full lipid bilayers. These results add validation to which out of the many possible ions and short-chain lipid moieties ordered within those crystal structures may be inferred as putative bilayer phospholipids, a critical consideration in antibody and vaccine design. The additional simulations outlined with different lipid ratios and varied antigens as well as more rigorous PMF studies, could be applied to better inform affinity thresholds and energetic relationships paramount to the lipid complexes and conformational preferences reported here. Furthermore, these modeling approaches should have utility in finding membrane-targeting elements in antibodies towards identifying causes of autoimmune stress. Likewise, the analysis tools in this work might be practical for aiding proactive in antibody engineering targeting membrane proteins, for example grafting lipid phosphate binding structural motifs or amino acid sequences with desirable membrane associating properties into distinct antibody loops regions.</p>
<p>Further, these simulations can serve future examination of molecular details concerning the genetic origins and developmental pathways for incipient lipid-binding antibodies. Through natural or vaccine-induced immunity, coaxing the immune system to develop both lipid and antigen affinity (possibly even cooperativity) during maturation is a difficult task, and hindered by downregulation of membrane binding precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Likewise, MPER bnAbs are difficult to induce and, until recent clinical trials, have only been isolated from patients with chronic HIV-infection and sustained immunosuppression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Modern vaccine strategies often elicit certain subsets of precursor B cells, often targeting specific germline genes, in attempt to guide antibodies’ mature of specific molecular features intended for the targeted epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. The question remains whether particular germline genes and lineages are privileged for successful maturation as membrane-targeting (or MPER-targeting) antibodies. This notion is supported by 4E10 and PGZL1 sharing a germline gene (VH1-69)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and nearly identical membrane interactions. Certain germlines genes may be predisposed with inherent basal membrane affinity or be favored precursor scaffolds for compatibility with evolution of lipid-binding properties. Specific CDR lipid-binding motifs are predicted to be encoded early in maturation processes for PGZL1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, namely the CDR-H1 loop, and complemented by mutations at membrane-contacting FR-H3 and CDR-H3 loop residues incorporated later in maturation <bold>(Figure 7-figure supplement 1C)</bold>. Across MPER bnAbs, membrane-binding molecular features are likely acquired at strategic timepoints throughout development to balance poly-specificity and evade autoimmune checkpoints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. Experimental databases of germlines genes usage and of B-cell repertoires sequenced during immunization courses would be ideally paired with the simulations described here to investigate <italic>in vivo</italic> filtering of lineages with lipid-binding variants and assess possible rules of the autoimmune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Beyond gp41-targeting antibodies and lipid antibodies in autoinflammatory diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup> or microbial infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>, we suspect a broader scope of positive outcomes from antibody tolerance and interaction with lipid bilayers may occur in Nature thus is currently underestimated and underutilized. Although host cross-specificity of 4E10 is well documented, the vastly reduced poly-reactivity of PGZL1 and 10E8 inspires optimism that maturation of phospholipid interactions and membrane tolerance may be incorporated into strategies for vaccine design and therapeutic antibodies for other membrane proteins with conserved buried epitopes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. Currently, the breadth of analogous antibodies targeting membrane proteins via extensive or cooperative lipid interactions is poorly explored. The simulation procedures and principles described here are well positioned to investigate this outstanding question and could help define broader chemical rules for design of membrane-interfacing antibodies.</p>

<p>Previous experimental studies demonstrated that membrane association drives avidity for several potent broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies and its loss dramatically reduces neutralization. In this study, the authors present a tour de force analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that demonstrate how several HIV-neutralizing membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-targeting antibodies associate with a model lipid bilayer.</p>
<p>First, the authors compared how three MPER antibodies, 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, associated with model membranes, constructed with two lipid compositions similar to native viral membranes. They found that the related antibodies 4E10 and PGZL1 strongly associate with a phospholipid near heavy chain loop 1, consistent with prior crystallographic studies. They also discovered that a previously unappreciated framework region between loops 2-3 in the 4E10/PGZL1 heavy chain contributes to membrane association. Simulations of 10E8, an antibody from a different lineage, revealed several differences from published X-ray structures. Namely, a phosphatidylcholine binding site was offset and includes significant interaction with a nearby framework region. The revised manuscript demonstrates that these lipid interactions are robust to alterations in membrane composition and rigidity. However, it does not address the reverse-that phospholipids known experimentally not to associate with these antibodies (if any such lipids exist) also fail to interact in MD simulations.</p>
<p>Next, the authors simulate another MPER-targeting antibody, LN01, with a model HIV membrane either containing or missing an MPER antigen fragment within. Of note, LN01 inserts more deeply into the membrane when the MPER antigen is present, supporting an energy balance between the lowest energy conformations of LN01, MPER, and the complex. These simulations recapitulate lipid binding interactions solved in published crystallographic studies but also lead to the discovery of a novel lipid binding site the authors term the &quot;Loading Site&quot;, which could guide future experiments with this antibody.</p>
<p>The authors next established course-grained (CG) MD simulations of the various antibodies with model membranes to study membrane embedding. These simulations facilitated greater sampling of different initial antibody geometries relative to membrane. These CG simulations , which cannot resolve atomistic interactions, are nonetheless compelling because negative controls (ab 13h11, BSA) that should not associate with membrane indeed sample significantly less membrane.</p>
<p>Distinct geometries derived from CG simulations were then used to initialize all-atom MD simulations to study insertion in finer detail (e.g., phospholipid association), which largely recapitulate their earlier results, albeit with more unbiased sampling. The multiscale model of an initial CG study with broad geometric sampling, followed by all-atom MD, provides a generalized framework for such simulations.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors construct velocity pulling simulations to estimate the energetics of antibody membrane embedding. Using the multiscale modelling workflow to achieve greater geometric sampling, they demonstrate that their model reliably predicts lower association energetics for known mutations in 4E10 that disrupt lipid binding. However, the model does have limitations: namely, its ability to predict more subtle changes along a lineage-intermediate mutations that reduce lipid binding are indistinguishable from mutations that completely ablate lipid association. Thus, while large/binary differences in lipid affinity might be predictable, the use of this method as a generative model are likely more limited.</p>
<p>The MD simulations conducted throughout are rigorous and the analysis are extensive, creative, and biologically inspired. Overall, these analyses provide an important mechanistic characterization of how broadly neutralizing antibodies associate with lipids proximal to membrane-associated epitopes to drive neutralization.</p>

<p>In this study, Maillie et al. have carried out a set of multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the viral membrane and four broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope trimer. The simulation recapitulated in several cases the binding sites of lipid head groups that were observed experimentally by X-ray crystallography, as well as some new binding sites. These binding sites were further validated using a structural bioinformatics approach.

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the current reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Previous experimental studies demonstrated that membrane association drives avidity for several potent broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies and its loss dramatically reduces neutralization. In this study, the authors present a tour de force analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that demonstrate how several HIV-neutralizing membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-targeting antibodies associate with a model lipid bilayer.</p>
<p>First, the authors compared how three MPER antibodies, 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, associated with model membranes, constructed with two lipid compositions similar to native viral membranes. They found that the related antibodies 4E10 and PGZL1 strongly associate with a phospholipid near heavy chain loop 1, consistent with prior crystallographic studies. They also discovered that a previously unappreciated framework region between loops 2-3 in the 4E10/PGZL1 heavy chain contributes to membrane association. Simulations of 10E8, an antibody from a different lineage, revealed several differences from published X-ray structures. Namely, a phosphatidylcholine binding site was offset and includes significant interaction with a nearby framework region. The revised manuscript demonstrates that these lipid interactions are robust to alterations in membrane composition and rigidity. However, it does not address the reverse-that phospholipids known experimentally not to associate with these antibodies (if any such lipids exist) also fail to interact in MD simulations.</p>
<p>Next, the authors simulate another MPER-targeting antibody, LN01, with a model HIV membrane either containing or missing an MPER antigen fragment within. Of note, LN01 inserts more deeply into the membrane when the MPER antigen is present, supporting an energy balance between the lowest energy conformations of LN01, MPER, and the complex. These simulations recapitulate lipid binding interactions solved in published crystallographic studies but also lead to the discovery of a novel lipid binding site the authors term the &quot;Loading Site&quot;, which could guide future experiments with this antibody.</p>
<p>The authors next established course-grained (CG) MD simulations of the various antibodies with model membranes to study membrane embedding. These simulations facilitated greater sampling of different initial antibody geometries relative to membrane. These CG simulations , which cannot resolve atomistic interactions, are nonetheless compelling because negative controls (ab 13h11, BSA) that should not associate with membrane indeed sample significantly less membrane.</p>
<p>Distinct geometries derived from CG simulations were then used to initialize all-atom MD simulations to study insertion in finer detail (e.g., phospholipid association), which largely recapitulate their earlier results, albeit with more unbiased sampling. The multiscale model of an initial CG study with broad geometric sampling, followed by all-atom MD, provides a generalized framework for such simulations.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors construct velocity pulling simulations to estimate the energetics of antibody membrane embedding. Using the multiscale modelling workflow to achieve greater geometric sampling, they demonstrate that their model reliably predicts lower association energetics for known mutations in 4E10 that disrupt lipid binding. However, the model does have limitations: namely, its ability to predict more subtle changes along a lineage-intermediate mutations that reduce lipid binding are indistinguishable from mutations that completely ablate lipid association. Thus, while large/binary differences in lipid affinity might be predictable, the use of this method as a generative model are likely more limited.</p>
<p>The MD simulations conducted throughout are rigorous and the analysis are extensive, creative, and biologically inspired. Overall, these analyses provide an important mechanistic characterization of how broadly neutralizing antibodies associate with lipids proximal to membrane-associated epitopes to drive neutralization.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Maillie et al. have carried out a set of multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the viral membrane and four broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope trimer. The simulation recapitulated in several cases the binding sites of lipid head groups that were observed experimentally by X-ray crystallography, as well as some new binding sites. These binding sites were further validated using a structural bioinformatics approach. Finally, steered molecular dynamics was used to measure the binding strength between the membrane and variants of the 4E10 and PGZL1 antibodies.</p>
<p>The use of multiscale MD simulations allows for a detailed exploration of the system at different time and length scales. The combination of MD simulations and structural bioinformatics provides a comprehensive approach to validate the identified binding sites. Finally, the steered MD simulations offer quantitative insights into the binding strength between the membrane and bnAbs.</p>
<p>While the simulations and analyses provide qualitative insights into the binding interactions, they do not offer a quantitative assessment of energetics. The coarse-grained simulations exhibit artifacts and thus require careful analysis.</p>
<p>This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying bnAb recognition of the HIV-1 envelope. The insights gained from this work could inform the design of more potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies.</p>
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p>
<p>We recommend the authors remove the figure and section related to bnAb LN01, perform additional analysis (e.g., further expanding on the differences in antibody binding in the presence or absence of antigen), and present this as a separate manuscript in a follow-up study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We consider the analysis of a bnAb with a transmembrane antigen and of LN01 as essential to the manuscript and novel results.  Study of LN01 provides many insights unique from the other MPER bnAbs in this study.  We agree further characterization of LN01 and bnAbs with transmembrane antigen or full-length Env are intriguing and necessary to complete the full mechanistic understanding of lipid-associated antibodies.  LN01 section in this paper is novel in the field and demonstrates the preliminary evidence motivating further work, which we agree are beyond the scope of this already long detailed study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>I appreciate the degree to which the authors responded to my previous points raised in the private review, including edits where I might have missed something in the manuscript or relevant literature. I imagine such a point-by-point response was quite onerous. Thank you also for balancing presentation/clarity with content/rigor considering the large information content of this manuscript; in silico results are inherently hard to present given the delicate balance between rigorous validation and novel information content. I apologize if I repeat points raised and addressed previously and commend the authors on their revised study, which is much improved in clarity; any additional revisions are of course entirely at your discretion.</p>
<p>&quot;...now having more diversity in lipid headgroup chemistries&quot; references the wrong figure-it should be: Figure 2-figure supplement 2A-C. The incorrect figure is also referenced again several sentences down: &quot;...relevant CDR and framework surface loops...&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this error. We have corrected figure references.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;One shared conformational difference observed for these bnAbs the higher cholesterol bilayers was slightly more extensive and broader interaction profiles as well as modestly deeper embedding of the relevant CDR and framework surfaces loops&quot; please rephrase</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion.  We rephrased this for improved clarity and flow.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;These results bolster the feasibility for using all-atom MD as an in silico platform to explore differential phospholipid affinity at these sites (i.e., specificity studies) and influence on antibody preferred conformation as membrane composition and lipid chemistry are systematically varied&quot; Please tone down these speculations-you have demonstrated that simulations are robust to different headgroup chemistries but have not provided evidence for the exclusion of lipids that are known not to associate with these antibodies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We rephrased this speculation to highlight the potential of this application. We also emphasize future studies that would be required to achieve this application in the following sentence.</p>
<p>“These results motivate use of all-atom MD as an in silico approach for exploring differential phospholipid affinity at these sites…”</p>

<p>I am not sure how relevant this might be to the claims of Figure 2-figure supplement 3, but AlphaFold3-based phospholigand docking might provide an additional orthogonal approach if relevant ligand(s) are available for such analysis (particularly for the newly proposed 10E8 POPC complex).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for this suggestion.  AI/ML based prediction methods like AF3 and RoseTTAFold All-Atom (RFAA) are interesting new methods that have come since our initial submission.   We’ve decided these experiments are beyond the scope of this already long and detailed study. We have added a sentence suggesting use of these methods in future work.</p>
<p>&quot;We next studied bnAb LN01 to interrogate differences&quot; --&gt; this transition still reads a bit unclear. Why shift gears and change antibodies? Also, while you do go into its interactions both +/- antigen, there's no lead into the simulation initialization with and without antigen to guide the reader into the comparisons you will draw in the figure. Also, the order of information presentation is a bit strange, where the rationale for choosing a single monomeric helix is brought up in the middle of the paragraph instead of at the beginning of the section. In the next paragraph, it goes back to the initialization of the membrane composition again, which feels a bit disorganized-I do appreciate the unique challenge of having to weave through so much quality data! In fact, if you were to conduct simulations of membrane + antigen vs. membrane + LN01 vs. membrane + LN01 + antigen, I am tempted to say that this could be removed from this manuscript and flow better as a paper in and of itself.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to improve the writing style.  We feel this section adds a lot of value to the manuscript, so we will keep it in the paper and improved the transition as well as rationale.</p>
<p>We selected to study the additional antibody LN01 and the monomeric MPER-TM antigen conformation because of the existing structural evidence available without additional creative model building.  This rationale has been updated in the new text.</p>
<p>We changd the order of information as suggested, moving the rationale for antigen fragment earlier in the paragraph followed by the background of the lipids sites from the crystal that can lead into simulation set-up.  We clarified the simulation initialization was similar for systems with and without antigen in the opening sentence of the paragraph</p>

<p>The discussion reads very well. Is it possible to direct antibody maturation, even in an engineered context, towards membrane affinity without increasing immunogenic polyreactivity? This is mentioned very briefly and cited with ref 36, but I would be interested in the author's thoughts on this topic.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful idea to explore in future work.  Our conclusion alludes to possibly artificially evolving membrane affinity studied by MD, as done <italic>in vitro</italic> by Nieva and co-workers.  Because the hypothetical nature, we’ve chosen not to elaborate on those ideas from this manuscript.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Previous experimental studies demonstrated that membrane association drives avidity for several potent broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies and its loss dramatically reduces neutralization. In this study, the authors present a tour de force analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that demonstrate how several HIV-neutralizing membrane-proximal external region (MPER)-targeting antibodies associate with a model lipid bilayer.</p>
<p>First, the authors compared how three MPER antibodies, 4E10, PGZL1, and 10E8, associated with model membranes, constructed with a lipid composition similar to the native virion. They found that the related antibodies 4E10 and PGZL1 strongly associate with a phospholipid near heavy chain loop 1, consistent with prior crystallographic studies. They also discovered that a previously unappreciated framework region between loops 2-3 in the 4E10/PGZL1 heavy chain contributes to membrane association. Simulations of 10E8, an antibody from a different lineage, revealed several differences from published X-ray structures. Namely, a phosphatidylcholine binding site was offset and includes significant interaction with a nearby framework region.</p>
<p>Next, the authors simulate another MPER-targeting antibody, LN01, with a model HIV membrane either containing or missing an MPER antigen fragment within. Of note, LN01 inserts more deeply into the membrane when the MPER antigen is present, supporting an energy balance between the lowest energy conformations of LN01, MPER, and the complex. Additional contacts and conformational restraints imposed by ectodomain regions of the envelope glycoprotein, however, remain unaddressed-the size of such simulations likely runs into technical limitations including sampling and compute time.</p>
<p>The authors next established course-grained (CG) MD simulations of the various antibodies with model membranes to study membrane embedding. These simulations facilitated greater sampling of different initial antibody geometries relative to membrane. Distinct geometries derived from CG simulations were then used to initialize all-atom MD simulations to study insertion in finer detail (e.g., phospholipid association), which largely recapitulate their earlier results, albeit with more unbiased sampling. The multiscale model of an initial CG study with broad geometric sampling, followed by all-atom MD, provides a generalized framework for such simulations.</p>
<p>Finally, the authors construct velocity pulling simulations to estimate the energetics of antibody membrane embedding.

Thus, while large/binary differences in lipid affinity might be predictable, the use of this method as a generative model are likely more limited.</p>
<p>The MD simulations conducted throughout are rigorous and the analysis are extensive. However, given the large amount of data presented within the manuscript, the text would benefit from clearer subsections that delineate discrete mechanistic discoveries, particularly for experimentalists interested in antibody discovery and design. One area the paper does not address involves the polyreactivity associated with membrane binding antibodies-MD simulations and/or pulling velocity experiments with model membranes of different compositions, with and without model antigens, would be needed. Finally, given the challenges in initializing these simulations and their limitations, the text regarding their generalized use for discovery, rather than mechanism, could be toned down.</p>
<p>Overall, these analyses provide an important mechanistic characterization of how broadly neutralizing antibodies associate with lipids proximal to membrane-associated epitopes to drive neutralization.</p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this study, Maillie et al. have carried out a set of multiscale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between the viral membrane and four broadly neutralizing antibodies that target the membrane proximal exposed region (MPER) of the HIV-1 envelope trimer. The simulation recapitulated in several cases the binding sites of lipid head groups that were observed experimentally by X-ray crystallography, as well as some new binding sites. These binding sites were further validated using a structural bioinformatics approach. Finally, steered molecular dynamics was used to measure the binding strength between the membrane and variants of the 4E10 and PGZL1 antibodies.</p>
<p>The conclusions from the paper are mostly well supported by the simulations, however, they remain very descriptive and the key findings should be better described and validated. In particular:</p>
<p>It has been shown that the lipid composition of HIV membrane is rich in cholesterol [1], which accounts for almost 50% molar ratio. The authors use a very different composition and should therefore provide a reference. It has been shown for 4E10 that the change in lipid composition affects dynamics of the binding. The robustness of the results to changes of the lipid composition should also be reported.</p>
<p>The real advantage of the multiscale approach (coarse grained (CG) simulation followed by a back-mapped all atom simulation) remains unclear. In most cases, the binding mode in the CG simulations seem to be an artifact.</p>
<p>The results reported in this study should be better compared to available experimental data. For example how does the approach angle compare to cryo-EM structure of the bnAbs engaging with the MPER region, e.g. [2-3]? How do these results from this study compare to previous molecular dynamics studies, e.g.[4-5]?</p>

<p>Considering reviewer suggestions, we slightly reorganized the results section into specific sub-sections with headings and changed the order in which key results were presented to allow the subsequent analysis more accessible for readers.  Supplemental materials were redistributed into eLife format, having each supplemental item grouped to a corresponding main figure. Many slightly detail modifications were made to figures (mostly supplemental items) without changing their character, such as clearer axes labels or revised annotations within panels.</p>
<p>The major additions within the results sections based on the reviews were:</p>
<p>(1) An expanded the comparison between our simulation analyses to previous simulations and to existing cryo-EM structural evidence for MPER antibodies’ membrane orientation the context of full-length antigen, resulting in new supplemental figure panels.</p>
<p>(2) New atomistic simulations of 10E8, PGZL1, and 4E10 evaluating the phospholipid binding predictions in a different lipid composition more closely modeling HIV membranes.</p>
<p>Minor edits to the analyses and interpretations include:</p>
<p>(1) Outlining the geometric components contributing to variance in substates after clustering the atomistic 10E8, 4E10, and PGZL1 simulations.</p>
<p>(2) Better defining the variance and durability of membrane interactions within and across systems in the coarse grain methods section.</p>
<p>(3) Removed interpretations in the original results sections regarding polyreactivity and energetics for MPER bnAbs that were not explicitly supported by data.</p>
<p>(4) More context of the prevenance of bnAb loop geometries in structural informatics section</p>
<p>(5) Rationale for the choice of the continuous helix MPER-TM conformation in LN01-antigen conformations, and citations to previous gp41 TM simulations.</p>
<p>(6) Removed language on the novelty of the coarse grain and steered pulling simulations as newly developed approaches; tempering the potential discriminating power and applications of those approaches, in light of their limitations.</p>
<p>The discussion was revised to provide more novel context of the results within the field, including discussing direct relevance of the simulation methods for evaluating immune tolerance mechanisms and into antibody engineering.   We have shared custom scripts used for molecular dynamics analysis on github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cmaillie98/mper_bnAbs.git">https://github.com/cmaillie98/mper_bnAbs.git</ext-link>) and uploaded trajectories to a public repository hosted on Zenodo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zenodo.org/records/13830877">https://zenodo.org/records/13830877</ext-link>).</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>Below, I provide an extensive list of minor edits associated with the text and figures for the authors to consider. I provide these with the hope of increasing the accessibility of the manuscript to broader audiences but leave changes to the discretion of the authors.</p>
<p>Text/clarity</p>
<p>Figure 1 main text</p>
<p>The main text discussing Figure 1 is disorganized, making the analysis difficult to follow. I would suggest the following: moving the sentence, &quot;4E10 and PG2L1 are structurally homologous&quot; immediately after the paragraph discussing the simulation initiation. Then, add a sentence that directly compares their experimental affinity, neutralization, and polyreactivity of 4E10 and PG2L1 (later, an unintroduced idea pops up, &quot;These patterns may in part explain 4E10's greater polyreactivity&quot;). Next, lead into the discussion of the MD simulation data with something to the effect of: &quot;Given these similarities, we first compared mechanisms of membrane insertion between 4E10 and PG2L1 to bolster confidence in our predictions&quot;. Later, the sentence &quot;Across 4E10 and PGZL1 simulations, the bound lipid phosphates&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and we have restructured the beginning of the results to implement this style: to first introduce then discuss the comparative PGZL1 &amp; 4E10 results, i.e. Figure 1 plus associated supplements.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the background and the introduction text leading up to Figure 1, CDR-H3 is discussed at length, however, the first figure focuses almost entirely on how CDR-H1 coordinates a lipid phosphate headgroup. Are there experimental mutations in this loop that do not affect affinity (e.g., to a soluble gp41 peptide), but do affect neutralization (like the WAWA mutation for CDR-H3, discussed later)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have altered the Introduction (para 2) and Results (4E10/PGZL1 sub-section) to give more balanced discussion of CDRs H1 &amp; H3.  That includes referencing experimental data addressing the reviewer’s question; a PGZL1 clone H4K3 where mutations to CDRH1 were introduced and shown have minimal impact on affinity to MPER peptide via ELISA and BLI, but those mutant bnAbs had significantly reduced neutralization efficacy (PMC6879610).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The sentence &quot;These phospholipid binding events were highly stable, typically persisting for hundreds of nanoseconds&quot; should be moved down to immediately precede, &quot;[However], in a PGZL1 simulation, we observed a&quot;. This would be a good place for a paragraph break following, &quot;Thus, these bnABs constitutively&quot;, since this block of text is very long.</p>
<p>Similarly, the sentence and parts of the section, &quot;Likewise, the interactions coordinating the lipid phosphate oxygens at CDR-H1&quot; more appropriately belongs immediately before or after the sentence, &quot;Our simulations uncover the CDR-lipid interactions that are the most feasible&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the detailed guidance in reorganizing the Figure 1 results.  We followed the advice to directly compare 4E10 and PGZL1 results separately from 10E8, moving those sections of text appropriately.  New paragraph breaks were added to improve accessibility and flow of concepts throughout the Results.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the sentence, &quot;our simulations uncover CDR-lipid interactions that are the most feasible and biologically relevant in the context of a full [HIV] lipid bilayer... validation to which of the many possible ions&quot; à have you confidently determined lipid binding and positioning outside of the site validated in figure 1? Which site(s) are these referencing? The next two sentences then introduce two new ideas on the loop backbone stability then lead into lipid exchange, which is a bit jarring.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have adjusted the language concerning the putative ions/lipids electron density across the many PGZL1 and 4E10 crystal structures, and additionally make the explicit point that we confidently determined the lack of lipid binding outside of the site focused on in Figure 1.</p>
<p>“… both bnAbs showed strong hotspots for a lipid phosphate bound within the CDR-H1 loops, with minimal phospholipid or cholesterol ordering around the proteins elsewhere.  The simulated lipid phosphates bound within CDR-H1 have exceptional overlap with electron densities and atomic details of modelled headgroups from respective lipid-soaked co-crystal structures…”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure 2 main text</p>
<p>&quot;We similarly investigated bnAb 10E8&quot; - Please make this a separate subheader, the block text is very long up to this point.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for the suggestion. We introduced a sub-header to separate work on 10E8 all-atom simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;we observed a POPC complexed with... modelled as headgroup phosphoglycerol anions...&quot; - please cite the references within the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing out this missing reference, we added the appropriate reference.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;One striking and novel observation&quot; - please remove the phrase &quot;striking&quot; throughout, for following best practices in scientific writing (PMC10212555)-this is generally well-done throughout.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed “striking” from our text per your suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>&quot;This CDR-L1 site highlights... (&gt;500 fold) across HIV strains&quot; - How much do R29 and Y32 also contribute to antigen binding and the conformation of this loop? These mutants also decreased Kd by approximately 20X, and based on the co-crystal structure with the TM antigen (PDB: 4XCC), seem to play a more direct role in antigen contact. Additionally, these residues should be highlighted on a figure, otherwise it's difficult to understand why they are important for membrane association.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for deep engagement to these supporting experimental details.  The R29A+Y32A 10E8 mutant referenced in the text showed only 4-fold Kd increase, a modest change for an SPR binding experiment.  Whereas R29E+Y32E 10E8 mutant resulted in 40x Kd increase, the “20x” the reviewer refers to.  Both 10E8 mutants showed similar drastically reduced breadth and potency of over 2 orders of magnitude on average.</p>
<p>These mutated CDR-L1 residues are not directly involved in antigen contact and adopt the same loop helix conformation when antigen is bound.  A minor impact on antigen binding affinity could be due altering pre-organization of CDR loops upon losing interactions from the Tyr &amp; Arg sidechains - particularly Tyr31 in contact with CDR-H3.</p>

<p>&quot;Structural searches querying... identified between 10^5 and 2*10^6...&quot; - why is this value represented as such a large range? Does this depend on the parameters used for analysis? Please clarify.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewers comment to contextualize the range and relative frequency of the bnAb loop conformations.   RMSD and length of loop are the key parameters, which can be controlled by searching reference loops of similar length.  The main point of the backbone-level searching is simply to imply the bnAb loops are not particularly rare when comparing loops of similar length.</p>
<p>We did as was suggested and added comparison to random loops of the same length to the main text, including a new Supplementary Table 4.</p>
<p>“…identified between 105 to 2∙106 geometrically similar sub-segments within natural proteins (&lt;2 Å RMSD)40, reflecting they are relatively prevalent (not rare) in the protein universe, comparing well with frequency of other surface loops of similar length in antibodies (Supplementary Table 3).”</p>

<p>&quot;We next examined the geometries&quot; could start after its own new subheading. Moreover, while there's an emphasis on tilt for neutralization, there is not a figure clearly modelling the proposed Env tilt compared to the relatively planar bilayer. It would be helpful to have an additional panel somewhere that shows the orientation of the antibody (e.g., a representative pose) in the simulations relative to an appropriately curved membrane, Env, the binding conformation of the antibody to Env, and apo Env, given the tilting observed in PMID: 32348769 and theorized in PMC5338832. What additional conformational changes or tilting need to occur between the antibodies and Env to accomplish binding to their respective epitopes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for outlining an interesting element to consider in our analysis of a multi-step binding mechanism for MPER antibodies. We added additional figure panels in the supplement to outline the similarities and differences between our simulations and Fabs with the inferred membranes in cryo-EM experiments of full-length HIV Env.  The simulated Fabs’ angles are very similar with only minor tilting to match the cryo-EM antibody-membrane geometries.</p>
<p>We added Figure 1-figure supplement 1A &amp; Figure 2-figure supplement 2A, and alter to text to reflect this:</p>
<p>“The primary difference is Env-bound Fabs in cryo-EM adopt slightly more shallow approach angles (~15_°_) relative to the bilayer normal.  The simulated bnAbs in isolation prefer orientations slightly more upright, but presenting CDRs at approximately the same depth and orientation.  Thus, these bnAbs appear pre-disposed in their membrane surface conformations, needing only a minor tilt to form the membrane-antibody-antigen neutralization complex.”</p>
<p>Env tilt dynamics and membrane curvature of natural virions may reconcile some of these differences.  Recent in situ tomography of Full-length Env in pseudo-virions corroborates our approximation of flat bilayers over the short length scales around Env.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The sentence &quot;we next examined the geometries&quot; mentions &quot;potential energy cost, if any, for reorienting...&quot;.

<p>As the reviewer highlights, the unbiased simulations and our analysis do not explicitly evaluate energetics.  We removed this phrase, and now only allude to the minimal energy barrier between the similar geometric conformations, relative to the tilting &amp; access requirements for antigen binding mechanism.</p>

<p>Please comment on the significance of how global clustering (Fig. S5A-C) was similar for 4E10 and PGZL1, but different for 10E8 (e.g., blue, orange, and yellow clusters for 4E10 and PHZL1 versus cyan, red, and green clusters for 10E8). As the cyan cluster seems to be much closer in Euclidian space to the 4E10/PGZL1 clusters, it might warrant additional analysis. What do these clusters represent in terms of structure/conformation? How do these clusters differ in membrane insertion as in (A)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful you identify analysis in the geometric clustering section that may be of interest to other readers. We have added additional supplementary table (Table 2) to detail the CDR loop membrane insertion and global Fab angles which describe each cluster, to demonstrate their similarities and differences.  We also better describe how global clustering was similar for 4E10 and PGZL1, but different for 10E8 in the relevant results section</p>

The cyan cluster is not close in structure to 4E10/PGZL1 clusters.  We note the original figure panel had an error.  The updated Figure 2-supplement 4B shows the correct Euclidian distance hierarchy with an early split between 4e10/pgzl1 and 10e8 clusters.</p>

<p>The procedure was the same for predicting an initial membrane insertion, albeit now we use the LN01-TM complex and the calculation will account for the membrane burial of the the TM domain and MPER fragment.  As mentioned, LN01 is predicted as inserted with CDR loops insert similarly with or without the TM-MPER fragment.  The geometry differs from PGZL1/4E10 and 10E8, denoted by the text.</p>

<p>Please comment on the oligomerization state of the antigen used in the MD simulation: how does the simulation differ from a crossed MPER as observed in an MPER antibody-bound Env cryo-EM structure (PMID: 32348769), a three-helix bundle (PMC7210310), or single transmembrane helix (PMC6121722)? How does the model MPER monomer embed in the membrane compared to simulations with a trimeric MPER (PMC6035291, PMID: 33882664)-namely, key arginine residues such as R696?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out critical underlying rationale for modeling this TM-MPER-LN01 complex which we have corrected in the revised draft. The range of potential conformations and display of MPER based on TM domain organization could easily be its own paper – we in fact have a manuscript in preparation on the topic.</p>
<p>The updated text expands the rationale for choosing the monomeric uninterrupted helix form of the MPER-TM model antigen (para 1 of LN01 section). The alternative conformations we did not to explore are called out, with references provided by the reviewer.</p>
<p>The discussion qualified that the MPER presentation is likely oversimplified here, noting MPER display in the full-length Env trimer will vary in different conformational states or membrane environments. However, the only cryo-EM structures of full-length ENV with TM domains resolved have this continuous helix MPER-TM conformation – seen both within crossing TM dimers or dissociated TM monomers.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Are there additional analyses that can validate the dynamics of the MPER monomer in the membrane and relative to LN01? Such as key contacts you would expect to maintain over the duration of the MD simulation?</p>

<p>We also increased description of this TM domain’s behavior, dynamics (tilt, orientation, Arg696 snorkeling, and complex w LN01) to provide a clearer picture of the simulation results – which aligns with past MD of the gp41 TM domain as a monomer (para 2 of LN01 section).  As well, we noted key LN01-MPER contacts that were maintained.</p>

This analysis could look at conformations immediately preceding association and dissociation to give clues as to what orientation(s) favor each state.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for suggesting this interesting analysis.  Clustering analysis of associated states are presented in Figure 5, Figure 5-Figure Supplement 1, and Figure 6, which show all CDR and framework loop directed insertion.  This feature is currently described in the main text.</p>
<p>We did not find strong correlation of specific orientations as “pre-dissociation” states or ineffective non-inserting “scanning” events.  We revised the key sentence to reflect the major take away – that non-CDR alternative conformations did not insert and most of those having CDRs inserted in a different manner than all-atom simulations also were prone to dissociate:</p>
<p>“Given that non-CDR directed and alternative CDR-embedded orientations readily dissociate, we conclude that course-grained models can distinguish unfavorable and favorable membrane-bound conformations to an extent that provides utility for characterizing antibody-bilayer interaction mechanisms.”</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We have added the details for 13h11 and the requested analysis (average aggregated time +/- standard deviation and average time per association event +- standard deviation) to supplement our summary statistics for this method.</p>

<p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</p>
<p>(1) The structure of the manuscript should be improved. For example, almost half of the introduction (three paragraphs) summarize the results. I found it hard to navigate all the data and specific interactions described in the result section. Furthermore, the claims at the end of several sections seem unsupported. Especially for the generalization of the approach. This should be moved to the discussion section. The discussion is pretty general and does not provide much context to the results presented in this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have significantly reorganized the results section to improve the flow of the manuscript and accessibility for readers, especially the first sections of all-atom simulations. We also removed claims not directly supported by data from our results, and expanded on some of these concepts in the discussion to make some more novel context to the result.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The author should cite more rigorously previous work and refrain from using the term &quot;develop&quot; to describe the simple use of a well established method. E.g. Several studies have investigated membrane protein interactions e.g. [1], membrane protein-bilayer self-assembly [2], steered molecular dynamics [3], etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for identifying relevant work for the simulations that set precedent for our novel application to antibody-membrane interactions.  We have removed language about development of simulation methods from the text and now better reference the precedent simulation methods used here.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Have the authors considered estimating the PMF by combining the steered MD simulation through the application of Jarzynski's equality?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We performed from preliminary PMFs for Fab-membrane binding, but saw it was taking upward of 40 us to reach convergence.  Steered simulations focus on a key lipid may be easier.</p>
<p>Although PMFs are beyond the scope of this work, we added proposals &amp; allusion to their utility as the next steps for more rigorous quantification of fab-membrane interactions.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Minor</p>
<p>(4) The term &quot;integrative modeling&quot; is usually used for computational pipelines which incorporate experimental data. Multiscale modeling would be more appropriate for this study.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We altered descriptions throughout the manuscript to reflect this comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Units to report the force in the steered molecular dynamics are incorrect. They should be 98.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We changed axes and results to correctly report this unit.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Labels for axes of several graphs are not missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added labels to all axes of graphs, except for a few where stacked labels can be easily interpreted to save space and reduce complexity in figures.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Figure 3 K &amp; L is this really &lt; 1% of total? The term &quot;total&quot; should also be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for pointing this out, we changed the % labels to be correct with axes from 0-100%. We clarified total in the figure caption.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The font size in figures should be uniformized.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This suggestion has been applied</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) Time needed for steered MD should be reported in CPUh and not hours (page 17).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We removed comments on explicit time measurements for our simulations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) Version of Martini force field is missing in methods section</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We used Martini 2.6 and added this to the methods.</p>
