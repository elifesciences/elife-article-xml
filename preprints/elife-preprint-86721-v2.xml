<title>Summary</title>
<p>5-Methylcytosine (5mC) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are broadly conserved in eukaryotes but are also frequently lost during evolution. The mammalian SNF2 family ATPase HELLS and its plant ortholog DDM1 are critical for the maintenance of 5mC. Mutations in HELLS, its activator subunit CDCA7, and the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B, cause immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with the loss of DNA methylation. We here examine the coevolution of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs. While DNMT3, the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, HELLS, and CDCA7 are all highly conserved in vertebrates and green plants, they are frequently co-lost in other evolutionary clades. The presence-absence patterns of these genes are not random; almost all CDCA7 harboring eukaryote species also have HELLS and DNMT1 (or another maintenance methyltransferase, DNMT5), whereas species that maintain DNMT1 or HELLS without CDCA7 are identified in several clades, such as Fungi and Ecdysozoa. Coevolution of presence-absence patterns (CoPAP) analysis in Ecdysozoa further indicates coevolutionary linkages among CDCA7, HELLS, DNMT1 and its activator UHRF1. We hypothesize that CDCA7 becomes dispensable in species that lost HELLS or DNA methylation, and/or the loss of CDCA7 triggers the replacement of DNA methylation by other chromatin regulation mechanisms. Our study suggests that a unique specialized role of CDCA7 in HELLS-dependent DNA methylation maintenance is broadly inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>DNA methylation, particularly 5-methylcytosine (5mC) at CpG sequences, is widely conserved in eukaryotes. Along with its role in silencing transposable elements and suppressing aberrant intragenic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Choi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Deniz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Neri et al., 2017</xref>), DNA methylation plays critical roles in developmental control, genome stability and the development of diseases such as cancers and immunodeficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Greenberg and Bourc’his, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Lyko, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Nishiyama and Nakanishi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Robertson, 2005</xref>). Despite its versatility as an epigenetic control mechanism, DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) are lost in multiple evolutionary lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bewick et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Kyger et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Ponger and Li, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). While the evolutionary preservation and loss of DNMTs and other proteins involved in 5mC metabolism has been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bewick et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">de Mendoza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Engelhardt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Mondo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Mulholland et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Nai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c116">Tirot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>), it remains unclear if there is any common process or event that leads to the loss of DNA methylation systems in certain evolutionary lineages. Since eukaryotic genomes are compacted by nucleosomes, DNA methylation systems must deal with this structural impediment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Felle et al., 2011</xref>). Could the emergence or loss of a specific nucleosome regulator affect the evolution of DNA methylation as an epigenetic mechanism?</p>
<p>DNMTs are largely subdivided into maintenance DNMTs and <italic>de novo</italic> DNMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Lyko, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Ponger and Li, 2005</xref>). Maintenance DNMTs (directly or indirectly) recognize hemimethylated CpGs and restore symmetric methylation at these sites to prevent the passive loss of 5mC upon DNA replication. Conversely, methylation by <italic>de novo</italic> DNMTs does not require methylated DNA templates. In animals, 5mC is maintained during DNA replication by DNMT1 together with UHRF1, which directly recognizes hemimethylated cytosine via the SRA domain and stimulates activity of DNMT1 in a manner dependent on its ubiquitin-ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Nishiyama and Nakanishi, 2021</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> DNA methylation is primarily carried out by DNMT3 in animals, while plants encode the closely related <italic>de novo</italic> methyltransferase DRM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cao et al., 2000</xref>). Some species, such as the fungus <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, lack <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Catania et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). In <italic>C. neoformans</italic>, DNA methylation is maintained by DNMT5, which has a SNF2-family ATPase domain that is critical for its methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Dumesic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>). Although DNMT5 orthologs cannot be found in land plants and animals, their broad existence in Stramenopiles, Chlorophyta and Fungi suggests that DNMT5, perhaps together with DNMT1, coexisted in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>The loss of DNA methylation is a hallmark of immunodeficiency–centromeric instability–facial anomalies (ICF) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder which causes severe immune defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Ehrlich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Ehrlich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c123">Vukic and Daxinger, 2019</xref>). Activated lymphocytes of ICF patients display a characteristic cytogenetic abnormality at the juxtacentromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 1 and 16, where the satellite 2 repetitive element is highly enriched. In about 50 % of ICF patients, classified as ICF1, the disease is caused by mutations in the <italic>de novo</italic> DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Hansen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">Okano et al., 1999</xref>). The rarer genotypes known as ICF2, ICF3 and ICF4, are caused by mutations in ZBTB24, CDCA7, and HELLS (Helicase, Lymphoid Specific, also known as LSH, Lymphoid-Specific Helicase), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">de Greef et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Unoki, 2021</xref>). While hypomethylation at satellite II repeats is common to all ICF genotypes, ICF2-4 patient-derived cells, but not ICF1 patient cells, additionally exhibit hypomethylation at centromeric alpha-satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Jiang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c121">Velasco et al., 2018</xref>). Knock out of ICF genes in human HEK293 cells reproduces the DNA methylation profile observed in patient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Unoki et al., 2019</xref>). In mice, ZBTB24, HELLS and CDCA7, but not DNMT3B, are required for methylation at centromeric minor satellite repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Hardikar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c104">Ren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, although all ICF proteins promote DNA methylation, the ZBTB24-CDCA7-HELLS axis may target additional loci such as alpha satellites for DNA methylation in a DNMT3-independent manner. Indeed, the importance of HELLS in DNA methylation maintenance by DNMT1 has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ming et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c117">Unoki, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c119">Unoki et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>HELLS belongs to one of ∼25 subclasses of the SNF2-like ATPase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). Among these diverse SNF2 family proteins, HELLS appears to have a specialized role in DNA methylation. Reduced genomic DNA methylation was observed in HELLS (LSH) knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Dennis et al., 2001</xref>), transformed mouse fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dunican et al., 2013</xref>), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Myant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c133">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), and zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Dunican et al., 2015</xref>). In fact, this function of HELLS in DNA methylation was originally inferred from studies in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, where mutations in the HELLS ortholog DDM1 (decrease in DNA methylation) cause drastic reduction of 5mC in transposable and repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Miura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Vongs et al., 1993</xref>). Like HELLS, DDM1 is a SNF2 ATPase with demonstrable <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome remodeling activity (Brzeski et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Since DNA methylation defects in <italic>ddm1</italic> mutants can be rescued by the loss of histone H1, it has been proposed that DDM1-mediated remodeling of H1-bound nucleosomes is important for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c134">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>CDCA7 (also known as JPO1) was originally identified as one of eight CDCA genes that exhibited cell division cycle-associated gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c124">Walker, 2001</xref>). A putative 4CXXC zinc finger binding domain (zf-4CXXC_R1) is conserved among CDCA7 homologs, including its paralog CDCA7L (also known as JPO2 and R1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Ou et al., 2006</xref>). Multiple lines of evidence support the idea that CDCA7 functions as a direct activator of the nucleosome remodeling enzyme HELLS. First, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, HELLS and CDCA7e (the sole CDCA7 paralog present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs) both preferentially interact with nucleosomes rather than nucleosome-free DNA, and binding of HELLS to chromatin depends on CDCA7e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Second, HELLS alone exhibits little nucleosome sliding activity, but CDCA7e greatly stimulates it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Third, HELLS directly binds to CDCA7e (as well as CDCA7 and CDCA7L), even in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Fourth, HELLS and CDCA7 interact in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c118">Unoki et al., 2019</xref>), where chromatin binding of HELLS also depends on CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). ICF disease mutations located in the conserved zf-4CXXC_R1 domain (R274C, R274H and R304H in human CDCA7) inhibited chromatin binding of CDCA7 and HELLS without interfering with CDCA7-HELLS interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>), such that the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain likely serves as a chromatin binding module. Therefore, we proposed that CDCA7 and HELLS form a bipartite nucleosome remodeling complex, termed CHIRRC (<underline>C</underline>DCA7-<underline>H</underline>ELLS <underline>I</underline>CF-related nucleosome <underline>r</underline>emodeling <underline>c</underline>omplex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>We previously suggested that ZBTB24, CDCA7, and HELLS form a linear pathway to support DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). ZBTB24 is a transcription factor which binds the promoter region of CDCA7 and is required for its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c129">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). As CDCA7 binds HELLS to form the CHIRRC, we proposed that its ATP-dependent nucleosome sliding activity exposes DNA that was previously wrapped around the histone octamer and makes it accessible for DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, DNMT3A and DNMT3B cannot methylate DNA within a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Felle et al., 2011</xref>), and the importance of HELLS and DDM1 for DNA methylation at nucleosomal DNA has been reported in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Lyons and Zilberman, 2017</xref>). Given the frequent loss of 5mC as an epigenetic mark in multiple evolutionary lineages, it is striking that the role for HELLS/DDM1 in DNA methylation appears to be conserved in evolutionarily distant mammals and plants. Importantly, this would suggest that the promotion of DNA methylation through nucleosome sliding is specific to HELLS and cannot be substituted by other SNF2 family nucleosome remodelers, such as SNF2 (SMARCA2/4), INO80, and ISWI (SMARCA1/5). If the specific function of HELLS and CDCA7 in DNA methylation is indeed derived from the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA), we hypothesize that HELLS and CDCA7 coevolved with other DNA methylation machineries. We here test this hypothesis and discuss the potential sequence of events that led to the loss of DNA methylation in some species.</p>

<title>CDCA7 is absent from the classic model organisms that lack genomic 5mC</title>
<p>CDCA7 is characterized by the unique zf-4CXXC_R1 domain (Pfam PF10497 or Conserved Domain Database [CDD] cl20401) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Mistry et al., 2021</xref>).

Based on the reciprocal best hits (RBH) criterion using human HELLS as a query sequence (see Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c127">Ward and Moreno-Hagelsieb, 2014</xref>), HELLS orthologs were identified in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (DDM1) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Irc5), which is in line with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Litwin et al., 2017</xref>), as well as a putative HELLS ortholog in <italic>B. terrestris</italic>. No clear HELLS orthologs were identified in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, or <italic>S. pombe</italic>. This pilot-scale analysis based on the RBH criterion led us to hypothesize that the evolutionary maintenance of CDCA7 is linked to that of HELLS and DNMTs. In order to statistically validate this hypothesis, we set out to systematically define orthologs of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs in a broad range of evolutionary lineages.</p>

<title>CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates</title>
<p>We first characterized evolutionary conservation of CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates, where 5mC, DNMT1 and DNMT3 are highly conserved. A BLAST search against the Genbank protein database identified two zf-4CXXC_R1 domain-containing proteins, CDCA7/JPO1 and CDCA7L/R1/JPO2, throughout Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). In frogs (such as <italic>Xenopus</italic>, but not all amphibians), and some fishes (such as <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic> and <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), a third paralog CDCA7e exists (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>). CDCA7e is the only CDCA7-like protein that can be detected in <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>), and thus likely represents a form specific to oocytes and early embryos in these species. Among twelve conserved cysteine residues originally reported in the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Ou et al., 2006</xref>), the 12<sup>th</sup> cysteine residue is not conserved in <italic>Rhincodon typus</italic> (whale shark) CDCA7 and in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> CDCA7e. In general, the 12<sup>th</sup> cysteine residue of the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain is least conserved among CDCA7 homologs within and outside of vertebrates, such that we do not consider it a key component of the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain (see below). Considering that the jawless fish <italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic> (sea lamprey) and other invertebrates commonly possess only one CDCA7 family gene (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, and see below), the CDCA7 paralogs may have emerged in jawed vertebrates. Overall, the zf-4CXXC_R1 sequence is highly conserved among vertebrate CDCA7 homologs, including three residues that are mutated in ICF3 patients (R274, G294 and R304 in human CDCA7) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>). Note that these amino acid positions of the ICF3 mutations in human CDCA7 are based on the previously reported sequence of an NP_665809 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c114">Thijssen et al., 2015</xref>), which is annotated as isoform 2 (371 amino acids), whereas we list the isoform 1 (NP_114148) with 450 amino acids in this study (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>While the presence of four CXXC motifs in the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain is reminiscent of a classic zinc finger-CXXC domain (zf-CXXC, Pfam PF02008), which binds to nonmethylated CpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Long et al., 2013</xref>), their cysteine arrangement is distinctly different, perhaps reflecting the capacity of zf-4CXXC_R1 domain to recognize nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>) and potentially specific epigenetic marks or DNA sequences. In vertebrate CDCA7 paralogs, eleven conserved cysteines are arranged as <underline>CXXC</underline>X<sub>10</sub>CX<sub>4</sub>CX<sub>7</sub><underline>CXXC</underline>X<sub>19</sub><underline>CXXC</underline>X<sub>3</sub>CX<underline>CXXC</underline>.

Apart from the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain, vertebrate CDCA7-like proteins often, but not always, contain one or two Lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF)-binding motif(s) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and C</xref>), defined as ([E/D]XEXFXGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Tesina et al., 2015</xref>). It has been reported that human CDCA7L and CDCA7 both interact with c-Myc but apparently via different regions, a leucine zipper and a less-defined adjacent segment that overlaps with a bipartite nuclear localization signal, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Gill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). This leucine zipper sequence is highly conserved among vertebrate CDCA7 family proteins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A and D</xref>). In contrast to zf-CXXC domain-containing proteins such as KDM2A/B, DNMT1, MLL1/2, and TET1/3, the vertebrate CDCA7 proteins do not contain any predicted enzymatic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Maertens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c113">Tesina et al., 2015</xref>).</p>

Class I proteins have one zf-4CXXC_R1 domain with no other detectable domains listed in CDD or Pfam/InterPro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Paysan-Lafosse et al., 2023</xref>). Strikingly, all three ICF-associated residues (R274, G294 and R304 in human CDCA7) as well as all eleven characteristic cysteines of the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain are conserved, with the exception that the position of the fourth cysteine is shifted two residues toward the N terminus. We define the domain with the conservation of the signature cysteine residues and three ICF-associated residues as “class I zf-4CXXC_R1”, and proteins with class I zf-4CXXC_R1 as prototypical CDCA7 orthologs.</p>

<p>Class II proteins contain a zf-4CXXC_R1 domain, a DDT domain and a WHIM1 domain. These proteins were previously identified as DDR1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Dong et al., 2013</xref>). DDT and WHIM1 domains are commonly found in proteins that interact with SNF2h/ISWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aravind and Iyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c132">Yamada et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, it was reported that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> DDR1 and DDR3 interact with the ISWI orthologs CHR11 and CHR17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c112">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Among the eleven cysteine residues in the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain of these proteins, the position of the fourth residue is shifted towards the C-terminus. The ICF-associated glycine residue (G294 in human CDCA7, mutated to valine in ICF3 patients) is replaced by isoleucine. We define the zf-4CXXC_R1 containing a substitution at this glycine residue as class II zf-4CXXC_R1.</p>
<p>Class III proteins are longer (∼1000 amino acid) and contain an N-terminal zf-4CXXC_R1 domain and a C-terminal JmjC domain (Pfam, PF02373), which is predicted to possess demethylase activity against histone H3K9me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Saze et al., 2008</xref>). While all eleven cysteine residues can be identified, there are deletions between the 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> cysteine and 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> cysteine residues. None of the ICF-associated residues are conserved in the class III. One of these class III proteins is IBM1 (increase in bonsai mutation 1), whose mutation causes the dwarf “bonsai” phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Saze et al., 2008</xref>), which is accompanied with increased H3K9me2 and DNA methylation levels at the <italic>BONSAI</italic> (<italic>APC13</italic>) locus. Double mutants of <italic>ddm1</italic> and <italic>ibm1</italic> exacerbate the bonsai phenotype, indicating that DDM1 and IBM1 act independently to regulate DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Saze et al., 2008</xref>). Another class III protein is JMJ24, which harbors a RING finger domain in addition to the 4CXXC and JmjC domains. This RING finger domain promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the DNA methyltransferase CMT3, and thus opposes DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Deng et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Orthologs of these three classes of CDCA7 proteins found in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are widely identified in green plants (Viridiplantae), including Streptophyta (e.g., rice, maize, moss, fern) and Chlorophyta (green algae). Other variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 are also found in Viridiplantae. In contrast to green plants, in which the combined presence of HELLS/DDM1-, CDCA7- and DNMT-orthologs is broadly conserved, no zf-4CXXC_R1-containing proteins can be identified in red algae (Rhodophyta) (Table S1, see <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>

As these proteins do not contain any additional CDD-annotated domain like vertebrate and plant CDCA7 orthologs (except for <italic>Taphrina deformans</italic> CCG81269, which also has a CHROMO domain), we define this fungal protein family as CDCA7F, which forms a distinct clade in our phylogenetic analysis of zf-4CXXC_R1 sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

This composition mimics the plant class III proteins, for which the JmjC domain is located at the C-terminus. Among these proteins, it was suggested that <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> DMM-1 does not directly regulate DNA methylation or demethylation but rather controls the deposition of histone H2A.Z and/or H3K56 acetylation, which inhibit spreading of heterochromatin segments with methylated DNA and H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Honda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>).

<title>Systematic identification of CDCA7 and HELLS homologs in eukaryotes</title>
<p>To systematically identify CDCA7 and HELLS orthologs in the major eukaryotic supergroups, we conducted a BLAST search against the NCBI protein database using human CDCA7 and HELLS protein sequences. To omit species with a high risk of false negative identification, we selected species containing at least 6 distinct proteins with compelling homology to the SNF2 ATPase domain of HELLS, based on the assumption that each eukaryotic species is expected to have 6-20 SNF2 family ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, even the microsporidial pathogen <italic>Encephalitozoon cuniculi</italic>, whose genome size is a mere 2.9 Mb, contains six SNF2 family ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). As such, we generated a panel of 180 species encompassing all major eukaryote supergroups (5 Excavata, 18 SAR [2 Rhizaria, 6 Alveolata, 10 Stramenopiles]), 1 Haptista, 1 Cryptista, 15 Archaeplastida [3 Rhodophyta and 12 Viridiplantae], 4 Amoebozoa, 136 Opisthokonts [34 Fungi, 3 Holozoa, and 99 Metazoa]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1).</p>
<p>HELLS orthologs were initially identified if they satisfied the RBH criterion. To further validate the annotation of HELLS orthologs, a phylogenetic tree was constructed from a multiple sequence alignment of the putative HELLS orthologs alongside other SNF2-family proteins of <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster, S. cerevisiae</italic>, and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. If HELLS orthologs are correctly identified (i.e. without erroneously including orthologs of another SNF2-subfamily) they should cluster together in a single clade. However, the sequence alignment using the full-length protein sequence failed to cluster HELLS and DDM1 in the same clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>). Since HELLS and other SNF2-family proteins have variable insertions within the SNF2 ATPase domain, multiple sequence alignment of the SNF2 domains was then conducted after removing the insertion regions, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>). By this SNF2 domain-only alignment method, all HELLS orthologs formed a clade, separated from CHD1, ISWI, SMARCA2/4, SRCAP, and INO80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). An independent phylogenetic tree construction with a maximum-likelihood based method and 1000 bootstrap replicates confirmed these assignments (see Methods).</p>
<p>A BLAST search with the human CDCA7 sequence across the panel of 180 species identified a variety of proteins containing the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain, which is prevalent in all major supergroups (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>, Table S1). Each of these identified proteins contains only one zf-4CXXC_R1 domain. The resulting list of CDCA7 BLAST hits were further classified as prototypical CDCA7 orthologs if they preserve the criteria of the class I zf-4CXXC_R1 (signature eleven cysteine residues <italic>and</italic> the three ICF-associated residues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). A phylogenetic tree analysis of zf-4CXXC_R1 domains from diverse species confirmed that these CDCA7 orthologs with the class I zf-4CXXC_R1 domain are clustered under the same clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>). CDCA7 orthologs are broadly found in the three supergroup lineages (Archaeplastida, Amoebozoa, Opisthokonta) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>, Table S1). In Excavata, the amoeboflagellate <italic>Naegleria gruberi</italic> encodes a protein that is a likely ortholog of CDCA7 with an apparent C-terminal truncation (XP_002678720), possibly due to a sequencing error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Fig. S5</xref>). In SAR, CDCA7 orthologs are absent from all available genomes, except stramenopile <italic>Tribonema minus</italic>, which encodes a distantly related likely ortholog of CDCA7 (KAG5177154). These conservations suggest that the class I zf-4CXXC_R1 domain in CDCA7 was inherited from the LECA.</p>

Species that encode the set of DNMT1, UHRF1, CDCA7 and HELLS are particularly enriched in Viridiplantae and Metazoa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). A clear exception is <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic>, whose genome also encodes these four genes and is reported to have methylated cytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Moon et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, Table S1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>). <italic>N. gruberi</italic> is an exceptional example among Excavata species, encoding a CDCA7 ortholog (XP_002678720) as well as HELLS; an orphan DNMT protein (XP_002682263), and a UHRF1-like protein (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). DNMT1, DNMT3, HELLS and CDCA7 seem to be absent in other Excavata lineages, although Euglenozoa variants of DNMT6 and cytosine methylation are identified in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>Leishmania major</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Militello et al., 2008</xref>). The yellow-green algae <italic>Tribonema minus</italic> is the only SAR species that encodes a CDCA7 ortholog (KAG5177154), along with DNMT5 and HELLS.</p>
<p>Among the panel of 180 eukaryote species, we found 82 species that encode CDCA7 (including fungal CDCA7F) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). Strikingly, all 82 species containing CDCA7 (or CDCA7F) also harbor HELLS. Almost all CDCA7 encoding species also possess DNMT1. Exceptions are: the yellow-green algae <italic>T. minus</italic> and the Mamiellophyceae lineage of the green algae/Chlorophyta (<italic>Bathycoccus prasinos</italic>, <italic>Ostreococcus lucimarinus</italic>, <italic>Micromonas pusilla</italic>), which lost DNMT1 but possess DNMT5; the amoeboflagellate <italic>N. gruberi</italic>, which encodes an orphan DNMT and UHRF1, and the fungus <italic>T. deformans</italic>, which encodes UHRF1 and DNMT4. In contrast, 20 species (e.g., <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) possess only HELLS, while 10 species (e.g. the silk moth <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>) retains only DNMT1 among the set of DNMT1, CDCA7 and HELLS. These observations indicate that the function of CDCA7 is strongly linked to HELLS and DNMT1, such that the presence of CDCA7 depends on HELLS and DNMT1, while CDCA7 is easier to lose than DNMT1 and HELLS. Compared to the apparent HELLS/DNMT1-dependent existence of CDCA7, DNMT3 seems to be more dispensable; besides Fungi, which lack DNMT3, 16 species (e.g., the bed bug <italic>Cimex lectularius</italic> and the red paper wasp <italic>Polistes canadensis</italic>) possess the set of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMT1 but not DNMT3/DNMT3-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref> and Table S2).</p>
<p>To quantitatively assess coevolution of DNMTs, CDCA7 and HELLS, we performed CoPAP analysis on the panel of 180 eukaryote species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). The analysis was complicated due to the lineage-specific diverse DNMT classes (e.g., Dim2, DNMT5, DNMT6 and other plant specific DNMT variants) and divergent variants of zf-4CXXC_R1. Considering this caveat, we conducted CoPAP analysis of five DNMTs (DNMT1, Dim-2, DNMT3, DNMT5, DNMT6), UHRF1, HELLS, CDCA7, proteins with class II zf-4CXXC_R1, and proteins with zf-4CXXC_R1 and JmjC. As fungi-specific CDCA7F contains class II zf-4CXXC_R1, and all the other class II zf-4CXXC_R1 containing proteins were identified in species that also possess CDCA7, we conducted CoPAP against two separate lists; in the first list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7A</xref>) CDCA7F was included in the CDCA7 category (i.e. considered as a prototypical CDCA7 ortholog in fungi), whereas in the second list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7B</xref>) CDCA7F was included in the class II zf-4CXXC_R1 category. As positive and negative controls for the CoPAP analysis, we also included subunits of the PRC2 complex (EZH1/2, EED and Suz12), and other SNF2 family proteins SMARCA2/SMARCA4, INO80 and RAD54L, which have no direct role related to DNA methylation, respectively. As expected for proteins that act in concert within the same biological pathway, both CoPAP results showed significant coevolution between DNMT1 and UHRF1, as well as between the PRC2 subunits EZH1 and EED. Suz12 did not show a significant linkage to other PRC2 subunits by this analysis, most likely due to a failure in identifying diverged Suz12 orthologs, such as those in <italic>Neurospora</italic> and <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Miro-Pina et al., 2022</xref>). The evolutionary linkage between DNMT5 and DNMT6 were also observed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). In the result of CoPAP analysis against the first list, where CDCA7F was included in the CDCA7 category, CDCA7 exhibited a coevolutionary linkage to DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7A</xref>). In the second CoPAP, where CDCA7F was included in the class II zf-4CXXC_R1 category, CDCA7 exhibited linkage to UHRF1 and HELLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Fig. S7B</xref>). Notably, none of these proteins show an evolutionary association with the PRC2 proteins or other SNF2 family proteins, while the coevolutionary linkage between CDCA7 and the DNMT1-UHRF1 cluster was reproducible.</p>

<p>We next conducted the CoPAP analysis against a panel of 50 Ecdysozoa species, where DNA methylation system is dynamically lost in multiple lineages (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bewick et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Engelhardt et al., 2022</xref>), yet the annotation of DNMTs, UHRF1, CDCA7 and HELLS is unambiguous. As a negative control, we included INO80, which is dynamically lost in several Ecdysozoa lineages, such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). As expected, CoPAP analysis showed a highly significant coevolutionary interaction between DNMT1 and UHRF1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In addition, HELLS interacts with DNMT1, UHRF1 and CDCA7. In contrast, no linkage from INO80 or DNMT3 was determined. Altogether, these CoPAP analyses reproducibly found coevolutionary linkages between DNMT1-UHRF1 and CDCA7-HELLS, although the exact interaction topology is sensitive to the selection of species and protein classification methods.</p>

<title>Loss of CDCA7 in braconid wasps together with DNMT1 or DNMT3</title>
<p>CoPAP analysis detected the coevolutionary linkage between CDCA7 and DNMT1-UHRF1, rather than DNMT3. We were therefore intrigued by the apparent absence of CDCA7 and DNMT3 in two insect species, the red flour beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> and the braconid wasp <italic>Microplitis demolitor</italic>, whose genomic DNA does not have any detectable 5mC despite the presence of DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bewick et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). To further validate the co-loss of CDCA7 and DNMT1/DNMT3 in insects, we focused on the Hymenoptera clade (including <italic>M. demolitor</italic>), for which genome synteny has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, a striking synteny is observed in the genome region surrounding CDCA7 among the parasitic wood wasp (<italic>Orussus abietinus</italic>) and Aculeata species (bees <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> and <italic>Habropoda laborlosa</italic>, and the eusocial wasp <italic>Polistes canadensis</italic>), which diverged ∼250 MYA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c99">Peters et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, Table S2). In these species, CDCA7 is located between Methyltransferase-like protein 25 homolog (MET25, E) and Ornithine aminotransferase homolog (OAT, F). In fact, the gene cluster containing LTO1 homolog (D), MET25 (E), OAT (F), and Zinc finger protein 808 (ZN808, G) is highly conserved in all the analyzed Hymenoptera species, but not outside of Hymenoptera (e.g., <italic>Drosophila</italic>).</p>

<p>However, CDCA7 is absent from this gene cluster in parasitoid wasps, including Ichneumonoidea wasps (braconid wasps [<italic>M. demolitor</italic>, <italic>Cotesia glomerata, Aphidius gifuensis</italic>, <italic>Fopius arisanus</italic>] and ichneumon wasp [<italic>Venturia canescent</italic>]) and chalcid wasps (<italic>Copidosoma floridanum</italic>, <italic>Nasonia vitripennis</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, Table S3). Among Ichneumonoidea wasps, CDCA7 is undetectable in the genome of braconid wasps, while CDCA7 is located on a different chromosome in the ichneumon wasp <italic>Venturia canescens</italic>. In chalcid wasps, CDCA7 is present at a genome segment between Artemis (I) and Chromatin accessibility complex protein 1 (CHRC1, J). Supported by the chromosome-level genome assembly for <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic> and <italic>Aphidius gifuensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Pinto et al., 2021</xref>), the synteny analysis strongly indicates that CDCA7 is lost from braconid wasps. Intriguingly, braconid wasps co-lost CDCA7 either with DNMT3 (in <italic>M. demolitor</italic>, <italic>Cotesia glomerata</italic>, <italic>Cotesia typhae</italic> and <italic>Chelonus insularis</italic>) or with DNMT1 and UHRF1 (in <italic>Fopius arisanus</italic>, <italic>Diachasma alloeum</italic> and <italic>Aphidius gifuensis</italic>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and Table S3). Notably, in addition to <italic>M. demolitor</italic> (which lacks CDCA7 and DNMT3), it has been reported that little or no 5mC can be detected in <italic>Aphidius ervi</italic> (which lacks CDCA7, DNMT1 and UHRF1, Table S3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bewick et al., 2017b</xref>). In contrast, all Hymenoptera species that are known to have detectable 5mC possess CDCA7 along with DNMT1, UHRF1, DNMT3, and HELLS, except for <italic>Polistes canadensis</italic>, which has all but DNMT3 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> and Table S3). This co-loss of CDCA7 and DNA methylation (together with either DNMT1-UHRF1or DNMT3) in braconid wasps suggests that evolutionary preservation of CDCA7 is more sensitive to DNA methylation status <italic>per se</italic> than to the presence or absence of a particular DNMT subtype.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although DNA methylation is prevalent across eukaryotes, DNA methyltransferases are missing from a variety of lineages. Our study reveals that the nucleosome remodeling complex CHIRRC, composed of CDCA7 and HELLS, is frequently lost in conjunction with DNA methylation status. More specifically, evolutionary preservation of CDCA7 is tightly coupled to the presence of HELLS and DNMT1-UHRF1. The conservation of CDCA7’s signature cysteine residues alongside three ICF-associated residues across diverse eukaryote lineages suggests a unique evolutionary conserved role in DNA methylation. Our co-evolution analysis suggests that DNA methylation-related functionalities of CDCA7 and HELLS are inherited from LECA.</p>
<p>The evolutionary coupling of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMT1 is consistent with a proposed role of HELLS in replication-uncoupled DNA methylation maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ming et al., 2020</xref>). Commonly, DNA methylation maintenance occurs directly behind the DNA replication fork. Replication-uncoupled DNA methylation maintenance is distinct from this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Nishiyama et al., 2020</xref>), and HELLS and CDCA7 may be important for the maintenance of DNA methylation long after the completion of DNA replication, particularly at heterochromatin where chromatin has restricted accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Ming et al., 2020</xref>). The tighter evolutionary coupling of CDCA7-HELLS to DNMT1 rather than to DNMT3 may also reflect a potential capacity of CDCA7 in sensing DNA methylation, similar to the way that the zf-CXXC domain is sensitive to CpG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Long et al., 2013</xref>), but in a replication-coupled manner. However, this does not necessarily suggest that the role of CDCA7 is always coupled to maintenance DNA methylation.</p>
<p>The loss of CDCA7 is not always coupled to the loss of DNMT1 or HELLS. In the Hymenoptera clade, CDCA7 loss in the braconid wasps is accompanied with the loss of DNMT1/UHRF1 or the loss of DNMT3. Among these species, it was reported that 5mC DNA methylation is undetectable in <italic>M. demolitor</italic>, which harbors DNMT1, UHRF1 and HELLS but lost DNMT3 and CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bewick et al., 2017b</xref>). Similarly, in the Coleoptera clade, the red flour beetle <italic>T. castaneum</italic> possesses DNMT1 and HELLS, but lost DNMT3 and CDCA7 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>, Table S1). Since DNMT1 is essential for the embryonic development of <italic>T. castaneum</italic> and CpG DNA methylation is undetectable in this organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c108">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>), it has been predicted that DNMT1 has a function independent of DNA methylation in this species. Indeed, species that preserves DNMTs and/or HELLS in the absence of CDCA7 emerge repeatedly during eukaryote evolution, whereas CDCA7 appears to be immediately dispensable in species that have a dampened requirement for DNA methylation. In other words, there is no evolutionary advantage to retain CDCA7 in the absence of DNA methylation, and CDCA7 is almost never maintained in the absence of any DNMTs. Alternatively, could the loss of CDCA7 precede the loss of DNA methylation? If CDCA7 is important to promote DNA methylation maintenance, the loss of CDCA7 may exacerbate an impaired epigenetic environment and stimulate the adaptation of the organism towards DNA methylation-independent epigenetic mechanisms, thereby decreasing the necessity to maintain the DNA methylation system. In this way, the loss of CDCA7 could trigger the subsequent loss of DNMTs (and HELLS), unless these proteins acquired important DNA methylation-independent roles. In line with this scenario, insects, whose DNA methylation is largely limited to gene bodies, possess robust DNA methylation-independent mechanisms (such as piwi-RNA and H3K9me3) to silence transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonasio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Libbrecht et al., 2016</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Libbrecht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). The loss of CDCA7 is more frequently observed in insects than plants and vertebrates, where DNA methylation and HELLS/DDM1 play major roles in silencing transposons. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Czech et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Dunican et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Kato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Miura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">Onishi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c122">Vongs et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, lowering the demand of DNA methylation at transposable elements might reduce the essentiality of CDCA7 (and then perhaps that of DNMTs), though it is difficult to deduce which evolutionary change occurs first.</p>
<p>Considering the importance of HELLS/DDM1 in silencing transposable elements, it is intriguing that CDCA7, HELLS, and DNMT1 are conserved in many insects, in which transposable elements are generally hypomethylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Bonasio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Feng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Libbrecht et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c126">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c135">Zemach et al., 2010</xref>). DNMT1 knockout in the clonal raider ant, <italic>Ooceraea biroi</italic>, which has a full set of DNMT1, UHRF1, DNMT3, CDCA7 and HELLS (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), does not cause major developmental defects but leads to failure in reproductive oogenesis and compromised longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ivasyk et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, DNMT1 is essential for meiosis (but not for repression of transposable elements) in the milkweed bug <italic>Oncopeltus fasciatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bewick et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c128">Washington et al., 2021</xref>). HELLS and DNMT1 are also important for meiotic progression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Baumann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c111">Takada et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c136">Zeng et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, DNA methylation is a critical component for trans-sensing homologous chromosomes during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c103">Pratt et al., 2004</xref>). Since 5mC is highly mutagenic and DNA methylation patterns are altered during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Lowe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c125">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that the precise maintenance of DNA methylation patterns may act as a hallmark to distinguish between young/healthy DNA and old/mutated (or competitive/pathogenic) DNA during meiosis, perhaps in a way analogous to the role of methylated DNA for mismatch repair in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Schofield and Hsieh, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The observation that some species retain HELLS but lose CDCA7 (while the reverse is never true) suggests that HELLS can evolve a CDCA7-independent function. Indeed, it has been suggested that the sequence-specific DNA-binding protein PRDM9 recruits HELLS to meiotic chromatin to promote DNA double-strand breaks and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c110">Spruce et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike CDCA7, clear PRDM9 orthologs are found only in metazoans, and are even lost in some vertebrates such as <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> and <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Birtle and Ponting, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is plausible that HELLS acquires a species-specific CDCA7-independent role during evolution through acquiring a new interaction partner. Another example of this may be found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where DNA methylation and CDCA7 are absent and the HELLS homolog Irc5 interacts with cohesin to facilitate its chromatin loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Litwin et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, where genomic DNA is methylated, the HELLS homolog MUS-30 is not required for DNA methylation, but plays a role in DNA damage responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Basenko et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that the role of CDCA7 is evolutionarily more tightly coupled to DNA methylation than HELLS.</p>
<p>Recently, the role of HELLS in the deposition of the histone variant macroH2A, which compacts chromatin, has been reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Ni and Muegge, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Ni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c130">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, DDM1 is critical for deposition of H2A.W, which is enriched on heterochromatin, in a manner independent of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). The role of CDCA7 in the deposition of these H2A variants remains to be tested. HELLS and DDM1 can directly interact with macroH2A and H2A.W, respectively, even in the absence of CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Ni and Muegge, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">Osakabe et al., 2021</xref>). It is thus possible that HELLS/DDM1 family proteins have an evolutionary conserved function in H2A variant deposition independent of CDCA7 and DNA methylation. However, there is no clear indication of coevolution of HELLS and macroH2A, as macroH2A is largely missing from insects and the chelicerata <italic>Centruroides sculpturatus</italic> has macroH2A (XP_023217082, XP_023212717) but lost HELLS and CDCA7.</p>
<p>Whereas the class I CDCA7-like proteins are evolutionarily coupled to HELLS and DNMT1-UHRF1, other variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 are widespread in eukaryotes except for metazoans, which encode only CDCA7 orthologs and their close paralogs (with the exception of the sponge <italic>A. queenslandica</italic>). Proteins containing a diverged variant of zf-4CXXC_R1 and the JmjC domain, such as IBM1 in Arabidopsis and DMM-1 in Neurospora, are broadly found in Viridiplantae and Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Honda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Saze et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c137">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Functional studies of IBM1 and DMM-1 suggested that they contribute to DNA methylation regulation via indirect mechanisms. As IBM1 and DMM-1 do not preserve ICF-associated residues, which are critical for nucleosome binding in CDCA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Jenness et al., 2018</xref>), it is likely that these variants of zf-4CXXC_R1 are adapted to recognize different structural features of the genome and no longer preserve the DNA methylation function of CDCA7 orthologs.</p>
<p>Considering the broad conservation of DNA methylation in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Hemmi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Kondilis-Mangum and Wade, 2013</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Deleris et al., 2016</xref>), prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Beaulaurier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Casadesus and Low, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Dimitriu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c120">Vasu and Nagaraja, 2013</xref>) and Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Grogan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Hayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ishikawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Prangishvili et al., 1985</xref>), along with the existence of SNF2-like proteins (SSO1653) in prokaryotes and Archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>), we hypothesize that the evolutionary advent of zf-4CXXC_R1-containing CDCA7 was a key step to transmit the DNA methylation system from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) to the eukaryotic ancestor with nucleosome-containing genomes.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Building a curated list of 180 species for analysis of evolutionary co-selection</title>
<p>A list of 180 eukaryote species was manually generated to encompass broad eukaryote evolutionary clades (Table S1). Species were included in this list based on two criteria: (i) the identification UBA1 and PCNA homologs, two highly conserved and essential proteins for cell proliferation; and (ii) the identification of more than 6 distinct SNF2 family sequences. Homologs of CDCA7, HELLS, UBA1 and PCNA were identified by BLAST search against the Genbank eukaryote protein database available at National Center for Biotechnology Information using the human protein sequence as a query (NCBI). Homologs of human UHRF1, ZBTB24, SMARCA2/SMARCA4, INO80, RAD54L, EZH2, EED or Suz12 were also identified based on the RBH criterion. To get a sense of genome assembly level of each genome sequence, we divided “Total Sequence Length” by “Contig N50” (“length such that sequence contigs of this length or longer include half the bases of the assembly”; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/help/</ext-link>). In the species whose genome assembly level is labeled as “complete”, this value is close to the total number of chromosomes or linkage groups. As such, as a rule of thumb, we arbitrarily defined the genome assembly “preliminary”, if this value is larger than 100. In <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, these species with preliminary-level genome assembly were noted as boxes with dotted outlines.</p>

<sec id="s4b">
<title>CDCA7 homolog identification and annotation</title>
<p>BLAST search was conducted using human CDCA7 (NP_114148) as the search query against NCBI protein database. The obtained list of CDCA7 homologs was classified based on the conservation of eleven cysteine and three ICF-associated residues in the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain, as described in Results. This classification was further validated based on their clustering in a phylogenetic tree built from the CLUSTALW alignment of the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain identified by NCBI conserved domains search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Higgins and Sharp, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c115">Thompson et al., 1994</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1</xref>), using MacVector (MacVector, Inc.). The cluster of class I zf-4CXXC_R1 domain-containing proteins (where all three ICF-associated residues are conserved) was segregated from other variants of zf-4CXXC_R1-containing proteins except for the moss Physcomitrium XP_024393821 and green algae Bathycoccus XP_007512509 and Chlamydomonas GAX81623, which has class II zf-4CXXC-R1 (where the ICF-associated glycine residue is substituted). To further assess this validation, another phylogenetic tree was built by the optimal maximum likelihood-based model selected by IQ-TREE 2.2.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Minh et al., 2020</xref>), using the zf-4CXXC_R1 domain alignment generated and selected by Muscle v5 (Dataset S1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Edgar, 2022</xref>). A consensus tree was then constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees using UFBoot2 (Dataset S2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>). The phylogenetic tree built by this second method deviated all class II and other zf-4CXXC_R1 variants from CDCA7 orthologs with class I zf-4CXXC_R1 (Dataset S2).</p>

<sec id="s4c">
<title>HELLS homolog identification and annotation</title>
<p>Putative HELLS orthologs were first identified according to the RBH criterion. Briefly, a BLAST search was conducted using human HELLS as the query sequence, after which protein sequences of obtained top hits (or secondary hits, if necessary) in each search were used as a query sequence to conduct reciprocal BLAST search against the <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> protein database. If the top hit in the reciprocal search returned the original input sequence (i.e. human HELLS), it was temporarily annotated as an orthologous protein. If HELLS showed up as a next best hit, it is temporarily listed as a “potential HELLS ortholog”. To further validate the identified HELLS orthologs, full length amino acid sequences of these proteins were aligned using CLUSTALW in MacVector with homologs of the Snf2 family proteins SMARCA2/SMARCA4, CHD1/CHD3/CHD7, ISWI, RAD54L, ATRX, HLTF, TTF2, SHPRH, INO80, SMARCAD1, SWR1, MOT1, ERCC6, and SMARCAL1, which were also identified and temporarily annotated with a similar reciprocal BLAST search methods. The phylogenetic tree generated by this full-length alignment separated the clade containing HELLS, DDM1, INO80, SMARCA2/SMARCA4, CHD1/CDH3/CHD7, and ISWI from other Snf2 family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3</xref>). This alignment was used to define the conserved SNF2 domain and variable linker regions in the putative HELLS orthologs and other homologous SNF2-family proteins (INO80, SMARCA2/SMARCA4, CHD1/CDH3/CHD7, and ISWI). The variable linker regions were then removed from selected proteins for each kingdom/phylum to conduct the secondary CLUSTALW alignment in MacVector, from which a phylogenetic tree was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). A distinct cluster of HELLS and other SNF2 family proteins can be identified from the phylogenetic tree, hence confirming that the annotation of HELLS orthologs based on the reciprocal BLAST search method is reasonable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). Exceptions are <italic>Leucosporidium creatinivorum</italic> ORY88017 and ORY88018, which did not cluster within the HELLS clade of the phylogenetic tree. However, we decided to annotate <italic>L. creatinivorum</italic> ORY88017 and ORY88018 as HELLS orthologs since among other <italic>L. creatinivorum</italic> SNF2-family proteins in this species these two proteins are most similar to human HELLS while clear orthologs of other <italic>L. creatinivorum</italic> SNF2 family proteins, CHD1 (ORY55731), ISWI (ORY89162), SMARCA2/4 (ORY76015), SRCAP/SWR1 (ORY90750) and INO80 (ORY91599), can be identified. To further validate the phylogenetic tree generated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>, another phylogenetic tree was built by the optimal maximum likelihood-based model selected by IQ-TREE 2.2.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Minh et al., 2020</xref>), using the alignment generated and selected by Muscle v5 (Dataset S3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Edgar, 2022</xref>). A consensus tree was then constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees using UFBoot2 (Dataset S4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>). The topology of the phylogenetic tree build by this second method was consistent with the original tree shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>.</p>

<sec id="s4d">
<title>DNMT homolog identification and annotation</title>
<p>Proteins with a DNA methyltransferase domain were identified with BLAST searches using human DNMT1 and DNMT3A. Additional BLAST searches were conducted using human DNMT2, <italic>C. neoformans</italic> DNMT5, <italic>N. crassa</italic> Dim-2 and DNMT4, <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> XP_002287631 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>), and Kwoniella mangroviensis DNMTX (XP_019001759) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Catania et al., 2020</xref>). DNMT domains were extracted from selected proteins that represent each kingdom/phylum and DNMT type (including ambiguous classes) based on a NCBI conserved domains search, and were aligned with CLUSTALW to build a phylogenetic tree in MacVector. To further assess this validation, another phylogenetic tree was built by the optimal maximum likelihood-based model selected by IQ-TREE 2.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Minh et al., 2020</xref>), using the alignment generated and selected by Muscle v5 (Dataset S5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Edgar, 2022</xref>). A consensus tree was then constructed from 1000 bootstrap trees using UFBoot2 (Dataset S6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Hoang et al., 2018</xref>). The topology of the phylogenetic tree built by this second method was largely consistent with the original tree except for placement of orphan DNMTs. In both trees, <italic>Vitrella brassicaformis</italic> CEM15752, <italic>Fragilariopsis cylindrus</italic> OEU08290, OEU15938, <italic>Thalassiosira pseudonana</italic> XP_002295472, and <italic>Tribonema minus</italic> KAG5185060 form a clade, which, only in the IQ-TREE generated tree, splits from the canonical DNMT4 clade. As proteins in this clade have been previously annotated as DNMT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Huff and Zilberman, 2014</xref>), we followed this classification and present this IQ-TREE-based phylogenetic tree of DNMTs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref>, which was illustrated using the ETE3 toolkit.</p>

<title>CoPAP</title>
<p>The published method was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>). The curated list of orthologous proteins listed in Table S1 was first used to generate a presence-absence FASTA file. Next, a phylogenetic species tree was generated from all orthologous protein sequences listed in Table S1 using the ETE3 toolkit. For this, protein sequences were retrieved using the rentrez Bioconductor package and exported to a FASTA file alongside a COG file containing gene to orthologous group mappings. ETE3 was used with the parameters <italic>-w clustalo_default-trimal01-none-none</italic> and <italic>-m cog_all-alg_concat_default-fasttree_default</italic> and the resulting tree exported in Newark format. CoPAP was run using default parameters and results visualised using Cytoscape. Code and files required for CoPAP input generation as well CoPAP parameters and output results can be found in our Github repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Copap_Analysis">https://github.com/RockefellerUniversity/Copap_Analysis</ext-link>). A method to calculate <italic>p</italic>-value for CoPAP was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, for each pair of tested genes, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was computed. Parametric bootstrapping was used to compute a <italic>p</italic>-value by comparing it with a simulated correlation coefficient calculated based on a null distribution of independently evolving pairs with a comparable exchangeability (a value reporting the likelihood of gene gain and loss events across the tree)</p>
<p>As negative and positive controls for the CoPAP analysis, we identified several well-conserved protein orthologs across the panel of 180 eukaryotic species, including Snf2-like proteins SMARCA2/SMARCA4, INO80, and RAD54L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Flaus et al., 2006</xref>), as well as subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays an evolutionary conserved role in gene repression via deposition of the H3K27me3 mark. PRC2 is conserved in species where DNMTs are absent (including in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>) but is frequently lost particularly in several lineages of SAR and Fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c109">Sharaf et al., 2022</xref>). Among the four core subunits of PRC2, we focused on the catalytic subunit EZH1/2, EED, and SUZ12, since the fourth subunit RbAp46/48 has a PRC2-independent role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>). We are aware that the reciprocal BLAST search missed previously reported highly divergent functional orthologs of SUZ12 in <italic>Neurospora</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Jamieson et al., 2013</xref>), and EED and Suz12 in <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Miro-Pina et al., 2022</xref>). However, we did not attempt to use these divergent homologs of EED and SUZ12 as baits to expand our search in order to consistently apply our homology-based definition of orthologs.</p>

<p>Funabiki et al, performed a co-evolutionary analysis of Lsh/HELLS and CDCA7, two factors with links to DNA methylation pathways in mammals, amphibia and fish. The authors suggest that conserved roles for the two factors in DNA methylation maintenance pathways can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor. Overall, the findings are important and the results could be useful for researchers studying DNA methylation pathways in many different organisms.</p>
<p>Comments on current version:</p>
<p>In the revised version of this manuscript the authors addressed all previously raised issues. I would like to thank them for that. The data is now clearly presented and interpreted and more experimental detail has been added. Thus, the manuscript is much improved and provides an interesting basis for experimental follow-up and further functional investigations.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Funabiki and colleagues investigated the co-evolution of DNA methylation and nucleosome remolding in eukaryotes. This study is motivated by several observations: (1) despite being ancestrally derived, many eukaryotes lost DNA methylation and/or DNA methyltransferases; (2) over many genomic loci, the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation relies on a conserved nucleosome remodeling complex composed of CDCA7 and HELLS; (3) it remains unknown if/how this functional link influenced the evolution of DNA methylation. The authors hypothesize that if CDCA7-HELLS function was required for DNA methylation in the last eukaryote common ancestor, this should be accompanied by signatures of co-evolution during eukaryote radiation.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, they first set out to investigate the presence/absence of putative functional orthologs of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs across major eukaryotic clades. They succeed in identifying homologs of these genes in all clades spanning 180 species. To annotate putative functional orthologs, they use similarity over key functional domains and residues - such as ICF related mutations for CDCA7 and SNF2 domains for HELLS - as well as maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses. Using established eukaryote phylogenies, the authors conclude that the CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT axis arose in the last common ancestor to all eukaryotes. Importantly, they found recurrent loss events of CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT in at least 40 eukaryotic species, most of them lacking DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Having identified these factors, they successfully identify signatures of co-evolution between DNMTs, CDCA7 and HELLS using CoPAP analysis - a probabilistic model inferring the likelihood of interactions between genes given a set of presence/absence patterns. As a control, such interactions are not detected with other remodelers or chromatin modifying pathways also found across eukaryotes. Expanding on this analysis, the authors found that CDCA7 was more likely to be lost in species without DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors suggest that the CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT axis is ancestral in eukaryotes and raise the hypothesis that CDCA7 becomes quickly dispensable upon the loss of DNA methylation and/or that CDCA7 might be the first step toward the switch from DNA methylation-based genome regulation to other modes.</p>
<p>The data and analyses reported are significant and solid. Overall, this work is a conceptual advance in our understanding of the evolutionary coupling between nucleosome remolding and DNA methylation. It also provides a useful resource to study the early origins of DNA methylation related molecular process. Finally, it brings forward the interesting hypothesis that since eukaryotes are faced with the challenge of performing DNA methylation in the context of nucleosome packed DNA, loosing factors such as CDCA7-HELLS likely led to recurrent innovations in chromatin-based genome regulation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The hypothesis linking nucleosome remodeling and the evolution of DNA methylation.</p>
<p>
- Deep mapping of DNA methylation related process in eukaryotes.</p>
<p>
- Identification and evolutionary trajectories of novel homologs/orthologs of CDCA7.</p>
<p>
- Identification of CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT co-evolution across eukaryotes.</p>

<p>This important manuscript reveals signatures of co-evolution of two nucleosome remodeling factors, Lsh/HELLS and CDCA7, which are involved in the regulation of eukaryotic DNA methylation. The results suggest that the roles for the two factors in DNA methylation maintenance pathways can be traced back to the last eukaryotic common ancestor and that the CDC7A-HELLS-DNMT axis shaped the evolutionary retention of DNA methylation in eukaryotes. The evolutionary analyses are solid, although more refined phylogenetic approaches could have strengthened some of the claims. Overall, this study should be useful for researchers studying DNA methylation pathways in different organisms, and it should be of general interest to colleagues in the fields of evolutionary biology, chromatin biology and genome biology.</p>

<p>We sincerely appreciate constructive comments and suggestions by the reviewers and a fair and accurate summary by the monitoring editor. Below we made point-by-point responses to reviewers’ comments.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Overall, I find the work performed by the authors very interesting. However, the authors have not always included literature that seems relevant to their study. For instance, I do not understand why two papers Dunican et al 2013 and Dunican et al 2015, which provide important insight into Lsh/HELLS function in mouse, frog and fish were not cited. It is also important that the authors are specific about what is known and in particular about what is not known about CDCA7 function in DNA methylation regulation. Unless I am mistaken, there is currently only one study (Velasco et al 2018) investigating the effect of CDCA7 disruption on DNA methylation levels (in ICF3 patient lymphoblastoid cell lines) on a genome-wide scale (Illumina 450K arrays). Unoki et al 2019 report that CDCA7 and HELLS gene knockout in human HEK293T cells moderately and extremely reduces DNA methylation levels at pericentromeric satellite-2 and centromeric alpha-satellite repeats, respectively. No other loci were investigated, and it is therefore not known whether a CDCA7-associated maintenance methylation phenotype extends beyond (peri)centromeric satellites. Thijssen et al performed siRNA- mediated knockdown experiments in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (differentiated cells) and showed that lower levels of Zbtb24, Cdca7 and Hells protein correlate with reduced minor satellite repeat methylation, thereby implicating these factors in mouse minor satellite repeat DNA methylation maintenance. Furthermore, studies that demonstrate a HELLS-CDCA7 interaction are currently limited to Xenopus egg extract (Jenness et al 2018) and the human HEK293 cell line (Unoki et al 2019). Whether such an interaction exists in any other organism and is of relevance to DNA methylation mechanisms remains to be determined. Therefore, in my opinion, the conclusion that &quot;Our co- evolution analysis suggests that DNA methylation-related functionalities of CDCA7 and HELLS are inherited from LECA&quot; should be softened, as the evidence for this scenario is not very compelling and seems premature in the absence of molecular data from more species.</p>

<p>As pointed out by the reviewer, the role of CDCA7 in genome DNA methylation was extensively studied in Velasco et al 2018. The result, together with Thijssen et al (2015), and Unoki et al. (2018), supports the idea that ZBTB24, CDCA7 and HELLS act within the same pathway to promote DNA methylation, the pattern of which is overlapping but distinct from DNMT3B-mediated methylation. This observation suggests that a ZBTB24- CDCA7-HELLS mechanism for DNA methylation may involve an alternative DNMT. Interestingly, our analysis of the gene presence-absence pattern revealed that the presence of CDCA7 coincides with DNMT1 more than DNMT3 genes. Indeed, while CDCA7 is lost from diverse branches of eukaryote species, genomes encoding CDCA7 always encode HELLS, and almost always encode DNMT1. Based on this observation, we speculate the role of CDCA7 is tightly linked to HELLS and DNA methylation throughout evolution.</p>
<p>As pointed out by Reviewer 1, the link between CDCA7, HELLS and DNA methylation has not been determined experimentally across these species. However, based on our previously published and unpublished data, we are confident about the functional interaction between CDCA7 and HELLS in Xenopus laevis and Homo sapiens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the importance of HELLS homologs in DNA methylation has been extensively studied in human, mice and plants. We hope our current study will motivate the field to experimentally test the evolutionary conservation of HELLS-CDCA7 interaction, as well as their importance in DNA methylation, in other species.</p>

<p>The authors used BLAST searches to characterize the evolutionary conservation of CDCA7 family proteins in vertebrates. From Figure 2A, it seems that they identify a LEDGF binding motif in CDCA7/JPO1. Is this correct and if yes, could you please elaborate and show this result? This is interesting and important to clarify because previous literature (Tesina et al 2015) reports a LEDGF binding motif only in CDCA7L/JPO2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We searched for a LEDGF binding motif ({E/D}-X-E-X-F-X-G-F, also known as IBM described in Tesina et al 2015) in vertebrate CDCA7 proteins, and reported their positions in Figure 2A. Examples of identified LEDGF-binding motifs are now presented in Fig. 2C.</p>

<p>To provide evidence for a potential evolutionary co-selection of CDCA7, HELLS and the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) the authors performed CoPAP analysis. Throughout the manuscript, it is unclear to me what the authors mean when referring to &quot;DNMT3&quot;.
In the Material and Methods section, the authors mention that human DNMT3A was used in BLAST searches to identify proteins with DNA methyltransferase domains. Does this mean that &quot;DNMT3&quot; should be DNMT3A? And if yes, should &quot;DNMT3&quot; be corrected to &quot;DNMT3A&quot;? Is there a reason that &quot;DNMT3A&quot; was chosen for the BLAST searches?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As described in the Methods section, both Human DNMT1 and DNMT3A were used to initially identify any proteins containing a domain homologous to the DNA methyltransferase catalytic domain. Within Metazoa, if their orthologs exist, the top hit from BLAST search using human DNMT1 and DNMT3A show E-value 0.0, and thus their orthology is robust. This is even true for DNMT1 and DNMT3 homologs in the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica, which is one of the earliest-branching metazoan species. For other DNMTs, such as DNMT2, DNMT4, DNMT5, DNMT6, we conducted separate BLAST searches using those proteins as baits as described in Methods. The methyltransferase domain was then isolated using the NCBI conserved domains search. The selected DNMT domain sequences were aligned with CLUSTALW to generate a phylogenetic tree to further classify DNMTs. In response to reviewer #2’s comments, we also generated another multi-sequence alignment of DNMTs using MUSCLE v5 and conducted maximum-likelihood-based phylogenetic tree assembly using IQ-TREE (new Fig. S6). The overall topology of these trees is consistent except for orphan DNMTs. It has been suggested that vertebrate DNMT3A and DNMT3B are derived from duplication of a DNMT3 gene of chordates ancestor (e.g., Liu et al 2020, PMID 31969623). As such many invertebrates encode only one DNMT3. As previously shown (Yaari et al., 2019, PMID 30962443), plants have two distinct DNMT3-like protein family, the ‘true DNMT3’ and DRM, the plant specific de novo DNMT that is often considered to be a DNMT3 homolog (see Reviewer 2’s comment). Our phylogenetic analysis successfully deviated the clade of DNMT3 and DRM from the rest of DNMTs (Figure S6). Yaari et al noted that PpDNMT3a and PpDNMT3b, the two DNMT3 orthologs encoded by the basal plant Physcomitrella patens, are not orthologs of mammalian DNMT3A and DNMT3B, respectively. Therefore, to minimize such nomenclature confusions, any DNMTs that belong to either the DNMT3 or DRM clades indicated in Figure S6 are collectively referred to as ‘DNMT3’ throughout the paper (see Figure S2 for overview).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>CoPAP analysis revealed that CDCA7 and HELLS are dynamically lost in the Hymenoptera clade and either co-occurs with DNMT3 or DNMT1/UHRF1 loss, which seems important. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide sufficient information in their figures or supplementary data about what is already known regarding DNA methylation levels in the different Hymenoptera species to further consider a potential impact of this observation. What is &quot;the DNA methylation status&quot; of all these organisms? This information cannot be easily retrieved from Table S2. A clearer presentation of what is actually known already would improve this paragraph.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the DNA methylation status of the species in the Hymenoptera clade has not been comprehensively tested, we initially did not include this information to Figure 7.
However, during the course of the revision, we realized that Bewick et al.2017 (PMID 28025279) reported that DNA methylation is absent from the braconid wasp Aphidius ervi. We originally conducted synteny analysis on Aphidius gifuensis, which has a chromosome-level genome assembly with annotated proteins available in NCBI, whereas annotated proteins for Aphidius ervi protein are not available in NCBI. By conducting tBLASTn search against the Aphidius ervi genome, we now found that the presence/absence pattern of CDCA7, HELLS, DNMT1, DNMT3 and UHRF1 in Aphidius ervi is identical to that of Aphidius gifuensis, with a caveat that genome assembly of Aphidius ervi is at scaffold-level. In other words, DNA methylation, DNMT1 and CDCA7 are absent in Aphidius ervi, where 5mC is undetectable. Additionally, we also realized that the DNA methylation status reported for some species in Bewick et al. 2017 was inferred from the CpG frequency instead of the direct experimental detection of methylated cytosines. Therefore, we have amended Table S3 to indicate the presence of 5mC only for those species where this was experimentally tested. As such, we now consider the DNA methylation status of Fopius arisanus, which lacks DNMT1 and CDCA7, to be unknown.</p>
<p>Altogether, among the 17 Hymenoptera species that we analyzed (listed in the amended Table S3), the 8 species that have detectable DNA methylation all encode CDCA7, whereas the 2 species that do not have detectable DNA methylation lack CDCA7. We will note this finding in the revised text, and include the known 5mC status in the new Figure 7.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, A. thaliana DDM1, and mouse and human Lsh/Hells are known to preferably promote DNA methylation at satellite repeats, transposable elements and repetitive regions of the genome. On the other hand, DNA methylation in insects and other invertebrates occurs in genic rather than intergenic regions and transposable elements (e.g. Bewick et al 2017; Werren JH PlosGenetics 2013). It would be helpful to elaborate on these differences.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We were aware of this interesting point, which was discussed in the third paragraph of the Discussion. To better illustrate this point, we now expanded the Discussion (page 14) to speculate about the role of DNA methylation in insects, where emerging evidence indicates the importance of DNMT1 in meiosis. It should be noted that, in the Arabidopsis ddm1 mutant, reduction of CG methylation of gene bodies is common (50% of all methylated euchromatic genes) (Zemach et al, 2013). In addition, hypomethylation is not limited to satellite repeats and transposable elements in ICF patients defective in HELLS or CDCA7 (Velasco et al., 2018).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Funabiki and colleagues investigated the co-evolution of DNA methylation and nucleosome remolding in eukaryotes. This study is motivated by several observations: (1) despite being ancestrally derived, many eukaryotes lost DNA methylation and/or DNA methyltransferases; (2) over many genomic loci, the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation relies on a conserved nucleosome remodeling complex composed of CDCA7 and HELLS; (3) it remains unknown if/how this functional link influenced the evolution of DNA methylation. The authors hypothesize that if CDCA7-HELLS function was required for DNA methylation in the last eukaryote common ancestor, this should be accompanied by signatures of co-evolution during eukaryote radiation.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, they first set out to investigate the presence/absence of putative functional orthologs of CDCA7, HELLS and DNMTs across major eukaryotic clades.
They succeed in identifying homologs of these genes in all clades spanning 180 species. To annotate putative functional orthologs, they use similarity over key functional domains and residues such as ICF related mutations for CDCA7 and SNF2 domains for HELLS. Using established eukaryote phylogenies, the authors conclude that the CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT axis arose in the last common ancestor to all eukaryotes. Importantly, they found recurrent loss events of CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT in at least 40 eukaryotic species, most of them lacking DNA methylation.</p>
<p>Having identified these factors, they successfully identify signatures of co-evolution between DNMTs, CDCA7 and HELLS using CoPAP analysis - a probabilistic model inferring the likelihood of interactions between genes given a set of presence/absence patterns. As a control, such interactions are not detected with other remodelers or chromatin modifying pathways also found across eukaryotes. Expanding on this analysis, the authors found that CDCA7 was more likely to be lost in species without DNA methylation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the authors suggest that the CDCA7-HELLS-DNMT axis is ancestral in eukaryotes and raise the hypothesis that CDCA7 becomes quickly dispensable upon the loss of DNA methylation and/or that CDCA7 might be the first step toward the switch from DNA methylation-based genome regulation to other modes.</p>
<p>The data and analyses reported are significant and solid. However, using more refined phylogenetic approaches could have strengthened the orthologous relationships presented. Overall, this work is a conceptual advance in our understanding of the evolutionary coupling between nucleosome remolding and DNA methylation. It also provides a useful resource to study the early origins of DNA methylation related molecular process. Finally, it brings forward the interesting hypothesis that since eukaryotes are faced with the challenge of performing DNA methylation in the context of nucleosome packed DNA, loosing factors such as CDCA7-HELLS likely led to recurrent innovations in chromatin-based genome regulation.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewers’ accurate summary, nicely emphasizing the importance of the our study. We agree that better phylogenetic analysis for orthology assignment will strengthen our conclusion. Having anticipated this weakness, however, we specifically conducted a CoPAP analysis exclusively for Ecdysozoa specieswhich supported our major conclusion, as orthology assignment is straightforward in these species. For example, if we conduct BLAST search against the clonal raider ant Oocerea biroi protein dataset using human HELLS as a query, top 1 hit is a protein sequence annotated as one of three isoforms of ‘lymphoid-specific helicase” (i.e., HELLS), with E value 0.0. Similarly, the top BLAST hit from the Oocerea biroi dataset using human DNMT1 as a query also returns with isoforms of DNMT1 with E value 0.0. As such, there are little disputes in orthology assignment in Ecdysozoa. Outside of Chordata, classification of DNMTs, particularly in Excavata and SAR, require more extensive identification in these supergroups. Our current orthology assignment for the major targets in this study (HELLS, DNMT1, DNMT3, DNMT5) is largely consistent with published results (Ponger et al., 2005 PMID 15689527; Huff et al, 2014 PMID 24630728; Yaari et al., 2019 PMID 30962443; Bewick et al., 2019 PMID 30778188).
However, while we are preparing this response and re-crosschecking our assignments with these references, we realized that we had erroneously missed DNMT5 orthologs in Leucosporidium creatinivorum, Postia placenta, Armillaria gallica and Saitoella complicata, and a DNMT6 ortholog in Fragilariopsis cylindrus. We also recognized that DNMT4 orthologs were identified in Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Thalassiosira pseudonana in Huff et al 2014 (PMID 24630728), but in our phylogenetic analysis, these proteins form a distinct clade between DNMT1/Dim-2 and DNMT4 (original Figure S6), although the confidence level of this classification by Huff et al was not strong. To resolve this potential confusion in DNMT annotations, we generated new multiple sequence alignments with MUSCLE v5 and IQ-TREE 2 (maximum likelihood-based method, coupled with selection of optimal substitution model and bootstrapping). The tree topology was not significantly altered between the two methods, except for the unambiguous location of orphan DNMTs and DNMT4-related proteins. To avoid unnecessary confusion in the DNMT annotations, we decided to present MUSCLE-IQ- TREE for the DNMT phylogenetic tree and classification (new Fig. S6). The raw results of IQ-TREE analysis for CDCA7/zf-4CXXC_R1, HELLS SNF2 domain, and DNMTs are included as Dataset S1-S3. We then conducted CoPAP analysis using the corrected classification. As it is not clear a priori if fungal specific CDCA7-like proteins (now referred to as CDCA7F with class II zf-4CXXC_R1) should be considered CDCA7 orthologs, we conducted CoPAP against two lists; the first list includes CDCA7F in the CDCA7 group, whereas the second list includes a separate category of class II zn-4CXXC_R1, which includes CDCA7F. Both results show slightly different topology in the coevolutionary linkages but support our major conclusion that CDCA7 coevolved with DNMT1-UHRF1 and HELLS. These new CoPAP results are shown in Fig. S7.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>Last sentence: &quot;...a unique specialized role of CDCA7 in HELLS-dependent DNA methylation maintenance...&quot;. What do the authors mean?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our analysis strongly indicates that CDCA7 is dispensable in systems lacking HELLS and DNMT (particularly DNMT1). In other words, species preserve CDCA7 only if it has both HELLS and DNMT1 (or in some cases DNMT5). The importance of HELLS homologs in DNA methylation has been extensively studied in human, mouse and plants. However, in these studies, substantial DNA methylation remains despite the defective HELLS/DDM1 (especially in euchromatic regions). Additionally, there are species (e.g., Bombyx mori) that have DNMT1 and detectable DNA methylation but lacks HELLS and CDCA7. These observations suggest that the role of CDCA7 must be unique and specialized in a way that it is strongly coupled to HELLS-dependent DNA methylation (but not HELLS-independent DNA methylation), and that this function of CDCA7 seems to be inherited from the last eukaryotic common ancestor.</p>

<p>As described in the cited reference (Lyko 2018), maintenance DNA methylation and de novo DNA methylation are well accepted functional classification of DNA methylation. It is also currently accepted that distinct DNMTs execute maintenance DNA methylation or de novo DNA methylation, although crosstalk between these processes has been reported.

In the first one (Fig. S7A) CDCA7F was included in CDCA7, whereas in in the second one (Fig. S7B) CDCA7F was included in the separate category of class II zf-4CXXC_R1.

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Among the 32 species outside of Viridiplantae and Opisthokonta, only the Acanthamoeba castellanii genome encodes clear orthologs of DNMT1, UHRF1 and CDCA7. Although it is often difficult to deduce if the selected panel of species is a reasonable representation, we think that it is not unreasonable to state that Acanthamoeba is a rare case to encode this set of proteins outside of Viridiplantae and Opisthokonta. We include UHRF1 since it is a well-established activator of DNMT1, and indeed our CoPAP analysis showed a tight coevolution of UHRF1 with DNMT1. Outside of Viridiplantae and Opisthokonta, only Acanthamoeba castellanii and Naegleria gruberi encode UHRF1. Interestingly, these two species also encode CDCA7 and HELLS.</p>
<p>Having said that, we rephrased this sentence, which reads;
“Species that encode a set of DNMT1, UHRF1, CDCA7 and HELLS are particularly enriched in Viridiplantae and Metazoa.”</p>

<list-item><p>page 11: Sentence containing &quot;..., that the function of CDCA7-like proteins is strongly linked to HELLS and DNMT1,...&quot; What do the authors mean with &quot;the function of CDCA7-like proteins&quot;? And what happened to DNMT3?</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our observation that almost all species that contain CDCA7 (including fungal CDCA7F) also have DNMT1 and HELLS, despite the frequent loss of these genes in species that do not contain CDCA7, indicates “that the function of CDCA7-like proteins is strongly linked to HELLS and DNMT1”. We found only 2 species that possesses CDCA7 (class I or class II) but not DNMT1 among the panel of 180 species. These 2 exceptional species, Naegleria gruberi and Taphrina deformans, do encode UHRF1-like proteins and a DNMT (an orphan DNMT in N. gruberi and DNMT4 in T. deformans). In contrast, we found 26 species that possess CDCA7 (or CDCA7F) but not DNMT3 (Table S1), so the linkage between CDCA7 and DNMT3 is weaker.</p>

<list-item><p>page 11: Sentence containing &quot;..., CDCA7 is lost from this gene cluster in parasitoid wasps, including Ichneumonoidea wasps and chalcid wasps&quot;. This sentence is confusing because already in an earlier paragraph the authors say that &quot;Microplitis demolitor lost CDCA7&quot; and in the following sentence they say &quot;...among Ichneumonoidea wasps, CDCA7 appears to be lost in the Braconidae clade, ...&quot;. It would greatly help this reader if the authors could streamline these sentences and also decide on whether CDCA7 is lost in M. demolitor or CDCA7 appears to be lost in M.demolitor.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>The confusion was in part due to the difficulty in differentiating between the true loss of a gene versus its apparent absence in a species due to an incomplete genome assembly, including for of M. demolitor. To verify that the loss of CDCA7 was not due to gaps in the genome assembly, we executed the synteny analysis. However, we edited this section to improve the readability (Page 12-13).</p>

<p>What could be the role for HELLS/CDCA7 in insect DNA methylation? In several cases, the authors analyses reveal co-evolutionary links between DNMT3 (DNMT3A?) and CDCA7/HELLS. I do not understand why this finding is not really discussed by the authors. Instead there is a strong focus on replication-uncoupled DNA methylation maintenance. Could the authors elaborate why?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The role of DNA methylation in insects is largely unclear, so discussion must be highly speculative. A recent finding in the clonal raider ant, showing that DNMT1 is not essential for development but is critical for oogenesis, pointed toward a possible more universal role of DNA methylation in meiosis. Stimulated from a finding in Neurospora, where DNA methylation is required for homolog pairing during meiosis, we discuss a speculative model that DNA methylation status acts as a hallmark to distinguish between healthy/young DNA and old/mutated (or competitive/pathogenic) DNA at homolog pairing during meiosis (page 14).</p>
<p>Regarding the cases where CDCA7 and DNMT3 are co-lost, we had discussed about this phenomenon at the last section of Result, stating, “This co-loss of CDCA7 and DNA methylation (together with either DNMT1-UHRF1or DNMT3) in braconid wasps suggests that evolutionary preservation of CDCA7 is more sensitive to DNA methylation status per se than to the presence or absence of a particular DNMT subtype.” Please note that we found several lineages that lacks CDCA7 but has DNMT1 (and DNMT3), whereas almost all species that has CDCA7 also has DNMT1 (but not necessarily DNMT3). Supported with our CoPAP analyses, our results indicate the tight functional link between CDCA7 and DNMT1, but it does not necessarily mean that CDCA7 does not play any role related to DNMT3 or de novo methylation. Clarification of this point and our speculation of how CDCA7 loss is linked to reduced requirement of DNA methylation are discussed in page 13 and 14 with additional texts.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is inferred from the well-known role of DNA methylation in bacteria for defending against phage viruses. However, it was not correct to state that such a function was inherited from prokaryotes. It should be stated that it was inherited from the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). We also admit that it is not clear if such an immunity-related role was inherited from LUCA, or if it emerged through convergent evolution. Therefore, we amended this description to emphasize our hypothesis that the advent of CDCA7 was “a key step to transmit the DNA methylation system from the LUCA to the eukaryotic ancestor with nucleosome-containing genomes”.</p>

<p>Not to our knowledge. However, as we realized that absence of DNA methylation in Aphidius ervi was previously reported (Bewick et al 2017), we now included this data together with presence/absence analysis of DNMT1, UHRF1, DNMT3, CDCA7 and HELLS. Known presence/absence of DNA methylation is now shown in Fig.7.</p>

</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>To address these points, we made new multisequence alignments using MUSCLE v6 and generated phylogenetic trees using the maximum likelihood-based IQ-TREE 2, where multiple models were screened. A consensus tree was generated after 1000 bootstrap replicates from the best alignment and model. The topology and assignment of these new trees were largely consistent with the original trees, except for some corrections in DNMT assignment as discussed below.</p>
<p>1. We realized that we erroneously missed DNMT5 orthologs of Leucosporidium creatinivorum, Postia placenta, Armillaria gallica and Saitoella complicata., and DNMT6 orthologs from Fragilariopsis cylindrus reported in Huff et al 2014 (PMID 24630728). They are now included in the new list and CoPAP analysis.</p>
<p>2. DNMT4 orthologs were identified in Fragilariopsis cylindrus and Thalassiosira pseudonana by Huff et al 2014 (PMID 24630728), but in our original phylogenetic analysis, these proteins form a distinct clade between DNMT1/Dim-2 and DNMT4. The new tree and classification are more consistent with Huff et al, so we present the new tree in Fig. S6 and conducted the classification based on this tree.</p>
<p>Beside Fig. S6, we decided to maintain original Fig. S1, S3 and S4 (with a few adjustments) for better visibility, but we included the results of IQ-TREE analysis as Dataset S1-S3.</p>
<p>The CoPAP analysis based on the revised assignment slightly changed the topology of coevolutionary linkages. In addition, we obtained a slightly different result depending on whether fungal specific CDCA7 with class II zn-4CXXC_R1 (now referred to as CDCA7F) is included as a CDCA7 ortholog or not. Despite this difference, we reproducibly observed the coevolutionary linkage between CDCA7 and DNMT1- UHRF1.</p>

<list-item><p>Be more careful with wording: RBH is not sufficient to call gene/proteins orthologs (e.g. Page 8). The above mentioned method will help you support this claim (+ synteny when you can).</p>

<p>We were aware of this issue. This is why we conducted phylogenetic tree building based on sequence alignment of full-length HELLS (Fig. S3) and SNF2 domain only (Fig. S4), as explained in the text. We found that the RBH criterion is robust in Metazoa; orthologs are easily recognizable with very low E-value (0.0) and extensive homology over the full length of the protein, while synteny is not practical to employ in the diverse set of species.</p>

<p>“A method to calculate p-value for CoPAP was described previously (Cohen et al., 2012, PMID 22962457). Briefly, for each pair of tested genes, Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed. Parametric bootstrapping was used to compute a p-value by comparing it with a simulated correlation coefficient calculated based on a null distribution of independently evolving pairs with a comparable exchangeability (a value reporting the likelihood of gene gain and loss events across the tree).”</p>
