<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Mounting evidence showed that the genetic association of ORMDL3 (ORMDL Sphingolipid Biosynthesis Regulator 3) gene polymorphisms with bronchial asthma and various inflammatory disorders. Yet its role in type I interferon (IFN) signaling remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that ORMDL3 is a negative modulator of the type I IFN signaling by engaging in an interaction with MAVS (Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling protein) and subsequently directing RIG-I (Retinoic Acid-Inducible Gene I) for proteasome-mediated degradation. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) assays uncovered that ORMDL3 binds to USP10 (Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 10), which forms a complex with and stabilizes RIG-I through decreasing its K48-linked ubiquitination. ORMDL3 thus disrupts the interaction between USP10 and RIG-I, thereby promoting RIG-I degradation. Additionally, subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models in C57BL/6 mice revealed that inhibition of ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor efficacy by augmenting the proportion of cytotoxic CD8 positive T cells and IFN production in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, our findings reveal the pivotal roles of ORMDL3 in the maintenance of antiviral innate immune responses and anti-tumor immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Type I interferons (IFN-Is) play a key role in the innate immune response to viral infections. under viral stimulations, cells produce and release interferons, which subsequently induce the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Besides their critical role in antiviral immune responses, growing evidence suggests that type I interferons (IFNs) produced by malignant tumor cells or infiltrating immune cells also influence the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Many traditional chemotherapeutic drugs, targeted anti-cancer drugs, immunoadjuvants, and oncolytic viruses require intact type I IFN signaling to exert their full effects <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, studies have shown that high intratumoral expression levels of type I IFN or IFN-stimulated genes are associated with favorable disease outcomes in cancer patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In response to viral RNA molecules, RLRs (RIG-I-like receptors) exposed its CARD domain and then cooperate with mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and TANK-binding kinase1(TBK1) to promote the production of type I interferon and transcription of different interferon-stimulated genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, targeting RLRs can provoke anti-infection activities, moreover, RLRs also play an important role in anti-tumor immunity,for example, targeting RLRs sensitize “immune-cold” tumors to “immune hot” tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors facilitates upregulation of endogenous retroviruses in tumor cells, whch induce the activation of the RLR RNA recognition pathway that potentiates immune checkpoint therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. SB 9200, also referred to as inarigivir soproxil or GS-9992 is a dinucleotide agonist of RIG-I and nucleotide binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, is in clinical trials to treat chronically infected HCV patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Another RIG-I agonist MK-4621 appears to be safe and tolerable for patients with advanced or recurrent tumors, with no dose-limiting toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The post-transcriptional modifications (PTMs) of RIG-I is vital for its activation and stability. Several E3-ligases have been reported for K63- or K48-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I and regulate RLR pathway. K63-linked ubiquitination mediated by TRIM25<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and Mex-3 RNA binding family member C (MEX3C) in CARD region of RIG-I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, or mediated by RNF135 in RIG-I C-terminus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>, facilitates RLR signal transduction. In addition to K63 ubiquitination that usually associates with signal transduction pathways. classical degradative K48-linked polyubiquitylation also regulates RIG-I’s stability. Several E3 ligases such as Cbl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, ring finger protein 122 (RNF122)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, RNF125<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> and TRIM40<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Conversely, the expression of RIG-I is also regulated by several deubiquitylating enzymes. For instance, ubiquitin specific peptidase 3 (USP3), USP21, and CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD), RIG-I K63-polyubiquitin chains were removed by them and thus regulates RLR signaling pathway. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>, Deubiquitinase USP4 and USP15 can increase the stability of RIG-I and TRIM25 by removing K48 ubiquitination from them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Discovering new protein machines regulating the activity or stability of RIG-I will provide new insights and targets for antiviral and anti-tumor therapies.</p>
<p>ORMDL3 is part of the three-member ORMDL gene family, which also includes ORMDL1 and ORMDL2. It encodes a 153-amino acid transmembrane protein that is primarily located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Genetic variants in <italic>ORMDL3</italic> is associated with sphingolipid synthesis and altered metabolism,which contributing to asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Recent evidence has elucidated that eosinophil trafficking, recruitment, and degranulation was regulated by ORMDL3, This regulation may contribute to the development of allergic asthma and potentially other eosinophilic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, ORMDL3 polymorphisms also contribute to a diverse set of inflammatory disorders that include bronchial asthma, inflammatory bowel disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>, ankylosing spondylitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, atherosclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, SLE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> and cholangitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, the role of ORMDL3 in innate immunity remains unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, we illuminate ORMDL3 as a pivotal negative regulator of the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway. ORMDL3 forms a complex with MAVS and subsequently directs RIG-I toward degradation. ORMDL3 amplifies the K48-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by disrupting the interaction between RIG-I and UPS10. Animal experiments showed that inhibiting ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor activity, demonstrated by an augmented proportion of activated CD8+ T cells and increased interferon production within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Collectively, our results unveil the critical role of ORMDL3 in maintaining the homeostasis of antiviral innate immune responses and suggesting ORMDL3 as a candidate target for cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<title>ORMDL3 negatively regulates RLR induced type I IFN signaling pathway</title>
<p>In order to investigate the potential role of ORMDL3 in the antiviral response, HEK293T cell overexpression ORMDL3 was stimulated with polyI:C or VSV infection. The result showed that ORMDL3 significantly inhibited polyI:C and VSV stimulated transcription of <italic>IFNB1</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Western blots demonstrated a marked reduction in the phosphorylation level of IRF3 when ORMDL3 was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Ectopic expressed ORMDL3 in A549 cells attenuated <italic>IFNB1</italic> expression induced by polyI:C but not polyG:C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed in parallel experiments using primary mouse BMDM cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These findings highlight ORMDL3 as a repressor of RNA-induced type I IFN expression. To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the suppression of type I IFN signaling by ORMDL3, luciferase reporter assays were performed. ORMDL3 was found to decrease the luciferase reporter activity induced by RIG-I, while showing no effect on cGAS/STING or TRIF (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The ISRE luciferase reporter assay also showed similar result (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). We constructed an ORMDL3 stable knockdown cell line of A549 to examine the role of ORMDL3 on viral replication. We found that ORMDL3 knockdown strikingly suppressed the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and overexpression ORMDL3 enhanced the replication of VSV (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). We also infected the A549 stable knockdown cell line with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), and there is no significance between shNC and shORMDL3 cell lines (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). These results suggest that ORMDL3 only facilitates RNA virus replication but not DNA virus, which coincides with the finding that ORMDL3 specifically represses RNA but not DNA induced type I interferon expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>We next evaluated the influence of VSV, HSV-1 and RIG-I agonist SB9200 on ORMDL3 expression. Given the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site rs7216389 at ORMDL3 locus is associated with the susceptibility of childhood asthma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> and virus-induced respiratory wheezing illnesses <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, we took the genotype of this SNP into account. Upon these stimulations, HSV-1 does not obviously alter the abundance of ORMDL3 (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A</xref>). For VSV and SB920, the expression of ORMDL3 is downregulated in some cell lines and is independent of the SNP (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1B,S1C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that ORMDL3 is a negative regulator of RLR RNA sensing pathway, and its expression is reciprocally repressed by this pathway.</p>

<title>ORMDL3 regulates the protein abundance of RIG-I</title>
<p>Further RT-PCR results indicated that ectopic expression of ORMDL3 inhibited <italic>IFNB1</italic> mRNA expression and transcription of downstream genes <italic>CCL5</italic> and <italic>CXCL10</italic> induced by RIG-I and MAVS but not TBK1 or IRF3-5D (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A,2B</xref>,<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">S2A</xref>). Additionally, MDA5-induced IFN upregulation was also inhibited by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2B</xref>). These results revealed that ORMDL3 negatively regulates RLR pathway. Owing to ORMDL3 was down-regulated in response to VSV stimulation in HEK293T, so we firstly transfected cells with siORMDL3 followed by secondary transfection with RIG-I-N (an active form of RIG-I) in HEK293T, and we found that siORMDL3 significantly increase the expression of <italic>IFNB1</italic>,<italic>CCL5</italic> and <italic>ISG54</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as the protein abundance of RIG-I (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Subsequent experiments involving various signaling proteins such as RIG-I (WT/N), MDA5, TBK1, and IRF3 indicated a negative correlation between ORMDL3 levels and RIG-I/RIG-I-N protein expression, with maximal degradation observed in RIG-I-N (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, we also tested whether overexpressing mice Ormdl3 will also lead to mice Rig-i degradation, Interestingly we discovered that mice Rig-I and human RIG-I both can be degraded upon ORMDL3 overexpression, implying that ORMDL3’s function is conservative in human and mice (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2C</xref><bold>,D</bold>). In addition, ORMDL3 overexpression also eliminated endogenous RIG-I protein abundance (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2E</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on these obervations, we focus on the relationship between RIG-I and ORMDL3. We ectopically expressed an increasing amount of Flag-ORMDL3 with the RIG-I-N (harbors two CARD domains) and the RIG-I-C truncated form (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2F</xref>), and found that ORMDL3 only decreased protein abundance of RIG-I-N (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). We co-transfected ORMDL3 and RIG-I with or without polyI:C and found that RIG-I was degraded upon the stimulation of polyI:C, suggesting that ORMDL3 degrades RIG-I only when it was activated and the CARD domain was exposed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Further examination showed that co-expression of ORMDL3 suppressed RIG-I-N induced expression of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and <italic>CCL5</italic>, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>TNF</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting its role on both NF-κB and type I interferon pathways. Given the regulation of ORMDL3 on NF-κB has been reported, we focused on its role in the type I interferon pathway.</p>

<title>ORMDL3 promotes the proteasome degradation of RIG-I</title>
<p>Two major protein degradation pathways including the ubiquitin proteasome pathway and lysosoml proteolysis system. We next identified which degradation system dominantly mediates the degradation of RIG-I by ORMDL3. We co-expressed ORMDL3 and RIG-I and treated cells with proteasome inhibitor MG132, and lysosome inhibitor CQ. We found the degradation of RIG-I mediated by ORMDL3 could be blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not lysosome inhibitor CQ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). To rule out the possibility of transcriptional down-regulation of RIG-I, RT-PCR analysis was performed, confirming that the decrease in RIG-I protein was a post-transcriptional event (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>). To investigate the mechanism, we co-transfected RIG-I-N, ORMDL3 and plasmids encoding different form of ubiquitin. The results indicated an increase in K48-linked ubiquitin chains on RIG-I-N, implicating ORMDL3 in promoting proteasomal degradation of RIG-I (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). To pinpoint the lysine residues crucial for RIG-I ubiquitination, we engineered a mutant version of RIG-I-N in which all lysines were mutated to arginines, denoted as RIG-I-N-KR. Intriguingly, the degradation-promoting effect of ORMDL3 on RIG-I-N-KR was nullified (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Given there are 18 lysine residues in RIG-I-N, we generated two mutants, mutant1 and mutant2, each mutating the last nine lysines and the first nine lysines (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B</xref>). Remarkably, the results showed that mutant1 was resistant to degradation by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the last nine lysines on RIG-I-N mediated its degradation induced by ORMDL3.</p>

<p>To delve deeper into the intricate mechanism of ORMDL3-induced degradation of RIG-I, we initially introduced single-point mutations, specifically K146R, K154R, K164R, and K172R <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>, which have been reported important for the function and stability of RIG-I. Co-transfection with ORMDL3 revealed that these individual mutations did not impede the degradation process, hinting at potential cooperation of lysine residues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). We then mutated all four lysine residues and assessed ORMDL3-induced RIG-I-N degradation. Strikingly, the RIG-I-N-4KR mutant, in which K146, K154, K164, and K172 were simultaneously mutated to arginines, displayed resistance to degradation by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). At the meantime, the 4KR mutant failed to exhibit the upregulation of K48-linked ubiquitination induced by ORMDL3 overexpression, reinforcing the pivotal role played by K146, K154, K164 and K172 in mediating RIG-I ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition, we found that in mice primary BMDM when ORMDL3 was overexpressed, endogenous RIG-I was downregulated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>).</p>

<p>To map the essential domains of ORMDL3 that mediate its association with MAVS, we generated different truncations of ORMDL3 based on the structure, which includes four truncations 1-42, 43-82, 83-118, 119-153 (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>).

In addition, co-transfection of RIG-I-N-Myc with individual ORMDL3 truncations showed that each domain of ORMDL3 is favorable to RIG-I-N degradation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). Moreover, inspired by Guo et al.’s discovery of a naturally occurring short isoform of ORMDL3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, we engineered N- and C-terminal truncations of ORMDL3 to mimic this isoform (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref>), results revealing that both truncations retained the ability to interact with MAVS (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>). Luciferase assays and RT-PCR affirmed the inhibitory efficacy of each domain (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D, E</xref>). we also tested whether these different domains can promote the degradation of RIG-I-N, results revealed that every domain can amplify the degradation of RIG-I (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4F</xref>). To further validate the association between ORMDL3 and MAVS, we did FRET experiment in Hela cells, we overexpressed YFP-MAVS(donor) and CFP-ORMDL3(acceptor), when we bleached YFP-MAVS, and we noticed that the fluorescence of CFP-ORMDL3 enhanced (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>USP10 deubiquitinates and stablizes RIG-I</title>
<p>To identify the E3 ligase or deubiquitinase involved in ORMDL3-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, we conducted immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis using Flag-ORMDL3 as bait and identified USP10 as a potential candidate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Subsequent co-IP validation demonstrated the interaction between ORMDL3 and USP10 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>), Subsequent co-IP experiment showed the interaction between USP10 and RIG-I (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the RIG-I level is decreased in USP10 stable knockdown 293T cells while overexpression of USP10 promotes the accumulation of RIG-I (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D,5E</xref>). As USP10 is a deubiquitinase, we investigated its impact on RIG-I ubiquitination and observed a decrease in K48 ubiquitination of RIG-I upon USP10 overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Co-expression RIG-I-N or its 4KR mutant with USP10 showed that USP10 failed to increase the RIG-I-N-4KR level, underscoring the indispensability of these residues (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>). Upon overexpressing RIG-I-N and ORMDL3 in USP10 knockdown cells, ORMDL3’s ability to degrade RIG-I was markedly compromised, emphasizing the indispensable role of USP10 in this degradation process (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>).

<title>ORMDL3 disturbs USP10 induced RIG-I stabilization</title>
<p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments unveiled robust interactions between USP10 and both RIG-I and ORMDL3, with ORMDL3 demonstrating the ability to disrupt the RIG-I-USP10 interaction (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). Crucially, USP10 exhibited a specific role in stabilizing RIG-I, but not other innate proteins such as MAVS, MDA5 and IRF3, and this effect can be reversed by ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Further investigations showed that the function of ORMDL3 in disturbing USP10-mediated RIG-I stabilization could be rescued by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but not the lysosome inhibitor CQ (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Subsequent co-transfection experiments delineated that mutations affecting all lysines (KR) or the last nine lysines (mutant1) of RIG-I-N were necessary to prevent USP10-induced accumulation and ORMDL3-mediated degradation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). Notably, single-point mutation of the K146, K154, K164, and K172 residues on RIG-I-N does not affect the regulation of USP10 and ORMDL3 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>), while the 4KR mutation abolished this process (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>). These findings underscored the importance of these four lysine residues in both ORMDL3-mediated degradation and USP10-stabilization of RIG-I. Building upon these observations, we sought to elucidate whether USP10 stabilizes RIG-I through these four sites. Co-expression of HA-K48Ub and RIG-I-N-GFP with or without USP10 revealed a decrease in K48 ubiquitination of RIG-I by USP10, while this effect was nullified in the presence of the 4KR mutant, consistent with ORMDL3-mediated regulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>).

<title>Knock down of ORMDL3 enhance anti-tumor immunity</title>
<p>To assess the impact of ORMDL3 on anti-tumor activity, we conducted knockdown experiments targeting ORMDL3 in LLC and MC38 murine cancer cell lines, followed by subcutaneous inoculation into C57BL/6 mice. Remarkably, the deficiency of ORMDL3 significantly suppressed LCC tumor growth and reduced the tumor formation rate compared to the control group (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A-C</xref>). This tumor growth inhibition by targeting ORMDL3 was further validated in the MC38 cancer model (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G-I</xref>). Moreover, both in LLC and MC38 knocked down cell lines, the protein level of RIG-I was significantly upregulated (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5D-G</xref>), and this RIG-I upregulation was further verified by westernblots in LLC tumors (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure S5C</xref>) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in MC38 tumors (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7K</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The RIG-I MAVS pathway is essential for the early detection of viral infections and the initiation of an effective antiviral immune response, There are mainly two downstream signaling events of the RIG-I MAVS pathway including interferon signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokine signaling pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. During the process of producing type I interferons, MAVS recruit TBK1 amd then phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 and leading to the production of type I interferons.</p>
<p>And the pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling pathway mainly through the activation of NF-κB, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6,TNF etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. RIG-I’s activation is vital fo innate immunity, and its post-translational modification is important, for example,TRIM25,TRIM4, RNF135,RNF194, which facilitates RIG-I activation by mediating RIG-I’s K63-linked ubiquitination, meanwhile, there are also some E3 ligases mediate K48 ubiquitination of RIG-I, such as RNF125, RNF122, RNF55 and carboxyl terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>, promote its degradation through ubiquitin proteasome pathway, thus attenuates cascade activation. Researchers found that some deubiquitylating enzymes also play an important role in mediating RIG-I activity, for example USP3,USP21 and CYLD,they regulate RIG-I activity by removing K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, In our study, we uncovered that USP10 stablize RIG-I by decreasing its K48 ubiquitination on lysine 146,154,164,172.</p>
<p>Research on ORMDL3 mainly focus on exploring its relationship with asthma and its exacerbations, initially,it was acknowledged that it is associated with rhinovirus infection, mechanism investigation recovered that ORMDL3 regulates intercullular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) expression and regulates ceramide and sphingolipid metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. However, the effects of ORMDL3 proteins on human innate immunity have rarely been reported. In our study, we found that the mRNA level of <italic>IFNB1</italic> and ISGs was severely impaired in ORMDL3-overexpressing cells in response to viral infection (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) and significantly increased when ORMDL3 was knocked down and co-express with RIG-I-N (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). These data confirmed that ORMDL3 acts as a negative regulator of antiviral innate immune responses. ORMDL3 is a multiple transmembrane structural protein located in the center of the SPT complex, serving to stabilize the SPT assembly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Co-IP experiments showed that the ER protein ORMDL3 interacts with mitochondrial protein MAVS, suggesting that there may exist scaffold protein to mediate their interaction. ORMDL3 is reported to associate with calcium transportation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>, in the meantime the calcium transfer between ER and mitochondria plays an important role in protein synthesis, so perhaps some ERMCs proteins mediate the interaction between ORMDL3 and MAVS. Furthermore, We discovered that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10 stabilizes RIG-I and ORMDL3 disturbs this process to negatively regulates IFN production. When USP10 was knockdown, ORMDL3 overexpression could not facilitate RIG-I-N degradation anymore, suggesting that USP10 plays an indispensable role in ORMDL3 mediating RIG-I degradation.</p>
<p>Collectively, we identified ORMDL3 as a negative regulator of type I interferon pathway and anti-cancer immunity. The working model is that ORMDL3 forms a complex with MAVS and promotes the degradation of RIG-I thus attenuating the transcription of type I IFN, In addition, constraining ORMDL3 can enhance IFN signaling and the proportion of cytotoxic CD8 T cell (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). The negative regulatory loop of antiviral innate immunity and anti-tumor activity involving ORMDL3 could offer insights that contribute to the development of therapeutics targeting viral infections and tumors.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aim to investigate the role of ORMDL3 in regulating Type 1 interferon (IFN) responses and its effect on tumor growth inhibition. The study focuses on the mechanisms involving the RIG-I pathway and USP10-mediated degradation and attempts to establish a link between ORMDL3 expression and the effectiveness of cancer therapy. The authors also explore the broader implications of ORMDL3 in immune signaling, particularly within the context of Type 1 IFN signaling and its therapeutic potential.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• The manuscript explores a novel aspect of cancer immunology by examining the relationship between ORMDL3 and Type 1 IFN signaling, potentially offering new therapeutic avenues.</p>
<p>
• A variety of experimental approaches are employed, including knockdown models, overexpression assays, and protein interaction analyses, to elucidate the role of ORMDL3 in modulating immune responses.</p>
<p>
• The findings suggest a potential mechanism by which ORMDL3 affects the tumor microenvironment and immune responses, which could have significant implications for understanding cancer progression and therapy.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The study does not clearly establish the relationship between Type 1 IFN and cancer therapy, and more robust data are needed to support the claim that tumor growth inhibition occurs via Type 1 IFN upregulation following ORMDL3 knockdown.</p>
<p>
• There is ambiguity regarding whether ORMDL3 has a positive or negative role in the Type 1 IFN pathway, especially given conflicting findings in the literature that link higher ORMDL3 levels to increased Type 1 IFN expression.</p>
<p>
• The use of certain experimental models, such as HEK293T cells (which are not typical Type 1 IFN producers), raises concerns about the validity and generalizability of the results. Further clarity is needed regarding the rationale for using the same tag in overexpression experiments.</p>
<p>
• The manuscript contains several inconsistencies and lacks detailed explanations of critical areas, such as the mechanism by which ORMDL3 facilitates USP10 transfer to RIG-I despite no direct interaction between ORMDL3 and RIG-I.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identified ORMDL3 as a negative regulator of the RLR pathway and anti-tumor immunity. Mechanistically, ORMDL3 interacts with MAVS and further promotes RIG-I for proteasome degradation. In addition, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP10 stabilizes RIG-I and ORMDL3 disturbs this process. Moreover, in subcutaneous syngeneic tumor models in C57BL/6 mice, they showed that inhibition of ORMDL3 enhances anti-tumor efficacy by augmenting the proportion of cytotoxic CD8-positive T cells and IFN production in the tumor microenvironment (TME).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper has a clearly arranged structure and the English is easy to understand. It is well written. The results are clearly supporting the conclusion.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer’s concern. In Figure 6 we detected the expression of IFNB1 and ISGs in MC38 and LLC tumor upon ORMDL3 knockdown. At the mean time, we also used IHC to explore the abundance of RIG-I and ORMDL3 in these tumors. In addition, in figure S5 we performed western blots to detect the expression of RIG-I with or without ORMDL3 knockdown. All these results support our hypothesis that that ORMDL3 is a negative regulator of interferon via modulating RIG-I abundance.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. In our system and experiments, we validated that ORMDL3 is a negative regulator of interferon, although there is also literature that links higher ORMDL3 levels to increased type-I IFN response. ORMDL3 has been reported associated with rhinovirus-induced childhood asthma (Nature.  2007;448(7152):470-473; N Engl J Med. 2013 Apr 11;368(15):1398-407), and ORMDL3 level is positively associated with rhinovirus abundance (N Engl J Med. 2013 Apr 11;368(15):1398-407).  There are reports indicating that ORMDL3 supports the replication of rhinovirus (for example, Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2020 Jun;62(6):783-792). This phenomenon is consistent with our findings that higher ORMDL3 expression leads to lower interferon production, which facilitates viral replication. We believe that the different experimental conclusions obtained in these experiments are due to different experiment condition and different stimulation. In our research, we provided comprehensive studies at the molecular, cellular, and animal levels to support the conclusion that ORMDL3 is a negative regulator of type-I interferon.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer’s suggestion. Besides HEK293T, in Figure 1C and 1D we also used A549 and BMDM to overexpress ORMDL3 and stimulate them with polyI:C or polyG:C, Our results showed that ORMDL3 especially inhibits RLR signaling. Additionally, in Figure 3H we found that the endogenous RIG-I expression decreased when we overexpressed ORMDL3 in BMDM. Regarding the issue of using different protein tags, we plan to use different tags to validate our results.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>There are some ERMC (ER-mitochondria contact) proteins that mediate the interaction between ER and mitochondria. ORMDL3 locates in ER, and it has been reported to be associated with calcium transportation. At the meantime, the calcium transfer between ER and mitochondria plays an important role in protein synthesis. It is possible that some ERMC proteins mediate the interaction between ORMDL3 and MAVS. In addition,  we also validated that ORMDL3 interacts with USP10 (Figure 5B). Although ORMDL3 and RIG-I do not interact directly, we generated a mechanistic model that ORMDL3 and MAVS recruit USP10 and RIG-I to ERMCS respectively, thus USP10 could form a complex with RIG-I (Figure 5C) and regulate the stability of RIG-I upon RNA sensing.</p>
