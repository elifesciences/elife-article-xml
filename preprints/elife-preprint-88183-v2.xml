<title>Abstract</title><p>Periodontitis, one of the most common non-communicable diseases, is characterized by chronic oral inflammation and uncontrolled tooth supporting alveolar bone resorption. Its underlying mechanism to initiate aberrant oral barrier immunity has yet to be delineated. Here, we report a unique fibroblast subpopulation <underline>a</underline>ctivated to <underline>g</underline>uide oral inflammation (AG fibroblasts) identified in a single-cell RNA sequencing gingival cell atlas constructed from the mouse periodontitis models. AG fibroblasts localized beneath the gingival epithelium and in the cervical periodontal ligament responded to the ligature placement and to the discrete application of Toll-like receptor stimulants to mouse maxillary tissue. The upregulated chemokines and ligands of AG fibroblasts linked to the putative receptors of neutrophils in the early stages of periodontitis. In the established chronic inflammation, neutrophils together with AG fibroblasts appeared to induce type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) that were the primary source of interleukin-17 cytokines. The comparative analysis of <italic>Rag2</italic>-/- and <italic>Rag2γc</italic>-/-mice suggested that ILC3 contributed to the cervical alveolar bone resorption interfacing the gingival inflammation. We propose that AG fibroblasts function as a previously unrecognized surveillant to initiate gingival inflammation leading to periodontitis through the AG fibroblast-neutrophil-ILC3 axis.</p>

<title>Summary of Updates:</title>
<fn fn-type="update"><p>We discovered a new subpopulation of gingival fibroblasts, named AG fibroblasts, using non-biased single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of mouse gingival samples undergoing the development of ligature-induced periodontitis. AG fibroblasts exhibited a unique gene expression profile: the ligature-induced upregulation of Toll-Like Receptors and their downstream signals as well as chemokines such as CXCL12. Thus, we have hypothesized that AG fibroblasts initially sense the pathological stress including oral microbial stimuli and secrete inflammatory signals through chemokine expression.
The original manuscript examined the relationship between AG fibroblasts and oral barrier immune cells focusing on the chemokines and other ligands derived from AG fibroblasts and their putative receptors in those immune cells. Using scRNA-seq data mining programs, our data demonstrated the compelling evidence that AG fibroblasts should play a critical role in orchestrating the oral barrier immunity, at least at the early stages of periodontal inflammation.
We agree with public comments, editors' comments and reviewers' comments that it is important to further explore the functional/pathological role of AG fibroblasts. In this revision, we investigated the role of TLRs in the pathogen sensing mechanism of AG fibroblasts. To accomplish this goal, we applied a newly developed mouse model in which mice were exposed to the maxillary topical application (MTA) of oral microbial pathogens without the ligature placement. With 1 hr exposure with human oral biofilm, not with planktonic microbiota, the mice maxillary tissue exhibited measurable degradation as evidenced by the activation of cathepsin K. To dissect the role of TLRs, we applied the putative stimulants of TLR9 and TLR2/4 using the discrete MTA model. The scRNA-seq from the MTA model revealed that the application of unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide and P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, induced the activation of chemokines by AG fibroblast.
The additional figures and corresponding results, discussion and materials &amp; methods were included.
Furthermore, Abstract, Introduction and Discussion were revised to highlight the role of AG fibroblasts in the context of oral barrier immunity.</p></fn>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The oral mucosa is one of the most active barrier tissues in the human body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>] and oral barrier immunity acts as a crucial surveillance system, which must defend from pathogenic organisms, while ensuring sustained tolerance of commensal microbes and harmless antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. However, once this gingival inflammation progresses, adjacent alveolar bone supporting the cervical area of the dentition is subjected to a localized, but often severe, osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in tooth loss and disruption of the maxillofacial structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>]. Periodontitis is not only the most frequent cause of tooth loss in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>], but also, globally, ranks among the most significant contributors to poor health and decreased quality of life, imposing substantial economic and healthcare burdens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]. It is therefore acutely important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of gingival inflammation, in order to facilitate the development of effective preventive and therapeutic measures for this debilitating condition.</p>
<p>The postulated pathological framework has been reconstructed from animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], harvested immune cell analyses, and oral microbial associations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>]. For example, the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model has shown that fully developed periodontal inflammation is closely associated with the abundant recruitment and excessive activation of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>] and pathological induction of interleukin (IL)-17–secreting proinflammatory effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th)17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Based on our current understanding of osteoimmunology, it was hypothesized that these pathological immune cells activate osteoclasts, leading to induction of periodontal alveolar bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. However, the precise cascade of events leading to this disease outcome has not been fully deciphered.</p>
<p>Investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying interaction between different inflammatory cell fractions in immunological disorders is an intense area of research. Prior studies have shown that chemokines are involved in the trafficking and activation of inflammatory cells during both homeostasis and disease-associated inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]. These small proteins, which typically contain disulfide cysteine–cysteine (CC) and cysteine–X–cysteine (CXC) molecular signatures, act as ligands for cellular receptors that modulate inflammatory signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. Such chemokine–receptor networks direct the migration of inflammatory cells, potentially amplifying the resulting tissue damage. However, increasing evidence suggests that in addition to immune cells, barrier tissue stromal cells are involved in innate immune cell regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. We and others have found that oral fibroblasts secrete cytokines and chemokines in response to microbial stimuli or a proinflammatory environment, suggesting a possible mechanism by which they may regulate immune cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]. Therefore, a comprehensive elucidation of chemokine–receptor signaling networks will likely need to include all types of gingival cells.</p>
<p>In the present study, to better understand the pathways contributing to chronic oral inflammation, we constructed the gingival single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the ligature-induced periodontitis mouse model as well as the newly developed mouse model of maxillary topical application (MTA) of pathological oral microbial biofilm component(s), discretely mimicking the initial events of gingival inflammation and degradation. Here we report a novel subpopulation of fibroblasts <underline>a</underline>ctivated to <underline>g</underline>uide chronic inflammation (AG fibroblasts). Our findings suggest that chemokines and ligands derived from AG fibroblasts bind to and activate receptors involved in neutrophil and lymphocytes. We further show that in the fully developed chronic gingival inflammation of the ligature-induced periodontitis model, <italic>Cd4</italic><sup>-</sup> innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) predominantly produce proinflammatory IL-17 cytokines and provide evidence that type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are responsible for cervical alveolar bone resorption in mice—a pathological feature consistent with the human periodontitis disease phenotype. Thus, the results from this study identify the AG fibroblast–neutrophil–ILC3 axis as a previously unrecognized mechanism contributing to pathological inflammation in periodontitis.</p>

<title>Alterations in major cell type proportions during periodontitis development</title>
<p>The alveolar bone and gingival tissue surrounding the maxillary second molar of C57BL/6J mice presented healthy connective tissue supporting the dentition with minimal CD45+ immune cell infiltration and well-developed collagen architecture (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> – <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 1A</xref></bold>). The placement of a ligature around the maxillary left second molar[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>] induced a localized and small gingival connective tissue degradation and infiltration of CD45+ immune cells near the cervical area (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></bold>). The noticeable gingival defect and more prominent though still localized CD45+ immune cell infiltration developed after Day 3 following ligature placement (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> – <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>). On Day 7, the gingival connective tissue was largely degraded, and chronic inflammation was developed (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> – <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>). Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of micro-computed tomography (microCT) images (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 1C</xref></bold>) further revealed a reduction in alveolar bone height starting from Day 3, which progressively increased on Day 7 (<bold><xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref></bold>). Overall, the observed pattern of periodontal tissue degradation was consistent with that reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>].</p>

<p>Left-side palatal gingiva tissue was harvested from mice on Day 0 (<italic>i.e</italic>., healthy gingiva without ligature placement) and on Days 1, 4, and 7 after ligature placement, and gingival cells were dissociated for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>].

<title>Fibroblasts activated to guide leukocyte migration in periodontitis development</title>
<p>We previously identified two distinct subpopulations of gingival fibroblasts, differentiated by expression of type XIV collagen (<italic>Col14a1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>], and these were also detected in our current scRNA-seq data from Day 0 to 7 (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>). Gene ontogeny (GO) enrichment analysis of the <italic>Col14a1</italic>-expressing fibroblast subpopulation revealed expression of major gene clusters related to immune regulation, including “Regulation of leukocyte migration” (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref></bold>). This immune regulatory phenotype appears to be unique to <italic>Col14a1</italic>-expressing fibroblasts, which are therefore referred to as ‘fibroblasts <underline>a</underline>ctivated to <underline>g</underline>uide leukocyte migration’ or AG fibroblasts. The other subpopulation of <italic>Col1a1</italic>-expressing fibroblasts appeared to <underline>k</underline>eep typical fibroblastic features and is thus referred to as KT fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></bold>). GO analysis suggested that KT fibroblasts primarily maintained connective tissue remodeling but did not express an immune regulatory phenotype. An additional fibroblast subpopulation expressing smooth muscle aortic actin 2 (<italic>Acta2</italic>) was detected on Day 7, and these were identified as myofibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>] (MF) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref></bold>).

<title>AG fibroblasts and immune surveillance in early periodontitis development</title>
<p>To further characterize AG fibroblasts and their “Regulation of leukocyte migration” phenotype, we analyzed expression of CC motif chemokine ligands (CCLs) and CXC motif chemokine ligands (CXCLs) within fibroblast subpopulations in our scRNA-seq dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. Results show that AG fibroblasts activated expression of <italic>Ccl8, Ccl11, Ccl19, Cxcl1, Cxcl10</italic>, and <italic>Cxcl12</italic> immediately after ligature placement on Days 1 and 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). Chemokine expression levels then decreased on Day 7, suggesting that AG fibroblasts might initiate early leukocyte migration into gingival tissue. Given that activation of Toll-like receptors (TLR) is known to increase chemokine expression, we further assessed expression of TLRs in fibroblast subpopulations. We found that AG fibroblasts displayed temporal activation of <italic>Tlr2, Tlr3</italic>, and <italic>Tlr4</italic> expression on Days 1 and 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). Similarly, the TLR downstream genes <italic>Myd88, Irak1, Map3k7</italic>, and <italic>RelA</italic> were also expressed on Days 1 and 4 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>).

<p>To validate the presence of AG fibroblasts, Day 1 gingiva and periodontal tissue histological sections were subjected to immunohistochemistry with antibodies against COL14A1 and CXCL12 (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). We detected COL14A1- and CXCL12-positive AG fibroblasts localized near gingival epithelial cells in the connective tissue papillae and free gingiva, as well as in the cervical zone of the periodontal ligament (PDL) space (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). We note that this localization pattern of AG fibroblasts appears to be highly suitable for early immune surveillance during periodontitis pathogenesis. Thus, we have hypothesized that AG fibroblasts initially sense the pathological stress including oral microbial stimuli through TLRs and secrete inflammatory signals through chemokine expression.</p>

<title>Role of AG fibroblasts in myeloid cell activation</title>
<p>The interaction between chemokine ligands and their receptors has been extensively studied. Here, to evaluate the interaction between chemokine ligands strongly expressed by AG fibroblasts and chemokine receptors in innate immune cells, we matched AG fibroblast-expressed chemokines to expression of their putative receptors in myeloid cells. Results show that AG fibroblasts may regulate macrophages via the expression <italic>Ccl8</italic> and <italic>Ccl11</italic>, which encode chemokines that can interact with CC chemokine receptors (CCRs) encoded by <italic>Ccr2</italic> and <italic>Ccr5</italic> in macrophages.

<p>Intercellular communication may occur via other ligand–receptor interactions, which induce downstream target gene expression in recipient cells.

On Day 1, ligand expression was present primarily in AG fibroblasts, whereas on Day 7, MFs also exhibited prominent ligand expression (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref></bold>). Analysis of target gene expression revealed that both macrophages and neutrophils expressed receptors capable of interacting with AG fibroblast ligands on Day 1.

<p>Lastly, we evaluated potential interactions between chemokine ligands expressed by AG fibroblasts and neutrophils and chemokine receptors in innate immune cells. Our data suggest the presence of a chemokine–receptor association between ILC3s and both AG fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref></bold>) and neutrophils (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref></bold>), although interactions with other innate immune cells are also possible. NicheNet analysis further identified potential ligand–target gene associations between lymphocytes, including ILC3s, and both fibroblasts (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref></bold>) and myeloid cells (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9F</xref></bold>). Ligand expression was more prominent in AG fibroblasts than in other fibroblast subpopulations (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9G</xref></bold>) and elevated in neutrophils relative to macrophages (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9H</xref></bold>). Additionally, target gene expression was detected in ILC3s, although it was not specific to these cells (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9I</xref>, <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9J</xref></bold>). Thus, in total, our data suggest a regulatory role for a newly identified AG fibroblast subpopulation in the gingiva, which appears to orchestrate chronic gingival inflammation, at least in the early stages, and to promote alveolar bone resorption via stimulation of neutrophils and ILC3s.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study revealed that the gene signature of a unique and previously uncharacterized subpopulation of gingival fibroblasts, referred to as AG fibroblasts, could possess the functional capability to serve as an oral immune surveillant and to orchestrate the initiate gingival inflammation. Oral barrier immunity presents a complex interaction between different types of immune cells to protect and maintain the oral environment and structure. Given the frequent exposure to a diverse commensal and pathological microbiome, physical and chemical insults, and dietary and airborne antigens, the oral barrier immune mechanism must resiliently establish the highly tolerant homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. This oral immune homeostasis mechanism is not yet fully understood to date; however, the aberrant oral immune response and gingival chronic inflammation leading to periodontitis have provided an important clue to elucidate the oral barrier immunity.</p>
<p>The previous studies suggested gingival intraepithelial γ8T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>], a subset of neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>], macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>], and dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] should serve the candidate immune surveillant in the oral barrier tissue. These immune cells recognize the pathological signals through the TLR sensing mechanism. TLR2<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR4<sup>-/-</sup>, TLR2&amp;4<sup>-/-</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] and TLR9<sup>-/-</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>] mice exhibited the reduced alveolar bone loss in various mouse periodontitis models, suggesting that TLRs indeed played an important role in developing discordant oral barrier immunity. However, these studies did not identify the TLR-carrying surveillant cells centrally involved in initiating the chronic gingival inflammation.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that TLR-expressing gingival fibroblasts may regulate innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>]. In the present study, we found that not all gingival fibroblasts acquired an immune-sensing capability, but rather, AG fibroblasts represented a distinct fibroblast subpopulation, capable of responding to microbial and tissue damage signals to serve initiate immune surveillance. To test if TLR ligands stimulate the AG fibroblast activation, we applied a newly developed mouse system employing the discrete MTA model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The present study used TLR9 ligand: CpG ODN; and TLR2/4 ligand: LPS. Topical application of these TLR ligands to the maxillary gingival tissue activated AG fibroblasts and increased expression of CC and CXC chemokines (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). It was noted that the CpG ODN application did not upregulate <italic>Tlr9</italic> expression, while the LPS application increased <italic>Tlr2/4</italic> expression. <italic>TLR9</italic> mRNA level has not been fully correlated to the chronic inflammatory diseases; however, the pathological activation of TLR9 caused the discordant downstream inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. In the present study, the differential expression of the TLR downstream signaling molecules suggested the ligand specific response by AG fibroblasts. In fact, both stimulants increased the expression of myeloid differentiation marker 88 (<italic>Myd88</italic>), IL1R-associated kinase (<italic>Irak</italic>), mitogen-activated protein kinase (<italic>Map3k7</italic>) and NF-kB subunit <italic>RelA</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>), suggesting that the corresponding TLRs were indeed stimulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. The <italic>Tlr</italic> expression pattern of Day 1 AG fibroblasts was similar to that of the MTA of CpG ODN, whereas the Day 4 AG fibroblasts resembled the <italic>Tlr</italic> expression pattern of the MTA of LPS (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></bold>). It is tempting to speculate that microbial DNA/TLR9 activation of AG fibroblasts may initiate the early pathological process followed by the LPS/TRL2/4 stimulation in the more established periodontal inflammation. Taken together, we hypothesize that AG fibroblasts sensitively detect the microbial signals and play a previously unrecognized role in innate immune regulation during the early periodontitis development.</p>
<p>One of the major observations in the present study was that AG fibroblasts clearly upregulated the chemokine expression only after the pathological stimulation. CCL and CXCL chemokines orchestrate the chronic inflammation through the ligation and activation of their putative chemokine receptors in a specific mechanism. For example, neutrophils express a relatively limited number of chemokine receptors—CXCR2, CXCR4, and CCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. Therefore, neutrophil migration and trafficking to the affected gingiva as well as its pathological transformation in chronic periodontitis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>] may be guided through the specific chemokine-receptor interaction. Consistent with prior studies, we detected the expression of these chemokine receptors in gingival neutrophils, and they were linked to the chemokine ligands expressed by AG fibroblasts—CXCL1, CXCL12, and CCL8, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).</bold> In addition, neutrophils can respond to various chemo-attractants that modulate and finetune various cellular behaviors, such as migration direction, adhesion strength, and functional heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>]. Here, we observed evidence for substantial intracellular communication between AG fibroblasts and neutrophils through ligand–target gene interactions (<bold><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></bold>). Although validation of each putative ligand–receptor interaction is beyond the scope of this study, our data suggest that AG fibroblasts support neutrophil trafficking in both early and established periodontitis lesions.</p>
<p>A primary pathological consequence of periodontitis is uncontrolled alveolar bone resorption, leading to tooth loss, which is thought to be mediated by osteoimmune pathways involving IL-17– expressing Th17 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Surprisingly, analysis of our scRNA-seq revealed that the expression of <italic>Rorc, Il17a</italic>, and <italic>Il17f</italic> was not detected in CD4<sup>+</sup> Th cells, but rather, in lymphocytes with ILC characteristics (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>). ILCs share phenotypic and functional features with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, although they lack antigen-specific T cell receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. The gingival ILCs expressed <italic>Rorc</italic>, <italic>Il17a,</italic> and <italic>Il17f,</italic> but not <italic>Tbx21</italic> and <italic>Gata3,</italic> indicating that they were type 3 ILCs (ILC3s). Notably, recent clinical studies have reported the presence of ILCs in gingiva from human periodontitis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>] and leptin receptor–deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>], although their pathological contributions have not been fully elucidated.</p>
<p>In the present study, we further explored the role of ILC3s in periodontitis-associated bone loss using <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Rag2γc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutation prevents V(D)J recombination required for generating immunoglobulin and T cell receptors, resulting in the production of functionally immature B and T cells, including Th17 cells. However, ILCs do not undergo genomic receptor rearrangements and, thus, are unaffected by <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutation. In contrast, <italic>Rag2γc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice have the additional <italic>Il2rg</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutation, which disables common γ chain cytokines (γc). Therefore, in addition to non-functional B and T cells, these animals also have defective γc-dependent ILCs. The ligature-placed <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibited a reduced number of osteoclasts in the apical PDL area, indicative of reduced bone resorption in this root apical region. By contrast, <italic>Rag2γc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrated a significant loss of bone resorption in both the cervical and apical PDL areas (<bold><xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref></bold>). Human periodontitis induces the localized alveolar bone resorption at the cervical PDL zone interfacing the gingival inflammatory legion. In contrast, apical alveolar bone resorption is observed in clinical cases of root canal infection (apical periodontitis). Therefore, our findings suggest that ILC3s, which are differentially impacted by <italic>Rag2γc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutations, may be primarily responsible for human periodontitis-like cervical alveolar bone resorption near the site of gingival inflammation.</p>
<p>Differentiation of ILC3s and Th17 cells is mediated by similar environmental cues, with IL-6 and IL-23a playing critical roles in both pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref>]. Our present scRNA-seq data (<bold><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref></bold>) suggest that AG fibroblasts and neutrophils are the primary cellular sources of <italic>Il6</italic> during the early and later stages, respectively, of periodontitis development. In contrast, <italic>Il23a</italic> was found to be expressed by a variety of cell types, such as AG fibroblasts, myeloid cells, and multiple subsets of epithelial cells, including those with an EMT phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>]. Further, CC and CXC chemokine– receptor associations between ILC3s and both AG fibroblasts and neutrophils appeared to be non-specific. Therefore, our data suggest that rather than a specific trigger, the collective gingival environment, which includes AG fibroblasts, might contribute to ILC3 differentiation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, based on our present findings, we propose that a previously unrecognized AG fibroblast subpopulation in the gingiva can facilitate immune surveillance and participate in the pathological regulation of innate immune cells, such as proinflammatory neutrophils, within oral barrier tissue (<bold><xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure 10</xref></bold>). Moreover, we hypothesize that ILC3s in the inflamed gingiva play a critical role in pathological alveolar bone resorption in the mouse model of periodontitis and, potentially, in human disease. Thus, the newly proposed AG fibroblast–neutrophil–ILC3 axis may hold valuable clues for unraveling the pathological mechanisms underlying periodontitis development. Moreover, these findings also provide a basis for investigation of new preventive and therapeutic strategies to contain oral barrier inflammation and potentially sever the link between periodontitis and debilitating non-communicative metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.</p>

<caption><p>Schematic overview of the newly proposed AG fibroblast–neutrophil–ILC3 axis. We propose that periodontal inflammation is initiated by the activation of AG fibroblasts, which secrete chemokines and cytokines that recruit neutrophils to sites of tissue damage. Activated neutrophils and AG fibroblasts, in turn, activate ILC3s, leading to production of proinflammatory IL-17 cytokines. Ultimately, cervical alveolar bone resorption is facilitated by a localized osteoclastogenic environment, induced by activated ILC3s, together with AG fibroblasts, neutrophils, myofibroblasts, and gingival epithelial cells, including those with an epithelial– mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype.</p></caption>

WT mice without ligature placement were used as Day 0 pre-periodontitis control. <italic>Rag2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> and <italic>Rag2γc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice were euthanized on Day 7. The palatal tissue was digitally photographed, and maxillae were harvested and fixed in 10% buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The gingival defect area was measured from digital photographs, using the ImageJ Java-based image-processing program (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA), and normalized to the circumferential area of the maxillary first molar. Fixed maxillae were subjected to microCT imaging at an energy level of 60 kV and 166 µA, and 3D images were reconstructed from microCT scans (Skyscan 1275: Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Alveolar bone loss was assessed at three sites (mesiobuccal cusp, distobuccal cusp, and distal cusp) of the first molar, two sites (mesiobuccal cusp and distobuccal cusp) of the second molar, and one site (buccal cusp) of the third molar by measuring the distance from the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to the alveolar bone crest (ABC) on the buccal and palatal side of the alveolar bone. Total bone loss was calculated from the six-site total CEJ–ABC distance. The bone volume/total volume (BV/TV) ratio, bone surface, trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) in the buccal side of alveolar bone of the second molar were determined using the proprietary analysis program (CTan: Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).

<title>Evaluation of gingival effect in the maxillary topical application (MTA) model</title>
<p>We have developed a method to apply chemical therapeutic agents topically to the mouse maxillary tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>]. We used the maxillary topical application (MTA) model to apply oral microbial components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]. The present study used the MTA model using 1 µg/ml unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide (CpG ODN: InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) or <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> lipopolysaccharide (LPS: InvivoGen). First, a custom-made oral appliance was fabricated using clear dental resin, covering the maxillary/palatal tissue between the molars. Mice were anesthetized and placed on a supine position. CpG ODN (3 µl) or LPS (3 µl) was pipetted over the maxillary tissue and the oral appliance was placed to hold the solution with a bite block for 1 hr in an anesthetization chamber. Mice were then transferred to the operation table and the oral appliance and bite block were removed. In general, there was no remaining solution in the mouth. Mice were returned to the cage in the vivarium. On Day 4 of the MTA, mice were euthanized by 100% CO2 inhalation and the maxillary tissue was harvested and fixed with 10% buffered formalin for histological evaluation.</p>

Individual gene counts for each cell were divided by the total gene counts for that cell and multiplied by a scale factor of 10,000; natural-log transformation was then applied to the counts. The FindVariableFeatures function was used to select 2,000 variable genes with default parameters, and the ScaleData function was used to scale and center the counts in the dataset. Principal component analysis and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection dimensional reduction were performed on variably expressed genes. The cluster markers were found using the FindAllMarkers function, and cell types were manually annotated based on the cluster markers.

</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important subject. We have previously expressed a concern on the mouse ligature model that the microbial composition of the mouse ligature did not mirror the human oral microbial composition. Therefore, we developed the maxillary topical application (MTA) model, in which human oral biofilm was directly applied to the maxillary gingiva. In this study, the newly developed MTA model was further dissected by single cell RNA seq, which revealed that the extracellular substances of human oral biofilm might be an important trigger of gingival inflammation. RESULT has been revised.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION has been simplified as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. Many host cells participate in immune responses, such as gingival epithelial cells. AG fibroblast is not the only cell involved in the immune response, and the weight of its role needs to be clarified. So the expression in the conclusion should be appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>RESPONSE: We agree with this comment. Our study identified the AG fibroblast–neutrophil–ILC3 axis as a previously unrecognized mechanism which could play an additional role in the complex interplay between oral barrier immune cells.</p>

<p>eLife assessment</p>
<p>The findings of this article provide valuable information on the changes of cell clusters induced by chronic periodontitis. The observation of a new fibroblast subpopulation, which was named as AG fibroblasts, was quite interesting, but needs further evidence. The strength of evidence presented is incomplete.</p>

<p>We discovered a new subpopulation of gingival fibroblasts, named AG fibroblasts, using non-biased single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of mouse gingival samples undergoing the development of ligature-induced periodontitis. AG fibroblasts exhibited a unique gene expression profile: [1] constitutive expression of type XIV collagen; and [2] ligatureinduced upregulation of Toll-Like Receptors and their downstream signals as well as chemokines such as CXCL12. Thus, we have hypothesized that AG fibroblasts initially sense the pathological stress including oral microbial stimuli and secrete inflammatory signals through chemokine expression.</p>
<p>The current manuscript examined the relationship between AG fibroblasts and oral barrier immune cells focusing on the chemokines and other ligands derived from AG fibroblasts and their putative receptors in those immune cells. Using scRNA-seq data mining programs, our data demonstrated the compelling evidence that AG fibroblasts should play a critical role in orchestrating the oral barrier immunity, at least at the early stages of periodontal inflammation.</p>
<p>We agree that it is important to explore the functional/pathological role of AG fibroblasts. In this revision, we further investigated the role of TLRs in the pathogen sensing mechanism of AG fibroblasts. To accomplish this goal, we applied a newly developed mouse model in which mice were exposed to the maxillary topical application (MTA) of oral microbial pathogens without the ligature placement. With 1 hr exposure with human oral biofilm, not with planktonic microbiota, the mice maxillary tissue exhibited measurable degradation as evidenced by the activation of cathepsin K. To dissect the role of TLRs, we applied the putative stimulants of TLR9 and TLR2/4 using the discrete MTA model. The scRNA-seq from the MTA model revealed that the application of unmethylated CpG oligonucleotide and P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively, induced the activation of chemokines by AG fibroblast.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript reported this critical data with the detailed information. As such the additional figures and corresponding results, discussion and materials &amp; methods were included.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In this article, the authors found a distinct fibroblast subpopulation named AG fibroblasts, which are capable of regulating myeloid cells, T cells and ILCs, and proposed that AG fibroblasts function as a previously unrecognized surveillant to orchestrate chronic gingival inflammation in periodontitis. Generally speaking, this article is innovative and interesting, however, there are some problems that need to be addressed to improve the quality of the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. As suggested, we further investigated the surveillant function of AG fibroblasts by reanalyzing the scRNA-seq data for stress sensing receptors such as Toll-Like Receptors (TLR). In the revision, we addressed the role of TLR in the activation of AG fibroblasts using a newly developed mouse model employing the maxillary topical application (MTA) of putative TLR stimulants. The new information clearly demonstrated that AG fibroblasts play a pivotal role as the surveillant and translating the pathogenic stimulants to oral barrier inflammation through chemokine expression.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This study proposed the AG fibroblast-neutrophil-ILC3 axis as a mechanism contributing to pathological inflammation in periodontitis. However, the immune response in the vivo is very complex. It is difficult to determine which is the cause and which is the result. This study explores the relevant issue from one dimension, which is of great significance for a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of periodontitis. It should be fully discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate this comment. We expanded the current understanding of oral immune signal communication in Discussion and highlight how AG fibroblast may fit to it. To address this question, we expanded our investigation in the pathological signal detection by AG fibroblasts by employing the newly developed maxillary topical application (MTA) model. The revised manuscript contains the new information and expanded the discussion in the context of complex immune response.</p>

<p>Detailed comments are listed below:</p>
<p>Abstract：</p>
<p>
I am confused about the expression of &quot;human periodontitis-like phenotype&quot;. How does the authors define this concept? Periodontitis is a complex disease, despite that alveolar bone resorption is a typical manifestation of periodontitis, its characteristics remain to be further studied. I hope the authors can provide some detailed information about this concept or describe it in another way.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an important comment. Radiographically, human periodontitis is diagnosed by alveolar bone resorption from the cervical region, not from root apex. To highlight this, we present dental radiographs of human periodontitis as supplementary information. However, we agree with this comment, our statement should be limited to alveolar bone resorption pattern in Rag2KO and Rag2gcKO mice. Abstract be revised accordingly.</p>

<p>Introduction:</p>
<p>
It is recommended to simplify the first to third paragraphs, and briefly explain the functions of various types of cells in different stages of periodontitis, as well as the role of different cluster markers play across the time course of periodontal inflammation development.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following this recommendation, INTRODUCTION has been simplified.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Results:</p>
<p>1. It is recommended to add HE staining and immunohistochemistry staining to observe the inflammation, tissue damage, and repair status from 0 to 7 days, so that readers can understand cell phenotype changes corresponding to the periodontitis stage. The observation index can include inflammation and vascular related indicators.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As recommended, representative histological figures were included. We further performed new immunohistochemistry experiment of mouse gingival tissue (D0, D1, D3, D7) highlighting the infiltration of CD45+ immune cells. We found that inflammatory vascular formation in the H&amp;E histology, which was highlighted. To characterize the tissue damage, the histological sections were stained by picrosirius red to highlight the change in collagen connective tissue of PDL and gingiva.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Figure 1A-1D can be placed in the supplementary figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Combining the new data above, Figure 1 was revised as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. I suggest the authors to put the detection of the existence of AG fibroblasts before exploring its relationship with other types of cells.</p>
<p>1. The layout of the picture should be closely related to the topic of the article. It is recommended to readjust the layout of the picture. Figure 1 should be the detection of AG cells and their proportion changes from 0 to 7 days. In other figures, the authors can separately describe the proportion changes of myeloid cells, T cells and ILCs, and explored the association between AG fibroblasts and these cell types.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, the presentation order of Figures and text was revised to bring the information about AG fibroblasts first. The chemokine-receptor analysis was moved below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Please provide the complete form of &quot;KT&quot; in Line 162.</p>

<p>Methods:</p>
<p>
It is recommended to separately list the statistical methods section. The statistical method used in the article should be one-way ANOVA.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A separate statistical method section is created. As pointed out, we used one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test (when multiple groups were compared).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>
I suggest the authors remove Figures 3-6 from the discussion section. For example, in Line 283, &quot;(Figure 3 and 4)&quot; should be removed.</p>

<p>1. Many host cells participate in immune responses, such as gingival epithelial cells. AG fibroblast is not the only cell involved in the immune response, and the weight of its role needs to be clarified. So the expression in the conclusion should be appropriate.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following this critique, we revised INTRODUCTION, DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION, to highlight how AG fibroblasts function within a comprehensive immune response network.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. This study cannot directly answer the issue of the relationship between periodontitis and systemic diseases.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this critique. We either deleted or de-emphasized the relationship between periodontitis and systemic diseases throughout the text.</p>
