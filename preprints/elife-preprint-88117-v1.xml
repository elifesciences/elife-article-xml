<title>Abstract</title>
<sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>In children, psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are related to risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Maladaptive cognitive functioning is a well-known risk factor and early marker for psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. Since cognitive functioning is linked to various genetic and environmental factors during development, we hypothesize that it mediates the effects of those factors on childhood PLEs. Using large, representative, longitudinal data, we tested the relationships of genetic and environmental factors (such as familial and neighborhood environment) with cognitive intelligence and their relationships with current and future PLEs in children.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>To estimate unbiased associations against potential confounding variables, we leveraged large-scale, representative, multimodal data of 6,602 children (aged 9-10 years old; 47.15% females; 5,211 European-ancestry) from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study. Linear mixed model and a novel structural equation modeling (SEM) method that allows unbiased estimation of both components and factors were used to estimate the joint effects of cognitive capacity polygenic scores (PGSs), familial and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), and supportive environment on NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence and PLEs. We adjusted for ethnicity (genetically defined), schizophrenia PGS, and additionally unobserved confounders (using computational confound modeling).</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>We identified that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs correlated significantly with several genetic and environmental variables: i.e., lower PGSs for cognitive capacity, lower familial SES, lower neighborhood SES, lower supportive parenting behavior, and lower positive school environment. In SEM, lower cognitive intelligence significantly mediated the genetic and environmental influences on higher PLEs (Indirect effects of PGS: β range=-0.0355∼ -0.0274; Family SES: β range=-0.0429∼ -0.0331; Neighborhood SES: β range=0.0126∼ 0.0164; Positive Environment: β range=-0.0039∼ -0.003). Supportive parenting and a positive school environment had the largest total impact on PLEs (β range=-0.152∼ -0.1316) than genetic or environmental factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our results reveal the role of genetic and environmental factors on children’s risk for psychosis via its negative impact on cognitive intelligence. Our findings have policy implications in that improving the school and family environment and promoting local economic development might be a way to enhance cognitive and mental health in children.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Childhood is the critical developmental period in human life. Cognitive development and mental health in this period significantly impact key life outcomes at later ages, including academic performance, economic productivity, physical health, intelligence, and psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shonkoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Walker et al., 2021</xref>). Literature shows the significant impact of social adversities on cognitive development and mental health in early childhood. Lower family socioeconomic status (SES), particularly household income, is linked to lower or delayed neurocognitive development and higher risk of psychopathology in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Hair, Hanson, Wolfe, &amp; Pollak, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Noble et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Peverill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tomasi &amp; Volkow, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Weissman, Conger, Robins, Hastings, &amp; Guyer, 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Additional to family SES, the importance of neighborhood social environment on children’s neurocognitive development has been also highlighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Tooley et al., 2020</xref>). Adverse neighborhood environment, such as the percent of families below poverty line, education level, and violence exposure, was associated with lower cognitive performance and greater risk for psychosis in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Butler, Yang, Laube, Kühn, &amp; Immordino-Yang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Karcher, Schiffman, &amp; Barch, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rakesh, Seguin, Zalesky, Cropley, &amp; Whittle, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taylor, Cooper, Jackson, &amp; Barch, 2020</xref>). Conversely, as a protective factor against familial and neighborhood socioeconomic challenges, supportive parenting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brody et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brody et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>; J. L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Luby et al., 2012</xref>; Joan L. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Luby, Belden, Harms, Tillman, &amp; Barch, 2016</xref>) and positive school environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Gard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Piccolo, Merz, &amp; Noble, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rakesh et al., 2021</xref>) have been highlighted to improve child cognition and mental health.</p>
<p>Psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are prevalent in childhood and indicate the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">van der Steen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Van Os &amp; Reininghaus, 2016</xref>) and other psychopathologies including mood, anxiety, and substance disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Poulton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">van der Steen et al., 2019</xref>). PLEs are linked to a lower cognitive intelligence (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cannon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Kelleher &amp; Cannon, 2011</xref>). In childhood, PLEs also have a stronger association with environmental risk factors than any other internalizing/externalizing symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Karcher, Schiffman, et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Maladaptive cognitive intelligence may precede the manifestation of psychotic symptoms (T. D. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cannon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Keefe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Reichenberg et al., 2005</xref>). Family studies show a decline in cognitive intelligence preceding psychotic symptoms is related to genetic risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Cosway et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Curtis, Calkins, Grove, Feil, &amp; Iacono, 2001</xref>). In more recent studies these associations lead to the model that cognitive intelligence mediates the genetic risk for psychopathology and PLEs (Karcher, Paul, et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Pat et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, genetic overlap between psychotic disorders and cognitive capacity has been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Escott-Price et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Le Hellard et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>To obtain unbiased estimates of environmental effects, it is crucial to adjust for genetic confounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sariaslan et al., 2016</xref>) considering the large genetic effects on intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bouchard &amp; McGue, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Deary, Spinath, &amp; Bates, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Plomin &amp; Spinath, 2004</xref>) and psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hilker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Kendler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Sullivan, Kendler, &amp; Neale, 2003</xref>). Recent advances in genetics have led to the development of the polygenic score (PGS) approach: a computational method to estimate the genetic loading for a complex trait using statistical associations of each single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choi, Mak, &amp; O’Reilly, 2020</xref>). In particular, PGS of cognitive capacity holds particular importance. Cognitive capacity PGS is positively correlated with cognitive intelligence and education attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Judd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Okbay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018</xref>), brain morphometry, and negatively correlated with psychopathologies (e.g. psychosis, autism, depression, Alzheimer’s disease) and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Harden &amp; Koellinger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Judd et al., 2020</xref>; Karcher, Paul, et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018</xref>). An important gap in the literature is the lack of integrated assessment of the effects of genetic and environmental factors at multiple levels (e.g., familial vs neighborhood) to dissect the genetic and environmental effects underlying abnormal cognitive intelligence and the PLEs. Addressing this with large and representative data will allow for a more complete understanding of the factors related to the development of psychosis and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>In this study, we firstly aim to assess the associations of cognitive PGSs, family and neighborhood SES, and supportive environment with children’s cognitive intelligence and PLEs using statistical and computational approaches to carefully consider potential confounding. We then aim to test whether intelligence has a mediating effect on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs.</p>

<title>Study Participants</title>
<p>We used the multi-modal genetic and environmental data of 11,878 preadolescent children aged 9-10 years old collected from 21 research sites of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, one of the largest longitudinal studies for children’s neurodevelopment in the United States. We analyzed the baseline, first year, and second year follow-up datasets included in ABCD Release 4.0, downloaded on January 25, 2022. After k-nearest neighbor imputation of missing values of covariates (4.67% of total observations), we removed participants with missing data on study variables. The final samples included 6,602 multiethnic children, which comprised 890 of African ancestry (13.48%), 91 of East Asian ancestry (1.38%), 5,211 of European ancestry (78.93%), 229 of Native American ancestry (3.47%), and 181 not specified (2.74%).</p>

<title>Data</title>
<sec id="s3b1">
<title>NIH Toolbox Cognitive Performance</title>
<p>To assess children’s neurocognitive abilities, we used baseline observations of uncorrected composite scores of the total, fluid, and crystallized intelligence from the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery, which has seven cognitive instruments for examining executive function, episodic memory, language abilities, processing speed, working memory, and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Thompson et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b2">
<title>Psychotic-Like Experiences (PLEs)</title>
<p>Baseline, first year, and second year follow-up of PLEs were measured using the children’s responses to the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief Child Version. In line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Karcher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Karcher, Perino, &amp; Barch, 2020</xref>; Karcher, Schiffman, et al., 2021), we computed <italic>Total Score</italic> and <italic>Distress Score</italic>, each indicating the number of psychotic symptoms and levels of total distress. Considering self-reports and parent-reports of psychopathology may differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Achenbach, 2006</xref>), we additionally used parent-rated PLEs derived from four items of the Child Behavior Checklist according to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Karcher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Karcher et al., 2020</xref>; Karcher, Schiffman, et al., 2021).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b3">
<title>Polygenic Scores (PGS)</title>
<p>To investigate the aggregated effect of genetic components, we estimated PGS of two representative cognitive capacity traits for each participant: education attainment (EA) and cognitive performance (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). We used the summary statistics released from the largest GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lee et al., 2018</xref>) of European-descent individuals for educational attainment (EA, n=1,131,881) and cognitive performance (CP, n=257,841). EA was measured as the years of schooling; CP was measured as the respondent’s score on cognitive ability assessments. To construct PGS of schizophrenia for sensitivity analyses, we used the summary statistics from the multiple GWAS of European sample (n=65,967; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Ruderfer et al. (2018)</xref>) and East Asian sample (n=58,140; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lam et al. (2019)</xref>). We applied PRS-CSx, a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework that improves cross-population prediction via continuous shrinkage prior to SNP effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ge, Chen, Ni, Feng, &amp; Smoller, 2019</xref>) (For details, see <bold><xref rid="app1" ref-type="app">Appendix S1</xref></bold>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b4">
<title>Family-, Neighborhood-, and School-level Environment</title>
<p>We assessed children’s family-level SES with family income, parental education, and family’s financial adversity based on parent self-reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Karcher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tomasi &amp; Volkow, 2021</xref>). Higher family income and parental education and lower family’s financial adversity denote a higher family SES.</p>
<p>Neighborhood-level SES was assessed using the <italic>Area Deprivation Index</italic> (ADI), the percentage of individuals below -125% of the poverty level (henceforth “<italic>poverty</italic>”), and <italic>years of residence,</italic> which were associated with PLEs in prior research (Karcher, Schiffman, et al., 2021). Higher values of ADI and <italic>poverty</italic> and fewer <italic>years of residence</italic> indicate a lower neighborhood SES.</p>
<p>Based on existing literature (Karcher, Schiffman, et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Rakesh et al., 2021</xref>), we measured the level of supportive parenting behavior (henceforth “<italic>good parenting</italic>”) and benign school environment (henceforth “<italic>good schooling”</italic>) to assess the effect of positive family and school environment on each individual.</p>

<title>Statistical Modeling</title>
<sec id="s3c1">
<title>Linear Mixed Models</title>
<p>We used linear mixed models to minimize potential population stratification from different household environments and geographical locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). To avoid multicollinearity, CP and EA PGSs were used separately in two other models. Key variables of interest were PGS, family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive environment. As a random factor, the variable indicating ABCD research sites was used. Variables within each model had no signs of multicollinearity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Fox &amp; Monette, 1992</xref>) (generalized variance inflation factor &lt; 2.0 for every variable in all models). The child’s sex, age, genetic ethnicity, BMI, marital status of the caregiver, and family history of psychiatric disorders were included as covariates in the model (Karcher, Schiffman, et al., 2021). All continuous variables were standardized (z-scaled) beforehand to get standardized estimates, and the analyses were conducted with the <italic>lme4</italic> package in R version 4.1.2. Throughout this paper, threshold for statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05, with correction for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate. 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals were obtained with 5,000 iterations.</p>

<title>Path Modeling</title>
<p>To test the plausibility of whether cognitive intelligence may mediate the association between genetic and environmental factors and PLEs, we used an up-to-date SEM method, integrated generalized structured component analysis (IGSCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hwang, Cho, Jung, et al., 2021</xref>). This approach is suited to our study using the multi-modal genetic and environmental variables in that it estimates models with both factors and components as statistical proxies for the constructs. We considered path-analytic relationships among the six key constructs: the PGS, family SES, neighborhood SES, positive family and school environment, general intelligence, and PLEs. As the PGSs, family SES, neighborhood SES, positive family and school environment, and PLEs may be seen as aggregations of their relevant observed variables, indicating that they are determined by their observed variables, we statistically represented these constructs as the weighted sums of their observed variables or components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Cho, Sarstedt, &amp; Hwang, 2021</xref>). On the other hand, we represented general intelligence as a common factor that determines the underlying covariance pattern of fluid and crystallized intelligence, based on the classical g theory of intelligence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Jensen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Spearman, 1904</xref>).</p>
<p>The IGSCA model included the same covariates used in the linear mixed model as well as the ABCD research site as an additional covariate. We applied GSCA Pro 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hwang, Cho, &amp; Choo, 2021</xref>) to fit the IGSCA model to the data and checked the model’s goodness-of-fit index (GFI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Jöreskog &amp; Sörbom, 1986</xref>), standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), and total variance of all indicators and components explained (FIT) to assess its overall goodness-of-fit. A larger FIT value indicates more variance of all variables is explained by the specified model. The rules-of-thumb cutoff criteria in IGSCA is GFI≥0.93 and SRMR≤0.08 for an acceptable fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Cho, Hwang, Sarstedt, &amp; Ringle, 2020</xref>). Finally, we conducted conditional process analyses to investigate further the indirect and total effects of the constructs in the model. We obtained 95% confidence intervals based on 5,000 bootstrap samples to test the statistical significance of parameter estimates.</p>

<title>Sensitivity Analyses</title>
<p>To ensure robustness of the main analyses results, we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses. As the European-descent-based GWAS was used for constructing PGS, we reran the main analyses using participants of European ancestry (n=5,211) to adjust for ethnic confounding. Next, we tested effects of gene x environment interactions on cognitive intelligence and PLEs, respectively. We also assessed whether the effects of cognitive capacity PGS in the linear mixed model are significant after adjusting for schizophrenia PGS, a more direct genetic predictor of PLEs. Lastly, we adjusted for unobserved confounding bias in the linear mixed model, using a recently developed framework for causal inference based on null treatments assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Miao, Hu, Ogburn, &amp; Zhou, 2022</xref>). As this method allows dependence among treatments, it can be utilized in examining the effects of multiple treatment variables having shared variances due to unobserved confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Okbay et al., 2022</xref>) (e.g., cognitive capacity PGS, family and neighborhood SES, positive family and school environment).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated the relationships of the genetic and environmental influences on the development of intelligence and the PLEs in youth, leveraging genetic data from the large epidemiological samples and a multi-level environmental (socioeconomic) data. Our results support the model that genetic factors (PGS for cognitive capacity), socioeconomic conditions, and family and school environments may influence cognitive intelligence in children, and this impact may lead to the individual variability of the current and future PLEs in children. Our analysis with integrated data shows the contributions of genetic and environmental factors, respectively, to cognitive and mental wellness in children, and further provides policy implications to improve them.</p>
<p>Our SEM shows that cognitive intelligence mediates the environmental and genetic influence on the current and future PLEs. The environmental factors (family SES, neighborhood SES, and positive parenting and schooling) and PGS of cognitive capacity exhibit significant indirect effects via cognitive intelligence on PLEs. Prior studies identifying the mediation of cognitive intelligence focused on either genetic or environmental factors alone (Karcher, Paul, et al., 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>). Our study advances this by demonstrating the specific and unbiased effects of genetic and environmental factors while controlling for each other. Considering the directions and magnitudes of the effects, though the effects of PGS remain significant, aggregated effects of environmental factors account for much greater degrees on PLEs (potential policy implications is discussed below). The indirect pathway of PGS &amp; environment-intelligence-PLEs aligns with the studies with older clinical samples showing cognitive deficits as a precursor for the onset of psychosis and schizophrenia and their genetic and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Eastvold, Heaton, &amp; Cadenhead, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Fett et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Vorstman et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results of cognitive intelligence mediating the genetic and environmental effects on PLEs may be related to several potential mechanisms. Children raised in higher family SES may have sufficient nutrition and cognitive stimulants, whereas children living in deprived neighborhoods may be exposed to higher rates of crime, air pollution, and substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Lewis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Marshall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Taylor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tomasi &amp; Volkow, 2021</xref>). Environmental enrichment may be associated with longer periods of neural plasticity (e.g. myelination, maturation of brain circuitry), leading to higher cognitive development and lower risk of mental disorders like psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Tooley, Bassett, &amp; Mackey, 2021</xref>). This may be further linked to the cognitive reserve theory. The theory suggests that genetic influence for cognitive capacity and environmental enrichment promotes more efficient, flexible brain networks, which may lead to greater resilience against psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Stern, 2009</xref>). Indeed, prior clinical studies show the linkage between cognitive reserve and psychosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Amoretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Leeson et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Our results indicate that genetic influences on cognitive capacity phenotypes are significantly linked to the risk of psychosis. While schizophrenia PGS showed no significant associations with PLEs, PGSs for CP and EA were strongly correlated with PLEs (baseline year, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up). These associations were robust after adjustment for ethnic confounding and unobserved confounders. Cognitive capacity PGS generally show higher predictive performance than PGS of any other traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Okbay et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018</xref>). Genetic variants associated with CP and EA are related to complex traits across the life span, including neuroticism, depressive symptoms, smoking in adulthood, cognitive decline at a later age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Joo, Cha, Freese, &amp; Hayes, 2022</xref>), risk for Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Harden &amp; Koellinger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Lee et al., 2018</xref>), brain volume, area, and thickness, as well as psychotic disorders (Karcher, Paul, et al., 2021). Prior gene expression studies suggest that polygenic signals for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and EA are significantly enriched in the central nervous system, particularly the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Finucane et al., 2018</xref>). Our findings emphasize the importance of cognitive capacity PGS as a biomarker which not only implicates cognitive traits but also exhibits genetic overlap with the risk for psychosis.</p>
<p>The differing magnitudes of the PGS impact between EA and CP warrant attention. The effects of the EA PGS on the PLEs of all years were 160.68%∼371.67% larger than those of CP PGS. This discrepancy may result from that the larger sample size of EA GWAS than that of CP GWAS. Alternatively, the discrepancies in effect sizes may suggest different genetic compositions between EA and CP. Recent literature documents that more than half of the polygenic signal for EA is related to noncognitive and social skills required for successful educational attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Demange et al., 2021</xref>), whereas CP may rather be linked to cognitive skills. This observation also supports the well-established relationships of the EA PGS with socioeconomic and life-course outcomes (e.g., social mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Belsky et al., 2018</xref>), voter turnout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aarøe et al., 2020</xref>), and wealth inequality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Barth, Papageorge, &amp; Thom, 2020</xref>)), which may be influenced by unobserved environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Young, Benonisdottir, Przeworski, &amp; Kong, 2019</xref>). In our analysis, using the two PGSs resulted in a more thorough assessment, leading to a more unbiased estimation of the genetic and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the significant effects of cognitive capacity PGS on cognitive intelligence (β=0.0699∼0.1793) remained robust and similar in magnitude after adjusting for ethnicity (β=0.0754∼0.1866) and other (unobserved) confounding (β=0.0546∼0.1776). As we controlled for family-, neighborhood-, and school-level environmental factors and unobserved confounders, our results may be interpreted as significant genetic influences on individual’s cognitive intelligence. This interpretation is supported by a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Isungset et al., 2022</xref>): Despite of the socioeconomic differences in Norway (a typical social democratic welfare state) and the US (a typical liberal welfare state), the magnitudes of genetic influence on cognitive intelligence were similar (Norway: β=0.18; US: β=0.17). Cognitive capacity PGS is an important genetic factor across the nations and societies. Therefore, analyses omitting the genetic influence may be subject to overestimation of the socioeconomic impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Plomin &amp; von Stumm, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Sariaslan et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>This study shows that a high SES and positive environment, particularly good parenting and schooling, is associated with higher intelligence and a lower risk for PLEs in children. While prior research has emphasized the dominant role of family SES (e.g. family income) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Tomasi &amp; Volkow, 2021</xref>), our SEM analyses(IGSCA) showed that positive environmental factors such as supportive parenting and schooling have a greater impact on children’s PLEs. Specifically, the effect sizes were the highest in supportive family and school environment, followed by family and neighborhood SES. Even after adjusting for ethnicity and unobserved confounders, the strong associations of good parenting and schooling with higher intelligence and fewer PLEs remained significant. These findings suggest that interventions that target positive family and school environments may be particularly effective. Recent research supports this notion, showing that interventions that promote supportive parenting and inclusive school environments can improve neurocognitive development, academic performance, and decrease risk behaviors such as drinking and emotional eating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brody et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Brody et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Holmes et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>Moreover, our results showed that positive parenting and schooling in baseline year were associated not only with baseline year PLEs but also with PLEs 1-2 years later. This is in line with prior research showing that intervention focused on parenting behavior and school environment have long-lasting positive effects that extend into adulthood and even across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Cunha &amp; Heckman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Hill et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Our findings highlight the potential for preventative strategies that target residential environment, family SES, parenting, and schooling—a comprehensive approach that considers the entire ecosystem of children’s lives—to enhance children’s cognitive development and mental health. A holistic and quantitative approach that takes into account the comprehensive ecosystem of family, school, and residential environments may ensure treatment effects and efficient use of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Cree et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Garner &amp; Yogman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shonkoff, 2012</xref>). For example, the Health Impact in 5 Years Initiative of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">CDC, 2018</xref>) includes 14 evidence-based interventions, such as providing school-based prevention programs, public transportation, home improvement loans, and earned income tax credits, to tackle the social determinants of public health. Our study strengthens the idea that an interdisciplinary science-driven, coordinated approach to intervening in the select environmental factors may allow practical improvements in child development, particularly in those who are at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Our study has some limitations. Firstly, due to data availability constraints in the ABCD study, we only utilized baseline observations for NIH Toolbox cognitive intelligence, and we could not test whether PLEs might be a mediator of intelligence. Secondly, the generalizability of our findings may be limited since most of the participants included in our analysis are from European ancestry. Finally, we did not include all important environmental variables, such as air pollution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Marshall et al., 2020</xref>) and social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Krabbendam, 2005</xref>) (not collected in the ABCD study).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study provides unbiased estimation of the pathways of genetic factors of cognitive capacity and environmental factors of family, school, and neighborhood to cognitive and mental wellness in children. Our findings underscore the importance of a comprehensive approach that considers both biological and socioeconomic features in promoting young children’s cognitive development and mental health. Given the importance of child development, it requires joint efforts from multiple disciplines.</p>

<title>Genotype data</title>
<p>The ABCD study collected saliva samples of study participants at the baseline visit and shipped the samples from the collection site to the Rutgers University Cell and DNA Repository. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped using the Affymetrix NIDA Smokescreen array (733,293 SNPs). We removed any inferior SNPs with (i) genotype call rate&lt;95%, (ii) sample call rate&lt;95%, and (iii) rare variants with minor allele frequency (MAF)&lt;0.01. Variant imputation was performed with the Michigan Imputation Server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc5">Das et al., 2016</xref>) using the 1000 Genome phase 3 version 5 multiethnic Grch37/hg19 reference panel with Eagle ver2.4 phased output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc9">Loh et al., 2016</xref>). For the imputed 12,046,090 SNPs, we only retained data from any individuals with &lt;5% missing genotypes; without extreme heterozygosity (F coefficient &lt; 3 standard deviations from the population mean); and SNPs with &gt;0.4 imputation quality INFO score, &lt;5% missingness rate, &gt;0.01 MAF and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p&gt;10<sup>−6</sup>). The genetic ancestry of each participant was determined with the fastSTRUCTURE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc11">Raj, Stephens, &amp; Pritchard, 2014</xref>), available from ABCD Release 4.0. Considering the diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds of the study participants, we estimated both kinship coefficients (K.C.s) and ancestrally informative principal components (P.C.s) to additionally control familial relatedness and ancestry admixture using PC-Air (M. P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc3">Conomos, Miller, &amp; Thornton, 2015</xref>) and PC-Relate (Matthew P. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc4">Conomos, Reiner, Weir, &amp; Thornton, 2016</xref>). We selected unrelated participants that were inferred to be more distant than 4<sup>th</sup>-degree relatives (K.C.&gt;0.022) and removed any outliers that fell significantly outside (&gt;6 S.D. limits) the center in P.C. space. In the rest of this paper, we used final genotype data (11,301,999 variants) of 10,199 unrelated multiethnic samples, including 7,893 European-ancestry participants, after Q.C.</p>

<title>Polygenic Scores (PGS)</title>
<p>Hyperparameters of PGSs were optimized in the held-out validation set of 1,579 unrelated participants, consisting of 88 of African ancestry (5.57%), 25 of East Asian ancestry (1.58%), 1,365 of European ancestry (86.45%), 88 of Native American ancestry (2.91%), and 55 not specified (3.48%). The validation set was created during the quality control process of the study genotype data when we selected unrelated study participants of the original ABCD samples with pairwise kinship coefficients of less than 0.022 among them. To select the optimal hyperparameter, we fitted linear regression models for intelligence composite scores within the validation set and evaluated the model performance in terms of the highest R<sup>2</sup> and effect size (beta). The models were adjusted for age, sex, and the first ten principal components of genotype data. For the PGS of multiethnic participants, genetic ancestry determined by ADMIXTURE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Alexander, Novembre, &amp; Lange, 2009</xref>) was additionally included as a covariate. The validation samples were only used for hyperparameter tuning for PGS optimization and were excluded from any further analyses. The PGSs were residualized against the first ten ancestrally informative P.C.s to adjust for population stratification.</p>

<title>Results of IGSCA with European samples</title>

<p>Intelligence was under a significant direct influence of the cognitive capacity PGS (β=0.2987 [95% CI=0.2673∼0.3281]), neighborhood SES (β=-0.0931 [95% CI=-0.1303∼-0.0586]), family SES (β=0.3034 [95% CI=0.2683∼0.3413]), and positive environment (β=0.0396 [95% CI=0.0104∼0.0698]). Neighborhood SES (β=0.0411 [95% CI=0.0037∼0.0784]), family SES (β=-0.0531 [95% CI=-0.0956∼- 0.0101]), and positive environment (β=-0.1473 [95% CI=-0.1779∼-0.1163]) showed significant direct influence on baseline year PLEs, but cognitive capacity PGS did not. Constructs that had significant direct effects on PLEs of 1-year and 2-year follow-up were family SES (βs&lt;-0.0850) and positive environment (βs&lt;-0.1222).</p>
<p>Intelligence had a significant mediating effect on the pathways of the PGS (β=-0.0555 [95% CI=- 0.0754∼-0.0392]), family SES (β=-0.0563 [95% CI=-0.07749∼-0.0392]), neighborhood SES (β=0.0173 [95% CI=0.0098∼0.0271]), and positive environment (β=-0.0074 [95% CI=-0.0142∼-0.0019]) to baseline year PLEs. For PLEs of 1-year and 2-year follow-up, the mediation effects of intelligence were also significant with all four constructs: PGS (1-year: β=-0.0397 [95% CI=-0.0586∼-0.0235]; 2-year: β=- 0.0204 [95% CI=-0.0389∼-0.0036]), family SES (1-year: β=-0.0404 [95% CI=-0.0601∼-0.0238]; 2-year: β=-0.0207 [95% CI=-0.0399∼-0.0036]), neighborhood SES (1-year: β=0.0124 [95% CI=0.0064∼0.0208]; 2-year: β=0.0064 [95% CI=0.0011∼0.0132]), and positive environment (1-year: β=-0.0053 [95% CI=- 0.0108∼-0.0012]; 2-year: β=-0.0027 [95% CI=-0.0067∼-0.0002]).

<title>Results of linear mixed models adjusted for unobserved confounders with multiethnic samples</title>
<p>Unobserved confounding variables may bias linear regression estimates. In particular, linear estimates may be subject to collider bias when those unobserved confounders and genetic factors are jointly associated with environmental factors and target traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">Akimova, Breen, Brazel, &amp; Mills, 2021</xref>). Thus, bias from unobserved confounding variables were adjusted using the null treatments approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Miao et al., 2022</xref>). This approach can identify the causal effects of multiple treatment variables in presence of unobserved confounders. Assuming that fewer than half of the treatments have causal effects on the outcome, it first estimates the joint distribution of treatments-confounders to obtain asymptotic bias using a factor model. Second, it estimates the relationship between treatments, confounders, and outcome using standard density estimation methods (e.g., least squares regression). Finally, by eliminating the asymptotic bias from the estimated treatments-confounders-outcome relationship, it can adjust for unobserved confounding even without specifying which treatments are null.</p>
<p>The significance of effects of PGSs was mostly preserved after adjusting for unobserved confounders (<bold>Table S6</bold>). Higher cognitive capacity PGSs correlated significantly with higher intelligence (CP PGS: βs&gt;0.1111, p&lt;0.0001; EA PGS: βs&gt;0.0546, p=0.0002]). CP PGS was associated with lower baseline year Distress Score PLEs (β= -0.0348, p=0.021) and EA PGS was associated with lower Total and Distress Score PLEs of baseline year and follow-up years (baseline: βs&lt;-0.0534, p=0.0002; 1-year: β=-0.0375, p=0.0149; 2-year: βs&lt;-0.0391, p=0.017). We found no significant associations of neighborhood SES variables with any of the target variables (p&gt;0.05).</p>
<p>While good parenting behaviors did not have significant association with intelligence, good schooling was significantly associated with higher total and fluid intelligence (βs&gt;0.0328, p=0.0242). Good parenting behaviors had significant negative correlations with all types of PLEs of baseline year and follow-up years (baseline: βs&lt;-0.0412, p=0.036; 1-year: βs&lt;-0.0435, p=0.0316; 2-year: βs&lt;-0.0558, p=0.0017). Good schooling was also negatively associated with all types of PLEs of baseline year and follow-up years (baseline: βs&lt;-0.0464, p=0.036; 1-year: βs&lt;-0.0952, p&lt;0.0001; 2-year: βs&lt;-0.0583, p=0.0095).</p>
<p>Parental education and family income were not significantly associated with all types of intelligence and PLEs of all three time points. Family’s financial disadvantage did not show significant association with intelligence and baseline year PLEs, but it had positive associations with 1-year follow-up Total Score (β=0.0604, p=0.0113) and Distress Score PLEs (β=0.0532, p=0.0197) and 2-year follow up Total Score (β&gt;0.0544, p=0.0284) and Distress Score PLEs (β=0.0584, p=0.0224).</p>

<p>This study by Park et al. describes an interesting approach to disentangle gene-environment pathways to cognitive development and psychotic-like experiences in children. They have used data from the ABCD study and have included PGS of EA and cognition, environmental exposure data, cognitive performance data and self-reported PLEs. Although the study has several strengths, including its large sample size, interesting approach and comprehensive statistical model, I have several concerns:</p>
<p>- The authors have included follow-up data from the ABCD Study. However, it is not very clear from the beginning that longitudinal paths are being explored. It would be very helpful if the authors would make their (analysis) approach clearer from the introduction. Now, they describe many different things, which makes the paper more difficult to read. It would be of great help to see the proposed path model in a Figure and refer to that in the Method.</p>
<p>- There is quite a lot of causal language in the paper, particularly in the Discussion. My advice would be to tone this down.</p>
<p>- It's a bit unclear to me why the authors chose the PEs phenotype as their outcome of interest. They mainly speak about child development and mental health in general in the Introduction, so why focus on PLE? Aren't genes and environments also relevant for other types of mental health problems? Relatedly, in the Discussion the authors seem to conflate PLEs with psychosis. There is a large body of literature highlighting the differences between PLEs and psychosis, and this should - in my opinion - be adjusted throughout the introduction and discussion.</p>
<p>- I feel that the limitation section is a bit brief, and can be developed further.</p>
<p>- I like that the assessment of CP and self-reports PEs is of good quality. However, I was wondering which 4 items from the parent-reported CBCL were used and how did they correlate with the child-reported PEs? And how was distress taken into account in the child self-reported PEs measurement? Which PEs measures were used?</p>
<p>- What was the correlation between CP and EA PGSs?</p>
<p>- Regarding the PGS: why focus on cognitive performance and EA? It should be made clearer from the introduction that EA is not only measuring cognitive ability, but is also a (genetic) marker of social factors/inequalities. I'm guessing this is one of the reasons why the EA PGS was so much more strongly correlated with PEs than the CP PGS. See the work bij Abdellaoui and the work by Nivard.</p>
<p>- Considering previous work on this topic, including analyses in the ABCD Study, I'm not surprised that the correlation was not very high. Therefore, I don't think it makes a whole of sense to adjust for the schizophrenia PGS in the sensitivity analyses, in other words, it's not really 'a more direct genetic predictor of PLEs'.</p>
<p>- How did the FDR correction for multiple testing affect the results?</p>
<p>Overall, I feel that this paper has the potential to present some very interesting findings. However, at the moment the paper misses direction and a clear focus. It would be a great improvement if the readers would be guided through the steps and approach, as I think the authors have undertaken important work and conducted relevant analyses.</p>

<body>
<p>This paper tried to assess the link between genetic and environmental factors on psychotic-like experiences, and the potential mediation through cognitive ability. This study was based on data from the ABCD cohort, including 6,602 children aged 9-10y. The authors report a mediating effect, suggesting that cognitive ability is a key mediating pathway in the link between several genetic and environmental (risk and protective) factors on psychotic-like experiences.</p>
<p>While these findings could be potentially significant, a range of methodological unclarities and ambiguities make it difficult to assess the strength of evidence provided.</p>
<p>Strengths of the methods:</p>
<p>The authors use a wide range of validated (genetic, self- and parent-reported, as well as cognitive) measures in a large dataset with a 2-year follow-up period. The statistical methods have the potential to address key limitations of previous research.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the methods:</p>
<p>The rationale for the study is not completely clear. Cognitive ability is probably a more likely mediator of traits related to negative symptoms in schizophrenia, rather than positive symptoms (e.g., psychosis, psychotic-like symptom). The suggestion that cognitive ability might lead to psychotic-like symptoms in the general population needs further justification.</p>
<p>Terms are used inconsistently throughout (e.g., cognitive development, cognitive capacity, cognitive intelligence, intelligence, educational attainment...). It is overall not clear what construct exactly the authors investigated.</p>
<p>Not the largest or most recent GWASes were used to generate PGSes.</p>
<p>
It is not fully clear how neighbourhood SES was coded (higher or lower values = risk?). The rationale, strengths, and assumptions of the applied methods are not fully clear. It is also not clear how/if variables were combined into latent factors or summed (weighted by what). It is not always clear when genetic and when self-reported ethnicity was used. Some statements might be overly optimistic (e.g., providing unbiased estimates, free even of unmeasured confounding; use of representative data).</p>
<p>It appears that citations and references are not always used correctly.</p>
<p>Strengths of the results:</p>
<p>The authors included a comprehensive array of analyses.</p>
<p>Weaknesses of the results:</p>
<p>Many results, which are presented in the supplemental materials, are not referenced in the main text and are so comprehensive that it can be difficult to match tables to results. Some of the methodological questions make it challenging to assess the strength of the evidence provided in the results.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors suggest that their findings provide evidence for policy reforms (e.g., targeting residential environment, family SES, parenting, and schooling). While this is probably correct, a range of methodological unclarities and ambiguities make it difficult to assess whether the current study provides evidence for that claim.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The immediate impact is limited given the short follow-up period (2y), possibly concerns for selection bias and attrition in the data, and some methodological concerns.</p>

<p>We clarified the specific longitudinal paths explored in our study in the end of the Introduction section (line 149~160). We also added a figure of the proposed path model (Figure 1) and refer to it in the Method section (line 232~239).</p>

<p>We specified additional potential constraints of our study, including limited representativeness, limited periods of follow-up data, possible sample selection bias, and the use of non-randomized, observational data. These corrections can be found in line 518~538.</p>

<p>We believe that the Reviewer #1’s comment for the correlations between PLEs derived from PQ-BC (total score and distress score PLEs) and from CBCL (parent-rated PLEs) might have been due to the fact that she/he was referring to the prior version of our manuscript submitted to a different journal. We obtained Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the PLEs (baseline year: r = 0.095~0.0989, p&lt;0.0001; 1-year follow-up: r = 0.1322~0.1327, p&lt;0.0001; 2-year follow-up: r = 0.1569~0.1632, p&lt;0.0001) and added this information in the Method section for PLEs (line 198~201).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for the feedback to clarify that educational attainment (EA) is not only a genetic marker of cognitive ability but also that of socioeconomic outcomes. Per your suggestion, we included the associations of EA PGS with multiple biological and socioeconomic outcomes found in prior studies (e.g., Abdellaoui et al., 2022) in the Introduction (line 131~142).</p>

<p>We conducted this adjustment considering that PLEs often precede the onset of schizophrenia. In addition, prior studies found that schizophrenia PGS is significantly associated with cognitive intelligence within psychosis patients (Shafee et al., 2018) and individuals at-risk of psychosis (He et al., 2021), and that significant distress psychotic-like experiences had greater positive correlation with schizophrenia PGS than PGS for psychotic-like experiences (Karcher et al., 2018).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we thought that it is necessary to assess whether the effects of cognitive phenotypes PGS (i.e., CP PGS and EA PGS) in the linear mixed model are significant after adjusting for schizophrenia PGS. We believe our results from the mixed linear model showed the sensitivity and specificity of the association between cognitive phenotype PGS and PLEs.</p>

<p>For all analysis results presented in our study, False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing compared p-values of nine key study variables: PGS (cognitive performance or educational attainment), family income, parental education, family’s financial adversity, Area Deprivation Index, years of residence, proportion of population below -125% of the poverty line, positive parenting behavior, and positive school environment. An exception was the sensitivity analysis that included schizophrenia PGS in the linear mixed model for adjustment: with another PGS variable added, FDR correction compared p-values of ten key variables. Overall, the effects of FDR correction on the results were limited; i.e., the majority of associations between the key variables and the outcomes, which were deemed highly significant, remained unchanged after the FDR correction.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel that this paper has the potential to present some very interesting findings. However, at the moment the paper misses direction and a clear focus. It would be a great improvement if the readers would be guided through the steps and approach, as I think the authors have undertaken important work and conducted relevant analyses.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>This paper tried to assess the link between genetic and environmental factors on psychotic-like experiences, and the potential mediation through cognitive ability. This study was based on data from the ABCD cohort, including 6,602 children aged 9-10y. The authors report a mediating effect, suggesting that cognitive ability is a key mediating pathway in the link between several genetic and environmental (risk and protective) factors on psychotic-like experiences.</p>
<p>While these findings could be potentially significant, a range of methodological unclarities and ambiguities make it difficult to assess the strength of evidence provided.</p>
<p>Strengths of the methods:</p>
<p>The authors use a wide range of validated (genetic, self- and parent-reported, as well as cognitive) measures in a large dataset with a 2-year follow-up period. The statistical methods have the potential to address key limitations of previous research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for recognizing these methodological strengths of our study. The reviewer’s positive comments are highly supportive and encouraging for us.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses of the methods:</p>
<p>The rationale for the study is not completely clear. Cognitive ability is probably a more likely mediator of traits related to negative symptoms in schizophrenia, rather than positive symptoms (e.g., psychosis, psychotic-like symptom). The suggestion that cognitive ability might lead to psychotic-like symptoms in the general population needs further justification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We sincerely thank and highly appreciate the concerns that the reviewer has raised regarding our proposal that cognitive ability may serve as a mediator of psychotic-like experiences. To the best of our knowledge, it has been proposed that cognitive ability can be a mediator of positive symptoms in schizophrenia (including psychotic-like experiences), as well as negative symptoms. This mediating role of cognitive ability was proposed in several prior studies on cognitive model of schizophrenia/psychosis. Per your suggestion, we included further justification in the Introduction section of our study (line 104~107). Specifically, we highlighted that cognitive ability has been theoretically proposed as a potential mediator of genetic &amp; environmental influence on positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as psychotic-like experiences. We refer to studies conducted by Howes &amp; Murray (2014) and Garety et al. (2001).</p>

<p>Terms are used inconsistently throughout (e.g., cognitive development, cognitive capacity, cognitive intelligence, intelligence, educational attainment...). It is overall not clear what construct exactly the authors investigated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We corrected the term ‘cognitive capacity’ to ‘cognitive phenotypes’ throughout our manuscript. We also added in the Introduction (line 141~143) that we will collectively refer to these two PGSs of focus as ‘cognitive phenotypes PGSs’, which is similar to the terms used in prior research (Joo et al., 2022; Okbay et al., 2022; Selzam et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Not the largest or most recent GWASes were used to generate PGSes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for mentioning this point. The reason why we were not able to use the largest GWAS for cognitive intelligence, educational attainment and schizophrenia is because (unfortunately) our study started earlier than the point when the GWAS studies by Okbay et al. (2022) and Trubetskoy et al. (2022) were published. We corrected that our study used ‘a GWAS of European-descent individuals for educational attainment and cognitive performance’ instead of the largest GWAS (line 206~208).</p>

<p>It is not fully clear how neighbourhood SES was coded (higher or lower values = risk?). The rationale, strengths, and assumptions of the applied methods are not fully clear. It is also not clear how/if variables were combined into latent factors or summed (weighted by what). It is not always clear when genetic and when self-reported ethnicity was used. Some statements might be overly optimistic (e.g., providing unbiased estimates, free even of unmeasured confounding; use of representative data).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Consistent with the illustration of neighborhood SES in the Methods section, higher values of neighborhood SES indicate risk. In the original Figure 2, higher values of neighborhood SES links to lower intelligence (direct effects: β=-0.1121) and higher PLEs (indirect effects: β=-0.0126~ -0.0162). We think such confusion might have been caused by the difference between family SES (higher values = lower risk) neighborhood SES (higher values = higher risk). Thus, we changed the terms to ‘High Family SES’ and ‘Low Neighborhood SES’ in the corrected figure (Figure 3) for clarification.</p>
<p>Considering that shorter duration of residence may be associated with instability of residency, it may indicate neighborhood adversity (i.e., higher risk). This definition of the ‘years of residence’ variable is in line with the previous study by Karcher et al. (2021).</p>
<p>We represented PGSs, family SES, neighborhood SES, positive family and school environment, and PLEs as composite indicators (derived from a weighted sum of relevant observed variables). To the best of our knowledge, it has been suggested from prior studies that these variables are less likely to share a common factor and were assessed as a composite index during analyses. For instance, Judd et al. (2020) and Martin et al. (2015) analyze genetic influence of educational attainment and ADHD as composite indicators. Also, as mentioned in Judd et al. (2020), socioenvironmental influences are often analyzed as composite indicators. Studies on psychosis continuum (e.g., van Os et al., 2009) suggest that psychotic disorders are likely to have multiple background factors instead of having a common factor, and notes that numerous prior research uses composite indices to measure psychotic symptoms. These are the reasons why we used components for these constructs instead of generating latent factors (which is done in the standard SEM method). On the contrary, we represented general intelligence as a common factor that determines the underlying covariance pattern of fluid and crystallized intelligence, based on the classical g theory of intelligence. We added this explanation in line 269~285.</p>
<p>Moreover, during estimation, the IGSCA determines weights of each observed variable in such a way as to maximize the variances of all endogenous indicators and components. We added this explanation in the description about the IGSCA method (line 266~268).</p>
<p>We deleted overly optimistic statements like ‘unbiased estimates’ and used expressions such as ‘adjustment for observed/unobserved confounding’ instead, throughout our manuscript.</p>

<p>It appears that citations and references are not always used correctly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thoroughly checked all citations and specified the references for each statement.
We deleted Plomin &amp; von Stumm (2018) and Harden &amp; Koellinger (2020) and cited relevant primary studies (e.g., Lee et al., 2018; Okbay et al., 2022; Abdellaoui et al., 2022) instead. We also specified the references supporting the statement that educational attainment PGS links to brain morphometry (Judd et al., 2020; Karcher et al., 2021). As Okbay et al. (2022) use PGS of cognitive intelligence (which mentions the analyses results in their supplementary materials) as well as educational attainment, we decided to continue citing this reference. These corrections can be found in line 131~141.</p>

<p>Strengths of the results:</p>
<p>The authors included a comprehensive array of analyses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses of the results:</p>
<p>Many results, which are presented in the supplemental materials, are not referenced in the main text and are so comprehensive that it can be difficult to match tables to results. Some of the methodological questions make it challenging to assess the strength of the evidence provided in the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As you rightly identified, we inadvertently failed to reference Table S2 in the main text. We have since corrected this omission in the Results section for the IGSCA (SEM) analysis (line 375). The remainder of the supplementary tables (Table S1, S3~S7) have been appropriately cited in the main manuscript. We recognize that the quantity of tables provided in the supplementary materials is substantial. However, given the comprehensiveness and complexity of our analyses, which encompass a wide array of study variables, these tables offer intricate results from each analysis. We deem these results, which include valuable findings from sensitivity analyses and confound testing, too significant to exclude from the supplementary materials. That said, we are open to, and would greatly welcome, any further suggestions on how to present our supplementary results in a more accessible and digestible format. We are ready and willing to implement any necessary modifications to ensure clarity and ease of comprehension. Your guidance in this matter is highly valued.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors suggest that their findings provide evidence for policy reforms (e.g., targeting residential environment, family SES, parenting, and schooling). While this is probably correct, a range of methodological unclarities and ambiguities make it difficult to assess whether the current study provides evidence for that claim.</p>
<p>Impact:</p>
<p>The immediate impact is limited given the short follow-up period (2y), possibly concerns for selection bias and attrition in the data, and some methodological concerns.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We added as study limitations (line 518~538) that the impact of our findings for understanding cognitive and psychiatric development during later childhood may be limited due to the relatively short follow-up period, the possibility of sample selection bias, and the problems of interpreting analyses results from an observational study as causality (despite the novel causal inference methods, designed for non-randomized, observational data, that we used).</p>
<p>As responded above, we made necessary corrections and clarifications for the points suggested by the reviewer. As we are willing to make additional revisions, please feel free to give comments if you feel that our corrections are insufficient or inappropriate.</p>
