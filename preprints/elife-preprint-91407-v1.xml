<title>Abstract</title><sec>
<title>Background</title>
<p>Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and no reliable, effective diagnostic, and predictive biomarkers are used in clinical routines. A growing body of evidence shows metabolic alterations in patients with glaucoma. we aimed to develop and validate potential metabolite biomarkers to diagnose and predict the visual field progression of PACG.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Here, we used a 5-phases (discovery phase, validation phase 1, validation phase 2, supplementary phase, and cohort phase) multicenter (EENT hospital, Shanghai Xuhui central hospital), cross-sectional, prospective cohort study design to perform widely-targeted metabolomics and chemiluminescence immunoassay to determine candidate biomarkers. Five machine learning (random forest, support vector machine, lasso, K-Nearest neighbor, and Gaussian NB) approaches were used to identify an optimal algorithm. The discrimination ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Calibration was assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow tests and calibration plots.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Results</title>
<p>Studied serum samples were collected from 616 participants, and 1464 metabolites were identified. Machine learning algorithm determines that androstenedione exhibited excellent discrimination and acceptable calibration in discriminating PACG across the discovery phase (discovery set 1, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] =1.0 [95%CI, 1.00-1.00]; discovery set, AUC=0.85 [95%CI, 0.80-0.90]) and validation phases (internal validation, AUC=0.86 [95%CI, 0.81-0.91]; external validation, AUC=0.87 [95%CI, 0.80-0.95]). Androstenedione also exhibited a higher AUC (0.92-0.98) to discriminate the severity of PACG. In the supplemental phase, serum androstenedione levels were consistent with those in aqueous humor (r=0.82, P=0.038) and significantly (P=0.021) decreased after treatment. Further, cohort phase demonstrates that higher baseline androstenedione levels (hazard ratio=2.71 [95% CI: 1.199-6.104], P=0.017) were associated with faster visual field progression.</p>
</sec>
<sec>
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrates serum androstenedione as a novel biomarker that can be used to diagnose PACG and predict visual field progression.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Background</title>
<p>Glaucoma is the most frequent cause of irreversible blindness worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>, and its prevalence is increasing globally, making it a public health concern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) is a major form of glaucoma in east Asian ethnic patients, affecting 70% of glaucoma patients worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Hence, early detection of PACG and accurate prediction of visual field (VF) changes can potentially preserve vision and mitigate the risk of PACG advancement. Measurement of intraocular pressure, perimetry, gonioscopy and optical coherence tomography is the main diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. However, the present clinical techniques are inadequate for the early diagnosis and prognosis of VF progression as they depend on specialized eye examination equipment and the expertise of ophthalmologists. Furthermore, patients seldom seek the services of an ophthalmologist until the symptoms worsen or visual acuity significantly deteriorates. Importantly, the He et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> taught us that performing laser iridotomy on patients with 180 degrees of angle closure does not prevent PACG, thus gonioscopy may not a good tool to help distinguish PACG from controls. Therefore, the development of a straightforward and dependable biomarker or biomarker panel to facilitate early detection and prognostication of progressive visual field loss in primary angle-closure glaucoma is imperative, rather than relying solely on the expertise of ophthalmologists and specialized equipment.</p>
<p>Multiple etiology and risk factors lead to the onset/development of PACG in humans, which involves a tremendous flow of physiological changes, genetic factors, and metabolic adaptations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Both physiological changes, genetic factors, and metabolic adaptations should lead to profound changes in most metabolic pathways. Small molecule metabolites, as crucial biomarkers of cellular function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, which identifies and quantified by metabolomics, are the omics product closest to clinical phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. A burgeoning corpus of evidence indicates metabolic changes in individuals afflicted with glaucoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, extant metabolomics research on glaucoma is constrained by inadequate sample sizes, a dearth of validation sets to corroborate findings, and an absence of specificity analyses. Notably, investigations have yet to comprehensively characterize the serum metabolome in sizable cohorts to identify putative biomarkers capable of distinguishing patients with PACG from healthy controls.</p>
<p>In this study, a cross-sectional and prospective cohort design was employed to systematically profile blood metabolites using widely-targeted metabolomics and chemiluminescence immunoassay in both patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and normal subjects. The objectives of the study were to characterize the metabolic profile associated with PACG, identify potential blood diagnostic biomarkers of PACG, assess the specificity of diagnostic biomarkers for PACG of any severity, and verify the biomarkers used to predict the visual field progression of PACG.</p>

<p>From January 2020 to December 2021, newly diagnosed PACG and age-sex-matched normal controls were recruited from the Eye Center of Fudan University and Shanghai Xuhui Central hospital. Detailed ophthalmic examinations and medical examinations were described in the supplementary material. Approval from the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (2020[2020013]) was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Eye and ENT Hospital, and the study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

<label>2.2</label><title>Study design</title>
<p>A cross-sectional, multicenter, prospective cohort study design. In the cross-sectional study, a total of 616 patients and normal controls were prospectively enrolled from the Eye Center of Fudan University and Shanghai Xuhui Central hospital which was divided into 4 phases (discovery phase [discovery set 1, the discovery set 2], validation phase 1 [external validation], validation phase 2 [internal validation], supplemental phase) from eight districts in China (Figure S1). The 5 phases of the study are independent and are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. The discovery set 1 was composed of 80 serum samples from PACG patients and 60 samples from normal controls which was enrolled from Eye Center of Fudan University between January 2020 to June 2020. The discovery set 2 was composed of 100 serum samples from PACG patients and 80 samples from normal controls which was enrolled from Eye Center of Fudan University between July 2020 to Deccember 2020. The differential metabolites of discovery set 1 and discovery set 2 were obtained by widely-targeted metabolomics. The intersection of the differential metabolites of the two discovery sets was used as a candidate biomarker. For validation phase 1, serum samples from 70 PACG patients and 50 normal controls were collected which was enrolled from Shanghai Xuhui Central hospital between January 2020 to December 2020. Candidate biomarkers were validated in validation phase 1 using widely-targeted metabolomics, and potential biomarkers were obtained. For validation phase 2, serum samples from 98 PACG patients and 78 normal controls were collected which was enrolled from Eye Center of Fudan University between January 2021 to December 2021. Potential biomarkers were validated in validation phase 2 using chemiluminescence methods. For the supplemental phase, we used widely-targeted metabolomics to investigate whether the same potential biomarkers were present in PACG patientsâ aqueous humor. All the clinical characteristics (Age, sex, BMI, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking) were matched between PACG and normal controls in the 4 phases.</p>

<p>In the prospective cohort study, 98 newly diagnosed PACG patients were included from the Eye Center of Fudan University between January 2020 and December 2020. All participants visited once every six months to allow regular assessment of PACG disease progression (the minimum follow-up period was set to 24 months). Serum samples from 98 PACG patients were collected and measured using chemiluminescence methods. Detailed information of patients follow up were described as previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>

<label>2.3.1</label><title>Sample collection</title>
<p>The blood was collected prior to the treatment. Briefly, subjects were asked to ensure about eight-ten hours of fasting before sampling. Venous blood samples were collected in heparinized tubes between 7:00-9:30 am. The clinical laboratory obtained the sample at about 10:00 am and centrifuged them at 3000rpm for 10min. Then serum was collected into a sterilized cryotube and immediately stored at - 80â for metabolomic analysis.</p>
<p>The acquisition of aqueous humor was described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Aqueous humor (AH) was collected by skilled ophthalmologists during the surgical treatment of PACG and cataract patients. AH was obtained at the start of the procedure using a fine-bore needle during a corneal paracentesis. Following that, AH samples were quickly transferred to sterile cryotubes and kept at -80 Â°C for metabolomic analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c2">
<label>2.3.2</label><title>Sample preprocessing</title>
<p>Before extraction, the serum was thawed on ice, vortex for 10s and mixed well. 300ÂµL of pure methanol was added to 50ÂµL of serum, swirled for 3min, and centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10min at 4Â°C. After centrifugation, transfer the supernatant into a new centrifuge tube and place it in a -20â refrigerator for 30 minutes. The sample was thawed on ice and centrifuged at 12000r/min for 3 minutesâTransfer 180ÂµL of the supernatant to the injection vial for mass spectrometry analysis. Quality control (QC) samples are generated by pooling all the serum samples to monitor the retention time and signal intensity consistency. Equal volumes (10 ÂµL) of all serum samples were combined to generate quality control (QC) samples, which were employed to monitor the repeatability of the analysis. During the mass spectrometry analysis, one QC sample was included in every ten samples to ensure the consistency of the analytical process. The PACG and control groupsâ serum samples were randomly arranged and analyzed. The laboratory conducting the metabolomics measurements was blinded to the samplesâ case/control/QC status.</p>

<p>Normality was assessed using the ShapiroâWilk W-test. Independent studentâs t-test, Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way ANOVA, Wilcox test, and chi-square tests were used when appropriate. Results are presented as frequency and percentage for categorical variables, mean Â± SD for normally distributed continuous variables, and median (interquartile range) for not normally distributed continuous variables. The Spearman correlation test was used to determine the significance of the correlations between the variables.</p>
<p>Diagnostic efficiency was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Five machine learning (random forest, support vector machine, lasso, K-nearest neighbor [KNN], and Gaussian Naive Bayes [NB]) approaches were used to identify an optimal algorithm. The Youden index maximizing sensitivity plus specificity is applied to determine the best cutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were also calculated. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were used to assess the goodness of fit. The calibration of the biomarker was assessed by computing the calibration plot. Hanley-McNeil method was used to compare these AUCs.</p>
<p>Unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) was performed by statistics function prcomp withe R. The data was unit variance scaled before unsupervised PCA. Supervised orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) were applied to obtain a higher level of group separation and a better understanding of variables responsible for classification. Heatmaps of samples and metabolites were carried out by R package (ComplexHeatmap; heatmap). In order to evaluate the binding mode of metabolites and proteins, Autodock Vina v.1.2.2 was used to analyze molecular docking. Fold change= the characteristic peak area of metabolites in the PACG group / the control group.</p>
<p>Identified metabolites were annotated using the KEGG Compound database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/">http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/</ext-link> compound/). Then annotated metabolites were mapped to the KEGG Pathway database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html">http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html</ext-link>). Significantly enriched pathways were identified with a hypergeometric testâs p-value for metabolites.</p>
<p>Cox proportional hazards analysis was also carried out to investigate the relationship between baseline androstenedione levels and VF progression loss. The HRs and baseline characteristics that would assist in categorizing participants into the non-progressing PACG group over the follow-up period were determined using Cox proportional hazards models. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to study the survival results, and the log-rank test was applied to see whether there were any differences between the produced plots.</p>
<p>All statistical analyses were performed using R programming language and SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), a list of statistical approaches and packages detailed in table S1. P-values less than 5% were considered statistically significant.</p>

Following rigorous quality control, data filtering, and normalization procedures, a total of 1464 metabolites were identified across the various samples (N = 440). During the discovery phase, the OPLS-DA analysis revealed notable distinctions between participants with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) and those without the condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Volcano plots (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) were generated using metabolites exhibiting a false discovery rate [FDR] of less than 0.1 and fold changes greater than 1.15 or less than 0.85. In discovery sets 1 and 2, 268 metabolites (21.5%) and 117 metabolites (9.6%), respectively, were found to be significantly altered between PACG and normal subjects.</p>

<p>Can these metabolites in blood differentials be considered as potential biomarkers for PACG? In order to investigate this, we computed the area under the curve (AUC) for each of the 32 differential metabolites to evaluate their discriminatory capacity in distinguishing PACG from healthy individuals using five machine learning techniques (random forest, support vector machine, lasso, KNN, and Gaussian NB). Among these approaches, KNN demonstrated the highest performance in identifying PACG from normal controls.

<label>3.6</label><title>Androstenedione associates with severity of PACG</title>
<p>The present study aimed to examine the potential association between serum androstenedione levels and the clinical severity of PACG.

The results from both discovery set 1 (Figure S10A) and discovery set 2 (Figure S10B) indicated that the mean serum androstenedione levels were significantly higher in the severe PACG group compared to the moderate and mild PACG groups (P&lt;0.001). These findings were further validated in both validation phase 1 (Figure S10C) and validation phase 2 (Figure S10D).</p>
<p>A correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between MD and androstenedione. Notably, a statistically significant positive correlation was found between MD and androstenedione in both discovery set 1 (Figure S4, r=0.37, P&lt;0.001) and discovery set 2 (Figure S5, r=0.50, P&lt;0.001). This finding was further confirmed in validation phase 2 (Figure S10E, r=0.61, P&lt;0.001). Subsequently, the diagnostic potential of androstenedione in distinguishing the severity of PACG was investigated. An AUC was calculated for each severity of PACG to evaluate the discriminatory accuracy of androstenedione in distinguishing between mild, moderate, and severe cases. The results of ROC analysis indicated AUC values ranging from 0.75 to 0.95 in discovery set 1 (Figure S11A, Table S8) and 0.94 to 0.99 in discovery set 2 (Figure S11B, Table S8) when using KNN machine learning algorithms.

<label>3.7</label><title>Clinical value of androstenedione in patients with PACG</title>
<p>The lack of specificity of serum biomarkers remains a significant obstacle to the clinical application of such markers. To investigate temporal changes in androstenedione levels during the initial diagnosis and post-treatment period, we conducted a random analysis of nine pairs of blood samples from patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) taken before and three months after therapy. Our findings indicate a significant decrease in androstenedione levels in the post-treatment serum of the 97th patient compared to the pre-treatment serum (P = 0.021).

<p>The delayed identification of PACG is a notable contributor to patientsâ impaired vision and irreversible blindness. Regrettably, existing medical protocols do not advocate for the use of blood-based biomarkers to diagnose and prognosticate PACG. Consequently, it is imperative to develop novel, uncomplicated, and practicable approaches to improve the early detection of PACG and its predictive accuracy. To address the significant challenge at hand, the present study conducted a cross-sectional and prospective cohort investigation utilizing high-throughput, widely-targeted metabolomics and targeted chemiluminescence immunoassay on blood samples obtained from a substantial number of patients diagnosed with PACG and healthy individuals. The findings of this study reveal, for the first time, that androstenedione exhibits a reasonable level of precision (AUC, 0.85-1.0) in distinguishing between PACG and control groups in blood samples. Additionally, the baseline levels of androstenedione may serve as a valuable predictor of glaucomatous visual field progression.</p>
<p>Some metabolites have been proposed to have a potential role in discriminating PACG from normal, but validation studies in larger cohorts still need to be completed. Rong et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> conducted a case-control (PACG=38, normal=48) study using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and reported that palmitoleic acid, linoleic acid, Î³-linolenic acid, and arachidonic acid were identified as essential metabolites associated with PACG, but diagnostic accuracy is unknown. In our study, these metabolites were also detected, but diagnosis accuracy (AUC&lt;0.7) was limited. Qin et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> measured plasma twenty-two free fatty acids (FFA) and six lipid classes using metabolomics analysis, shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and total saturated fatty acids may be screening indices (AUC, 0.82-0.85) for PACG patients but lack validation set to confirm the results. DHA (AUC, 0.74-0.85), FFA (22:6) (AUC, 0.74-0.85), and FFA (18:4) (AUC, 0.79-1.0) was also shown a diagnose value for PACG patients in the discovery set of our study (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), but the robustness and diagnose accuracy was weaker than androstenedione (AUC, 0.85-1.0) (Table S10). The contribution of previous metabolites to PACG diagnosis was small, which prompted us to conduct a trial designed to develop biomarkers. In this study, androstenedione levels achieved better diagnostic efficiency and robust calibration across the discovery and validation sets. The transformation of normal subjects into PACG is a chronic stepwise process. Given this, screening healthy individuals and those with a family history of the disease is vital. Another important finding of this research was that the level of serum androstenedione retained its diagnostic efficiency for distinguishing the severity of PACG. Furthermore, serum androstenedione levels incrementally increased from mild to moderate to severe PACG, suggesting that serum androstenedione levels may accurately reflect the progression/severity of PACG. Furthermore, androstenedione levels at baseline were a new biomarker for predicting glaucomatous VF progression. Hence, serum androstenedione levels may provide a new biomarker for early detection and monitoring/predicting PACG severity/progression.</p>
<p>In the supplemental phase, we asked whether the serum levels of androstenedione were significantly corrected with aqueous humor levels of androstenedione from the same PACG patients, which is an important criterion for application as a routine clinical biomarker and to explore the biological function in PACG. Fortunately, the levels of aqueous humor androstenedione were positively corrected (r=0.82, P=0.038) with serum levels. Meanwhile, the levels of aqueous humor androstenedione incrementally increased from mild-moderate to severe PACG. Furthermore, the levels of aqueous humor androstenedione remained higher in PACG than in cataracts. Together, these results confirm that androstenedione can serve as a novel biomarker for early detection and monitoring of the progression/severity of PACG.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, oral topical glaucoma medications and laser peripheral iridectomy were the primary therapies used to treat PACG. However, the effects of these therapies are mainly estimated by measurement of intraocular pressure and optical coherence tomography. Thus, we have wondered whether, by dynamic detection, serum androstenedione levels could reflect the therapeutic effect of these therapies. In the supplemental phase (fourth phase), in a small cohort of 9 PACG patients treated with laser peripheral iridectomy or oral topical glaucoma medications, which showed a better prognosis, 7 of 9 exhibited decreased levels of serum androstenedione. These results shed new light on the monitor the effect of therapy; however, these should be verified in a larger cohort.</p>
<p>The main strength of our study is its robustness. We conducted a 5-phase study (discovery set [discovery set 1, the discovery set 2], validation phase 1, validation phase 2, supplemental phase, and cohort phase). We used large and well-characterized patients with adequate controls to confirm the results. Widely-targeted metabolomics and target chemiluminescence immunoassay methods provide high reliability of the metabolite. Androstenedione achieved better diagnostic accuracy across the discovery and validation sets, with AUC varying between 0.85 and 1.0. Interestingly, baseline androstenedione levels can predict glaucoma progression via VF loss results. Of note, the clinical practice of androstenedione in patients with PACG was analyzed by supplemental phase.</p>
<p>The metabolites identified by this study match PACG pathophysiological concepts. Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that these 32 significantly altered metabolites primarily belonged to 16 pathways (Figure S13, Figure S14A). Among the top altered pathways, steroid hormone biosynthesis appears to be the critical node to high-match PACG pathophysiological concepts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>: it connects with androstenedione. The sex hormones pathway is a vital component of steroid hormone biosynthesis (Figure S14B). Several studies have focused on the importance of 17Î²-estradiol in protecting the retinal ganglion cell layer and preserving visual function in clinical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> and basic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> research by anti-inflammatory effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Our previous studies suggested that decreased sex hormone concentrations in glaucoma lead to a hyperinflammatory state, leading to faster rates of VF damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, we hypothesized that aromatase defects might lead to a decrease in estradiol levels and an increase in androstenedione, causing an inflammatory response and leading to retinal ganglion cell death in patient with glaucoma (Figure S14C). In addition, androstenedione converted to estrogens is catalyzed by the aromatase (Figure S14D). Furthermore, some of the metabolites might also be linked to PACG physiological processes that remain unclear, and future research in this field is needed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, other studies have also found significant correlations between androstenedione and other diseases. For example, Javier et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> found that androstenedione can predict the progression of Frailty Syndrome in patients with localized breast cancer treated with aromatase inhibitors. Adriaansen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> reported that diurnal salivary androstenedione levels in healthy volunteers for monitoring treatment efficacy of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.</p>
<p>As far as our understanding goes, this is the initial investigation to methodically outline blood metabolites and scrutinize the diagnostic efficacy of a potential biomarker for PACG. Nevertheless, our study is not without its limitations: (1) The supplementary phase of our study was conducted with a restricted number of patients and healthy controls. Therefore, further investigations with larger sample sizes are necessary to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of serum androstenedione for the detection of primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). (2) Our study cohort exhibited uniform genetic and environmental traits, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings to populations with diverse ethnic or racial backgrounds. (3) Despite the matching of PACG patients and controls for age, gender, BMI, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and drinking, it is possible that unidentified residual confounding factors could impact the observed metabolomic disparities. (4) Throughout the duration of the follow-up period, the majority of individuals received pharmacological treatment, and the studyâs follow-up period was limited to a mere two years. Consequently, the outcomes may have been impacted by either behavioral adjustments prompted by patientsâ cognizance of their medical condition or by any form of therapeutic intervention. (5) Despite our examination of the impact of hormone intake (including estrogen, progestagen, and anti-androgen), the potential influence of reproductive aging cannot be entirely dismissed.</p>

<label>5.</label><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In conclusion, androstenedione has been identified and validated through the use of widely-targeted LC-MS or targeted chemiluminescence immunoassay, demonstrating its ability to effectively differentiate between healthy individuals and those with PACG. Additionally, baseline androstenedione levels may serve as a valuable predictor of glaucomatous VF progression. However, further clinical and basic studies are required to confirm the clinical utility of serum androstenedione for early-stage PACG diagnosis, as well as its potential for monitoring/predicting VF progression and elucidating the underlying mechanisms linking androstenedione to PACG.</p>

<p>The prevalence of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is high in Asia compared to all over the world. This study focused on characterizing the metabolite profile associated with PACG, identifying potential blood diagnostic markers, assessing their specificity for PACG, and verifying their applicability to predict the progression of visual field loss. To this end, Li et al. implemented a 5-phases multicenter prospective study to identify novel candidate biomarkers of PACG. A total of 616 individuals were recruited, identifying 1464 distinct metabolites in the serum by metabolomics and chemiluminescence immunoassays. By applying different machine learning algorithms the metabolite androstenedione showed good discrimination between PACG and control subjects, in both the discovery and validation phases. This metabolite also showed alterations in the aqueous humor and higher levels of androstenedione seemed to be associated with faster loss of visual field. Overall, the authors claimed that serum androstenedione levels may provide a new biomarker for early detection and monitoring/predicting PACG severity/progression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
â¢ Omics research on glaucoma is constrained by inadequate sample sizes, a dearth of validation sets to corroborate findings, and an absence of specificity analyses. The 5-phases study was designed to try to overcome these limitations. The study design is very robust, with well well-described discovery set (1 and 2), validation phase (1 and 2), supplemental phase, and cohort phase. Large and well-characterized patients with adequate control subjects contributed to the robustness of the results.</p>
<p>
â¢ Combining untargeted and targeted metabolomics using mass spectrometry instruments (high resolution and low resolution) with an additional chemiluminiscence immunoassay determining androstenedione levels</p>
<p>
â¢ Androstenedione achieved better diagnostic accuracy across the discovery and validation sets, with AUC varying between 0.85 and 1.0. Interestingly, baseline androstenedione levels can predict glaucoma progression via visual field loss results.</p>
<p>
â¢ A positive correlation was observed between levels of androstenedione in serum and aqueous humor of PACG patients.</p>
<p>
â¢ A level higher of 1.66 ng/mL of the metabolite androstenedione seems to imply a high risk of visual field loss. Androstenedione may serve as a predictor of glaucomatous visual field progression.</p>
<p>Weakness:</p>
<p>
â¢ A single biomarker seems very unlikely to be of much help in the detection of glaucoma due to the etiological heterogeneity of the disease, the existence of different subtypes, and the genetic variability among patients. Rather, a panel of biomarkers may provide more useful information for clinical prediction, including better sensitivity and specificity. The inclusion of additional metabolites already identifying in the study, in combination, may provide more reliable and correct assignment results.</p>
<p>
â¢ The number of samples in the supplementary phase is low, larger sample sizes are mandatory to confirm the diagnostic accuracy.</p>
<p>
â¢ Cohorts from different populations are needed to verify the applicability of this candidate biomarker.</p>
<p>
â¢ Sex hormones seem to be associated also with other types of glaucoma, such as primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), although the molecular mechanisms are unclear (see doi:10.1167/iovs.17-22708). The inclusion of patients diagnosed with other subtypes of glaucoma, like POAG, may contribute to determining the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed biomarker. Androstenedione levels should be determined in POAG, NTG, or PEXG patients.</p>
<p>
â¢ In addition, the levels of androstenedione were found significantly altered during other diseases as described by the authors or by conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome, limiting the utility of the proposed biomarker.</p>
<p>
â¢ Uncertainty of the androstenedione levels compromises its usefulness in clinical practice.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The objective of authors using metabolomics analysis of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is to demonstrate that serum androstenedione is a novel biomarker that can be used to diagnose PACG and predict visual field progression.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Use of widely targeted and untargeted metabolite detection conditions. Use of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and a chemiluminescence method for confirmation of androstenedione.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The &quot;predict&quot; part is on much less solid ground. The visual field progression and association with serum androstenedione within the current experimental design eludes to a correlation. It truly cannot be stated as predictive. To predict one needs to put the substance when nothing is there and demonstrate that the desired endpoint is reached. Conversely, the substance (androstenedione) can be removed, and show that the condition regresses. None of these are possible without model system experiments, which have not been done. The authors could put some additional details in the methods, such as: 1) how much sample was collected, 2) whether equal serum volume for analysis had equal serum proteins (or cells). They have used a LC-MS/MS and a Chemiluminescence method, but another independent method such as GC-MS/MS or NMR to detect androstenedione for a subset of patients with different stages of visual field defect would be desirable.</p>
