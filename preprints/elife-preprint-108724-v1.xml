<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells play a central role in tumor immunotherapy. The presence and activation status of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in tumors are efficient biomarkers to predict prognostic and therapeutic efficacy for patients receiving immunotherapy<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA4 antibodies) targeting the reactivation of tumor-infiltrated cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells have shown amazing clinical benefits in treating various human tumors<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>]</sup>. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) and T-cell receptor-engineered T (TCR-T) cells, which are exogenous cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells that are genetically engineered to directly target cancer cells, have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy against some human tumors<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Fully elucidating the mechanisms regulating development, differentiation, and functions of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells paves ways for development of better tumor immunotherapies.</p>
<p>Expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) can be induced in a wide variety of immune cell types<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. For example, TCR activation induces the expression of PD-1 on T-cell surface. The interaction between PD-1 receptor and its ligand, PD-L1, reduces TCR signals to suppress immune system. When tumors evade attacks from the immune system, cancer cells upregulate their surface PD-L1 expression to prevent attack by endogenous cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Antibodies blocking the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 have been proven to be effective in human tumor immunotherapy and show high efficacy in many tumor types<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Understanding how immune cells regulate their PD-1 expression is one of the most important aspects of tumor immunology research. Although a few regulators of PD-1 expression in cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells have been identified recently<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup>, an unbiased systematic screening is still missing.</p>
<p>Here, by combining ex vivo primary memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell culture and an in vivo syngeneic mouse tumor model with genome-wide and custom CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, we systematically identified genes and pathways that regulate PD-1 expression and functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Among them, inactivation of a key enzyme in glycoconjugate biosynthesis, i.e., B4GALT1, enhances PD-1 expression, TCR activation, and functions of mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells both in vitro and in vivo. Similar roles of B4GALT1 were also observed in human CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Mechanistic studies indicate that B4GALT1 regulates CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell function via a TCR-dependent pathway through cell surface protein glycosylation. Systematic LC-MS analysis further identified that proteins in TCR-complex and its co-receptors are direct substrates of B4GALT1. Mechanistic studies indicate that B4GALT1 deficient T-cells showed stronger TCR-CD8 interaction and enhanced TCR activation than wild-type control, which can be bypassed by artificially tethering of TCR with CD8 when CD8β-CD3ε fusion protein was overexpressed. These results support a model that B4GALT1 modulates T-cell function by direct galactosylation of TCR and CD8 which prevents the interaction between them. Finally, the expression of B4GALT1 showed a significant negative correlation with prognosis of human cancer patients when normalized to tumor infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Taken all together, the results reveal the important roles of protein N-glycosylation in regulating functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and prove that B4GALT1 is a potential target for tumor immunotherapy.</p>

<title>Ex vivo and in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 screenings identify genes and pathways that regulate PD-1 expression and functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells</title>
<p>We set up an ex vivo genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening system to identify genes and pathways that regulate PD-1 expression in mouse primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). In brief, splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells from Cas9-EGFP/OT-I mice were infected with a retroviral whole-genome guide RNA (gRNA) library following ovalbumin (Ova) peptide stimulation. After puromycin selection, the memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were re-stimulated by co-culturing with B16F10-OVA cells. The highest and lowest 5% PD-1<sup>+</sup> cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and defined as PD-1<sup>high</sup> and PD-1<sup>low</sup> populations, respectively. The distributions of individual gRNAs in the whole-genome library in those subpopulations, as well as in input cells, were revealed by next-generation sequencing. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <italic>Pdcd1</italic> and previously identified PD-1 regulators, such as <italic>Satb1</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup> and <italic>Fut8</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>, were successfully identified as positive controls. We could verify most of the top candidates individually by FACS and RT-qPCR assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified several KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways significantly involved in regulation of PD-1 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). As expected, genes that are known to be involved in the T-cell receptor (TCR) activation pathway such as <italic>Cd3d</italic>, <italic>Zap70</italic>, and <italic>Lat</italic> were among the top ones identified. Interestingly, genes involved in protein export pathway (such as <italic>Srp14</italic>, <italic>Srp68</italic>, <italic>Sec16A</italic>) and in aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis (such as <italic>Mars</italic>, <italic>Hars2</italic>, <italic>Eprs</italic>) were significantly increased in PD-1<sup>low</sup> populations. In addition, we also identified and verified genes required for N-glycan biosynthesis, including <italic>B4galt1</italic>, <italic>Mgat2</italic>, and <italic>Dpm3</italic>, which could negatively regulate the expression of PD-1 (Fig. S1a-c).</p>

<p>To verify these candidate genes in a high-throughput manner, we synthesized a custom gRNA library containing 4,617 gRNAs targeting the top candidate genes obtained from whole-genome screenings and 105 intergenic control gRNAs. The gRNA library-infected Cas9-EGFP/OT-I memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were restimulated by co-culture and PD-1 regulators were enriched using the same strategy as whole-genome screening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">fig. 1a</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">fig. 2b</xref>, most of the significant PD-1 regulators in the top list of genome-wide screening could also be enriched in the custom small library screening, which indicates the reliability of our ex vivo screenings. To test potential functions of these candidate genes in the context of tumor microenvironment, custom gRNA-library-infected Cas9-EGFP/OT-I memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were transplanted into wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) with B16F10-OVA tumors to screen for genes regulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell functions in vivo. After 7 days, tumor-infiltrated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were collected for gRNA sequencing (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). We successfully identified several positive control genes<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup> such as <italic>Socs1</italic>, <italic>Regnase-1 (Zc3h12a)</italic>, <italic>Rc3h1</italic>, and <italic>Cd36</italic>, indicating our in-vivo screening system worked robustly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Interestingly, inactivating <italic>B4galt1</italic>, which encodes beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1, showed significant phenotypes in both ex vivo and in vivo screenings.</p>

<title>B4GALT1 suppression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells activates TCR signaling and enhances T-cell functions both in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p>B4GALT1 is one of the seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferases that transfer galactose in a beta 1-4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars, including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), glucose (Glc), and xylose (Xyl). More specifically, B4GALT1 uses UDP-galactose and N-acetylglucosamine for the production of galactose beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosamine<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup>. In addition to glycoconjugate biosynthesis, B4GALT1 can also form a heterodimer with a-lactalbumin (LALBA) as lactose synthetase in lactating tissues. Although B4GALT1 is expressed ubiquitously, its roles in regulating interaction and adhesion of immune cells have been suggested<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Infection of Cas9-EGFP/OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells with different gRNAs targeting B4galt1 resulted in significantly increased surface PD-1 expression and PD-1 mRNA levels both before and after co-culture with B16F10-OVA cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and Fig. S1c). Such phenotypes could be rescued by overexpression of either a short or long isoform of mouse <italic>B4galt1</italic> cDNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), suggesting that biosynthetic function, but not ligand-induced signal transduction, of B4GALT1<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>]</sup> is responsible for suppression of PD-1 expression. In addition, <italic>B4galt1</italic> deficient OT-I T-cells showed enhanced expression of T-cell activation and cytotoxic markers such as IFNγ and TNFα (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>), as well as in vitro targeted cell killing activity when co-cultured with target cells, B16F10-OVA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). To verify whether B4GALT1 has similar functions in human T-cells, we infected primary human CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells with NY-ESO-1 TCR constructs containing shRNA expression cassettes targeting human B4GALT1<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3f</xref>, comparing with control, knockdown of human B4GALT1 enhanced targeted killing of human A375 cells in vitro. Increased secretion levels of IFNγ and TNFα have been observed after knockdown of B4GALT1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g</xref>). Surprisingly, knockout of B4GATL1 could not affect hCD19-CAR mediated in vitro killing of Nalm6 cells (Fig. S2a). When stimulate with only anti-CD3/28 antibodies in the absence of target cells, B4GALT1 knockout OT-I cells also did not show significantly enhanced expression of IFNγ and TNFα, comparing with controls (Fig. S3a). These results indicate that B4GALT1 may enhance T-cell functions via a TCR- and target-cell dependent pathway.</p>

<p>To dissect mechanisms by that B4GALT1 regulates T-cell functions, we sorted OT-I T-cells after co-culture with target cells for genome-wide transcriptional analysis. Whole-genome RNA sequencing analysis confirmed the enhanced TCR activation in <italic>B4galt1</italic> knockout CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3h-j</xref>). GSEA of DEGs (differentially expressed genes) between control and <italic>B4galt1</italic> gRNA-infected CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells revealed that TCR signaling pathway was at the top of significantly altered pathways (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3j</xref>).</p>
<p>When transplanted into wild-type mice with B16F10-OVA cells inoculated subcutaneously, <italic>B4galt1</italic> gRNA-infected OT-I T-cells showed significantly higher tumor killing activity than control gRNA-infected cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a-c</xref>). Analysis of tumor-infiltrated lymphocytes (TILs) demonstrated more infiltrated OT-I T-cells in tumors when <italic>B4galt1</italic> gRNA was infected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Mechanistically, B16F10-OVA tumors had similar numbers of infiltrated <italic>B4galt1</italic> gRNA-infected OT-I T-cells as control gRNA-infected cells 24 hours after intravenous injection (Fig. S4a), suggesting that B4GALT1 has no significant effect on initial tumor infiltration of OT-I T-cells. On the other hand, CFSE (carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester) analysis at a later time point (6 days after infusion) showed increased OT-I T-cell proliferation within tumors when B4GALT1 was inactivated (Fig. S4b). Altogether, these results suggest that inhibition of N-galactosylation could enhance functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells both in vitro and in vivo, and that B4GALT1 could be a potential target to modulate activity of T-cells.</p>

<title>Systematically identification of direct substrates of B4GALT1 on T-cell surface</title>
<p>To dissect the molecular mechanism by which B4GALT1 regulates T-cell activation, we analyzed N-glycome on OT-I T-cell surface by FACS staining (Fig. S5a). Biotin-labeled <italic>Erythrina cristagalli</italic> lectin (ECL) and succinyl-wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) were used to profile surface expression of terminal βGal and βGlcNAc, respectively. <italic>B4galt1</italic> knockout OT-I T-cells showed slightly but significantly decreased ECL staining and significantly increased sWGA staining, comparing with WT control T-cells (Fig. S5b-c). FACS staining with biotin-labeled recombinant Galectin-1 (Gal-1) showed a more dramatic difference between control and <italic>B4galt1</italic> knockout OT-I T-cells (Fig. S5d).</p>
<p>To identify potential substrates of B4GALT1 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell surface, we used a recombinant Gal-1 affinity column and lactose elution to purify N-glycosylated proteins from whole membrane-protein extracts of OT-I CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). LC-MS analysis of proteins that were significantly different between control and <italic>B4galt1</italic> knockout OT-I T-cells revealed that both TCRα/β (OT-I) and CD8α/β were among the top list (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). KEGG analysis also showed a significant enrichment of TCR signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>).

<p>It has been suggested that interaction between TCR and CD8 plays an important role for TCR activation<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. We hypothesized that aberrant galactosylation of TCR and CD8 might directly affect their interaction. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>, FRET signals of TCR-CD8 increased significantly in B4GALT1 deficient T-cells, comparing with control wild-type cells. To confirm whether reduced TCR-CD8 interaction is the major cause of TCR activation phenotype in B4GALT1 knockout CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, we generated a construct which fused the CD8β ectodomain (ECD) with CD3ε (Fig.5g). Overexpression of such CD8β-CD3ε fusion led to enhanced in vitro killing activities in wild-type CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. On the other hand, the enhanced T-cell killing activities by B4GALT1 knockout was significantly diminished when fusion construct was overexpressed in B4GALT1 knockout CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells (Fig.5h-i). Taken together, these results support a model that B4GALT1 directly regulates galactosylation of TCR complex and co-receptors to regulate TCR-CD8 interaction, which is essential for TCR activation and functions of T-cells.</p>

<p>To investigate potential clinical relevance of B4GALT1 in human tumor patients, we analyzed cancer samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>. While expression levels of B4GALT1 are not linked to an overall survival benefit using data of all TCGA collected primary cancer samples, after normalized to expression level of CD8A, Kaplan-Meier curve showed a significantly better survival duration in patients with low expression of B4GALT1 (Fig. S6a-b)<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup>. In Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (LAML), Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and Rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) data sets, for patients with higher expression of CD8A, low B4GALT1 expression level is significantly associated to better overall survival, comparing with patients with lower expression of CD8A (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and Fig. S6c). On the contrary, in patients with lower expression of B4GALT1, high CD8A expression level is significantly associated to better overall survival, comparing with patients with higher expression of B4GALT1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref> and Fig. S6c).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, which directly kill tumor cells, are key effector cells within tumor microenvironment<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Following TCR activation by MHC-peptide complexes, PD-1 expression in T-cells is significantly upregulated<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. Cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-7, and interferons secreted by T-cells, can also induce high PD-1 expression<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. Beyond its role as one of the markers for TCR activation, PD1 suppresses further T-cell activation after binds to its ligand PD-L1, thereby preventing excessive immune responses<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>. Therapeutically targeting PD-1 molecules on immune cells, especially cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, is one of the most successful strategies to treat tumors<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]</sup>. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate PD-1 expression on cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells presents important clues to optimize current tumor immunotherapy strategies, including CAR-T/TCR-T and immune checkpoint inhibitors, especially anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 blocking antibodies.</p>
<p>By genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, we systematically identified genes and pathways regulating PD-1 expression in primary CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. The results that <italic>Pdcd1</italic> gene and some previously reported regulators of PD-1, such as <italic>Satb1</italic> and <italic>Fut8</italic>, were successfully identified, demonstrate the effectiveness of this screening system. Interestingly, genes in N-glycan biosynthesis are significantly enriched to negatively regulate PD-1 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Inhibition of B4GALT1 could activate expression of PD-1 and functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, B4GALT1 modulates galactosylation of proteins on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell surface, including proteins in TCR complex and its co-receptors. The decreased galactosylation of TCR complex and CD8 enhances the TCR-CD8 interaction, which is the major downstream mechanism that B4GALT1 regulates TCR activation. Our results not only demonstrate the important roles of protein N-glycosylation in regulating functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells but also prove that B4GALT1 is an effective target for tumor immunotherapy. In particular, previous studies have demonstrated the roles of B4GALT1 in cancer cells such as in LUAD and CRC<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>. Our study suggests that inhibition of B4GALT1 in both cancer cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells may synergistically suppress tumor growth.</p>
<p>Based on results from individual studies of specific glycosidases and glycosyltransferases, N-linked glycosylation of T-cell surface proteins have been proposed to regulate T-cell development, activation, and functions<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup>. Here, we identified roles of N-glycome synthesis in regulating PD1 expression of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells by unbiased genome-wide screenings. To further investigate mechanisms, we systematically characterized substrates of B4GALT1 on CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell surface, suggesting the model that B4GALT1 regulates TCR activation by directly modulate N-glycosylation of components of TCR and its co-receptor complexes. In addition, several interesting observations also provides mechanistic insights supporting our hypothesis. Knockout of B4GALT1 only significantly affect activation of exogenous and exogenous TCR (OT-I and NY-ESO-1, respectively) but not CAR (hCD19-CAR) in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells. Similarly, knockout of CD8a shows different effect on TCR and CAR activation (data not shown). Moreover, different from results obtained after co-culture with target cells, when B4GALT1 knockout CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were stimulated by anti-CD3/28 only, they did not show significantly enhanced activation. Further studies are necessary to clarify whether B4GALT1 mediated N-galactosylation modifications directly or indirectly affect functions of its substrates and how target cancer cells contribute to activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells in a B4GALT1-dependent manor.</p>
<p>Adoptive T-cell therapy has been actively implicated for treatment of cancer and chronic infections<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. While CAR-T and TCR-T therapies demonstrated promising effect in controlling hematological malignancies, their applications in solid tumors remains challenging<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>,</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup><sup>]</sup>. How to enhance activities of in vitro expanded T-cells is also a major barrier for tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]</sup>. Our in vitro and in vivo results strongly support that B4GALT1 is a potential target to enhance the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapy.</p>
<p>In summary, our study utilized unbiased genome-wide and custom small library screenings to identify PD-1 regulators in CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells, and discovered a fundamental role for a gene involved in N-glycan biosynthesis---B4GALT1, which can enhance T-cell activation and functions both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight the power of protein N-glycosylation in regulating functions of CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells and suggest that B4GALT1 is a potential target for tumor immunotherapy. It will provide a new perspective and direction for the research of T-cell regulators to enhance the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Yu et al investigated the role of protein N-glycosylation in regulating T-cell activation and functions is an interesting work. By using genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screenings, the authors found that B4GALT1 deficiency could activate expression of PD-1 and enhance functions of CD8+ T cells both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the important roles of protein N-glycosylation in regulating functions of CD8+ T cells, which indicates that B4GALT1 is a potential target for tumor immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are the findings of novel function of B4GALT1 deficiency in CD8 T cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, authors did not directly demonstrate that B4GALT1 deficiency regulates the interaction between TCR and CD8, as well as functional outcomes of this interaction, such as TCR signaling enhancements.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We are very sorry that we did not highlight our results in Fig. 5f-h enough. In those figures, we demonstrated the interaction between TCR and CD8 increased significantly in B4GALT1 deficient T-cells, by FRET assays. To confirm the important role of TCR-CD8 interaction in mediating the functions of B4GALT1 in regulating T-cell functions, such as in vitro killing of target cells, we artificially tethered TCR and CD8 by a CD8β-CD3ε fusion protein and tested its functions in both WT and B4GALT1 knockout CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell. Our results demonstrate that such fusion protein could bypass the effect of B4GALT1 knockout in CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells (Fig. 5g-h). Together with the results that B4GALT1 directly regulates the galactosylation of TCR and CD8, those results strongly support the model that B4GALT1 modulates T-cell functions mainly by galactosylations of TCR and CD8 that interfere their interaction.</p>

<p>Thank reviewer for reminding. We verified the efficiency of some gRNAs by FACS and Surveyor assay. We will add those data in supplementary results in revised version later.</p>

<p>please see response to reviewer #1.</p>

<p>(3) The specific N-glycosylation sites of TCR and CD8 are not identified, and would be helpful for site-specific mutational analysis to further the authors' model.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for suggestion! Unfortunately, there are multiple-sites of TCR and CD8 involved in N-glycosylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://glycosmos.org/glycomeatlas">https://glycosmos.org/glycomeatlas</ext-link>). We worry that mutations of all these sites may not only affect glycosylation of TCR and CD8 but also other essential functions of those proteins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The study could benefit from further in vivo experiments testing the role of B4GALT1 in other physiological contexts relevant to CD8 T cells, for example, autoimmune disease or infectious disease.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank reviewer for this great suggestion to expand the roles of B4GALT1 in autoimmune and infection diseases. However, since in current manuscript we are mainly focusing on tumor immunology, we think we should leave these studies for future works.</p>
