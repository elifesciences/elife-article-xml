<title>Summary</title><p>The rising prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a global health threat that needs to be addressed urgently. Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF) is commonly thought to be involved in immunity, but its effect on lipid metabolism is not clear. Here, we investigated the function of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism. BATF alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and inhibited elevated programmed cell death protein (PD)1 expression induced by HFD. A mechanistic study confirmed that BATF regulated fat accumulation by inhibiting PD1 expression and promoting energy metabolism. PD1 antibodies alleviated hepatic lipid deposition. In conclusion, we identified the regulatory role of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism and that PD1 is a target for alleviation of NAFLD. This study provides new insights into the relationship between BATF, PD1 and NAFLD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become a prevalent chronic liver disease that threatens human health globally. Studies have shown that the global prevalence of NAFLD is about 25% and this trend is still rising<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The clinical diagnostic criterion for NAFLD is that &gt;5% of the liver has steatosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Further deterioration of NAFLD leads to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> and liver fibrosis, markedly increased risk of adverse outcomes including overall mortality, and liver-specific morbidity and mortality, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Transcription factors (TFs) are a class of DNA-binding proteins whose gene regulation ability is critical to the molecular state of cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Multiple studies have shown that TFs are closely related to NAFLD. The currently discovered TFs related to liver lipid metabolism include peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, liver X receptors (LXRs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> and sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. These TFs are essential for maintaining the body’s lipid metabolism balance through the regulation of lipid metabolism genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Drugs targeting TFs have been developed, and are widely used in the prevention and treatment of lipid metabolic disorders such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, etc., and show excellent clinical effects and potential applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Basic leucine zipper ATF-like transcription factor (BATF), BATF2 and BATF3 belong to the activator protein (AP)-1 family<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Initially, BATF family members were only considered to be inhibitors of AP-1-driven transcription, but recent studies have found that these TFs have unique transcriptional activities in dendritic cells, B cells and T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. This indicates that their functions may not be fully understood. Currently, BATF has not been found to be directly related to lipid metabolism. The purpose of this study was to explore this relationship. Our study provides a new perspective for understanding the occurrence of NAFLD.</p>

<title>BATF reduces high-fat-diet-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes</title>
<p>High-fat diet (HFD) promotes hepatic lipid accumulation and leads to dysregulation of lipid metabolism. We detected hepatic BATF expression in mice fed an HFD for 14 weeks to investigate the role of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism. HFD significantly increased liver lipid deposition and BATF levels in mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A, B</xref>). HepG2 cells were treated with oleic acid/palmitic acid (OA/PA) to mimic HFD. It promoted triglyceride (TG) accumulation (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1A</xref>) and increased BATF expression (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). Our analysis of data from patients with NAFLD showed that BATF levels increased with increasing NAFLD score (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We inhibited BATF in HepG2 cells (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1B</xref>) and found no effect on cellular TG accumulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). This indicated that inhibition of BATF could not regulate lipid deposition in hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). Therefore, the role of BATF overexpression was studied. Oil red O staining on lipid droplets and TG detection showed that BATF alleviated OA/PA-induced HepG2 cellular fat deposition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G, H</xref>). BATF also reduced TG accumulation in L02 human hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I, J</xref>). To confirm the results, we isolated mouse primary hepatocytes and infected them with a virus expressing BATF. The results also showed that BATF alleviated accumulation of lipid droplets and TG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1K, L</xref>). In AML12 cells, we found consistent results (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig S1C, D</xref>). These results confirm that BATF can alleviate lipid deposition in hepatocytes.</p>

<title>Increased hepatic BATF alleviates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in mice</title>
<p>We constructed an AAV8 virus overexpressing BATF to infect mouse liver. After infection, mice were fed normal chow or HFD. The weight and fat mass of the mice were measured weekly, and the mice were sacrificed 12 weeks after virus infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Overexpression of BATF increased hepatic BATF protein expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B, C</xref>), but there was no change in heart, muscle, fat or spleen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D, E</xref>). In addition, In the case of no difference in feed intake among the four groups (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2A</xref>), HFD increased body weight and adiposity in mice, while BATF significantly alleviated weight gain and fat accumulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F, G</xref>). Mouse livers showed that HFD made them yellow and covered with fat-like particles, but BATF significantly alleviated these changes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2H</xref>). Liver hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining of mice in the HFD group confirmed that BATF reduced the number of unstained vacuoles (lipid droplets) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2I</xref>). To verify the effect of BATF on hepatic lipid metabolism, oil red O staining, TG content and Glycerin level were examined and confirmed that BATF significantly alleviated HFD-induced lipid deposition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2J–M</xref>). BATF had no effect on the liver total cholesterol (TC) content of mice (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2B</xref>). BATF did not have a significant impact on glucose metabolism in mice, including blood glucose levels (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2C</xref>), Glucose Oxidase activity (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2D</xref>) and glucose tolerance (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Fig S2E, F</xref>).</p>

<p>We conducted further studies to explore the mechanism by which BATF regulated hepatic lipid metabolism. BATF reduced alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A, B</xref>). It confirmed that BATF alleviated HFD-induced liver injury in mice. Detection of mRNA expression of lipid metabolism genes revealed that BATF did not affect lipid-synthesis-related genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>), but promoted expression of various lipid hydrolysis genes, including <italic>AMPK</italic>α<italic>1, Aco</italic>, <italic>Acox1</italic>, <italic>Bcl2</italic>, <italic>Cpt1</italic>, etc (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Fatty acid β-oxidation is a main route of fat metabolism, in which short-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase (SCAD) plays a key role. The result confirmed that BATF greatly promotes SCAD activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>). Fatty acid oxidation mainly takes place in mitochondria, so studies on the effect of BATF on aerobic oxidation were carried out. BATF elevated the level of ATP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3F</xref>). An oxygen consumption rate test was performed to explore the effect of BATF on mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3G</xref>), and indicated that BATF increased basal respiration, maximal respiration and ATP production in HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3H</xref>). These results suggest that BATF mitigates the effects of HFD on hepatic lipid deposition by promoting energy metabolism.</p>

<title>BATF alleviates HFD-induced adipocyte hypertrophy in mice</title>
<p>BATF alleviated HFD-induced increase in adiposity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2G</xref>). After anesthetizing the mice, we used micro-computed tomography (CT) to scan the whole body and image the adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). The red lightly shaded parts represent the adipose tissue of the mice, and the results indicated that BATF alleviated overall fat accumulation. The epididymal fat and subcutaneous fat of mice were separated. The results showed that BATF reduced the epididymal and subcutaneous fat (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B–E</xref>). HE staining of mouse adipose tissue allowed microscopic observation of adipocytes, and the diameter and area of the adipocytes indicated that BATF alleviated adipocyte hypertrophy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F–K</xref>). BATF was overexpressed only in the liver but not in adipose tissue. To investigate the effect of BATF on lipid accumulation in adipocytes, we overexpressed BATF in 3T3-L1 cells and found that it had no effect on accumulation of TG (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4L</xref>). These results confirm that BATF does not directly act upon adipocytes to reduce fat accumulation. Therefore, we speculated that BATF regulates fat accumulation in adipose tissue by influencing secretion of substances from the liver. To test this conjecture, we cultured differentiated 3T3-L1 cells with HepG2- cultured cell culture medium (overexpressing BATF) and assayed their TG content. The HepG2-cultured cell culture medium (overexpressing BATF) alleviated TG accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4M</xref>). Interleukin (IL)-27 has an inhibitory effect on fat accumulation. We confirmed that HFD decreased IL-27 expression, while BATF enhanced IL-27 expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4N</xref>). This suggests that BATF mitigates the expansion of adipose tissue by promoting IL-27 secretion.</p>

<title>BATF alleviates hepatocyte lipid accumulation by inhibiting programmed cell death protein 1</title>
<p>Several studies have confirmed that there is a regulatory relationship between BATF and programmed cell death protein (PD)1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. HFD increased PD1, while BATF inhibited PD1 expression in mouse liver (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). These results were confirmed in HepG2 cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). To determine the role of PD1 in lipid accumulation in hepatocytes, we overexpressed PD1 in HepG2 cells and assayed the lipid content. Both oil red O staining and TG content confirmed that PD1 promoted lipid deposition in hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C, D</xref>). PD1 antibody inhibited the role of PD1 and successfully alleviated TG accumulation in hepatocytes, but BATF overexpression plus PD1 antibody did not further alleviate lipid deposition (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), suggesting that BATF regulates lipid deposition through PD1. To confirm this hypothesis, we overexpressed BATF and PD1. Overexpression of BATF decreased TG, while the TG-lowering effect of BATF disappeared when PD1 was overexpressed (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref>). To determine the regulatory role of BATF on PD1, we constructed a luciferase vector containing 2000 bp upstream of the transcription start site of PD1. BATF decreased the transcriptional activity of PD1 promoter, confirming the role of BATF in regulating PD1 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5G</xref>). These results suggest that BATF regulates lipid deposition through inhibition of PD1. In conclusion, HFD leads to an increase in the level of PD1 transcription in the liver. BATF promotes lipolysis and energy consumption in hepatocytes by regulating PD1 transcription, thereby reducing HFD-induced liver lipid deposition and alleviating NAFLD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H</xref>).</p>

<title>PD1 antibody alleviates HFD-induced obesity and liver steatosis in mice</title>
<p>PD1 plays an important role in tumorigenesis as a tumor immune escape target, and PD1 antibodies as antitumor drugs can inhibit PD1 and mitigate tumor growth and cancer development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Our study confirmed that PD1 promoted lipid deposition in hepatocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C, D</xref>), and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were performed to verify the role of PD1 on hepatic steatosis in mice fed an HFD. PD1 antibody alleviated HFD-induced weight gain in mice after intraperitoneal injection of PD1 antibody (200 μg) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). The mice injected with PD1 antibody were smaller than the control mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). The results of fat mass confirmed that PD1 antibody alleviated fat accumulation in mice (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). The epididymal and subcutaneous fat of mice were reduced by PD1 antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D–G</xref>). Mouse livers showed that HFD gave them an appearance of hepatic steatosis, which was significantly alleviated by PD1 antibody (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6H</xref>). The liver was stained with Oil Red O and assayed for TG content, which showed that PD1 antibody reduced accumulation of lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6I</xref>) in the liver and alleviated lipid deposition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6J</xref>). We extracted RNA from mouse livers and examined expression of lipolysis-related genes. PD1 antibody treatment was consistent with overexpression of BATF, and both promoted expression of lipolysis-related genes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6K</xref>). Similarly, PD1 antibody treatment promoted SCAD activity in mouse liver, suggesting fatty acid β-oxidation was enhanced (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6L</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, we found that HFD elevated BATF expression in mouse liver. We also found that inhibition of hepatocyte BATF did not regulate lipid deposition, while overexpression of BATF decreased TG accumulation. Studies on hepatocytes confirmed that BATF regulated hepatocyte lipid deposition. BATF also alleviated HFD-induced obesity in mice, not by directly acting on adipose tissue but by influencing IL-27, which acts as a regulator of fat deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by BATF has not previously been investigated. Here, we found that BATF mitigated HFD-induced increase in PD1 expression. We revealed that PD1 promoted hepatocyte lipid deposition. Through luciferase assays, we found that BATF regulated lipid deposition by inhibiting PD1 expression. Experiments in mice confirmed that PD1 inhibition alleviated HFD-induced obesity and hepatic steatosis.</p>
<p>The adaptive immune system has evolved to eliminate virtually any threat from the organism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. PD1 is expressed during T-cell activation and through T-cell receptor counteracting positive signaling by engaging its ligands PDL1 and/or PDL2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. PD1 regulates the immune system and promotes self-tolerance by downregulating the immune response to human cells and by suppressing T-cell inflammatory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. The development of checkpoint blockade inhibitors has revolutionized cancer immunotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup> and has led to durable survival outcomes in some patients with metastatic disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Previous studies on PD1 have focused on the immune system, and we found that HFD increased its expression in the liver of mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> suggesting that PD1 is equally important in the liver. Several studies have demonstrated that PD1 and BATF regulate each other to modulate immune system flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that BATF and PD1 co-regulate the hepatic immune system to affect lipid deposition. Our results confirm our conjecture that BATF reduces fat accumulation by inhibiting PD1, confirming that PD1 is downstream of the BATF signaling pathway (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F, G</xref>).</p>
<p>Cancer and autoimmune disease are closely related, and many therapeutic antibodies are widely used in clinics for the treatment of both diseases. Moreover, immune checkpoint blockade using the anti-PD1/PD-L1/CTLA4 antibody has been shown to improve prognosis of patients with refractory solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In this study, we used PD1 antibodies to treat HFD-induced obesity and NAFLD in mice. Surprisingly, PD1 antibody has an excellent therapeutic effect on obesity and NAFLD. PD1 antibodies reduced adiposity and hepatic lipid deposition (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>), which is consistent with overexpression of BATF. There have been no approved drugs for NAFLD treatment. In this study, the effect of PD1 antibodies on NAFLD treatment was encouraging. Our findings have somewhat pioneered the cognition of BATF, PD1 and its expansion with NAFLD therapy.</p>

<p>The authors investigated the function of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism. They found BATF alleviated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. In addition, BATF could inhibit programmed cell death protein (PD)1 expression induced by HFD. By using over expression and transcriptional activity analysis, this study confirmed that BATF regulates fat accumulation by inhibiting PD1 expression and promoting energy metabolism. Then, they found PD1 antibodies alleviated hepatic lipid deposition. These data identified the regulatory role of BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism and that PD1 is a target for alleviation of NAFLD. The conclusions of this manuscript are supported by the data.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, authors firstly investigated the role of a transcriptional factor BATF in hepatic lipid metabolism both in vivo and in vitro. By using a AAV transfection to overexpress BATF in liver, the mice with overexpression of BATF resisted the high fat diets induced obesity and attenuated the hepatic steatosis. Mechanically, the PD1 mediated its effect on lipid accumulation in hepatocyte and IL-27 mediated its effect on adiposity reduction in vivo.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. This work found the transcription factor BATF was positive to reduce hepatic lipid accumulation and offered a potential target to treat NAFLD.</p>
<p>2. PD1 antibody is always used to treat cancer, authors here have developed its new function in metabolic disease. PD1 antibody could help mice to combat obesity and hepatic steatosis induced by high fat diets.</p>
<p>3. Overexpression of BATF in the liver not only decreased the lipid accumulation in the liver but also reduced the fat mass. IL-27 secretion in the liver was enhanced to affect the adipose tissue. The cross talk in liver and adipose tissue was also validated in this paper.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you very much for your advices and comments. We took your suggestion into consideration and decided to modify it as you suggested. We will add more data and analysis on this topic in the article to make the exposition fuller.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. There are different cells in liver tissue, in which BATF protein is expressed most.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Based on the analysis of single-cell public data (GEO accession: GSE129516), BATF is expressed in every cell cluster in the liver, with the highest expression in T cells and the least in cholangiocytes (Author response image 1).</p>

<p>1. For in vivo study, food intake is key data to exclude the change of energy intake.</p>

<p>Feed intake related result plots have been added to figureS2A.</p>

<p>1. For Fig.6 Since PD1 are also highly expressed in heart and spleen, how to exclude the effect of PD1 antibody on these tissues?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>According to the images of the heart (Author response image 2 left) and spleen (Author response image 2 right) during mouse dissection, the morphology and size of the two organs were similar in HFD-CN and HFD-PD1 group. Moreover, relevant literature indicated that PD-1 blockade had little impact on the number and function of transferred T cells within the spleen(Peng et al.)，and anti-PD-1 had no effect on mouse splenic cell proliferation (Shindo et al.).Du et al. showed in their study that single use of PD-1 antibody (10 mg/kg, once every three days, for 4 weeks) did not affect mouse heart (Du et al.). Both our results and related literature indicated that PD 1 antibody should not have adverse effects on the heart and spleen.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your advices and comments. We have seriously considered your suggestion and will focus on it in our future research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weakness</p>
<p>1. BATF protein is also abundantly expressed in control hepatocyte, but the knockdown of BATF had no effect on lipid accumulation. Besides, the expression of BATF was elevated by high fat diets. So it will be interesting to investigate its role in the liver by using its hepatic conditional knockout mice.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewers' suggestion to investigate other functions of BATF in the liver besides its protective role in a high-fat environment. However, we did not use BATF knockout mice in this study because our data indicated that BATF knockdown had no effect on lipid accumulation. We will pursue further research and validation in future studies.</p>

<p>1. The data for the direct regulation of BATF on PD1 and IL-27 is not enough, it is better to carry out CHIP experiment to further confirm it.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable comments. The article by Kevin Man et al. found that, upregulation of transcription factor BATF regulates PD1 expression and repairs impaired cellular metabolism (Man et al.). This confirms that BATF has a regulatory effect on PD1. And in our manuscript, the dual luciferase reporter assay of BATF and PD1 confirmed that BATF can regulate the expression of PD1(Fig 5G). This confirms that BATF has a regulatory effect on PD1. We do not have conclusive evidence for a direct interaction between BATF and IL-27 yet, but there are some relevant studies that support their connection. For instance, BATF and IRF1 were found to be transcription factors induced early by IL-27 treatment, and essential for Tr1 cell differentiation and function, both in vitro and in vivo (Karwacz et al.). Moreover, Zhang et al. identified BATF as one of the transcription factors regulating IL-27 expression by transcription factor prediction and RNA sequencing analysis (Zhang et al.). These results lay the foundation for elucidating the regulation of PD1 and IL-27 by BATF.</p>
