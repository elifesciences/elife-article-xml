<title>Summary</title>
<p>In the lesioned zebrafish retina, Müller glia produce multipotent retinal progenitors that generate all retinal neurons, replacing lost cell types. To study the molecular mechanisms linking Müller glia reactivity to progenitor production and neuronal differentiation, we used single cell RNA sequencing of Müller glia, progenitors and regenerated progeny from uninjured and light-lesioned retinae. We discover an injury-induced Müller glia differentiation trajectory that leads into a cell population with a hybrid identity expressing marker genes of Müller glia and progenitors. A glial self-renewal and a neurogenic trajectory depart from the hybrid cell population. We further observe that neurogenic progenitors progressively differentiate to generate retinal ganglion cells first and bipolar cells last, similar to the events observed during retinal development. Our work provides a comprehensive description of Müller glia and progenitor transcriptional changes and fate decisions in the regenerating retina, which are key to tailor cell differentiation and replacement therapies for retinal dystrophies in humans.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The vertebrate retina is the neural tissue in the back of the eyes that detects and processes visual stimuli prior to transmission to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dowling, 1987</xref>). The retina has a layered structure, with outer, inner and ganglion cell nuclear layers alternating with the outer and inner plexiform layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Hoon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stenkamp, 2015</xref>). The nuclear layers comprise the nuclei of retinal neurons, whereas the plexiform layers contain neuronal synapses. There are six distinct classes of retinal neurons and one main type of glia: retinal ganglion, cone photoreceptor, horizontal, amacrine, rod photoreceptor and bipolar cells, as well as Müller glia. This heterogeneity arises during development in the indicated order from a common pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs), which progressively restrict their competence to generate early and mid-late born cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agathocleous and Harris, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Alexiades and Cepko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cepko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Cepko et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Livesey and Cepko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Stenkamp, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Turner and Cepko, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Weber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Young, 1985</xref>). Retinal development, structure and function are highly conserved among vertebrates, including the teleost zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) with only slight variations. For instance, humans and zebrafish possess a cone-dominated retina adapted for diurnal visual tasks, whereas nocturnal animals, like mice and rats, have rod-dominated retinae adapted for a dim light lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Fleisch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Saade et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stenkamp, 2007</xref>). Intriguingly, and in contrast to warm-blooded vertebrates like birds and mammals, adult zebrafish can fully regenerate their retinae upon lesions affecting different neuronal cell types, depending on the injury paradigm. For instance, intense light ablates preferentially light-sensing rod and cone photoreceptors in the central and dorsal retina, whereas application of neurotoxins, like ouabain or NMDA, affects mainly retinal ganglion and amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fimbel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Powell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Sherpa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Vihtelic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Vihtelic and Hyde, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Weber et al., 2013</xref>). Independently of the lesion type, Müller glia (MG), acting as resident stem cells, are the primary cellular origin of regenerated cells. Specifically, zebrafish MG react to the lesion by partial dedifferentiation and cell cycle re-entry, followed by an asymmetric division producing renewed MG and multipotent RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Gorsuch and Hyde, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lahne et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Wan and Goldman, 2016</xref>). Dedifferentiation of MG to a progenitor-like state is not complete, as MG upregulate progenitor-associated genes like <italic>pax6</italic> or <italic>vsx2</italic>, but retain their glial morphology. In this context, glial markers like Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (<italic>gfap</italic>) as well as glutamine synthase (<italic>glula</italic>) have been reported to be either retained or downregulated, depending on the lesion paradigm, the regeneration time point, the antibody and the transgenic line used to label MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fimbel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). However, in all reported cases, MG-derived RPCs do not express <italic>gfap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). Asymmetric cell division of MG occurs between 31 hours and 2 days post-lesion, followed by further proliferation of MG-derived RPCs that peaks at 4-5 days post lesion, depending on the injury paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fimbel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>). Studies on zebrafish retina regeneration have so far mainly focused on very early phases of MG dedifferentiation and RPC production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fausett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Ramachandran et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thummel et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work showed that MG initially assume a reactive state, characterized by the expression of <italic>hmga1a</italic> and <italic>yap1</italic>, prior to giving rise to proliferative, neurogenic RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, impaired Yap1 or Hmga1a function impedes MG reprogramming and neurogenesis in the regenerating retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the molecular and cellular identities of self-renewed MG and MG-derived RPCs remain elusive. RPCs have fusiform nuclei that closely associate with GFAP-positive glial fibers across the inner nuclear layer. They also express markers of multipotency, like Pax6 and Sox2, as well as markers of neurogenesis, like Atoh7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gorsuch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Raymond et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thummel et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have investigated RPCs molecular identity mainly at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cameron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kassen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kramer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lahne et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Morris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ng Chi Kei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Powell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Qin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ramachandran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). However, a detailed characterization of the transcriptional network underlying RPC production and RPC differentiation, as well as the lineage relationships between MG, RPCs and differentiating progeny is currently missing. Here, we profiled the transcriptome of MG and MG-derived RPCs in response to an intense light lesion, and followed their differentiation trajectories towards regenerated retinal neurons at the single cell level. In particular, we addressed the transcriptional state of reactive MG prior to and after their asymmetric cell division. Moreover, we addressed whether MG-derived RPCs are heterogeneous and to what extent they express molecular markers that are observed during embryonic retinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). To this aim, we employed a short-term lineage tracing strategy that allowed the isolation of individual MG and MG-derived cells of the regenerating zebrafish retina, which were subsequently subjected to droplet-based, 10x Genomics single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We find that MG can be non-reactive in uninjured and lesioned conditions, as well as reactive upon lesion. Reactive MG give rise to a hybrid cell population, which replenishes the pool of MG as well as feeds into the pool of neurogenic RPCs. Moreover, MG-derived RPCs are highly heterogeneous and display a progressive restriction in their competence during subsequent differentiation. They upregulate developmental markers of retinogenesis and produce regenerated neurons partially according to the developmental birth order, with retinal ganglion cells born first and bipolar cells born last.</p>

<title>Isolation of individual MG, RPCs and regenerated progeny using fluorescent reporters</title>
<p>Previous work on the regenerating zebrafish retina described the early phases of MG de-differentiation and RPC production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cameron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fausett et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lahne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Thummel et al., 2010</xref>). However, knowledge on the molecular identity and cell fate choices of RPCs is scarce and based on analyses at a population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cameron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kramer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lahne et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ng Chi Kei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Powell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Qin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ramachandran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). To study MG activation, RPC identity and their relationship with MG in more detail, we profiled the transcriptome of MG and MG-derived RPCs and followed their differentiation trajectories towards regenerated retinal neurons at the single cell level. To do so, we devised a strategy to isolate individual MG, RPCs and regenerated progeny, using retinae of uninjured and light-lesioned fish carrying the two fluorescent reporters <italic>pcna:EGFP</italic> and <italic>gfap:mCherry</italic>. The former drives the expression of EGFP under the regulatory elements of <italic>proliferating cell nuclear antigen</italic> (<italic>pcna</italic>), a known marker of proliferating cells, and thereby labels actively dividing cells, and, due to the persistence of EGFP, their short-term progeny. The other reporter drives expression of mCherry under the regulatory elements of <italic>glial fibrillary acidic protein</italic> (<italic>gfap</italic>), a known marker of zebrafish MG. Both transgenes recapitulate the endogenous expression in the adult zebrafish retina faithfully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure1-figure supplement 1</xref>). Immunohistochemistry against the proliferation marker PCNA co-labeled <italic>pcna:EGFP</italic>-positive cells mainly in the ciliary marginal zone, one of the stem cells niches in the adult zebrafish retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Raymond et al., 2006</xref>). Occasionally, <italic>pcna:EGFP</italic>/PCNA-double positive cells were observed in the central retina as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure1-figure supplement 1A</xref>). The MG-specific antibody Zrf1 labeled virtually all <italic>gfap:mCherry</italic>-positive cells in the central retina as well as in the ciliary marginal zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure1-figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also addressed the expression of the two fluorescent reporter lines following light lesion, at three different time points upon injury. First, 44 hours post light lesion (hpl), when MG are about to undergo or have already completed their asymmetric cell division giving rise to the first RPCs and self-renewed MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lahne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>). Second, 4 days post light lesion (dpl), representing the peak of RPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>) and third, 6 dpl, when the first differentiating, regenerated progeny arise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>). Immunohistochemistry against EGFP and mCherry in double transgenic <italic>Tg(pcna:EGFP);Tg(gfap:mCherry)</italic> animals corroborated the expected expression pattern of the transgenes in the central retina at the chosen time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">Figure1-figure supplement 2</xref>). Uninjured, central retinae displayed no EGFP, but strong mCherry signal consistent with non-proliferating MG (white arrowheads). In contrast, numerous EGFP/mCherry double-positive cells were present at 44 hpl, indicating potential cell-cycle re-entry of MG (yellow arrowheads). At 4 dpl, overall mCherry expression was reduced, consistent with the previously described downregulation of the <italic>gfap</italic> promoter by MG-derived RPCs. In contrast, EGFP was strongly found throughout all retinal layers, matching the reported peak in proliferation of MG-derived RPCs (red arrowheads) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fimbel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, in comparison to 4 dpl, an increase in mCherry accompanies a decline in EGFP signal at 6 dpl (yellow arrowhead). In order to obtain single cells of MG, RPCs and regenerated progeny, we utilized the persistence of EGFP and mCherry fluorescence, providing a short-term label. Initially, only MG express mCherry in uninjured, central retinae, but activate EGFP in preparation of the asymmetric cell division upon light lesion at 44 hpl (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Firstborn RPCs inherit high levels of persisting fluorescent mCherry protein from dividing MG and slowly degrade/dilute the protein during subsequent rounds of cell division. Hence, MG-derived, but further dividing, RPCs are EGFP-positive, but low mCherry-positive at 4 dpl. At 6 dpl, RPCs have further diluted the mCherry reporter, thus displaying only a faint mCherry signal, but remain EGFP-positive. Similarly, RPC-derived, regenerated progeny is characterized by even lower levels of intrinsic mCherry fluorescence, and low EGFP signal during subsequent cell differentiation at 6 dpl. Following this rationale, we dissected retinae of uninjured and light-lesioned samples, dissociated them into single cell suspensions that were subjected to flow cytometry followed by droplet-based, 10x Genomics scRNAseq (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Flow cytometry plots confirmed the rationale of the above-mentioned strategy (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_3">Figure1-figure supplement 3</xref>). In all samples, we detected non-fluorescent and EGFP-positive only cells, consistent with non-proliferating and proliferating cells in the adult zebrafish retina. We also detected cell populations expressing only mCherry at all sampled time points, most likely representing non-reactive MG. In addition to cells expressing either EGFP or mCherry, we find EGFP/mCherry-double positive cells in all samples consistent with proliferating MG originating from the ciliary marginal zone and the central retina (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure1-figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_2">2</xref>). The EGFP/mCherry-double positive population increased at 44 hpl, presumably due to an increase in the cell number of reactive, proliferating MG. At 4 dpl, the expanded EGFP/mCherry-double positive cell population was still present, but displayed a lower mCherry, yet an increased EGFP signal, in line with MG-derived RPCs, peaking in proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>). At 6 dpl, a further decreased mCherry intensity was observed for the EGFP/mCherry-double positive cell population. In order to profile the transcriptome of individual MG, RPCs and progeny of the uninjured and light lesioned retinae, we dissected retinae of the before-mentioned time points (uninjured, 44 hpl, 4 dpl, 6 dpl) and eventually sorted 15.000 cells per time point. We applied a sorting gate that included both mCherry-positive only and EGFP/mCherry-double positive cells at the sampled time points (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_3">Figure 1-figure supplement 3</xref>). Non-fluorescent as well as EGFP- only positive cells were not included. Taken together, we devised a short-term lineage tracing strategy that allows the isolation of individual MG and MG-derived cells of the regenerating zebrafish retina, which can be subjected to droplet-based,10x Genomics.</p>

<title>scRNAseq identifies 15 distinct cell populations in the light-lesioned retina</title>
<p>Sorted cells underwent 10x Genomics scRNAseq and 13.139 cells passed the sequencing quality control. We detected a median of 1.407 genes and 4.061 mean read counts per cell. Initially, we identified three clusters for the full dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Figure 2- figure supplement 1A</xref>): a retinal core dataset and two additional clusters identified as microglia and low-quality cells expressing many ribosomal transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_1">Figure 2-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both populations were excluded from the subsequent analysis. Re-clustering of the core dataset, which eventually included 11.690 cells, revealed 15 potential, different cell populations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). From left to right on the UMAP, which visualizes the cell lineage trajectory, we observed the progressive emergence of MG, RPC and progeny clusters. We assigned the cellular identity by inspecting the top 100, upregulated marker genes per cluster (supplementary file 1). In detail, we identified four MG clusters (clusters 1 to 4) that locate to the left and middle portion of the map, followed by five RPC clusters (clusters 5 to 9) locating to the right side of the map. Regenerated progeny branch from the RPCs and include retinal ganglion (cluster 10), amacrine (cluster 13) and bipolar cells (cluster 15) at the bottom-right, as well as red and blue cones (clusters 11 and 12) at the top-right of the map. Additionally, there is a second cluster of amacrine cells (cluster 14) that separates from the first amacrine cell cluster.</p>

<p>To investigate how the composition of cells changed during regeneration, we computed embedding densities for each time point (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Similar to the progression of cellular identities, cells progressed over time from left to right, from the uninjured, to the 44 hpl, the 4 dpl, as well as the 6 dpl enriched samples. As expected, cells belonging to non-reactive MG were found at all sampled time points. In particular, the vast majority of cells of the uninjured sample belonged to cluster 1 as well as cluster 2. However, we also observed a small proportion of cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) aligning in a trajectory from non-reactive MG (left side of the map) through reactive MG (middle part) to RPCs and differentiating progeny (right side) in the uninjured sample. At 44 hpl, cells mapping to non-reactive MG were still abundantly present, although mostly shifted right towards a cluster representing reactive MG (cluster 3). Cells belonging to this cluster of reactive MG were also highly enriched in this sample. In contrast, cells mapping to the second cluster of reactive MG (cluster 4) as well as to RPCs (clusters 5-9) were overrepresented at 4 dpl, in line with the reported peak in proliferation at this time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>). Cells mapping to RPCs were still frequently present at 6 dpl. Moreover, cells belonging to regenerated progeny (clusters 10-15), which first appear at 4 dpl, became predominantly enriched at 6 dpl. In addition to the overall progression from left to right, we noted that cells mapping to reactive MG of the second cluster (cluster 4) and the abutting portion of non-reactive MG (cluster 1) were also enriched at this time point, indicating a reversed direction.</p>
<p>Analysis of the cell cycle state further supported our cluster annotation. Specifically, known cell cycle marker genes were used to calculate the predicted cell cycle state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Whitfield et al., 2002</xref>), and the cell cycle phase (G1, S, G2/M) was projected onto the UMAP of the single cell transcriptome (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Differentiating or differentiated cells were considered as cells in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, we observed that most cells of the left side and lower middle part as well as cells branching from the right side of the map were in G1, which comprised most non-reactive MG (clusters 1 and 2), one cluster of reactive MG (cluster 4), one RPC population (cluster 7) and the regenerated progeny (clusters 10-15). Cells in S phase were also present on the left side of the map, which represent non-reactive MG (clusters 1 and 2), but were in particular enriched in two domains of the middle part corresponding to reactive MG (cluster 3) and RPCs (clusters 5 and 7). In addition, two domains on the right side of the map showed an accumulation of cells in S phase, which include photoreceptor and horizontal cell precursors (clusters 8 and 9). The pattern of cells in G2/M phase complemented the pattern of cells in G1 and S phase. Cell proliferation pattern was further confirmed by <italic>pcna</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). When plotting <italic>pcna</italic> expression onto the main UMAP of the single cell transcriptome, we observed high counts in one population of reactive MG (cluster 3) and in RPCs (clusters 5, 6, 8 and 9). In summary, scRNAseq analysis enabled the establishment of a transcriptome map, which reveals the progressive emergence of non-reactive MG, reactive MG and MG-derived progenitors and regenerated progeny.</p>

The glial marker <italic>gfap</italic>, found among the top 100 upregulated marker genes for cluster 4 (supplementary file 1), showed a similar pattern, with high counts in clusters 1 to 4, but displayed high counts in cluster 5 as well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Given the expression pattern of <italic>apoeb</italic> and <italic>gfap</italic>, we identified clusters 1 to 4 as MG populations.

<p>We next looked into differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the non-reactive MG clusters 1 and 2. For instance, the UMAP plot of <italic>inhbaa</italic>, an evolutionarily conserved vertebrate glia marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>) showed strong expression only in clusters 1, 3 and 4, but not in cluster 2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>, and supplementary file 2). Reactive MG on the other hand downregulated some glial markers, like <italic>glula</italic> and <italic>rlbp1a</italic>, and upregulated inflammatory cytokines, like <italic>crlf1a</italic>, matrix metalloproteases, like <italic>mmp9</italic>, and growth factors like <italic>hbegfa</italic> in the regenerating retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>, and supplementary file 1). Consistent with that, plotting of <italic>crlf1a</italic> expression onto the UMAP showed high read counts in clusters 3 and 4, as well as in cluster 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Again, DEG analysis showed that reactive MG can be subdivided further, because only cluster 3, but not cluster 4 expressed Hairy-related downstream targets of active Notch signalling including <italic>her15.1-1</italic>, <italic>her9</italic> and <italic>her4.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref>, and supplementary file 3). Indeed, the UMAP plot of <italic>her4.1</italic> showed strong expression in cluster 3 as well as in cluster 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). To validate the expression of <italic>her4.1</italic> in the regenerating retina we used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. In agreement with our scRNAseq dataset, <italic>her4.1</italic> signal was not present in the uninjured retina, but appeared at 44 hpl in the inner nuclear layer of the central retina (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). At 4 and 6 dpl, <italic>her4.1</italic> transcripts remained in the inner nuclear layer and appeared in cells of the outer nuclear layer too (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). We further analysed the expression of <italic>crlf1a</italic>, a marker of reactive MG, with fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry against GFAP (located mainly to MG fibers) and the proliferation marker PCNA (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with our scRNAseq dataset, <italic>crlf1a</italic> was not detectable in the uninjured, central retina, but was upregulated in Zrf1/PCNA-double positive cells at 44 hpl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). At 4 dpl, <italic>crlf1a</italic> signal was still present in Zrf1/PCNA-double positive cells and returned back to undetectable levels at 6 dpl (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Taken together, we observed cellular heterogeneity in MG during regeneration, and identified two non-reactive and two reactive MG populations that express distinct marker genes.</p>

<title>scRNAseq identifies a transient cell population with hybrid characteristics of reactive MG and early RPCs in the light-lesioned retina</title>
<p>As mentioned above, several MG-related genes, like <italic>gfap</italic> or <italic>crlf1a</italic>, were also expressed in cluster 5, which locates next to the reactive MG (clusters 3 and 4), is highly proliferative and only becomes eminent at 4 dpl. Further analysis of this cluster showed expression of several members of the High Mobility Group (Hmg) protein family among the top 100 upregulated marker genes (supplementary file 1). Consistent with that, the UMAP expression profile of <italic>hmgb2b</italic> showed presence of high counts already in cluster 3 (reactive MG), as well as in other, further downstream RPC clusters and regenerating progeny (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This indicated a transition from MG to RPC fate in the course of regeneration and that cells of cluster 5 might have hybrid characteristics of reactive MG and downstream RPCs. Hence, we conducted a DEG analysis of cluster 5 in comparison to reactive MG (clusters 3 and 4), as well as to the neighbouring, downstream RPCs (cluster 6). When compared to reactive MG, cells of cluster 5 showed expression of several genes, including <italic>stmn1a</italic>, <italic>nr2e1</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1C</xref>, supplementary files 4 and 5). Consistently, UMAP expression profile of <italic>stmn1a</italic> showed counts prevalently in cluster 5 and neighbouring, downstream RPCs on the right side of the map, but not in the reactive or non-reactive MG on the left side (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). The UMAP profiles of <italic>sox9b</italic> and <italic>nr2e1</italic> showed strong expression almost exclusively restricted to cluster 5. DEG analysis between cluster 5 and the neighbouring downstream cluster 6 revealed also expression of <italic>nr2e1</italic> and <italic>sox9b</italic>, but additionally transcripts like <italic>id1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and supplementary file 6). Consistently, high <italic>id1</italic> counts were found in cluster 5 and in other reactive or non-reactive MG clusters, but not in downstream RPCs on the right side of the map (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). In order to validate the RNAseq data, we analysed the expression of <italic>hmgb2b</italic> and <italic>id1</italic> transcripts in the regenerating retina using <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization combined with immunohistochemistry, respectively. Consistent with our scRNAseq data, <italic>hmgb2b</italic> signal was not detectable in the uninjured, central retina, but was initiated in individual cells residing in the inner nuclear layer at 44 hpl (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). Subsequently, <italic>hmgb2b</italic> transcripts could be detected in clusters of cells in the inner and outer nuclear layers at 4 and 6 dpl (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The expression of <italic>id1</italic> in the regenerating tissue matched the scRNAseq data. Expression of <italic>id1</italic> was already detectable in Zrf1-positive but PCNA-negative cells in the inner nuclear layer of the uninjured, central retina (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). At 44 hpl, <italic>id1</italic> was strongly upregulated and co-localized with Zrf1/PCNA-double positive cells in the inner nuclear layer. At 4 and 6 dpl, <italic>id1</italic> expression was still associated with Zrf1/PCNA-double positive cells and, occasionally, with PCNA-only positive cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A, B</xref>). In summary, marker analysis reveals that cells in cluster 5 display a transcriptional signature of reactive MG, as well as RPCs, which is why we assigned it a hybrid identity.</p>

<title>scRNAseq identifies two neurogenic progenitor populations in the light-lesioned retina</title>
<p>The before-mentioned DEG-analysis between cluster 5 (hybrid cells) and cluster 6 (neighbouring, downstream RPCs) also revealed that the latter upregulated <italic>insm1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and supplementary file 6), which has been described to promote cell cycle exit of RPCs in the injured fish retina at 4 dpl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ramachandran et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, our DEG analysis showed upregulation of <italic>atoh7</italic> and <italic>onecut2</italic> in cluster 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and supplementary file 6). We found that the highly redundant gene <italic>onecut1</italic> was also expressed in cluster 6, albeit this was not found in the DEG analysis. As expected, the UMAP expression profile of <italic>insm1a</italic> confirmed high read counts in cluster 6 but also in clusters 7, 8 and 10 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). The UMAP expression profile of <italic>atoh7</italic> also confirmed expression in cluster 6, as well as in clusters 7 and 10 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Moreover, the UMAP expression profile of <italic>onecut1</italic> and <italic>onecut2</italic> confirmed that both genes were expressed in clusters 6 and 7 and in addition in cluster 9 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>). Cluster 7 expressed additional neurogenic marker genes like <italic>tubb5</italic> and <italic>sox11b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Baraban et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Lange et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mu et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and supplementary file 1). Finally, the cell cycle status and the UMAP expression of <italic>mki67,</italic> a mitotic marker, showed read counts in cluster 6, but not in cluster 7 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>).

<title>scRNAseq identifies fate-restricted progenitors in the light-lesioned retina</title>
<p>Gene expression analysis of cluster 8, which locates next to the neurogenic progenitors (cluster 6 and 7), showed significant upregulation of several well-known photoreceptor precursor markers, including <italic>crx</italic>, and <italic>thrb</italic> (supplementary file 1). Consistently, UMAP plots for <italic>crx</italic> and <italic>thrb</italic> revealed high counts in cluster 8 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>). Moreover, the former was also highly expressed in clusters 11 and 12, whereas the latter was restricted to the additional cluster 1. Subsequent further gene expression analysis identified clusters 11 and 12 as differentiating cone photoreceptors arising from cluster 8. Precisely, clusters 11 and 12 represent differentiating photoreceptors giving rise to blue and red cones as shown by the UMAP plots of <italic>opn1sw2</italic> and <italic>opn1lw2</italic>, respectively (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). Cluster 9, which abuts the neurogenic progenitor 3 (cluster 7), expressed known developmental markers of horizontal cell precursors like <italic>prox1a</italic> and <italic>rem1</italic> (supplementary file 1). Consistently, the UMAP plot for <italic>rem1</italic> showed high expression almost restricted to this cluster specifically. Gene expression analysis also revealed <italic>ptf1a</italic> expression in cluster 9, which has been shown to be required for lineage specification of horizontal and amacrine cells in the developing retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Jusuf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Jusuf and Harris, 2009</xref>). In line with these findings, the UMAP expression profile of <italic>ptf1a</italic> confirms high counts in the left part of cluster 9, but is even more pronounced in the upstream part of cluster 7 feeding into cluster 9 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). Gene expression analysis of the remaining clusters 10, 13, 14 and 15 identified them as differentiating progeny giving rise to retinal ganglion cells (cluster 10), amacrine cells (clusters 13 and 14), as well as bipolar cells (cluster 15), respectively (supplementary file 1). In this context, UMAP plots of <italic>gap43</italic> and the more mature retinal ganglion cell marker <italic>isl2b</italic> showed a strong upregulation in cluster 10 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>). UMAP plots of <italic>stx1b</italic> and <italic>pvalb6</italic>, markers of differentiating and mature amacrine cells, revealed strong expression in clusters 13 and 14, whereas UMAP plots of <italic>vsx1</italic> and <italic>samsn1a</italic>, known and novel markers of bipolar cells, respectively, showed high counts in cluster 15 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8E, F</xref>).</p>

<p>With this respect, it was recently shown that the regenerating adult zebrafish retina recapitulates developmental fate specification programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lahne et al., 2020a</xref>). Hence, we plotted the fraction of cells that differentiate into a specific cell fate during the time course of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_1">Figure 8-figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that the earliest committed progeny emerged at 4 dpl giving rise to retinal ganglion cells or to photoreceptors, in particular red cones. At 6 dpl, the number of retinal ganglion cells and red cones continued to increase. In addition, we detected a significant number of blue cones and amacrine cells, as well as a small number of bipolar cells at this time point. We did not detect any differentiating progeny giving rise to horizontal cells or rods at this stage. To address this issue, we further investigated the expression of more mature neuronal markers in our dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2</xref>). Expression of <italic>rho</italic> and <italic>gnat1</italic>, two markers of rod photoreceptors, was very low and sparse, and did not define any specific rod cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2A</xref>). Expression of <italic>gad1b</italic>, which encodes for glutamate decarboxylase synthetizing the neurotransmitter GABA, was mostly restricted to amacrine cells (clusters 13 and 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2B</xref>). To address the expression of more mature markers of amacrine and horizontal cells, we investigated <italic>chata</italic> (<italic>choline O-acetyltransferase a</italic>, an amacrine cell-specific marker), as well as <italic>calb2a</italic> and <italic>calb2b</italic> (<italic>calbindin 2a</italic> and <italic>calbindin 2b</italic>, markers of amacrine and horizontal cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). As expected, high counts of <italic>chata</italic> were specifically found in amacrine cells (clusters 13 and 14). In particular, <italic>chata</italic> expression was detected only in cells located at the tip of cluster 13 and in all cells of cluster 14. <italic>calb2a</italic> was expressed in some reactive MG (cluster 3) and quite strongly in some amacrine cells (cluster 13). Importantly, we did not detect any <italic>calb2a</italic> and <italic>calb2b</italic> in horizontal cell precursors (cluster 9).</p>
<p>We also checked the expression of transcripts for variants of protein kinase C using <italic>prkcab</italic> and <italic>prkcbb</italic> (<italic>protein kinase alpha b</italic>, <italic>protein kinase beta b</italic>) to identify mature bipolar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2D</xref>). Counts for <italic>prkcab</italic> were sparsely found in some non-reactive and reactive MG (clusters 1-4). <italic>prkcbb</italic>-positive cells were found more frequently in some non-reactive and reactive MG (clusters 1-4), progenitor 1 (cluster 5), as well as in amacrine cells (clusters 13, 14). Importantly, we did not detect <italic>prkcab</italic> or <italic>prkcbb</italic> in our bipolar cells. When plotting the expression of general synaptic markers like <italic>snap25a</italic> and <italic>snap25b</italic>, we observed mainly transcripts in the differentiating progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2E</xref>). Specifically, high counts of <italic>snap25a</italic> were found in retinal ganglion and amacrine cells (clusters 10, 13 and 14). High counts of <italic>snap25b</italic> were observed in the same clusters as well as in red and blue cones (clusters 11 and 12) and the right part of the horizontal cell precursors (cluster 9). Taken together, our scRNAseq data reveal the presence of fate-restricted progenitors and the sequential appearance of differentiating progeny in the light-lesioned, adult zebrafish retina. Moreover, the analysis of more mature markers shows that the differentiation of retinal ganglion cells and red cones is preceding the appearance of blue cones, amacrine and bipolar cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we employed a short-term lineage tracing strategy, which allowed the selective enrichment of MG and their respective progeny for up to six days post light lesion. Subsequent scRNAseq resolved the transcriptome of individual MG, RPCs as well as regenerated progeny, and allowed to reconstruct their lineage relationship in the homeostatic and regenerating zebrafish retina (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). A previous study combined bulk RNA sequencing of sorted MG with scRNAseq of whole retinae from zebrafish upon NMDA as well as light lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). This work focussed specifically on the early reprogramming of MG and progenitor production, covering up to 36 hours post light lesion. The authors report that MG go through an activated, non-proliferative state characterized by upregulation of gliosis markers. However, neither did they find any evidence of MG heterogeneity in uninjured conditions nor did they provide any thorough characterization of MG-derived RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). Additional RNA sequencing studies of the regenerating zebrafish retina have used microarray as well as RT-PCR and qRT-PCR to evaluate transcriptional changes at a population level, without providing any MG/RPC single cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cameron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Craig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kassen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Kramer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Morris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Ng Chi Kei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Qin et al., 2009</xref>). Previous immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments provided a broad description of MG-derived RPCs. Indeed, progenitors are reported as fusiform cells that proliferate and express markers of multipotency like Pax6 and Sox2, as well as some neurogenic markers like Atoh7, Ptf1a, Vsx1 and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Fimbel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Gorsuch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lahne et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ramachandran et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to these previous results, our study is the first providing a comprehensive overview of MG, MG-derived cells and their lineage relationship up to 6 days post lesion in the zebrafish retina. Due to our selective enrichment of MG and their respective progeny, we gain an adequate single cell resolution to observe substantial heterogeneity in the molecular identity of MG in homeostatic as well as regenerating conditions. We also provide an in depth description of MG as well as RPC molecular identity, cell fate decisions and production of regenerated progeny that cover all key aspects during zebrafish retina regeneration. Our strategy allowed us to define two main trajectories in the regenerating zebrafish retina (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). The first trajectory (solid and dashed red lines) comprises clusters 1 to 5 and constitutes a closed cycle that both maintains the MG pool and generates the first-born neurogenic RPCs. The second trajectory (solid black lines) involves clusters 6 to 15 and gives rise to all retinal neurons via the progressive restriction in cell fate competence of neurogenic RPCs. We discuss the two trajectories separately.</p>

Moreover, the hybrid cell population represents the tip of the neurogenic trajectory, resulting in the formation of neuronal precursors and differentiating neurons (solid black lines).

<title>Müller glia self-renew and give rise to early, multipotent progenitors</title>
<p>The glial trajectory starts with non-reactive MG (clusters 1 and 2), which express canonical glial markers like <italic>gfap</italic>, <italic>apoeb</italic> and additional genes like <italic>glula</italic>, <italic>rlbp1a</italic> and <italic>cahz</italic> that ensure the housekeeping function of MG during homeostasis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2_2">Figure 2-figure supplement 2</xref>, supplementary file 1). Most cells in the non-reactive MG clusters are quiescent based on the analysis of the cell cycle, and are frequently found in the uninjured, but also in the lesioned retina at all sampled time points (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, some non-reactive MG are in S or G2/M phases of the cell cycle, and express <italic>pcna</italic>, albeit at a lower level as compared to the expression in injury-induced, proliferating cell clusters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). This is consistent with the proposed model that zebrafish MG proliferate occasionally also in the uninjured, central retina and generate rod progenitors that feed the rod precursor pool at the base of the outer nuclear layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Stenkamp, 2007</xref>). Accordingly, we detect PCNA-positive cells in the uninjured, central retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1-figure supplement 1</xref>) as well as a small fraction of cells that align in a trajectory from non-reactive MG on the left through reactive MG in the middle, to photoreceptor precursors on the right side of the UMAP in the uninjured retina (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). However, some cells end up in the amacrine as well as retinal ganglion cell clusters. This suggests that MG might have the potential to generate not only rods, but also all other retinal neurons in the homeostatic adult retina. Indeed, MG in the uninjured retina express, albeit at a low level, multipotency markers like <italic>pax6</italic>, and share many marker genes with RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Blackshaw et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Raymond et al., 2006</xref>). Still, MG and injury-induced RPCs are considered distinct cell populations. Upon injury, MG divide only once between 31 and 48 hpl, whereas MG-derived RPCs continue to divide, reaching a peak of proliferation at 4-5 dpl (discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lahne et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). We isolated cells at 44 hpl, a time point when MG are about to undergo, or already underwent, their asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lahne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>) and identify cells in cluster 3 as early reactive MG. Consistent with that, we find that cells in cluster 3 do not only express <italic>gfap</italic> and <italic>apoeb</italic>, but also <italic>pcna</italic> (Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). Moreover, the predicted cell cycle status supports this notion. Whereas cells in the left part of cluster 3 are mostly in G1, cells in G2/M phase are found in the right part, with cells in S phase overlapping with both domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Cells in cluster 3 also upregulate inflammation-related markers like <italic>crlf1a</italic>, as well as <italic>mmp9</italic> and <italic>hbegfa</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref> and supplementary file 1). The upregulation of inflammatory genes makes MG similar to immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Silva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, our population of early reactive MG (cluster 3), identified mostly at 44 hpl, resembles the reactive MG pool found in the regenerating zebrafish retina at 36 hpl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). However, our MG cluster is proliferative, whereas the one discussed by the mentioned study is not. The presence of a distinct pool of non-proliferative, reactive MG as early as 36 hpl in the earlier study might be explained by the different time points of sample collection, and/or by the lower number of cells sequenced in our experiment (11.690) in comparison to the previous one (45.153) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>). In summary, MG in the homeostatic zebrafish retina behave like multipotent RPCs. Upon injury, reactive MG express genes associated with inflammation, like <italic>crlf1a</italic>, and undergo asymmetric cell division. Daughter cells derived from this cell division most likely map to cluster 5, which is discussed below.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>A crossroad in the glial trajectory: hybrid cells with MG and RPC characteristics</title>
<p>The close similarity between zebrafish MG and MG-derived RPCs at the level of expressed markers as well as cellular and subcellular morphology has been described extensively in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Lahne et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>). Thus, we suggest that cells in cluster 5, which displays a transcriptional hybrid identity between MG and RPCs, are the product of the asymmetric cell division from the early reactive MG (cluster 3). Cells in cluster 5 are still <italic>gfap</italic> positive, and share marker expression with early reactive MG, like <italic>her4.1</italic> and <italic>crlf1a</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A, C</xref>). However, cluster 5 is highly proliferative and becomes only prominent at 4 dpl, a time point when predominantly RPCs are proliferating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bernardos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>). Consistently, <italic>pcna</italic> is highly expressed in cluster 5 and the predicted cell cycle status indicates that most cells are in S or G2/M phase (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Moreover, previous studies have found <italic>her4.1</italic> and <italic>crlf1a</italic> in MG-derived RPCs in the light- as well as stab-lesioned retina, where they control RPC proliferation at 4 dpl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Wan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). We found that <italic>her4.1</italic> at 4 and 6 dpl locates to the inner nuclear layer as well as to the outer nuclear layer, where presumptive RPCs reside at this time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, cells in cluster 5 upregulate <italic>sox9b</italic> and <italic>nr2e1</italic>, which have been found in early, multipotent RPCs of the developing fish, avian and mammalian retinae, as well as in late retinogenesis, where they regulate MG genesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Buenaventura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Corso-Díaz and Simpson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kitambi and Hauptmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Muto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Poché et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, we propose that cells in cluster 5 represent a crossroad of the glial and neurogenic trajectory, containing self-renewed MG as well as first-born, MG-derived RPCs as a direct result of the earlier (44 hpl) asymmetric MG cell division. We further propose that self-renewed MG close the cycle via late reactive MG (cluster 4) and return into non-reactive MG (clusters 1 and 2, red, dashed line in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). In contrast, MG-derived RPCs embark into the neurogenic pathway (cluster 6, solid, black line). In an alternative model, cells in cluster 5 might represent only MG cells that have upregulated early RPC markers like <italic>sox9b</italic> and <italic>nr2e1</italic> and are dividing a second time at 4 dpl to generate renewed MG (cluster 4) and neurogenic RPCs (cluster 6). However, MG have been described to divide only once between 31 and 42 hpl and additional and/or asynchronous MG divisions later than 2 dpl have not been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lahne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Lenkowski and Raymond, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Nagashima et al., 2013</xref>). BrdU/EdU lineage tracing experiments will be required to address this issue, with the caveat that MG and RPCs are hardly distinguishable from each other in the 4 dpl retina, especially when using the Zrf1 antibody to label MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fausett and Goldman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Raymond et al., 2006</xref>). Live imaging of the regenerating retina would be the best tool to follow MG and MG-derived progenitors <italic>in vivo</italic>, but the technique is not optimized yet for long recordings from the intact tissue in the living animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Lahne et al., 2015</xref>). Either way, our proposed model of self-renewing MG is further supported by the change of cell density over time (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Following the cells across the four time points on the UMAP, we observe that initially most cells of the uninjured sample map to non-reactive MG (clusters 1 and 2) located at the far left. At 44 hpl, the cell density shifts towards the upper right portion of cluster 1 and towards the early reactive MG (cluster 3) in the upper, middle of the map. At 4 dpl, sampled cells mostly map to RPCs (clusters 5-9) on the right, as well as to late reactive MG (cluster 4) in the lower, middle part. Additionally, cells mapping to the lower right part of non-reactive MG (clusters 1 and 2) are enriched in this sample, indicating a reverse direction from right to left. This population is significantly further increased at 6 dpl, when the number of RPCs is less prominent and the differentiating neural types at the top and bottom right are predominantly present in the sample. According to this model, sample collection at even later time points, e.g. 10 or 14 dpl, might show that the initial status has been restored and that non-reactive MG are mostly enriched. However, it is unlikely that this experiment could be performed with our short-term labelling strategy.</p>

<title>The neurogenic trajectory produces regenerated progeny that partially follow the developmental order of neurogenesis</title>
<p>Neurogenic RPCs map to the right of cluster 5, and include proliferating, neurogenic RPCs (cluster 6) and the downstream, non-proliferating, neurogenic RPCs (cluster 7). Cells in these clusters express <italic>insm1a</italic>, <italic>atoh7</italic> and additional neurogenic genes that are required for the generation of several neuronal lineages (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and supplementary files 1 and 6). Indeed, <italic>atoh7</italic> expression has been described to be initiated in RPCs on their way to the last cell division giving rise to a retinal ganglion cell and another cell that can be either an amacrine cell, or a precursor of a horizontal or of a cone cell in the developing zebrafish retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Amini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Nerli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Poggi et al., 2005</xref>). Cluster 6 and 7 appear also highly similar to the transient, neurogenic RPC state that has been described recently in the developing mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). We propose that cluster 6 and 7 are the roots of the neurogenic trajectory from which fate-restricted RPCs and regenerated progeny arise at 4 and 6 dpl (solid, black line in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Cells in cluster 6 are <italic>mki67</italic>-positive, but additionally express <italic>insm1a</italic>, which promotes RPC cell cycle exit at 4 dpl in the injured retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Ramachandran et al., 2012</xref>). Cells in cluster 6 might undergo their last cell division, as suggested by the concomitant expression of <italic>atoh7</italic>. Consistently, in our scRNAseq high counts of <italic>atoh7</italic> are found in cells of cluster 6, to cluster 7 and eventually cluster 10.

<p>While amacrine cells arise directly from the core of neurogenic RPCs, fate restricted precursors for regenerated cones and for horizontal cells are identified (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), as it occurs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Godinho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Weber et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently with the events during development, red cones (cluster 11) branch from <italic>thrb</italic>-positive cells of the photoreceptor RPC cluster (cluster 8). Interestingly, <italic>thrb</italic> transcripts are found in neurogenic RPCs of cluster 7 as well as at the beginning of cluster 9, which contains horizontal cell precursors becoming evident at 4 dpl (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>). This is in agreement with observations in the developing zebrafish retina, where horizontal and cone cells share a common Thrb-positive progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Suzuki et al., 2013</xref>). Mature markers of horizontal cells, like calbindins, are not found in cluster 9 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2C</xref> and supplementary file 1), in contrast to cone photoreceptor mature markers, like opsins, at 4 and 6 dpl. While it might be that mature horizontal cells arise later than 6 dpl, their absence from our dataset could also be due to our experimental set-up. As explained before, we isolated mCherry-only positive and EGFP/mCherry-double positive cells to obtain MG and MG-derived cells. Whereas mCherry, driven by a <italic>gfap</italic> promoter fragment, is actively transcribed in MG, the label of MG-derived cells is completely dependent on the half-life of the fluorophore. Protein turnover and further cell divisions would result in a constant depletion of mCherry in MG-derived cells over time. In this context, we find a strong expression of <italic>pcna</italic> in cluster 9, indicating that additional cell divisions might have diluted the mCherry label to undetectable levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Inclusion of EGFP-positive only cells in our sample collection may reveal the pool of mature horizontal cells, which inherit the fluorophore from their <italic>pcna:EGFP</italic>-positive precursors. Accordingly, we find the presence of horizontal cell precursor markers in our dataset. For instance, cells in cluster 9 express <italic>onecut1</italic> and <italic>onecut2</italic>, which encode transcription factors and are upregulated in horizontal cell RPCs in the developing mouse retina, and which regulate horizontal cell maintenance in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Klimova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sapkota et al., 2014</xref>). Counts for <italic>onecut1</italic> and <italic>onecut2</italic> are found also in earlier neurogenic RPCs of clusters 6 and 7, where they most likely contribute to the transient state of RPCs together with additional neurogenic markers, like <italic>atoh7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). This is again consistent with observations in the developing mouse retina, where Onecut1 and Onecut2 regulate the development of retinal ganglion cells, as well as the development of cones, horizontal cells, and of a subset of amacrine cells, while inhibiting rod specification genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Emerson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Sapkota et al., 2014</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition to mature horizontal cells, we were also unable to detect any rod-specific cluster expressing mature rod markers like <italic>rho</italic> and <italic>gnat1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_2">Figure 8-figure supplement 2A</xref>). We assume that mature rods might arise as a third branch from the photoreceptor RPC cluster (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>), which indeed expresses rod specification markers like <italic>nr2e3</italic> (supplementary file 1). We speculate that rods either become evident only later than 6 dpl, or that they do not survive the isolation procedure, since rods possess a complex morphology with long outer segments. A third possibility might be that rod photoreceptors are replenished by their dedicated rod precursors faster than the triggering of the MG-dependent injury response. In this context, rod precursors form a pool of cells at the base of the outer nuclear layer and proliferate as early as 16 hours post-light lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Morris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Stenkamp, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Thummel et al., 2008</xref>). Since the already available pool of rod precursors would be <italic>gfap</italic>:mCherry-negative, we might have missed the derived rod progeny, given our sorting strategy. In summary, we show that in the light-lesioned retina, zebrafish MG go through an inflammatory-like state before generating hybrid MG/RPCs that eventually cycle-back to non-reactive MG as well generate neurogenic RPCs. The neurogenic RPCs progressively restrict their competence to produce neurons that include retinal ganglion cells first and bipolar cell last up to 6 dpl. Our study is the first comprehensive description of the molecular network underlying MG self-renewal and RPC differentiation to regenerating neurons which will inform future regenerative therapies to treat retinal dystrophies in humans.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Javed and Cayouette, 2017</xref>).</p>

<title>Dissociation of retinae to a single cell suspension</title>
<p>Uninjured and light-lesioned <italic>Tg(pcna:EGFP);Tg(gfap:nls-mCherry)</italic> fish were exposed to an overdose (0.2%) of MS-222 (Sigma) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brand et al., 2002</xref>) until cessation of the operculum movement. Subsequently, each cornea was poked with a needle, and tweezers were gently pressured on each side of the eye to remove the lens. Then, tweezers were used to carefully isolate the retinae, which were put in a dissociation solution of papain (16 U/ml), dispase (0.2 U/ml) and DNAse (168 U/ml) dissolved in Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS, Worthington Biochemical Corporation). Up to 6 retinae were put in 1.7 ml of dissociation solution. Retinae were digested for 30 minutes at 28°C, and then calcein blue (final concentration: 1µM, Invitrogen) was added for 10 minutes to the digestion solution at 28°C to stain for living cells. At the end of the enzymatic digestion, mechanical trituration was applied using fire-polished glass pipettes of decreasing tip diameter to help tissue dissociation. Single cells were centrifuged (300 g) at 4°C, for 6 minutes. The cell pellet was re-suspended in EBSS supplemented with DNAse (100 U/ml) to eliminate residual, ambient DNA, and albumin ovomucoid inhibitor (1:10 of stock solution, Worthington Biochemical Corporation) to stop papain action. The single cell solution was eventually filtered (20 µm filters) to remove clumps and debris, and put on ice, ready for Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). Each single cell suspension was obtained by pooling 8 retinae (from 4 fish, 2 males and 2 females) of uninjured and light-lesioned <italic>Tg(pcna:EGFP);Tg(gfap:mCherry)</italic> animals. Uninjured WT AB, <italic>Tg(gfap:mCherry)</italic> and <italic>Tg(pcna:EGFP)</italic> fish were used to prepare single cell suspensions of dissected retinae for setting the single fluorophore gates in flow cytometry.

The gating strategy is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_3">Figure 1-supplemental figure 3</xref> for uninjured samples and was the same for all the light-lesioned samples.

<title>(Droplet based) single cell transcriptomics</title>
<p>Single cell transcriptome sequencing was performed based on the 10x Genomics Single cell transcriptome workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, 15.000 FACS-sorted cells were recovered in BSA-coated tubes containing 5 ul PBS with 0.04% BSA. Cell samples were carefully mixed with Reverse Transcription Reagent (Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library Kit v3) and loaded onto a Chromium Single Cell B Chip to reach a recovery of 10.000 cells per sample. The samples were processed further following the guidelines of the 10x Genomics user manual for single cell 3’ RNA-seq v3. In short, the droplets were directly subjected to reverse transcription, the emulsion was broken and cDNA was purified using silane beads (Chromium Single Cell 3’ Gel Bead Kit v2). After amplification of cDNA with 11 cycles, samples were purified with 0.6x volume of SPRI select beads to deplete DNA fragments smaller than 400 base pairs and cDNA quality was monitored using the Agilent FragmentAnalyzer 5200 (NGS Fragment Kit). 10 ul of the resulting cDNA were used to prepare single cell RNA seq libraries - involving fragmentation, dA-Tailing, adapter ligation and 11 cycles of indexing PCR following manufacturer’s guidelines. After quantification, both libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 in 75 base pair paired-end mode, generating 45-109 million fragments per transcriptome library. The raw sequencing data was processed with the ‘count’ command of the Cell Ranger software (v2.1.0) provided by 10X Genomics. To build the reference, the zebrafish genome (GRCz11) as well as gene annotation (Ensembl 90) were downloaded from Ensembl and the annotation was filtered with the ‘mkgtf’ command of Cell Ranger (options: ‘—e attribute=gene_biotype:protein_coding --attribute=gene_biotype:lincRNA –attribute=gene_biotype:antisense’). Genome sequence and filtered annotation were then used as input to the ‘mkref’ command of Cell Ranger to build the appropriate Cell Ranger.</p>

For quality control, we removed cells with less than 2.000 counts, less than 500 detected genes, more than 15% mitochondrial reads or more than 60% of the counts in the top 50 highest expressed genes. The counts were normalised with the size factors computed with calculateSumFactors from scran 1.18.5 (min.mean=0.1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Lun et al., 2016</xref>). The normalised counts were log-transformed using the numpy function log1p.

A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the highly variable genes (function scanpy.pp.pca using svd_solver=’arpack’). A k-nearest-neighbour (knn) graph was computed using scanpy.pp.neighbors and a UMAP was computed using scanpy.tl.umap. Clustering was performed with scnapy.tl.leiden (resolution= 0.01). For the three resulting clusters, marker genes were computed using scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups. Two smaller clusters identified as microglia and low-quality cells were removed from the downstream analysis. Detection of highly variable genes PCA were performed as above on the remaining cells. A new knn graph was computed (this time with n_neighbors= 50) and a new UMAP was computed. Embedding densities were computed using scanpy.tl.embedding_density. Clustering was performed in multiple steps, always using scanpy.tl.leiden: First, the data were clustered with the resolution parameter set to 0.45. Next, cluster 10 was subclustered with resolution 0.1 and cluster 0 was subclustered with resolution 0.2. Marker genes of the resulting 15 clusters were computed with scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups. Differential expression analysis of pairs of clusters was performed by subsetting the data to cells from those two clusters and computing differentially expressed genes with scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups.

<title>Cluster annotation</title>
<p>Cluster annotation was performed in several steps. Initially, we identified clusters by considering the top 100 upregulated genes per cluster, the time point at which they appeared and their cell cycle profile. Genes were manually annotated by consulting the ZFIN database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/">http://zfin.org/</ext-link>) and Pubmed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) indexed literature about retina development and regeneration. In particular, we took as a reference the single cell RNA sequencing dataset of the regenerating zebrafish retina from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>, for marker genes lists. Following the initial identification of cell clusters, we proceeded with a finer characterization by considering differential gene expression analysis for clusters that shared a similar identity. Occasionally (e.g., in the case of horizontal cell precursor marker <italic>ptf1a</italic>), we plotted the UMAP profile of known candidates from retina development or regeneration. Selected marker genes were then checked for expression in the retina tissue via <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization and immunohistochemistry on cryosections.</p>

The extended depth of focus function (contrast method) was applied to raw, bright field images of <italic>her4.1</italic>, <italic>hmgb2b</italic>, <italic>atoh7</italic> and <italic>onecut1 in situ</italic> hybridizations to project the chromogenic signal of the optical stack to a single plane. Fluorescent microscope images were processed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) for image contrast adjustments, crop and rotation. Adobe Illustrator CC 2015.3 was used to assemble figures. Excel 2016 (Microsoft) was used to generate the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8_1">Figure 8- figure supplement 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>Marker genes were ranked by their test statistic computed with a t-test for each gene, comparing cells within the cluster to the cells outside the cluster, as implemented in the scanpy function tl.rank_genes_groups. The same was done to identify differentially expressed genes between pairs of clusters.</p>

<title>Ethical statement</title>
<p>Fish were kept according to FELASA guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Aleström et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Brand et al., 2002</xref>). All animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines and under supervision of the Regierungspräsidium Dresden (permit: TVV 44/2017). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and the number of animals used.</p>

Plot 1 displays all the events in a single cell suspension according to the forward (x axis) and side scatter (y axis) areas. Among cells gated in 1, singlets (P2) were chosen by considering the area (x axis) and the height (y axis) of the forward scatter in 2. Height (x axis) and width (y axis) of the side scatter were plotted in 3 to further gate singlets among P2. Finally, only calcein-positive (i.e. living) cells were gated among singlets in 4. The gating strategy was the same for the uninjured as well as all lesioned samples. Samples consisted of single cell suspensions derived from 8 retinae of 4 fish (2 males and 2 females) each. <bold>(8)</bold> Flow cytometry plots showing EGFP and mCherry fluorescence of cells from WT, <italic>Tg(gfap:mCherry)</italic> and <italic>Tg(pcna:EGFP)</italic> dissociated retinae.</p></caption>

<p>Muller glia function as retinal stem cells in the adult zebrafish retina. Following retinal injury, Muller glia are reprogramned (reactive Muller glia), and then divide to produce a progenitor that amplifies and differentiates into retinal neurons. Previous scRNAseq analysis used total retinal RNA from uninjured and injured retinas isolated at time points when Muller glia are quiescent, being reprogrammed, and proliferating to reveal genes and gene regulatory networks underlying these events (Hoang et al., 2020). The manuscript by Celotto et al., used double transgenic zebrafish that allow them to purify by FACS quiescent and reactive Muller glia, Muller glia-derived progenitors, and their differentiating progeny at different times post retinal damage. RNA from these cell populations was used in scRNAseq studies to identify the transcriptomes associated with these cell populations. Importantly, they report two quiescent and two reactive Muller glia populations. These results raise the interesting possibility that Muller glia are a heterogenous population whose members may exhibit different regenerative responses to retinal injury. However, without further experimentation, the validity and significance of this result remain unclear. In addition to putative Muller cell heterogeneity, Celotto et al., identified multiple progenitor classes, some of which are specified to regenerate specific retinal neuron types. Because of its focus on Muller glia and Muller glia-derived progenitors at mid to late stages of retina regeneration, this new scRNAseq data will be a useful resource to the research community for further interrogation of gene expression changes underlying retina regeneration.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>1. The identification of multiple populations of Muller glia, reactive Muller glia, and progenitors is interesting, but beyond a few in situ hybridization studies to validate injury-dependent gene inductions, there are no experiments that confirm that multiple cell populations exist in vivo, and no experiments examining the significance of these different populations in the regenerative process. It would be helpful to discuss how the peripheral to the central gradient of Muller cell maturation influences the scRNAseq-based cell clustering results.</p>
<p>2. While the reliance on transient GFP and mCherry expression may be sufficient, the final population used for the scRNAseq analysis is only partial in nature. Permanently marking the MG through a Cre-Lox system is more ideal. The authors mention the possibility of missing highly proliferative populations of MG/RPC through the dilution of fluorescent proteins; a transgenic system that allows for true lineage tracing may then capture more appropriate MG/RPC populations. The lack of gating for a pure GFP population also confounds this problem which the authors do mention in the discussions; this oversight was not explained.</p>
<p>3. Much time was taken to identify each cell cluster and to list the differentially expressed genes, but no functional significance for these genes was probed. While a lot of work has gone into the analysis shown, altering some of the MG/RPC trajectories through differentially expressed genes would go a long way to making this study more impactful.</p>
<p>4. The data presented in this paper has significant overlap with scRNAseq data presented by Hoang et al., 2020 in Science where Muller glia, reactive Muller glia, and Muller glia-derived progenitors were carefully analyzed. How does their data fit with the data presented here? The authors could have used that paper as a jumping-off point and offered more time points for comparison, especially as progenitors differentiate.</p>
<p>5. A major conclusion of the paper is that neurogenic progenitors in the injured retina differentiate into neurons with a similar order as that taking place during development. This analysis is based on two time points, and while the trends stay true to the authors' model, two time points are too few to make such a conclusion. In addition, because of the time points chosen for this analysis, many mature neuronal markers are lacking. Including additional time points so mature neuronal markers are detected in the dataset would enhance the trajectory proposed.</p>

<p>In this publication, the authors provide a comprehensive trajectory of transcriptional changes in Müller glia cells (MG) in the regenerating retina of zebrafish. These resident glia cells of the retina can differentiate into all neural cell classes following injury, providing full regenerative capabilities of the zebrafish retina. The authors achieved this by using single-cell RNA sequencing of Müller glia, progenitors, and regenerated progeny, comparing uninjured and light-lesioned retinae.</p>
<p>The isolation strategy involves using two transgenic strains, one labelling dividing cells and their immediate progeny, and the other Müller glia cells. This allowed them to separate injury-induced proliferating and non-reactive Müller glia cells. Subsequent single-cell transcriptomics showed that MG could be non-reactive under both uninjured and lesioned conditions and reactive MG give rise to a cell population that both replenishes the pool of MG and replenish neurogenic retinal precursor cells. These precursor cells produce regenerated neurons in a developmental time series with ganglion cells being born first and bipolar cells being born last. Interestingly hybrid populations have been detected that co-share characteristics of photoreceptor precursors and reactive glia.</p>
<p>This is the first study of its kind following the dynamic changes of transcriptional changes during retinal regeneration, providing a rich data source of genes involved in regeneration. Their finding of transcriptionally separable MG populations is intriguing.</p>
<p>This study focuses on the light-lesioned retina and leaves open the question if the observed transcriptional trajectories of regenerating neurons are generalizable to other lesion models (e.g. chemical or mutational lesions) or are specific to the light-damaged retina.</p>
