<title>Abstract</title><p>The gain-of-function mutation in the TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> channel (p.L114P) is associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell electrical activity and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. The <italic>KCNK16</italic> gene encoding TALK-1 is the most abundant and β-cell–restricted K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript. To investigate the impact of <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY, a mouse model containing the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation was generated. Heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice exhibit increased neonatal lethality in the C57BL/6J and the CD-1(ICR) genetic background, respectively. Lethality is likely a result of severe hyperglycemia observed in the homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P neonates due to lack of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and can be reduced with insulin treatment. <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P increased whole-cell β-cell K<sup>+</sup> currents resulting in blunted glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and loss of glucose-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Thus, adult <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice have reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and plasma insulin levels, which significantly impairs glucose homeostasis. Taken together, this study shows that the MODY-associated <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation disrupts glucose homeostasis in adult mice resembling a MODY phenotype and causes neonatal lethality by inhibiting islet insulin secretion during development. These data suggest that TALK-1 is an islet-restricted target for the treatment for diabetes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY) is a collection of monogenic forms of early-onset familial diabetes resulting from β-cell dysfunction. To date, mutations in 15 genes involved in β-cell development and function have been associated with MODY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Monogenic diabetes cases account for approximately 1%-5% of the total diabetic patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). However, as the phenotype of MODY overlaps with other forms of diabetes, many patients are misdiagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). Data from monogenic diabetes registries also suggests that in the US, ∼70% of the registered cases still do not have a known genetic cause, and similarly many patients in the UK (∼50%) with monogenic diabetes have MODY-causing mutations that remain to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). Additionally, some MODY-associated mutations are only reported in single families, and thus require genetic and mechanistic confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). We recently identified a mutation in <italic>KCNK16</italic>, the gene encoding TALK-1 channels (p. <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P), which co-segregates with MODY in a four-generation family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). As <italic>KCNK16</italic> is the most islet-restricted and abundant ꞵ-cell K<sup>+</sup> channel transcript, the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation is likely to perturb β-cell function and cause MODY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). This was further strengthened by a recent report of a Japanese family with the identical <italic>KCNK16</italic> mutation (p. <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P) segregating with MODY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Thus, it is important to determine the mechanistic underpinnings of how this specific mutation in TALK-1 impacts islet function and results in glucose dyshomeostasis.</p>
<p>TALK-1 is a key regulator of β-cell membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>), glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). A non-synonymous gain-of-function polymorphism in <italic>KCNK16</italic> (rs1535500; p. <italic>Kcnk16</italic> A277E) is also associated with an increased risk for type-2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Moreover, we recently determined that the MODY-associated <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation results in a significant gain-of-function in TALK-1 K<sup>+</sup> flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). Thus, there is strong genetic evidence that alterations in TALK-1 function (e.g., <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> A277E) result in diabetic phenotypes. Interestingly, when heterologously expressed in β-cells, TALK-1 L114P inhibited glucose-stimulated membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in most β-cells. Although TALK-1 L114P-mediated changes inhibition of electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx would be predicted to fully inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, they only resulted in partial blunting of β-cell insulin secretion. However, this is consistent with <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P MODY patients that required low-dose insulin therapy which also suggested that this mutation does not fully suppress glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This differs from previous studies showing that inhibition of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with either K<sup>+</sup> channel pharmacological activation or gain-of-function mutations (e.g., K<sub>ATP</sub> R201H) results in complete inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Therefore, it is critical to determine if endogenous TALK-1 L114P expression also shows complete inhibition of β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and how this impacts glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Another potential mechanism for the modest impact of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P on insulin secretion could be due to its function in other islet cells. For example, TALK-1 is also expressed in δ-cells where its activity limits somatostatin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Because somatostatin exerts inhibitory tone on islet β– and α-cells, TALK-1 L114P mediated reductions in δ-cell somatostatin secretion would be predicted to increase both glucagon and insulin secretion. Due to the β-cell intrinsic role of TALK-1 L114P channels, the effect of somatostatin on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion might be limited; however, it remains to be determined if the fasting hyperglycemia observed in <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY patients is due in part to elevated glucagon secretion.</p>
<p>The nature and severity of MODY phenotypes is dictated by how specific gene mutations affect β-cell function. K<sub>ATP</sub> is the only ion channel besides TALK-1 to be linked to MODY; this is due to mutations in genes encoding the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel complex (<italic>KCNJ11</italic> and <italic>ABCC8</italic>) or mutations in genes affecting ATP synthesis (e.g., glucokinase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). Interestingly, MODY-associated mutations in <italic>KCNJ11</italic> and <italic>ABCC8</italic> have also been found to cause other diabetic phenotypes including permanent or transient neonatal diabetes, and late-onset diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>). Although the two families with <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P exhibit a MODY phenotype, it remains to be determined if <italic>KCNK16</italic> mutations are associated with other diabetic phenotypes besides MODY. Indeed, it was originally predicted that mutations that cause a substantial gain-of-function in TALK-1 channel activity (e.g., <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P) would act similarly to the gain-of-function mutations in K<sub>ATP</sub> subunits that cause neonatal diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>). However, the biophysical activity of TALK-1 channels differ in many ways from K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, and this could contribute to more modest MODY phenotype observed in patients with <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P. For example, depolarization-dependent activation (outward rectification) of TALK-1 currents may limit the activity of TALK-1 L114P channels at resting <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>). K<sub>ATP</sub> channels also show larger unitary conductance than TALK-1, not much voltage dependence, and are nucleotide gated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). The unique biophysical properties of K<sub>ATP</sub> and TALK-1 channels predict mechanistic differences in their corresponding gain-of-function phenotypes. However, it remains to be elucidated how endogenous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P disrupts islet electrical activity and glucose homeostasis.</p>
<p>Here we developed a mouse model harboring the MODY-associated <italic>Kcnk16</italic> variant p. <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P to investigate the impact of this mutation on glucose homeostasis and confirm its association with MODY. Interestingly, we observe increased neonatal lethality in heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice in the C57BL/6J (B6) and the B6;CD-1(ICR) mixed genetic backgrounds, respectively, likely due to severe hyperglycemia and lack of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Whereas in adult mice, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P blunts glucose-stimulated β-cell electrical activity, Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thus significantly impairing glucose tolerance. These data strongly suggest that alterations in TALK-1 activity can disrupt islet hormone secretion and glucose homeostasis. Importantly, this study further confirms that the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation results in a MODY phenotype, but additionally predicts that gain-of-function TALK-1 mutations cause transient neonatal diabetes.</p>

<title><italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P neonates exhibit loss of glucose stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and insulin secretion leading to transient neonatal hyperglycemia and death</title>
<p>To confirm the association of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P in causing MODY, a mouse model harboring the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> mutation was developed in the C57BL/6J background using CRISPR/spCas9 (B6 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and supplemental figures 1A and 1B). Surprisingly, heterozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibited neonatal lethality as indicated by extremely low number of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice at weaning (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). To increase the likelihood of survival of neonates, B6 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice were crossed with outbred CD-1(ICR) mice resulting in a progeny in the mixed (50:50) background (B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, in the mixed background, neonatal lethality was observed in the homozygous B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (P/P) mice on ∼post-natal day 4 (P4), but not in the heterozygous B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (Supplemental figure 1C). Lethality was likely independent of growth defects as body weight did not differ between genotypes (Supplemental figure 1D). To test if lethality occurs from gain-of-function TALK-1 L114P mediated defect in neonatal islet function, we assessed glycemic control and insulin secretion on P4. Heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P neonates showed severe hyperglycemia and a concurrent reduction in plasma insulin levels in a gene-dosage dependent manner compared to the control littermates (WT) on P4 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>, and supplemental figures 1E, 2A, and 2B). Hyperglycemia in neonatal <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice subsided by P10, when glycemia was equivalent to WT controls (Supplemental figure 2). Additionally, the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in P4 islets from heterozygous neonates and decreased it further in P4 islets from homozygous neonates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). These changes in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis are likely due to TALK-1 L114P channel mediated alteration in islet function and not islet mass as pancreas weight was unchanged (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and supplemental figure 1F). Furthermore, neonatal islet composition was unaltered except for a modest increase in the α-cell (glucagon+) area/islet in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P(L/P) pancreas (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1H-J</xref>). The loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can be explained by a complete lack of glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P and P/P) neonates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1K-N</xref>). However, these islets exhibited KCl-mediated β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry; this indicates that TALK-1 L114P channels hyperpolarize β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, thereby overriding the effect of K<sub>ATP</sub> closure due to glucose metabolism and lead to insufficient glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Importantly, insulin treatment (Glargine Lantus; 0.2U/Kg/day, once-daily subcutaneous injection) was able to extend the lifespan of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (P/P) neonates suggesting lethality results from hyperglycemia due to inadequate insulin secretion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1O</xref>).</p>

<title>Adult <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice exhibit fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance</title>
<p>Because neonatal <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice showed transient hyperglycemia (Supplemental figure 2), we next utilized an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test to determine if <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P impairs glucose homeostasis in young adulthood. Male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice developed glucose intolerance as early as 11-weeks of age in the B6;CD-1 background and 8-weeks of age in the B6 background compared to their respective control littermates (data not shown). Similarly, male B6;CD-1 <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice developed impaired oral glucose tolerance by 7-weeks of age (Supplemental figure 3). This defect in glucose homeostasis is maintained with age in the male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A-C</xref> and supplemental figures 3A-C, and 4A-C). Furthermore, male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice also exhibit fasting hyperglycemia indicating a likely non-β-cell-specific islet defect in this mouse model (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). There were no body weight differences in males (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice only developed moderate glucose intolerance compared to the controls (WT) in both B6 and B6;CD-1 genetic backgrounds (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E-G</xref>; supplemental figures 3D-F and 4E-F). Moreover, the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation resulted in greater body weight gain in B6;CD-1 females compared to the WT controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>) due to increased lean mass, which might reduce glucose intolerance in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) females compared to males (Supplemental figures 5A-F). The T2D-associated SNP in <italic>KCNK16</italic> (rs1535500) which causes gain-of-function in TALK-1 activity, has shown a significant association with increased total cholesterol in a Han Chinese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>). However, an increase in TALK-1 activity due to the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation did not affect plasma– and liver-triglyceride and cholesterol levels in mice (Supplemental figures 5G-J).</p>

<title>Adult <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice show disrupted islet hormone secretion and islet composition</title>
<p>We then tested if the TALK-1-L114P-mediated impairment in glucose homeostasis arises from defective islet function. Both male and female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibited reduced plasma insulin levels compared to controls at 15 min and 30 min following an intraperitoneal glucose injection after a 4-hour fast (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Insulin sensitivity was not altered in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice indicating that the reduction in glucose tolerance is primarily due to an islet secretion defect (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). This was confirmed by in vitro glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and glucose-inhibition of glucagon secretion (GIGS) measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). Islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibited reduced ability to secrete insulin in response to glucose and showed elevated glucagon secretion under low glucose (2 mM) and euglycemic (7 mM) conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>). This indicates that the fasting hyperglycemia observed in male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) is likely a result of the observed increase in glucagon secretion under fasting conditions. We next investigated if impaired islet hormone secretion results from changes in islet composition. Immunostaining analyses revealed an increase in glucagon-positive area/ islet and a concurrent modest reduction in insulin-positive area/ islet in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) pancreata (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3F-J</xref>). Together, these results indicate that <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation leads to disruptions in both islet composition and secretion giving rise to a MODY-like phenotype in adult mice.</p>

<title><italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P blunts β-cell glucose-stimulated electrical excitability and increases whole-cell two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> channel currents</title>
<p>We used patch-clamp electrophysiology to test if the reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion results from decreased β-cell electrical excitability due to a gain-of-function in TALK-1 activity in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mouse islets. Perforated patch-clamp recordings revealed blunting of β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and loss of action potential firing in islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>). Because the whole islet recordings assume β-cell electrical responses in response to glucose, perforated patch-clamp recordings were also run on islet cell clusters expressing a fluorescent reporter specifically in β-cells. Similar to the whole islet recordings, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P β-cells showed blunted glucose-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization, which did not reach a depolarized threshold to fire action potentials in 67% of β-cells (Supplemental figure 6). However, as 33% of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P β-cells showed glucose-stimulated action potential firing (Supplemental figure 6), this indicates that these cells may also undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Reduced glucose-stimulated islet <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and action potential firing in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P β-cells was in part a result of increased whole-cell two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> channel currents at depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> and thus reducing K<sup>+</sup> channel activity with high KCl depolarized these cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>; Supplemental figure 6 and 7). However, TALK-1 L114P (L/P and P/P) channels did not show a substantial increase at hyperpolarized β-cell membrane potentials under low and high glucose where these K<sup>+</sup> currents are typically active (Supplemental figure 7). Notably, the heterologously expressed human TALK-1 L114P channels exhibited a drastic gain-of-function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>); this suggests the likelihood of unknown endogenous regulator(s) of TALK-1 in β-cells. It is also likely that recording conditions lead to poor isolation of the endogenous TALK-1 L114P currents. Thus, two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> channel currents were assessed by overexpressing mouse TALK-1 L114P channels in HEK293T cells under identical recording conditions as the human TALK-1 L114P study. Indeed, overexpression of the mouse mutant channel results in large K<sup>+</sup> currents indicative of a similar gain-of-function in mouse TALK-1 current as the human TALK-1 current due to the L114P mutation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4F</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P reduces glucose– and tolbutamide-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and augments IP<sub>3</sub>-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release</title>
<p>β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry was monitored in response to increasing concentrations of glucose in islets from WT and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice to assess if TALK-1 L114P-mediated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization reduces glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx. TALK-1 L114P blunted islet glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx in mice on both B6 and B6;CD-1 genetic backgrounds compared to WT controls (Figures 7A-F and supplemental figure 8). However, islets from male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice showed a larger reduction in normalized Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak and normalized area under the curve responses compared to their controls than islets from female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice compared to their controls (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5A-F</xref>). TALK-1 L114P channels did not affect the basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels at 2 mM G; however, the activity of these channels resulted in increased initial glucose-stimulated drop in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> (termed phase 0 response) compared to controls (Supplemental figure 8). This suggests a reduction in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) storage in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets. Furthermore, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets also showed a complete lack of glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> oscillations monitored at 9 mM G (Supplemental figures 9C and 9D). We then assessed if the reduction in glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx results from TALK-1 L114P overactivity on the β-cell plasma membrane by monitoring tolbutamide-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> entry. TALK-1 L114P-mediated β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization overrides the <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization caused by K<sub>ATP</sub> closure by tolbutamide. Thus, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets do not exhibit [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> entry in response to tolbutamide. Interestingly, islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice showed equivalent KCl-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> entry compared to control islets; this suggests that the loss of glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets occurs due to enhanced K<sup>+</sup> ion flux through gain-of-function in TALK-1 activity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5H</xref>). Our previous studies showed that TALK-1 channels are functional on the ER membrane where they provide a K<sup>+</sup> countercurrent for Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). Thus, we tested if TALK-1 L114P regulates [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> homeostasis by stimulating G<sub>q</sub>-signaling using acetylcholine, which results in IP<sub>3</sub> generation and IP<sub>3</sub>-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release. Indeed, IP<sub>3</sub>-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release was enhanced in islets from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice compared to controls suggesting gain-of-function TALK-1 channels are localized to the ER membrane where they facilitate increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER lumen (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figures 5I</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5J</xref>).</p>

<p>Despite the loss of glucose-stimulated islet electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice do not exhibit a drastic reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and overt diabetes. Therefore, compensatory mechanisms such as the amplification pathway for insulin secretion might be altered in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>). Moreover, prolonged hyperglycemia (although modest in this model), would also be predicted to result in long-term gene expression changes in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets that alter β-cell function. Thus, gene expression differences between WT and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mouse islets were quantified with bulk-RNA sequencing and validated with qRT-PCR (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figures 6</xref> A-D). We observed increased expression of many genes which regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent potentiation of insulin secretion such as <italic>Adcy5</italic>, <italic>Creb5, Adcyap1, and Adcyap1r1</italic>; genes that may promote Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent secretion from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). For example, <italic>Adcy5</italic> has been shown to amplify glucose-stimulated cAMP production, which enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. As cAMP is also a critical signal for β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>), the impact of cAMP on <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islet Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling was examined. Elevation of cAMP through activation of the GLP-1 receptor (with 200 nM liraglutide) only increased glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> oscillation frequency in WT islets and did not impact the loss of glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> entry in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islet (Supplemental figure 10).

<p>Other pathways could also be impacted in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets that may modify Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling or respond to the altered signaling such as in response to reduced glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx, fasting hyperglycemia, and/or impaired glucose tolerance. For example, broad changes in ion channel activity genes (e.g., <italic>Cacna1g, Cacng8, Scn5a, Pkd1l1, Kcnk2, Gabrg1</italic>, and <italic>Fxyd3</italic>) may contribute to altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets. Reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets results in decreased expression of genes previously shown to be elevated in chronically depolarized <italic>Abcc8</italic><sup>−/−</sup> β-cells such as <italic>Serpina7</italic>, <italic>Asb11</italic>, <italic>Sall1</italic>, and <italic>Aldh1a3</italic> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>).

Furthermore, several stress-associated, fibrosis-related, and inflammatory signaling pathway genes are upregulated in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets likely due to prolonged hyperglycemic conditions. These include dedifferentiation markers <italic>Sox4, Sox6, Sox9, Hk2, Vim,</italic> and <italic>Cd36</italic>, extracellular matrix-interaction pathway genes <italic>Col1a1</italic>, <italic>Col1a2</italic>, <italic>Col3a1</italic>, <italic>Col14a1</italic>, <italic>Col6a1</italic>, <italic>and Dcn</italic>, and inflammatory signaling genes <italic>Cxcl1</italic>, <italic>Ccl2</italic>, <italic>Ccl11</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic>, <italic>Tgfb2, Il33</italic>, <italic>and Il6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Gain-of-function in TALK-1 activity is associated with diabetic phenotypes, suggesting a causal role for overactive TALK-1 in islet dysfunction and diabetes progression. Utilizing a gain-of-function model of TALK-1 (L114P), this study uncovered that disrupted β-cell and α-cell function resulted in glucose intolerance in adolescent mice confirming the association of the TALK-1 L114P mutation with MODY-like diabetes. Importantly, our data also revealed that <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation can cause transient neonatal diabetes. This finding suggests that transient neonatal diabetic patients with unknown genetic diagnosis should be screened for mutations in <italic>KCNK16.</italic> Moreover, our data provides further genetic evidence that TALK-1 is a potentially novel therapeutic target for diabetes treatment. Specifically, in mice heterozygous for <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation we observe neonatal hyperglycemia due to blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, which can additionally result in neonatal death in mice homozygous for the mutant (L114P) allele of <italic>Kcnk16</italic>. In young-adulthood, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P causes glucose intolerance due to a reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion mediated by enhanced β-cell <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization and reduced glucose-stimulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. In addition to the β-cell intrinsic defect, the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation led to an increase in α-cell area fraction in islets and elevation of glucagon secretion under fasting conditions. Together these data highlight the crucial role of TALK-1 in β-cell function and glucose homeostasis and raises the possibility of TALK-1 inhibition as a druggable target for not only <italic>KCNK16</italic>-associated MODY but possibly for other forms of diabetes.</p>
<p>β-cell maturation and glucose-responsiveness of neonatal islets rapidly develops after birth and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is required for efficient glucose uptake, which contributes to normal growth. Following birth, a shift to intermittent feeding and elevated plasma glucose requires an increase in β-cell insulin secretion for efficient nutrient absorption, as well as a suppression of insulin release during fasting to avoid hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>). Glucose-sensitivity in mouse β-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling and insulin secretion develops over the first 4 postnatal days due to changes in β-cell metabolism, K<sub>ATP</sub> surface localization, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent secretory machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Thus, mice expressing severe gain-of-function ATP-insensitive K<sub>ATP</sub> channels die shortly after birth due to hypoinsulinemia, severe hyperglycemia, and ketoacidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>). <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice show a similar phenotype, with neonatal islets showing a complete loss of glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx, a drastic reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and severe hyperglycemia by P4. This suggests a greater impact of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P in neonatal islets compared to adult islets. Future studies during β-cell maturation are required to determine if TALK-1 activity is greater on the plasma membrane and/or ER membrane in early neonatal compared with adult β-cells. Interestingly, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P-mediated susceptibility to neonatal lethality was dependent on genetic diversity in mouse strains. Heterozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P caused almost complete neonatal lethality in the B6 background but only hyperglycemia in the B6:CD-1 background, whereas homozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P led to neonatal lethality in the B6:CD-1 mice. The mechanism for the enhanced ability of heterozygous <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P B6:CD-1 mice to survive remains to be determined. However, this has previously been reported for other knockout mouse models (e.g., <italic>Ankfy1</italic> and <italic>Ywhaz</italic>), that are only viable as adults on a mixed genetic background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>). Although the neonatal glycemic data from the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P families does not exist, it may be that neonatal lethality is not observed in affected individuals. However, it is interesting to note that all currently identified individuals carrying the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mutation are females (N=8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). The importance of hypoinsulinemia causing neonatal diabetes and lethality in TALK-1 L114P mice was confirmed by insulin treatment which extended their lifespan. This resembles other monogenic forms of neonatal diabetes that require exogenous insulin treatment for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>). Indeed, it has been well established that insulin signaling is required for neonatal survival; for example, a similar neonatal lethality phenotype was observed in mice without insulin (<italic>Ins1/Ins2</italic> double knockout) where death results within 2 days as well as in mice without insulin receptors (<italic>Insr</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) where death results by P3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Future studies are required to determine if TALK-1 gain-of-function mutations result in human transient neonatal diabetes followed by a MODY phenotype. Other monogenic diabetes mutations such as in genes encoding K<sub>ATP</sub> channels result in transient neonatal diabetes with diabetes reemergence later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>).</p>
<p>In adolescence, the timeline of development of MODY-like diabetes in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) model is consistent with data from MODY patients. Similar to the timeline of disease progression in other MODY mouse models, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice developed glucose intolerance during adolescence (∼8 weeks in the B6 strain). The onset and severity of glucose intolerance in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice also recapitulates the data from <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P MODY family probands, who were diagnosed at 11 and 15 years of age and displayed an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test (blood glucose:19 and 19.6 mM, 2 hours after 75 g oral glucose bolus, respectively). Disease severity is more prominent in the inbred B6 strain compared to the mixed B6:CD-1 strain likely owing to the outbred characteristics and genetic diversity of the CD-1 strain, which recapitulates the diverse nature of MODY manifestation observed in human patients. As the Japanese <italic>KCNK16</italic> MODY family showed a greater insulin requirement compared to the patients from Australian <italic>KCNK16</italic> MODY family, diversity in diabetes phenotypes likely occurs with <italic>KCNK16</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Interestingly, male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice exhibit more severe impairment in glucose homeostasis compared to female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P) mice. A variety of factors could explain the observed sex-differences, including the female hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) which is critical for protection against glucolipotoxicity and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Furthermore, older women have higher insulin levels in relation to relative insulin demand compared to men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>). Glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx in islets from female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice is significantly greater than islets from male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice, which would be predicted to lead to greater insulin secretion and lesser impairment in glucose tolerance in female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice. Sexual dimorphism observed in glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx could be mediated by differences in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling or differences in TALK-1 function. For example, under stress female human T2D islets maintain greater insulin secretion compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Although greater β-cell <italic>Kcnk16</italic> expression could also be responsible for the more significant impairment in glucose intolerance observed in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P male mice, there is only a trend for greater <italic>Kcnk16</italic> expression in sorted male β-cells (average RPKM 6296.25 +/− 953.84) compared to sorted female β-cells (5148.25 +/− 1013.22); this is similar in β-cells from high-fat diet treated mice (average RPKM 8020.75 +/− 1944.41 for males, and average RPKM 7551 +/− 2952.70 for females) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>). Whether sex-differences exist in humans with TALK-1 L114P mutation remains to be determined as all affected individuals in both <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY (p. TALK-1 L114P) families were females. Neonatal lethality was more penetrant in male than female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (P/P) mice, thus, it will also be important to determine if <italic>KCNK16</italic>-MODY patients show neonatal phenotypes and display sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>Similar to the proband from the human <italic>KCNK16</italic> L114P MODY family who showed elevated fasting blood glucose (∼7 mM), <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice also exhibit fasting hyperglycemia. While this was predicted to be due to decreased insulin secretion, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets showed equivalent insulin secretion under euglycemic conditions. However, these islets exhibited a significant elevation in fasting glucagon secretion which likely contributes to the fasting hyperglycemia. If TALK-1 L114P channels were expressed in α-cells, it would result in inhibition of α-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and glucagon secretion which supports previously described lack of TALK-1 protein expression in α-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). This suggests that hyperglucagonemia in TALK-1 L114P islets is likely due to loss of inhibitory paracrine signaling. As insulin secretion does not change under fasting and euglycemic conditions, hyperglucagonemia might primarily be mediated by reduced somatostatin secretion. This is supported by a significant decrease in <italic>Sst</italic> expression in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>), which is likely due to reduced δ-cell secretion. Also, our previous data in global TALK-1 KO mice show higher somatostatin secretion and lower glucagon secretion, thus δ-cell TALK-1 L114P would be predicted to limit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and somatostatin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Intriguingly, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets additionally exhibit increased α-cell area fraction and a concurrent modest reduction in β-cell area fraction compared to control islets. These changes in islet composition in consistent with both T1D and T2D data showing increased α-cell: β-cell ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>), which show elevated islet glucagon secretion. α-cell hyperplasia may result from increased activity/secretion, which is supported by other mediators of α-cell secretion (e.g., amino acids) that cause hyperplasia as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>). However, loss of somatostatin also elevates α-cell secretion without altering α-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>). Moreover, the increased somatostatin and insulin secretion only result in reduced α-cell secretion without altering α-cell number. Thus, the exact mechanism of how TALK-1 L114P mediates increased α-cell number remains to be determined. Taken together, the <italic>KcnK16</italic> L114P mouse model shows disrupted glucagon and insulin secretion leading to fasting hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, which provides confirmation that TALK-1 gain-of-function mutations likely cause MODY.</p>
<p>One obstacle in determining how MODY-associated mutations result in β-cell dysfunction is the limited availability of primary islet tissue from MODY families. Due to this, the initial assessment of MODY-associated human TALK-1 L114P was performed in overexpression systems, which resulted in a drastic gain-of-function. Similarly, overexpression of mouse <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P leads to a substantial gain-of-function in TALK-1 activity (7.96-fold at –30 mV and 6.13-fold at 0 mV compared to TALK-1 WT). However, surprisingly β-cells from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P and P/P) mice showed only a modest gain-of-function in two-pore domain K<sup>+</sup> channel currents. While the slight increase in β-cell K<sup>+</sup> conductance from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice would be predicted to partially alter islet excitability, these islets exhibit a complete loss of glucose-stimulated <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization. This suggests that endogenous TALK-1 L114P polarizes plasma membrane potential, which is further supported by the robust KCl-induced <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry observed in these islets. Because KCl shifts the reversal potential of K<sup>+</sup> channels to a more depolarized <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>, the constant <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> hyperpolarization in TALK-1 L114P β-cells likely results from increased K<sup>+</sup> conductance through these channels. Yet, K<sup>+</sup> conductance in TALK-1 L114P β-cells was not significantly different at the membrane potentials of these cells under either low or high glucose conditions. The recording conditions may lead to poor isolation of the endogenous TALK-1 L114P currents; however, overexpression of this mutant channel results in large K<sup>+</sup> currents under identical recording conditions. The K<sup>+</sup> conductance differences between heterologously versus endogenously expressed TALK-1 L114P channels points towards unidentified regulators of β-cell TALK-1 activity which could include endogenous ligands, protein interactions, and cellular localization of the channel. This is presumably not due to changes in TALK-1 protein levels because <italic>Kcnk16</italic> mRNA expression was not altered in control and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> (c. 337 T&gt;C) islets. The subtle increase in β-cell K<sup>+</sup> conductance correlates with a modest MODY-like phenotype and likely allows for incomplete suppression of β-cell function. This is also observed in K<sub>ATP</sub>-MODY, where channel activity is only modestly increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). Importantly, our study suggests that drastic TALK-1 gain-of-function mutations only lead to modest β-cell K<sup>+</sup> conductance, which may explain why both families with TALK-1 MODY carry the same pore-domain mutation (L114P) in TALK-1. Additionally, it is likely that other less-severe gain-of-function mutations in TALK-1 (e.g., A277E) result in a milder phenotype such as T2D. Another possibility is that because TALK-1 channels are functional not only on the plasma membrane but also the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>), some of the TALK-1 L114P-mediated reduction in glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx could be due to altered [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> handling. Indeed, glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx has previously been shown to be dependent in part on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release and TALK-1 L114P increases β-cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> release in response to muscarinic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>). Thus, future studies are required to determine the contributions of ER membrane localized versus plasma membrane localized TALK-1 L114P to altered glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx. Moreover, it will be important to establish the contributions of endogenous modulators of TALK-1 channels (WT and L114P) and how they contribute to β-cell dysfunction.</p>
<p>Suppression of glucose-stimulated electrical activity and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets would be predicted to cause a greater reduction of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion than that observed. However, a few β-cells from <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice show modest <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> depolarization; this resulted in a slight increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> in response to glucose in a small subset of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets, which could result in some glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Interestingly, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets also show reduced expression of <italic>Fxyd3,</italic> which encodes the auxiliary subunit of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and is a known negative regulator of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in diabetic mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>). Other interesting gene expression differences that may increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets include elevated expression (2.13-fold) of <italic>Adcy5</italic>, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent amplification pathway gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>). In humans, <italic>Adcy5</italic> depletion impairs glucose-dependent elevation of cAMP and associated insulin secretion, thus elevation in <italic>Adcy5</italic> expression would be predicted to increase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via cAMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). Expression levels of other cAMP-dependent pathway genes were also elevated in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets including <italic>Creb5, Adcyap1,</italic> and <italic>Adcyap1r1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Slit1</italic> and <italic>Srgap3</italic>, part of the SLIT-ROBO signaling which enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, were upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). SLIT-ROBO signaling regulates not only Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling but also actin remodeling and thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent signaling pathways. These gene expression changes suggest an increase in glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx-independent mechanism(s) of insulin secretion may compensate for TALK-1 L114P-mediated loss of β-cell electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p>
<p>Chronic hyperglycemia in diabetic patients and rodents results in islet dysfunction and destruction, thus hyperglycemia observed in the <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice could exacerbate β-cell failure. Glucotoxicity results in numerous islet transcriptome changes that in-part contribute to dysfunction. Similar to islets from diabetic patients, <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets exhibit an increase in <italic>Aldob</italic> (17.45-fold) and <italic>Nnat</italic> (1.95-fold) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Pdk4</italic> expression, a marker for the shift from utilization of glucose to fatty acids as the primary fuel source, is higher in <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islets (2.78-fold). Elevated islet PDK4 expression is also observed in patients with T2D and in animals on a HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Although hyperglycemia would be predicted to negatively impact <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P islet function, no overt changes in β-cell mass were observed in these mice. This differs from mice with islets expressing K<sub>ATP</sub> gain-of-function mutation, which show loss of β-cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>). <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P may not cause a significant β-cell destruction because these mice show sufficient glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to prevent overt diabetes.</p>
<p>In summary, we showed that the MODY-associated TALK-1 L114P mutation elevates α-cell glucagon secretion under fasting and euglycemic conditions and blunts glucose-stimulated β-cell electrical activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry leading to reduced insulin secretion. Together, elevated glucagon impairs fasting glycemia and reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion increases post-prandial glucose levels in adults. This phenotype was more prominent in the male <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice compared to the female <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mice raising the question whether sex-differences translate in humans carrying this mutation. Surprisingly, the TALK-1 L114P mutation also resulted in severe transient neonatal diabetes which was lethal in the C57Bl/6J genetic background. Thus, these data hold potential clinical utility in that neonatal diabetes patients with unknown genetic linkage should be screened for mutations in <italic>KCNK16</italic>. Together, these data strengthen the rationale for designing TALK-1 inhibitors for use as a therapeutic modality to treat diabetes.</p>
<p>Limitations of the study: 1. This study does not establish how TALK-1 channels on the ER membrane influence glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx. Future investigations are required to determine how <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P modulation of β-cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> contributes to blunted glucose-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> influx and insulin secretion. 2. The <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P mouse model created for this study replicates the MODY mutation in humans, however, due to TALK-1 expression in cells other than β-cells (e.g., δ-cells) it is difficult to determine the exact cellular contributions of <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P to the MODY phenotype. 3. This study does not establish why TALK-1 L114P channel currents either from kcnk16 L11P (L/P) or (P/P) primary β-cells show such low conductance compared to heterologously expressed TALK-1 L114P channels.</p>

<title>Bulk-RNA sequencing</title>
<p>RNA was isolated from islets from ∼15-week-old male mice (WT and <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P (L/P)) using Maxwell® 16 LEV simplyRNA Purification Kits (Catalog no. AS1280, Promega, USA). RNA integrity was analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only those samples with an RNA integrity number of seven or above were used. An Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument was used to produce paired-end, 150-nucleotide reads for each RNA sample. Paired-end RNA sequencing reads (150bp long) were trimmed and filtered for quality using Trimgalore v0.6.7(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>). Trimmed reads were aligned and counted using Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>) v2.7.9a with the – quantMode GeneCounts parameter against the mm10 mouse genome and GENCODE comprehensive gene annotations (Release M23). Per sample, the number of mapped reads ranged from 52-462 million. DESeq2 package v1.34.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>) was used to perform normalization and downstream differential expression. Features counted fewer than 5 times across at least 3 samples were removed. Freezing condition of the samples and sequencing batch was included as batch factor in DESeq2 design to increase the sensitivity for finding differences between <italic>Kcnk16</italic> L114P v/s WT samples and confirmed with principle component analysis (Supplemental figure 11B). Gene enrichment analysis implemented from Gene Ontology was applied using the clusterProfiler v4.2.2 package in R. Annotated gene sets GO was sourced from Genome wide annotation for Mouse (Carlson M (2019). org.Mm.eg.db: Genome wide annotation for Mouse. R package version 3.8.2.). For GO, genes significantly up– or downregulated in different conditions were used as input. False discovery rate-adjusted P value &lt; 0.05 and log2 fold change &gt;1 was used to define differentially expressed genes.</p>

<p>This study characterizes how a point mutation in the TALK-1 potassium channel, encoded by the KCNK16 gene, causes MODY diabetes. The mutation, L114P, causes a gain-of-function to increase K+ currents and inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Increased glucagon likely results from paracrine effects in the islets. The data are <bold>convincing</bold> and the work will be <bold>valuable</bold> for understanding islet function.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the effects of a L114P mutation in the TALK-1 channel on islet function and diabetes. This mutation is clinically relevant and a cause of MODY diabetes. This work employs a mouse model with heterozygous and homozygous mutants. The homozygous mice are homozygous lethal from severe hyperglycemia. The work shows that the mutation increases K+ currents and inhibits insulin secretion. This is a very nice paper with mechanistic insight and clear clinical importance. It is generally well written and the data is well presented.</p>
<p>Comments on revision:</p>
<p>I have no further comments to add at this time. The authors have adequately addressed my concerns.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work follows previous work from the group where they have demonstrated the role of TASK1 in the regulation of glucose stimulated insulin secretion. Moreover, a recent study links a mutation in KCNK16, the gene encoding TALK-1 channels to MODY. Here the authors have constructed a mouse model with the specific mutation (TALK-1 L114P mutation) and investigated the phenotype. They have to perform a couple of breeding tricks to find a model that is lethal in adult which might complicate the conclusions, however, the phenotype of the heterozygote model used have a MODY-like phenotype. The study is convincing and solid.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) The work is a natural follow-up from previous studies from the groups.</p>
<p>
(2) The authors present convincing and solid data that in the long perspective will help patients with this mutations.</p>
<p>
(3) Both in vivo and in vitro data are presented to give the full picture of the phenotype.</p>
<p>
(4) Data from both female and male mice are presented.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors have answered all my comments in the revised version and I find no more weaknesses. Some questions still remain but have been clearly discussed in the new version of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary</p>
<p>The L114P gain of function mutation in the K2P channel TALK-1 encoded by KCNJ16 has been associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). In this study, Nakhe et al. generated mice carrying L114P TALK-1 and evaluated the impact of the mutation on pancreatic islet functions and glucose homeostasis. The authors report that the mutation increases neonatal lethality, owing to hyperglycemia caused by a lack of glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Adult mutant mice showed glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycemia, which is attributed to blunted glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as well as increased glucagon secretion. Interestingly, male mice were more affected than female mice. Islets from adult mutant mice were found to have reduced Ca2+ entry upon glucose stimulation but also enhanced IP3-induced ER Ca2+ release, consistent with previous studies from the group showing a role of TALK-1 in ER Ca2+ homeostasis. Finally, comparison of bulk RNA sequencing results from WT and mutant islets revealed altered expression of genes involved in β-cell identify, function and signaling, which also contributes to the observed islet dysfunction.</p>
<p>Strengths</p>
<p>This is a well-executed and rigorous study that will be of great interest to the diabetes and islet biology communities. The findings provide convincing evidence supporting a causal role of the L114P gain of function TALK-1 mutation in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion defects and diabetes. The neonatal diabetes phenotype and the gender difference uncovered by the study have important clinical implications. The complexity of TALK-1 expression and hormone secretion in different endocrine cell types and how it impacts glucose homeostasis is elegantly illustrated in the L114P TALK-1 mouse model. The authors carefully and thoroughly addressed limitations of their study and discussed future directions. The importance of TALK-1 in β-cell and islet function demonstrated by this study will prompt future efforts targeting this important channel for diabetes treatment.</p>

<p>One paradox, that the authors point out, is that the drastic effects of TALK-1 L114P on plasma membrane potential do not result in a complete loss of insulin secretion. One important consideration is the role of intracellular stores in insulin secretion at physiological levels of hyperglycemia. This needs to be discussed more thoroughly, especially in the light of recent papers like Postic et al 2023 AJP and others. The authors do show an upregulation of IP3-induced Ca release. It is not clear whether they think this is a direct or indirect effect on the ER. Is there more IP3? More IP3R? Are the stores more full?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer brings up an important point. Although we see a significant reduction in glucose-stimulated depolarization in most islets from TALK-1 L114P mice, some glucosestimulated calcium influx is still present (especially from female islets); this suggests that a subset of islet β-cells are still capable of depolarization. Because our original membrane potential recordings were done in whole islets without identification of the cell type being recorded, we have now repeated these electrical recordings in confirmed β-cells (see Supplemental figure 6). The new data shows that 33% of TALK-1 L114P β-cells show action potential firing in 11 mM glucose, which would be predicted to stimulate insulin secretion from a third of all TALK-1 L114P β-cells; this could be responsible for the remaining glucosestimulated insulin secretion observed from TALK-1 L114P islets. However, ER calcium store release could also allow for some of the calcium response in the TALK-1 L114P islets. We have now detailed this in the discussion; this now details the Postic et. al. study showing that glucose-stimulated beta-cell calcium increases involve ER calcium release as it occurs in the presence of voltage-dependent calcium channel inhibition. Future studies can assess this using SERCA inhibitors and determining if glucose-stimulated calcium influx in TALK-1 L114P islets is lost. We also find that muscarinic stimulated calcium influx from ER stores is greater in TALK-1 L114P mice. We currently do not have data to support the mechanism for this enhancement of muscarinic-induced islet calcium responses from islets expressing TALK1 L114P. Our hypothesis is that greater TALK-1 current on the ER membrane is enhancing ER calcium release in response to IP3R activation. There is an equivalent IP3R expression in control and TALK-1 L114P islets based on transcriptome analysis, which is now included in the manuscript. However, whether there is greater IP3 production, greater ER calcium storage, and/or greater ER calcium release requires further analysis. Because this finding was not directly related to the metabolic characterization of this TALK-1 L114P MODY mutation, we are planning to examine the ER functions of TALK-1L114P thoroughly in a future manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors point to the possible roles of TALK-1 in alpha and delta cells. A limitation of the global knock-in approach is that the cell type specificity of the effects can't easily be determined. This should be more explicitly described as a limitation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added this to the discussion. This is now included in a paragraph at the end of the discussion detailing the limitations of this manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The official gene name for TALK-1 is KCNK16. This reviewer wonders whether it wouldn't be better for this official name to be used throughout, instead of switching back and forth. The official name is used for Abcc8 for example.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have revised the manuscript to include Kcnk16 L114P. The instances of TALK-1 L114P that remain in the manuscript are in cases where the text specifically discusses TALK-1 channel function.</p>

<p>There are several typos and mistakes in editing. For example, on page 5 it looks like &quot;PMID:11263999&quot; has not been inserted. I suggest an additional careful proofreading.</p>

<p>We have revised this reference, thoroughly proofread the revised manuscript, and corrected typos.</p>

<p>The difference in lethality between the strains is fascinating. Might be good to mention other examples of ion channel genes where strain alters the severe phenotypes? Additional speculation on the mechanism could be warranted. It also offers the opportunity to search for genetic modifiers. This could be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have added details on mutations where strain alters lethality.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The sex differences are interesting. Of course, estrogen plays a role as mentioned at the bottom of page 16, but there have been more involved analyses of islet sex differences, including a recent paper from the Rideout group. Is there a sex difference in the islet expression of KCNK16 mRNA or protein, in mice or humans?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the important comments on the TALK-1 L114P sex differences. We have revised the manuscript to include greater discussion about female β cell resilience to stress, which may allow greater insulin secretion in the presence of the TALK-1 L114P channels; this is based on the Brownrigg et. al. study pointed out by the reviewer (PMID: 36690328). Because these sex differences in islet function were examined in mice, we looked at KCNK16 expression in mouse beta-cells. While there is a trend for greater KCNK16 expression in sorted male beta-cells (average RPKM 6296.25 +/-953.84) compared to sorted female beta-cells (5148.25 +/- 1013.22). Similarly, there was a trend toward greater KCNK16 expression in male HFD treated mouse beta-cells (average RPKM 8020.75 +/- 1944.41) compared to female HFD treated mouse beta-cells (average RPKM 7551 +/- 2952.70). We have now added this to the text.</p>

<p>Page 15-16 &quot;Indeed, it has been well established that insulin signaling is required for neonatal survival; for example, a similar neonatal lethality phenotype was observed in mice without insulin receptors (Insr-/-) where death results from hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis by P3 (40).&quot; Formally, the authors are not examining insulin signaling. A better comparison is that of the Ins1/Ins2 double knockout model of complete hypoinsulinemia.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this as the appropriate comparison model and have now revised the manuscript to detail the 48-hour average life expectancy of Ins1/Ins2 double knockout mice (PMID: 9144203).</p>

<p>There are probably too many abbreviations in the paper, making it harder to read by nonspecialists. I recommend writing out GOF, GSIS, WT, K2P, etc.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for their time in reviewing our manuscript. We appreciate the helpful feedback and assistance in ensuring the highest quality publication possible. We have thoroughly addressed all the reviewer’s comments and revised the manuscript accordingly. These changes have strengthened the manuscript and are summarized below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) The authors perform an RNA-sequencing showing that the cAMP amplifying pathway is upregulated. Is this also true in humans with this mutation? Other follow-up comments and questions from this observation:</p>
<p>a) Will this mean that the treatment with incretins will improve glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and Ca2+ signalling and lower blood glucose? The authors should at least present data on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and/or Ca2+ signalling in the presence of a compound increasing intracellular cAMP.</p>
<p>b) Will an OGTT give different results than the IPGTT performed due to the fact that the cAMP pathway is upregulated?</p>
<p>c) Is the increased glucagon area and glucagon secretion a compensatory mechanism that increases cAMP? What happens if glucagon receptors are blocked?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Although cAMP pathways were upregulated in the TALK-1 L114P islets, the changes in expression were only modest as examined by qRTPCR. Thus, we are not sure if this plays a role in secretion. For humans with this mutation, there have been such a small number of patients and no islets isolated from these patients. Therefore, we are unaware if the cAMP amplifying pathway is upregulated in humans with the MODY associated TALK-1 L114P mutation. We have performed the suggested experiment assessing calcium from TALK-1 L114P islets in response to liraglutide (see Supplemental figure 10); there was no liraglutide response in TALK-1 L114P islets.  We have also performed the OGTT experiments as suggested and these have now been added to the manuscript (see Supplemental figure 3). We do not believe that the increased glucagon is a compensatory response, because: 1. TALK-1 deficient islets have less glucagon secretion due to reduced SST secretion (see PMID: 29402588); 2. There is no change in insulin secretion at 7mM glucose, however, glucagon secretion is significantly elevated from islets isolated from TALK-1 L114P mice; 3. TALK-1 is highly expressed in delta-cells, and in these cells TALK-1 L114P would be predicted to cause significant hyperpolarization and significant reductions in calcium entry as well as SST secretion. Thus, reduced SST secretion may be responsible for the elevation of glucagon secretion. We plan to investigate delta-cells within islets from TALK-1 L114P mice in future studies to determine if changes in SST secretion are responsible for the elevated glucagon secretion from TALK-1 L114P islets.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The performance of measurements in both male and female mice is praiseworthy. However, despite differences in the response, the authors do not investigate the potential reason for this. Are hormonal differences of importance?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. It is indeed becoming clear that there are many differences between male and female islet function and responses to stress. Thus, we have revised the manuscript to include greater discussion about these differences such as female β cell resilience to stress, which may allow greater insulin secretion in the presence of the TALK-1 L114P channels; this is based on the Brownrigg et. al. study pointed out by reviewer 1 (PMID: 36690328). While the differences in islet function and GTT between male and female L114P mice are clear, they both show diminished islet calcium handling, defective hormone secretion, and development of glucose intolerance. This manuscript was intended to demonstrate how the MODY TALK-1 L114P causing mutation caused glucose dyshomeostasis, which we have determined in both male and female mice. The mechanistic determination for the differences between male and female mice and islets with TALK-1 L114P could be due to multiple potential causes (as detailed in PMID: 36690328), thus, we believe that comprehensive studies are required to thoroughly determine how the TALK-1 L114P mutation differently impacts male and female mice and islets, which we plan to complete in a future manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p>
<p>The manuscript is overall clearly presented and the experimental data largely support the conclusions. However, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed to improve the clarity of the paper.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for their time in reviewing our manuscript. We appreciate the helpful feedback and assistance in ensuring the highest quality publication possible. We have thoroughly addressed all the reviewer’s comments and revised the manuscript accordingly. These changes have strengthened and improved the clarity of the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Specific comments:</p>
<p>(1) Title: The terms &quot;transient neonatal diabetes&quot; and &quot;glucose dyshomeostasis in adults&quot; are used to describe the TALK-1 L114P mutant mice. Transient neonatal diabetes gives the impression that diabetes is resolved during the neonatal period. The authors should clarify the criteria used for transient neonatal diabetes, and the difference between glucose dyshomeostasis and MODY. Longitudinal plasma glucose and insulin data would be very informative and help readers to follow the authors' narrative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the helpful comment and have added longitudinal plasma glucose from neonatal mice to address this (see Supplemental figure 2). The new data now shows the TALK-1 L114P mutant mice undergo transient hyperglycemia that resolves by p10 and then occurs again at week 15. Insulin secretion from P4 islets is also included that shows that male animals homozygous for the TALK-1 L114P mutation have the largest impairment in glucosestimulated insulin secretion, followed by male heterozygous TALK-1 L114P P4 islets that also have impaired insulin secretion (see Figure 1). The amount of hyperglycemia correlates with the defects in neonatal islet insulin secretion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Another concern for the title is the term &quot;α-cell overactivity.&quot; This could be taken to mean that individual α-cells are more active and/or that there are more α-cells to secrete glucagon. The study does not provide direct evidence that individual α-cells are more active. This should be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the helpful comment and have revised the manuscript title accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In the Introduction, it is stated that because TALK-1 activity is voltage-dependent, the GOF mutation is less likely to cause neonatal diabetes, yet the study shows the L114P TALK-1 mutation actually causes neonatal diabetes by completely abolishing glucose-stimulated Ca2+ entry. This seems to imply TALK-1 activity (either in the plasma membrane or ER membrane) has more impact on Vm or cytosolic Ca2+ in neonates than initially predicted. Some discussion on this point is warranted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These are important points and we have added details to the discussion about this. For example, the discussion now states that, “This suggests a greater impact of TALK-1 L114P in neonatal islets compared to adult islets. Future studies during β-cell maturation are required to determine if TALK-1 activity is greater on the plasma membrane and/or ER membrane compared with adult β-cells.” The introduction has also been revised to clarify the voltagedependence of TALK-1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) What is the relative contribution of defects in plasma membrane depolarization versus ER Ca2+ handling on defective insulin secretion response?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. TALK-1 L114P islets show blunted glucose-stimulated depolarization and glucose-stimulated calcium entry, however, the L114P islets show equivalent Ca2+ entry as control islets in response high KCl (Figure 5GH). As the KCl stimulated Ca2+ influx is similar between control and TALK-1 L11P islets, this indicates that plasma membrane TALK-1 L114P has a hyperpolarizing role that significantly blunts glucose-stimulated depolarization and reduces activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. We have further tested this by looking at glucose-stimulated β-cell membrane potential depolarization in TALK-1 L11P islets, which is significantly blunted (Figure4 A and B; Supplemental figure 6). However, 33% of TALK-1 L11P β-cells showed glucose-stimulated electrical excitability (Supplemental figure 6), which likely accounts for the modest GSIS from TALK-1 L11P islets. New data has also been included showing that KCl stimulation causes a significant depolarization of β-cells from TALK-1 L11P islets (Supplemental figure 6). Because plasma membrane TALK-1 L114P is largely responsible for the hyperpolarized membrane potential and blunted glucose-stimulated Ca2+ entry, this suggests that TALK-1 L11P on the plasma membrane is primarily responsible for the altered insulin secretion. The discussion has been revised to reflect this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The Jacobson group has previously shown that another K2P channel TASK-1 is also involved in ER Ca2+ homeostasis and that TASK inhibitors restored ER Ca2+ in TASK-1 expressing cells. Is TASK-1 expressed in β-cell ER membrane? Can the mishandling of Ca2+ caused by TALK-1 L114P be reversed by TASK-1 inhibitors?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point in relation to ER calcium handling by K2P channels. We have found that TASK-1 channels expressed in alpha-cells enhance ER calcium release and that inhibitors or TASK-1 channels elevate alpha-cell ER calcium storage. We did not observe any significant changes in the gene (Kcnk3) encoding TASK-1 between islets from control or TALK-1 L11P mice, which has now been added to the manuscript. However, because the TALK-1 L11P-mediated reduction of glucose-stimulated depolarization and inhibition of calcium entry are both prevented in the presence of high KCl (see Figure X); this strongly suggests that TALK-1 L114P K+ flux at the membrane is hyperpolarizing the membrane potential and limiting depolarization and calcium entry. This suggests that TALK-1 L114P control of ER calcium handling is not the primary contributor to the blunted glucose-stimulate calcium handling. Furthermore, acetylcholine stimulation of islets from both control and TALK-1 L114P islets elicited ER calcium release, which indicates that for the most part ER calcium release is still responsive to cues that control release, but they are altered. Taken together this suggests that the TALK-1 L114P impact on ER calcium is not the primary mediator of blunted glucose-stimulated islet calcium entry and insulin secretion.</p>

<p>(6) The electrical recording experiments were conducted using whole islets. The authors should comment on how the cells were identified as β-cells, especially in mutant islets in which there is an increased number of α-cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer brings up an important point. As indicated, the original membrane potential recordings were conducted using whole islets. While the recorded cells could mostly be βcells based on mouse islets typically containing &gt;80% β-cells, there is a possibility that some of the cells included in these recordings were α-cells or δ-cells (especially because of the noted α-cell hyperplasia in TALK-1 L114P islets). Thus, we have now included data from bcells that were identified with an adenoviral construct containing a rat insulin promoter driving a fluorescent reporter. This allowed the fluorescent β-cells to be monitored with electrophysiological membrane potential recordings. The new data (see Supplemental figure 6) shows a significant reduction in glucose-stimulated depolarization in 67% of β-cells with the L114P mutation compared to controls.</p>
