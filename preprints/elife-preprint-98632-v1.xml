<title>Summary</title>
<p>Oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs) are lost in many CNS diseases. Here, we investigate the generation of new OLCs via ectopic expression of <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic> or <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> in mouse postnatal astrocytes. Using stringent analyses including, Aldh1l1-astrocyte fate mapping and live cell imaging we confirm that <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic>, but not <italic>Nkx6.2</italic>, directly convert Aldh1l1<sup>pos</sup> astrocytes to MBP+ and PDGFRα+ induced OLCs (iOLCs), respectively. With single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) we uncover the molecular signatures of iOLCs. Transcriptomic analysis of <italic>Sox10</italic>- and control cultures over time reveals a clear trajectory from astrocytes to iOLCs. Finally, perturbation models CellOracle and Fatecode support the idea that <italic>Sox10</italic> drives cells towards a terminal iOLC fate. Altogether, this multidimensional analysis shows bonafide conversion of astrocytes to iOLCs using <italic>Sox10</italic> or <italic>Olig2</italic> and provides a foundation for astrocyte DLR strategies to promote OLC repair.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are best known as the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS). OLs ensheath neuronal axons to enable fast propagation of action potentials. Consequently, the loss or dysfunction of OLs results in impaired neurological function that is characteristic of many types of CNS disease and injury. Multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer’s Disease, spinal cord injury, white matter stroke and cerebral palsy are all characterized by oligodendrocyte failure. Thus, therapeutic strategies aimed at replacing OLs are of significant clinical interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Direct lineage reprogramming (DLR) aims to generate new target cells lost to disease via the forced conversion of donor cells. Typically, DLR is performed by the overexpression of transcription factors. Early pioneering work from the Tesar Lab demonstrated fibroblast to induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (iOPC) conversion by ectopic expression of <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic>, and <italic>Nkx6.2</italic>, determinants of OL cell fate in the embryonic brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. The combination of <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic> was also later used to generate iOPCs from pericytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Therapeutically, however, these newly generated iOPCs still require transplantation into the brain. Therefore, methods to reprogram endogenous CNS cells would be advantageous.</p>
<p>In parallel, astrocytes, CNS-resident cells, have emerged as donor cells in DLR strategies aimed at generating new neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Astrocytes are an attractive donor cell type for OL conversion given their shared neural origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Astrocytes may already have relevant epigenetic marks and active TFs that could make DLR faster or more efficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In addition, closely related cells may require fewer TFs for conversion. Indeed, conversion of astrocytes to an induced oligodendrocyte-like cell was suggested using <italic>Sox10</italic> alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, we reasoned that single ‘Tesar’ factors, <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic>, or <italic>Nkx6.2,</italic> could be used to force astrocyte conversion to new, induced oligodendrocyte lineage cells (iOLCs).</p>
<p>The OL lineage is comprised of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) that give rise to committed oligodendrocyte progenitors (COPs). These COPs differentiate into mature OLs (mOLs), comprising at least 6 different states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Of interest, during OL development, each of these ‘Tesar’ factors shows different temporal expression and plays a different role in OL fate specification. <italic>Olig2,</italic> long considered an OL lineage fate determinant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, is also expressed in astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, which suggests a broad role in early glial commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. <italic>Sox10</italic> is important throughout OL development; <italic>Sox10</italic> promotes early OL lineage specification by re-inducing <italic>Olig2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> and by inhibiting <italic>Sufu</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>, but is also required for OL survival following myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> is expressed late in OL development, with myelin genes <italic>Mbp</italic> and <italic>Mog,</italic> and plays a role in regulating myelination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Given the unique roles of each of these TFs in development, we further hypothesized that single Tesar factors could be used to create distinct types of iOLCs that ranged from OPCs to mature, myelinating OLs.</p>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted the need for rigorous reporting of DLR outcomes, following controversy of astrocyte to neuron DLR <italic>in vivo</italic>. A landmark study using astrocyte fate mapping strategies suggested that conversion was misrepresented as a result of AAV and promoter confounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is important that new DLR paradigms utilize fate mapping, and stringent, multi-faceted analysis to determine the origin of the newly generated cells.</p>
<p>Here, we used lentiviral delivery of <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic>, or <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> to investigate single TF conversion of postnatal (P0-P5) GFAP+ cortical astrocytes to different types of iOLCs. Lineage tracing experiments using Aldh1l1-CreERT2;Ai14 mice demonstrated that <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic> convert Aldh1l1+ astrocytes to iOLCs. Moreover, live cell imaging, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) and deep learning methods further support the findings that iOLCs can be generated from astrocytes following TF delivery. Altogether, our findings show bonafide astrocyte to iOLC DLR and lay the groundwork for future studies utilizing DLR for diseases involving OLC dysfunction and loss.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All experiments were performed in accordance with approved Animal Use Protocols (AUP 20012151, 25-0389H) from the Division of Comparative Medicine at the University of Toronto. P0-P5 Ai14 (B6;129S6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm</sup></italic><sup>14</sup><italic><sup>(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J, RRID:IMSR_JAX:007908) and Ai14;Ald1l1-CreERT2 mice (Ai14 crossed to B6N.FVB-Tg(Aldh1l1-cre/ERT2)1Khakh/J [RRID:IMSR_JAX:031008]) were used to generate postnatal astrocyte cultures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Cell Culture</title>
<p>Cortical astrocytes were isolated from male and female P0-P5 mice as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Briefly, mice were decapitated, followed by the removal of the skull and meninges. Cortices were dissected, pooled, and mechanically dissociated in astrocyte media [DMEM (Gibco Catalogue No. 10569-010), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco Catalogue No. 10082147) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco Catalogue No. 15140122)]. Cells were cultured in flasks pre-coated with 10 µg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma Catalogue No. P6407), and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Media was changed the day following isolation and every other day thereafter. Once the cells reached 80% confluency, typically after 6 days, flasks were placed on an orbital shaker for 30 minutes at 180rpm to remove contaminating microglia. Astrocyte media was replaced. For Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 cultures, 1uM 4-OHT was added to the astrocyte media at this step. Flasks were returned to the orbital shaker overnight at 180rpm, followed by vigorous shaking for one minute to remove contaminating OLCs. Media was removed and astrocytes were incubated in TrypLE Express Enzyme (Gibco Catalogue No. 12604013) for 5 minutes at 37°C, 5% CO2 to lift off the astrocytes. To inactivate the enzyme, astrocyte media was added at a 3:1 ratio (media:TrypLE). Cell suspension was collected and centrifuged at 300 x g for 5 minutes. Following removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in astrocyte media. Cells were then plated on poly-l-ornithine/laminin coated coverslips at either 50,000 or 70,000 cells/well in 24 well plates and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. For live cell analysis, cells were plated at 10,000 cells/ well in 96 well plates with poly-l-ornithine/laminin coating. For poly-l-ornithine/laminin coating, 0.1mg/ml poly-l-ornithine (Sigma Catalogue No. P4957) was added to dishes overnight at 37°C, washed 3 times with 1X phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and then dishes were incubated for two hours at 37°C with 10 μg/ml laminin (Sigma Catalogue No. L2020).</p>

<title>Reprogramming</title>
<p>Lentiviral particles were purchased from VectorBuilder. For Ai14 reprogramming, LV-hGFAP::<italic>Sox10-</italic>P2A-Cre, LV-hGFAP::<italic>Olig2</italic>-P2A-Cre, LV-hGFAP::<italic>Nkx6.2</italic>-P2A-Cre, and control LV-hGFAP::BFP-T2A-Cre were used. For Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 reprogramming, LV-hGFAP::<italic>Sox10</italic>-P2A-zsGreen, LV-hGFAP::<italic>Olig2</italic>-P2A-zsGreen, LV-hGFAP::<italic>Nkx6.2</italic>-P2A-zsGreen and control LV-hGFAP::zsGreen were used. A multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 was used for all experiments. Virus-containing astrocyte media was placed on the cells and left overnight. Viral media was replaced with fresh astrocyte media one day post transduction (DPT). Three DPT, cells were switched to OPC differentiation media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> [DMEM/F12/Glutamax (Gibco Catalogue No. 11330032), 1X N2 (Gibco Catalogue No. 17502048), 1X B27 without vitamin A (Gibco Catalogue No. 17504044), 200 ng/ml SHH (R&amp;D Systems Catalogue No. 464-SH), 20 ng/ml FGF (R&amp;D Systems Catalogue No. 3139-FB), 4 ng/ml PDGF (Sigma Catalogue No. SRP3228)]. At 10 DPT, the cells were switched to OL differentiation media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> [DMEM/F12/Glutamax, 1X N2, 1X B27 without vitamin A, 40 ng/ml T3 (T2877 Catalogue No. Sigma), 200 ng/ml SHH, 100 ng/ml Noggin (R&amp;D Systems Catalogue No. 1967-NG), 10 µM cAMP (Sigma Catalogue No. A9501), 100 ng/ml IGF (R&amp;D Systems Catalogue No. 791-MG), 10 ng/ml NT3 (Sigma Catalogue No. SRP6007)].</p>

<title>Live Cell Analysis</title>
<p>Astrocytes isolated from Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice were plated in 96 well plates, transduced and imaged every hour from 7 to 12DPT using the Apotome live cell system (Zeiss). 25 z-stack tiled images per well were captured with brightfield as well as the 488nm and 568nm fluorescent wavelength. Images were stitched to create a continuous video for each well. At 12DPT, cells were fixed and stained for OLC markers to confirm fate. Each well was then re-imaged at this final timepoint and OLC+ reprogrammed cells were matched to the live cell video and retrospectively analyzed for starting cell morphology and fluorescent expression.</p>

<title>Immunocytochemistry</title>
<p>Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma Catalogue No. P6148) for 20 minutes followed by three washes with 1X PBS. Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X-100 (Sigma Catalogue No. X100) for 10 minutes at room temperature, followed by three washes with 1X PBS, and then blocked with 5% milk for one hour at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies in 1X PBS overnight at 4°C, washed three times with 1X PBS, and then incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI (Sigma Catalogue No. D9542) in 1X PBS at room temperature for one hour. Following three final 1X PBS washes, coverslips were mounted on glass slides (Fisher Scientific Catalogue No. 125523) with Mowiol mounting solution (Sigma Catalogue No. 81381). For staining of membrane bound proteins (O4, PDGFRα), no permeabilization step with Triton-X-100 was performed. Primary antibodies: mouse anti-SOX10 (RRID:AB_10844002, 1:250), rabbit anti-PDGFRα (RRID:AB_2892065, 1:500), mouse anti-O4 (RRID:AB_357617, 1:1000) and rat anti-MBP RRID:AB_305869, 1:50).</p>
<p>Secondary antibodies: anti-mouse IgG 488 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A32723) and 647 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A32728), anti-mouse IgM heavy chain 488 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A21042) and 647 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A21238), anti-rabbit 488 IgG (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A11034) and 647 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A32733), anti-rat IgG 488 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A21208) and 647 (Invitrogen Catalogue No. A21247) all at 1:1000.</p>

<title>Different types of iOLCs are generated following expression of <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Sox10</italic> or <italic>Nkx6.2</italic></title>
<p>To investigate astrocyte to OLC conversion, we established postnatal, cortical astrocyte cultures from Ai14 mice. To understand the purity of our cultures, we quantified the numbers of contaminating OLCs. Quantification of SOX10+, O4+ and MBP+ OLCs showed less than 2.5% in our cultures (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the reprogramming potential of <italic>Olig2, Sox10,</italic> and <italic>Nkx6.2</italic>, we transduced Ai14 astrocytes with either LV-GFAP::<italic>Olig2,</italic> LV-GFAP::<italic>Sox10</italic>, LV-GFAP::<italic>Nkx6.2</italic> or a control LV-GFAP::<italic>Cre</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). When we quantified the numbers of tdTomato+ cells that co-expressed OPC (PDGFRα), COP (O4) or OL (MBP) markers at 8 and 10 DPT, no differences were seen in any of the TF-transduced cultures compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). By 12 DPT, <italic>Olig2</italic>-cultures showed an increase in the percentage of tdTomato<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> OPCs (p = 0.0309, H-statistic: 7.514), whereas <italic>Sox10</italic>- and <italic>Nkx6.2</italic>-cultures showed an increase in tdTomato<sup>+</sup>MBP<sup>+</sup> OLs (<italic>Sox10:</italic> p = 0.0004, <italic>Nkx6.2:</italic> p = 0.0108, F statistic = 13.28, degrees of freedom =3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). No differences were seen in the percentage of tdTomato<sup>+</sup>O4<sup>+</sup> COPs in any condition at 12DPT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). However, by 14DPT we observed an increase in the percentage of tdTomato<sup>+</sup>O4<sup>+</sup> COPs in <italic>Sox10-</italic> cultures when compared to controls (p = 0.0213, F statistic = 3.512, degrees of freedom = 3) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-C</xref>). Finally, to understand whether a longer time in culture could increase the number of MBP+ OLs, we cultured cells for an additional 8 days and analyzed the percent of tdTomato<sup>+</sup>MBP<sup>+</sup> cells at 22 DPT. No differences were seen in tdTomato<sup>+</sup>MBP<sup>+</sup> OLs in any condition compared to controls (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Canonical OLC cluster found in TF-treated cells following scRNA-seq</title>
<p>To further characterize <italic>Olig2-, Sox10-, Nkx6.2-</italic> and control cultures, we performed scRNA-seq at 14DPT (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Clustering analysis showed the appearance of nine clusters (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). We then used proportion analysis to identify clusters that were unique to TF-treated samples. Clusters 3 and 8 were predominantly comprised of cells from TF-induced cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E-F</xref>). The top 10 genes marking each cluster in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> are highlighted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>.

<p>We then compared the molecular profiles of clusters 3 and 8 to established OL lineage datasets. When using OLC specific annotations of mouse fetal and adult OLCs derived from Marques <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> to bin the data we found that cluster 3 was characterized by COP signatures, while cluster 8 was characterized by COP, newly formed oligodendrocyte (nfOL) and myelin forming oligodendrocyte (mfOL) signatures (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 3A</xref>). When using OLC annotations of <italic>in vitro</italic> OLCs derived from Dugas <italic>et al</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> to bin the data, we again saw that cluster 8 was characterized by OL signatures, but cluster 3 was not.

<title>Bonafide astrocyte to OLC conversion is confirmed with astrocyte fate mapping</title>
<p>We had previously observed contaminating OLCs in our cultures and the presence of tdTomato<sup>+</sup>OLC marker<sup>+</sup> cells in our Cre controls. Therefore, to understand the origin of these newly generated OLCs, we performed astrocyte fate mapping using Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 cultures, the current gold standard in the field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Prior to transduction, post-natal cortical Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 astrocyte cultures were treated with 1uM 4-OHT to permanently label all <italic>Aldh1l1</italic> expressing cells with tdTomato (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Cultures were transduced with LV-GFAP::<italic>Sox10</italic>-zsGreen, LV-GFAP::<italic>Olig2</italic>-zsGreen, LV-GFAP::<italic>Nkx6.2</italic>-zsGreen or a LV-GFAP::zsGreen control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). Any OLCs that were directly converted by a TF from these <italic>Aldh1l1</italic> expressing astrocytes would therefore express zsGreen and tdTomato (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To understand whether the OPCs generated from <italic>Olig2</italic> overexpression were the product of astrocyte reprogramming, we quantified the percentage of PDGFRα+zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells at 12DPT. We observed an increase in PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> OPCs compared to controls, confirming the astrocytic origin of iOPCs (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B,E</xref>). To assess the origin of <italic>Sox10</italic>-induced COPs we quantified the percentage of O4<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cells at 14DPT. No increase was observed in <italic>Sox10</italic> cultures compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, to determine the origin of OLs generated by <italic>Sox10</italic> or <italic>Nkx6.2,</italic> we quantified the percentage of MBP<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> OLs at 12DPT. We observed an increase of MBP<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup> OLs generated by <italic>Sox10</italic>, but not from <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> (Figure D,F). This suggests that <italic>Olig2</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> reprogram astrocytes to iOPCs and iOLs, respectively but that the <italic>Nkx6.2</italic>-derived OLs and <italic>Sox10</italic>-derived COPs we previously observed (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) were not the result of astrocyte conversion.</p>
<p>To further confirm these findings, we performed a live cell imaging experiment. Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated and control cultures were imaged from 7DPT to 12DPT then fixed and stained for OLC markers. tdTomato<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>OLC marker<sup>+</sup> cells were then tracked retrospectively to confirm their origin from a Aldh1l1-tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cell. tdTomato<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>OLC marker<sup>+</sup> OLs could be tracked back to a tdTomato<sup>+</sup> cell with a characteristic astrocyte morphology (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>, Supplemental Video 1). Taken together, our findings further confirm bonafide astrocyte to iOLC conversion.</p>
<p>We also examined the numbers of Aldh1l1<sup>+</sup> non-transduced (tdTomato<sup>+</sup> only) cells and Aldh1l1<sup>neg</sup> virally transduced (zsGreen<sup>+</sup> only) cells (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). No difference in the percentage of OLC marker<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>neg</sup> was seen between TF-treated and control cultures (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4</xref>). However, when we examined zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>neg</sup> cells, we observed an interesting increase in the percentage of MBP<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>neg</sup> OLs at 12DPT in <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated cells compared to controls (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 4C</xref>). When we analyzed our live cell imaging experiment to understand the origin of these cells, we found examples of tdTomato<sup>neg</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>OLCmarker<sup>+</sup> cells that arose from a tdTomato<sup>neg</sup> cell with an astrocyte morphology (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref>, Supplemental Video 2), suggesting conversion of other astrocyte-like Aldh1l1<sup>neg</sup> cells.</p>

<p>First, we examined the molecular identities of cells in our starting cultures. D0 cells were found in clusters 3, 5 and 9 and showed expression of canonical astrocyte markers, including <italic>Slc1a3, Aqp4, Atp1b2, Glul</italic> and <italic>Gfap</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B, D</xref>). Of interest, clusters 3 and 5 showed expression of <italic>Aldh1l1</italic>, but this gene was absent in cluster 9 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). This discrepancy in <italic>Aldh1l1</italic> expression, may explain the conversion of tdTomato<sup>neg</sup> cells seen in our fate mapping experiments (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4</xref>). Altogether, this suggests that early postnatal cultures are heterogeneous and comprised of 3 distinct astrocyte-like populations (clusters).</p>
<p>To understand the cell fate transitions that occur over our reprogramming timecourse, we performed trajectory analysis with Slingshot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and Monocle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). Slingshot and Monocle3 both reconstructed trajectories with clusters 6 and 4 as terminal branches (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E-F</xref>). We then examined the origin of cells comprising each cluster. As expected, the clusters formulating earlier roots of the Monocle3 branches (clusters 0, 1, 3) were primarily comprised of D0, 3DPT, and 8DPT timepoints (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Clusters 6 and 4, were predominantly comprised of 14DPT samples, and in particular, cells from <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated samples (D14_S) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G</xref>). Analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at these branches showed that cluster 6 and branch 14 of the Monocle3 trajectory were enriched in the OLC genes <italic>Sox10</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (p- and q-value=0), <italic>Bcas1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup> (p- and q-value=0), and <italic>Omg</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (p- and q-value=0 (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>).

All Monocle3-derived differentially expressed genes can be found in Data S2. Altogether, these analyses suggest that the trajectory to branch 14/cluster 6 represents the path of astrocyte to OLC conversion.</p>
<p>To determine how <italic>Sox10</italic> would influence the gene regulatory network of cells in clusters 6 and 4, we performed <italic>in silico</italic> perturbation of <italic>Sox10</italic> using CellOracle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. <italic>in silico</italic> knock out (KO) of <italic>Sox10</italic>, predicted a large shift away from a cluster 6 identity and little change away from the identity of cluster 4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). In agreement, <italic>in silico</italic> knock in (KI) of <italic>Sox10</italic> showed a large shift towards a cluster 6 identify and little change towards a cluster 4 identity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). This suggests that leaf 14 and cluster 6 represent cells with a gene regulatory network most affected by <italic>Sox10</italic>.</p>
<p>As cluster 6 was comprised of both <italic>Sox10-</italic>treated and control cells, we then performed a differential gene expression analysis of 14DPT control and <italic>Sox10-</italic>treated cells within this cluster. 175 DEGs were found, with the top genes (expressed in at least 50% of Cluster 6, <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated cells and with a difference of at least 0.5 pct between control and <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated cultures) clustered and provided in a dotplot (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). This analysis highlighted that genes including <italic>Omg</italic>, <italic>Bcas1</italic>, <italic>Pdgfra</italic>, <italic>Cldn11</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, and <italic>Sox10</italic> are enriched in <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated cells compared to control cells, suggesting that <italic>Sox10</italic>-treated cells are more representative of OLCs than the control cells exposed to OPC and OL media alone.</p>

<title>Understanding the genetic drivers of astrocyte to OLC DLR</title>
<p>Our analysis showed that <italic>Sox10</italic> was important for determining the OLC identity of cluster 6. We specifically chose <italic>Sox10</italic> based on its role in OLC fate specification in development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. To understand whether there might be other [better] candidate genes that would promote an OLC identity, we used an unbiased, deep learning perturbation model, Fatecode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, to predict genes that would allow cells to shift from a cluster 4 identity (astrocytes at 14DPT, not fully reprogrammed) to a cluster 6 identity (OLCs at 14DPT, end state of DLR). Following training of the Fatecode model on our <italic>Sox10</italic> and control treated DLR dataset, we identified perturbation on node 16 of the latent layer as one which increased the number of cells in cluster 6 whilst simultaneously reducing the number of cells in clusters 0, 2, 4, 5 and 7. (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>). Given that the total number of cells in the dataset does not change, this suggests that the perturbation on node 16 of the latent layer was pushing cells that did not reprogram (astrocytes at 8 and 14DPT) towards a reprogrammed (OLCs at 14DPT) fate. To identify the genes driving this shift, we ranked the absolute value of gene expression changes to obtain a list of 3000 genes involved in this perturbation, with the top 40 genes listed in Table S3. Strikingly, we observed that <italic>Sox10</italic> was ranked as the ninth most correlated gene and the top TF driving this shift (Table S3). This supports our previous findings that suggest <italic>Sox10</italic> drives astrocyte to OLC DLR. Additionally, we observed genes important for myelination (<italic>Plp1, Mbp</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, as well as other TFs previously identified with OLC differentiation and myelination (<italic>Sox3</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup><italic>, Klf9</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>) as integral to this shift. Taken together, these findings further support the importance of <italic>Sox10</italic> in reprogramming astrocytes to OLCs and identify additional genes and TFs that may be ideal candidates for astrocyte to OLC reprogramming.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we show astrocyte to OLC conversion with <italic>Sox10</italic> or <italic>Olig2</italic> using a battery of experimental tools, including astrocyte fate mapping, live cell imaging, a scRNA-seq timecourse and unbiased deep learning. While previous studies demonstrated the generation of iOLCs from different types of somatic cells using combinations of <italic>Sox10</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic> and <italic>Nkx6.2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>, ours is the first to compare the individual reprogramming ability of each these TFs in astrocytes. Using Aldh1l1-based fate-mapping, we found that that <italic>Sox10</italic> converts Aldh1l1<sup>+</sup> astrocytes to MBP<sup>+</sup> oligodendrocytes, whereas <italic>Olig2</italic> converts Aldh1l1<sup>+</sup> astrocytes to PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> OPCs.</p>
<p>In contrast to <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic>, <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> was unable to convert astrocytes to new OLCs. Unlike <italic>Sox10</italic> and <italic>Olig2</italic>, which define oligodendrocyte identity and continue to shape their gene regulatory network throughout life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>, <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> may be unable to direct a stable OLC identity. In support of this, previous work investigating pericyte to OL reprogramming found that inclusion of <italic>Nkx6.2</italic> in their reprogramming cocktail was refractory to reprogramming. In addition to observing the activation of genes unrelated to oligodendrogenesis, genes required for OPC identity were downregulated when cells were transduced with <italic>Nkx6.2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In a previous study, Khanghahi et al. investigated <italic>Sox10</italic> mediated astrocyte to OLC conversion. Ectopic expression of <italic>Sox10</italic> in astrocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> led to an increase in OPCs at 21DPT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, a different OLC type and longer time to conversion than we observed in our study. Although similar experimental designs were used in both studies (cortical P3-P5 astrocytes cultured in OPC media in Khanghahi <italic>et al</italic>. versus P0-P5 cortical astrocytes cultured in OPC followed by OL media in our study), these discrepancies may be due to the use of different viral delivery strategies and metrics of reprogramming. In our study, we used lentiviral delivery of <italic>Sox10-</italic>P2A-zsGreen under the control of the long (2178bp) hGFAP promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>. In addition, we used Ai14;Aldh1l1-CreERT2 mice and quantified only the iOLCs with an astrocyte origin (based on tdTomato<sup>+</sup>OLC marker<sup>+</sup>expression). In contrast, in the Khanghahi <italic>et al.</italic> study, the authors used a SFFV promoter to deliver <italic>Sox10</italic>-IRES-GFP and reported the number of GFP+ iOLCs in their <italic>Sox10</italic>-transduced cultures. Without an astrocyte specific promoter and stringent lineage tracking it is difficult to conclude that their iOPCs were the result of astrocyte conversion. The non-specific delivery strategy could have instead hit a contaminating, perhaps more distantly related cell that would need more time to convert.</p>
<p>In this regard, a recent study suggested that the conversion reported in studies of <italic>in vivo</italic> astrocyte to neuron DLR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup> were not true reprogramming, but rather the result of erroneous labelling of endogenous neurons due to technical confounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. As a result, the DLR community has advocated for the stringent validation of DLR paradigms. In this study, we first examined astrocyte to iOLC conversion in Ai14 cells. This enabled the permanent labeling of transduced cells and therefore, the tracking of those cells through the DLR timecourse. To then validate our findings, we used Aldh1l1-astrocyte fate mapping, which highlighted a lack of conversion with <italic>Nkx6.2</italic>.</p>
<p>When performing our lineage tracing experiments, we also discovered a subpopulation of cells (Aldh1l1-tdTomato<sup>neg</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup>OLCmarker<sup>+</sup>) that was converted by <italic>Sox10</italic> at a high reprogramming efficiency (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplemental Figure 4C</xref>). scRNA-seq analysis of cells prior to conversion also showed a cluster with low <italic>Aldh1l1</italic> expression compared to the other astrocyte clusters, but with similar levels of <italic>Gfap</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), which could explain its transduction by the LV-GFAP::<italic>Sox10</italic>. These <italic>Aldh1l1</italic><sup>lo</sup><italic>Gfap</italic><sup>hi</sup> cells were predominantly characterized by mature astrocyte markers but also showed expression of genes found in NG2 glia (<italic>Cspg, Pdgfra</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B-C</xref>). Curiously, this population did not show expression of proliferation marker <italic>Mki67</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), in contrast to previous studies showing that astrocyte-like NG2 glia are proliferative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. Of interest, one study reported high co-expression of <italic>Gfap Cspg4</italic> and <italic>Pdgfra</italic> in early postnatal astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref></sup>. This leads to the intriguing idea that these cells represent a population of Aldh1l1<sup>lo</sup> expressing astrocytes, which could preclude our understanding of the true extent of astrocyte reprogramming possible when using Aldh1l1-fate-mapping. The presence of these <italic>Aldh11l</italic><sup>lo</sup> cells shows that astrocyte cultures are heterogeneous and that different types of astrocytes or astrocyte-like cells may be suitable targets for DLR. Further studies using scRNA barcoding and CellOracle to profile the different types of astrocytes that are particularly amenable to reprogramming will be beneficial in designing more specific and tailored DLR strategies.</p>
<p>Conversion of Aldh1l1<sup>pos</sup> astrocytes to PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup> iOPCs using <italic>Olig2</italic> occurred at a relatively low rate, with an average conversion efficiency of 16.75% cells. This conversion was even lower for the generation of mature MBP<sup>+</sup>tdTomato<sup>+</sup>zsGreen<sup>+</sup> OLs, with an average conversion efficiency of 2.83%. This may suggest that although <italic>Sox10</italic> generates more mature OLCs, it can only do this in a select number of ‘elite’ donor cells. Alternatively, the absence of a substrate to myelinate in our cultures may preclude the true reprogramming ability of <italic>Sox10.</italic> OL survival <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> has been shown to be dependent on the presence of axons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that mRNA expression of myelin genes is increased when OLs are cultured in the presence of neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, and differentiation of OPCs can be induced with bead or nanofiber scaffolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref></sup>. However, additional factors, or the discovery of “better” TFs may also allow for increased reprogramming efficiency. It remains to be determined whether the genes predicted by Fatecode in this study will improve the efficiencies of OLC generation. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the extent of iOLC generation must be balanced with the extent of astrocyte loss as many studies have shown that widespread loss of astrocytes can be detrimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Investigation of the reprogramming trajectory of <italic>Sox10</italic> and control treated cells showed a bifurcation, where the cells either converted to iOLCs or remained as astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>). It remains to be determined if this is a genetic hurdle or a metabolic hurdle, similar to studies of astrocyte to neuron conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref></sup>. Future studies investigating the genes that characterize the ‘tipping point’ of conversion will be useful in identifying the mechanisms of astrocyte to iOLC reprogramming. A clearer understanding of how different astrocyte types convert to iOLCs and the mechanisms that underly the reprogramming processes will help us identify the best DLR paradigm for therapeutic applications.</p>

<p>This study provides a <bold>useful</bold> advance in generating mouse oligodendrocytes by direct lineage conversion from cortical astrocytes. The authors demonstrate that Sox10 converts astrocytes to MBP+ oligodendrocytes, whereas Olig2 expression converts astrocytes to PDFRalpha+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The data supporting the conclusions are <bold>solid</bold>, but there are concerns regarding select figures and the experiments being limited to in vitro studies.</p>

<p>Faiz et al. investigate small molecule-driven direct lineage reprogramming of mouse postnatal mouse astrocytes to oligodendrocyte lineage cells (OLCs). They use a combination of in vitro, in vivo, and computational approaches to confirm lineage conversion and to examine the key underlying transcription factors and signaling pathways. Lentiviral delivery of transcription factors previously reported to be essential in OLC fate determination-Sox10, Olig2, and Nkx2.2-to astrocytes allows for lineage tracing. They found that these transcription factors are sufficient in reprogramming astrocytes to iOLCs, but that the OLCs range in maturity level depending on which factor they are transfected with. They followed up with scRNA-seq analysis of transfected and control cultures 14DPT, confirming that TF-induced astrocytes take on canonical OLC gene signatures. By performing astrocyte lineage fate mapping, they further confirmed that TF-induced astrocytes give rise to iOLCs. Finally, they examined the distinct genetic drivers of this fate conversion using scRNA-seq and deep learning models of Sox10- astrocytes at multiple time points throughout the reprogramming. These findings are certainly relevant to diseases characterized by the perturbation of OLC maturation and/or myelination, such as Multiple Sclerosis and Alzheimer's Disease. Their application of such a wide array of experimental approaches gives more weight to their findings and allows for the identification of additional genetic drivers of astrocyte to iOLC conversion that could be explored in future studies. Overall, I find this manuscript thoughtfully constructed and only have a few questions to be addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The authors suggest that Sox10- and Olig2- transduced astrocytes result in distinct subpopulations iOLCs. Considering it was discussed in the introduction that these TFs cyclically regulate one another throughout differentiation, could they speculate as to why such varying iOLCs resulted from the induction of these two TFs?</p>
<p>(2) In Figure 1B it appears that the Sox10- MBP+ tdTomato+ cells decreases from D12 to D14. Does this make sense considering MBP is a marker of more mature OLCs?</p>
<p>(3) Previous studies have shown that MBP expression and myelination in vitro occurs at the earliest around 4-6 weeks of culturing. When assessing whether further maturation would increase MBP positivity, authors only cultured cells up to 22 DPT and saw no significant increase. Has a lengthier culture timeline been attempted?</p>
<p>(4) Figure S4D is described as &quot;examples of tdTomatonegzsGreen+OLCmarker+ cells that arose from a tdTomatoneg cell with an astrocyte morphology.&quot; The zsGreen+ tdTomato- cell is not convincingly of &quot;astrocyte morphology&quot;; it could be a bipolar OLC. To strengthen the conclusions and remove this subjectivity, more extensive characterizations of astrocyte versus OLC morphology in the introduction or results are warranted. This would make this observation more convincing since there is clearly an overlap in the characteristics of these cell types.</p>

<p>The study by Bajohr investigates the important question of whether astrocytes can generate oligodendrocytes by direct lineage conversion (DLR). The authors ectopically express three transcription factors - Sox10, Olig2 and Nkx6.2 - in cultured postnatal mouse astrocytes and use a combination of Aldh1|1-astrocyte fate mapping and live cell imaging to demonstrate that Sox10 converts astrocytes to MBP+ oligodendrocytes, whereas Olig2 expression converts astrocytes to PDFRalpha+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Nkx6.2 does not induce lineage conversion. The authors use single-cell RNAseq over 14 days post-transduction to uncover molecular signatures of newly generated iOLs.</p>
<p>The potential to convert astrocytes to oligodendrocytes has been previously analyzed and demonstrated. Despite the extensive molecular characterization of the direct astrocyte-oligodendrocyte lineage conversion, the paper by Bajohr et al. does not represent significant progress. The entire study is performed in cultured cells, and it is not demonstrated whether this lineage conversion can be induced in astrocytes in vivo, particularly at which developmental stage (postnatal, adult?) and in which brain region. The authors also state that generating oligodendrocytes from astrocytes could be relevant for oligodendrocyte regeneration and myelin repair, but they don't demonstrate that lineage conversion can be induced under pathological conditions, particularly after white matter demyelination. Specific issues are outlined below.</p>
<p>(1) The authors perform an extensive characterization of Sox10-mediated DLR by scRNAseq and demonstrate a clear trajectory of lineage conversion from astrocytes to terminally differentiated MBP+ iOLCs. A similar type of analysis should be performed after Olig2 transduction, to determine whether transcriptomics of OPC induction overlaps with any phase of MBP+ oligodendrocyte induction.</p>
<p>(2) A complete immunohistochemical characterization of the cultures should be performed at different time points after Sox10 and Olig2 transduction to confirm OL lineage cell phenotypes.</p>
