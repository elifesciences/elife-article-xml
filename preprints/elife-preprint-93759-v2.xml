<title>Abstract</title>
<p>NADPH oxidases (NOX) are transmembrane proteins that professionally produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and are distributed widely in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes use the ROS products for innate immune defense and signaling; the seven human isoforms of NOX participate in critical physiological and pathophysiological processes. Recently solved structures of two human NOX isoforms provide much new information, but do not fully elucidate controls on the electron transfer pathway from NAD(P)H substrate through FAD and heme cofactors to the final ROS product. SpNOX, a bacterial NOX homolog from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, shows robust constitutive activity in detergent solution, making it a good prototype for exploring electron transfer in the NOX family. Here we present crystal structures of wildtype and mutant full-length and dehydrogenase (DH) domain-only constructs of SpNOX. The isolated DH domain acts as a flavin reductase, and both DH and full-length constructs use either NADPH or NADH as substrate. Our data supports hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD as the rate limiting step in electron transfer. Using the DH domain, we demonstrate the role of F397 in allowing access of nicotinamide to the flavin isoalloxazine, while in the full-length construct, we used mutants and flavin analogs to confirm the contribution of both domains to flavin binding observed in the structure. Comparison with homologous enzymes suggests distal heme access may influence the final electron acceptor, while the relative position of DH and TM does not necessarily correlate with activity of a given NOX family member. Based on this comparison, SpNOX appears to be a good model of active NOX2, which allows us to propose an explanation for NOX2’s requirement for activation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>NADPH oxidases (NOX) are membranous enzymes that ‘professionally’ produce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vermot et al., 2021</xref>); the ‘professional’ production in NOX contrasts with many other sources of cellular ROS which result from metabolic leaking or byproducts. The first-characterized human enzyme of the NOX family, now called NOX2, has been known since 1978 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Segal and Jones, 1978</xref>), and provided a paradigm of its ROS product as a cytotoxic agent in defense mechanisms. However, from 1999 – 2001, six other isoforms of NOX were discovered: NOX1/3/4/5 and DUOX1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banfi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Deken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dupuy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Geiszt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kikuchi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Suh et al., 1999</xref>). These other isoforms of NOX function in many tissues and cell types and the ROS they produce play roles beyond cytotoxic defense, as biochemical and signaling agents. In addition to the identification of NOX2 deficiency as the cause of chronic granulomatous disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Segal and Jones, 1978</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">1979</xref>), dysregulation of other NOX family members has since been highlighted in pathophysiologies like hyperthyroidism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">De Deken et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dupuy et al., 1999</xref>) and inflammatory bowel diseases along with well-documented participation in normal physiological process like cardiovascular tone regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Rajagopalan et al., 1996</xref>), sense of balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Banfi et al., 2004</xref>), and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Musset et al., 2012</xref>) among others. Interestingly, these integrated processes directly link to multicellularity leading to the belief that true NOXes are found only in multicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lalucque and Silar, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The various isoforms display significant diversity in assembly with accessory membrane proteins (p22<sup>phox</sup> for NOX1-4, DUOXA1/2 for the corresponding DUOX1/2) or not (NOX5); in phosphorylation-promoted association of cytosolic factors required for activation (NOX 1-3) or not (NOX4-5, DUOX1/2); in the presence of EF hands conferring Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence (NOX5, DUOX1/2) or not (NOX1-4); and in the species of ROS produced, superoxide for NOX1-3,5 and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for NOX4 and DUOXs enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Vermot et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite their variety, all NOX family members share a common catalytic core comprised of two conserved domains. The transmembrane (TM) domain belongs to the Ferric Reductase Domain (FRD) superfamily, which consists of six TM helices containing conserved histidines in TM 3 and 5 that chelate up to two heme b cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). The cytosolic dehydrogenase (DH) domain belongs to the Ferredoxin NADP+ Reductase (FNR) family which has motifs to bind a flavin cofactor and a pyridine dinucleotide NAD(P)H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Taylor et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, the NOX core catalytic domain contains the necessary machinery to move electrons from the electron donor – NADPH – through the flavin and heme cofactors to the ultimate electron acceptor, molecular oxygen, to make the ROS product.</p>
<p>The fusion of the TM (N-terminal) and DH (C-terminal) domains constitutes the conserved architecture for the catalytic subunit of the NOX family members. The widespread appearance of separate FRD and DH domains in prokaryotes motivated a search for prokaryotic NOX homologs. First, separate <italic>E. coli</italic> FRD and FNR representatives MsrQ and Fre were identified and shown to interact, producing a NOX-like flow of electrons from NADPH to flavin and through the hemes to an electron acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Juillan-Binard et al., 2017</xref>). Another bioinformatic search identified a large number of prokaryotic sequences with fused FRD and FNR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hajjar et al., 2017</xref>). We demonstrated that one such protein from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, called SpNOX, is a <italic>bona fide</italic> NOX that produces ROS and shares the spectral signature and biochemical hallmarks (resistance to cyanide, inhibition by DPI) of eukaryotic NOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hajjar et al., 2017</xref>), although its biological function in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has not yet been determined. These results demonstrate definitively that NOXes also exist in prokaryotes. SpNOX purifies as a monomer and is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hajjar et al., 2017</xref>), so it represents the minimal functional core shared by all NOX family members. Furthermore, unlike eukaryotic NOX family members, it overexpresses well in <italic>E. coli</italic> and retains robust activity in detergent solution. These qualities make SpNox well suited to structural determination by several methods.</p>
<p>Published crystal structures of separate TM and DH domains of a NOX5 homolog CsNOX from the cyanobacterium <italic>Cylindrospermum stagnale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Magnani et al., 2017</xref>) provided novel structural information about the NOX family. A low resolution structure of full length SpNOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vermot et al., 2020</xref>) provided the first look at the fused TM and DH domains in NOX proteins, while cryo-EM structures of mammalian DUOX1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sun, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) and NOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Noreng et al., 2022</xref>) furnished important new insights. Still, much remains to be discovered regarding electron transfer, the essential catalytic function of the NOX family. SpNOX thus remains an attractive prototype through which to examine structure/function relationships common to NOX family members.</p>
<p>Here, we obtained X-ray structures of WT and F397W mutant of DH-only, and of a F397W mutant of full-length SpNOX. We combined enzymological and structural characterization to elucidate insights into substrate and cofactor recognition, as well as kinetic and mechanistic aspects of electron transfer for the NOX enzyme family. Comparative analysis of this constitutively active prokaryotic NOX with the previously described human NOX2 and DUOX1 structures provides a molecular explanation NOX2’s requirement for an activation step.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Production of SpNOX and SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> domain</title>
<p>SpNOX shares only about 25% identity with the human NOX homologs; nonetheless the NOX family members share several well-conserved motifs identified in eukaryotic NOX by Massari et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Massari et al., 2022</xref>). Figure S1A shows the logos corresponding to the eukaryotic NOX motifs in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Massari et al., 2022</xref>), but constructed from our alignment containing about half prokaryotic sequences. Other than the motif identified as NADPH3, for which our joint prokaryotic-eukaryotic NOX alignment lacked consensus, SpNOX (and other prokaryotic NOX) recognizably share all the motifs identified by Massari &amp; al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Massari et al., 2022</xref>). The C-terminal motif identified by our alignment includes several residues past the C-terminal end of the motif identified from eukaryotes, indicating the high frequency of additional residues in prokaryotic NOX. A specific acid/base pair (E<sub>283</sub>R<sub>284</sub> human NOX2 numbering) highly conserved in eukaryotic NOX appears directly after the predicted end of the 6<sup>th</sup> TM helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Sharpe et al., 2010</xref>), at the inter-domain hinge (Figure S1B); SpNOX has the similar pair Q<sub>180</sub>K<sub>181</sub> at this position which prompted us to define K181 as the start of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub>. A typical SDS-PAGE of purified SpNOX and SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> is shown in Figure S2A.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Optimization of the SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> thermostability and activity</title>
<p>SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> showed a tendency to aggregate, so we investigated buffer conditions to optimize its stability, solubility and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gekko and Timasheff, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Martins de Oliveira et al., 2018</xref>). SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> thermostability and activity were assessed through wide ranges of salt concentrations (0.05-1M) and glycerol percentage (0-20%). The temperatures of thermal unfolding were determined by nanoDSF and demonstrated a constant improvement of T<sub>m</sub> with NaCl concentration and glycerol percentage increases (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> activity was assessed by reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic>. In reactions without NaCl and glycerol, the DH domain efficiently supported cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reduction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). In contrast to thermal stability, however, SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> exhibits a dramatic loss of activity with increasing NaCl and glycerol. We generated a 3D surface plot of Tm as a function of NaCl and glycerol with specific activity as color scale (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) which allowed us to optimize buffer conditions jointly. The region highlighted by (<italic>○</italic>) in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> indicates that at 300mM NaCl and 5% glycerol SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> exhibits both high activity (5 mol reduced cyt. <italic>c</italic>/s/mol.SpNOX<bold><sub>DH</sub>)</bold> and a good thermostability (melting temperature of 60°C).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then optimized the pH in order to conjointly maximize the thermostability and the activity of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub>. Direct comparison of the kinetic parameters of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> and SpNOX necessitated identifying a pH that would work well for both constructs. The dependences of SpNOX<bold><sub>DH</sub></bold> activity (Figure S3A) and stability (Figure S3B), evaluated along a range of pH (respectively 5-7 and 4-9.5) in the presence of 300 mM NaCl 5% glycerol, exhibit a progressive decrease with increasing alkalinity. Like SpNOX<sub>DH</sub>, the <italic>thermostability</italic> of SpNOX follows a similar and progressive decrease of T<sub>m</sub> with alkalinity (Figure S3B), but in contrast the <italic>activity</italic> of SpNOX shows an optimum at higher alkalinity (Figure S3A). The two constructs show similar activity at pH 6.5, so we chose this as the pH. Thus, for all experiments in which we compare activity of the full-length SpNOX to the truncated SpNOX<sub>DH</sub>, we chose a standard buffer of 50mM bis TRIS-propane pH 6.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol.</p>

<sec id="s2c">
<title>Functional characterization of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub></title>
<p>The DH domain of NOXes, including SpNOX, as a homolog of the FNR superfamily, should catalyze the transfer of two electrons from the cytosolic NADPH to the FAD coenzyme; in full length NOX the electrons are then transferred singly to the hemes and across the membrane to molecular O<sub>2</sub>.

The strict requirement of FAD addition for SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> activity and its µM level of affinity suggests that the flavin behaves as a co-substrate rather than a prosthetic group.

<title>Comparative flavin recognition properties and activities of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> vs SpNOX</title>
<p>To characterize the flavin reductase activity of the DH domain and the relative contributions to FAD binding of the TM and DH domains of SpNOX, we determined the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of SpNOX and SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> cytochrome <italic>c</italic> reductase activity using flavins FAD, FMN, riboflavin, and lumiflavin (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). We observed a progressive loss of affinity for SpNOX as flavin size diminishes, with 263-fold higher affinity for FAD than for lumiflavin (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> retains constant affinity equal to that of lumiflavin (∼10μM) regardless of the flavin analog. These results suggest that the isolated DH domain binds to FAD primarily at the isoalloxazine ring of the cofactor, and the addition of ribitol (riboflavin), phosphate groups (FMN), and adenosine nucleotide (FAD) do not further interact significantly with the isolated DH domain. However, the full-length SpNOX appears to interact along the entire length of the FAD cofactor, indicating significant interactions between the FAD and the TM domain. This FAD binding site shared between the TM and DH domains may contribute to the correct placement of the cofactor for electron transfer to the proximal heme. On the other hand, in full length SpNOX the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> appears to be independent of the flavin derivative used, suggesting that the binding interactions between TM and FAD play no catalytic role and that only the isoalloxazine ring needs to be taken into account for the electron pathway from NADPH to the first heme. Finally, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of full length and DH-only constructs are the same order of magnitude, with ratios around 1 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), showing that the presence (or absence) of the hemes in the TM domain has little effect on the rate. It follows that the reduction of FAD -- i.e., hydride transfer from the nicotinamide -- is the rate limiting step in the electron transfer from substrate to O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

Thus, in SpNOX, the NAD(P)H binding energy arises from interactions just in the DH domain with little contribution from the TM domain of SpNOX.

<title>Structural characterization of SpNOX and SpNOXDH : mutation of F397</title>
<p>We obtained large hexagonal crystals of SpNOX (See Figure S5) but with poor diffraction power beyond 5 Å, and only 6 % between 3 to 5 Å, with clear anisotropy. We therefore tried stabilizing mutations based on the work of Deng <italic>et al</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 1999</xref>) in pea FNR, homologous to the NOX DH domain. They showed that the FNR C-terminal Y308 stabilizes the isoalloxazine site of the FAD cofactor and regulates access of the NADP+ substrate to this site; other works extended the discussion of the importance of this residue to the NOX DH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Zhen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kean et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that changing the corresponding residue of SpNOX to W would stabilize FAD binding and inhibit NADPH binding, thereby reducing mobility of the two subdomains relative to each other. Supporting this approach, Magnani et al reported the stabilizing effect in CsNOX of the serendipitous insertion of a Trp that stacks with the FAD isoalloxazine ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Ceccon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Magnani et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, we reasoned that changing the corresponding F residue to S would increase NADPH access to FAD, potentially facilitating crystals with NADPH bound.</p>
<p>Based on sequence alignment (Fig. S1), either of two phenylalanine residues in SpNox, F397 and F399, could correspond to the conserved C-terminal residue in FNR. We mutated both positions to tryptophan in the SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> construct and monitored activity to test their effects. In our standard buffer used for comparing DH with full-length constructs, F399W mutants showed normal activity (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), while F397W mutants showed no activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). We interpreted this to mean that W in position 397 prevents hydride transfer by immobile stacking with the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, while W in position 399 has little effect on hydride transfer. These results indicate that F397 of SpNOX corresponds to the terminal Y of FNR.</p>

<p>We subsequently explored mutations of F397 in both full length and DH constructs of SpNOX. The flavin content of purified F397W is much higher than that of WT, while the F397S is not able to retain flavin in its binding site (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>), consistent with our hypothesis about flavin binding. As displayed in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, in our standard activity conditions, F397W has little or no activity while F397S shows enhanced activity compared to WT. Increasing the NADPH concentration 10-fold resulted in low but significant activity of the F397W mutant (not shown). These results indicate that the W and S mutations of position 397 do not significantly affect the structural integrity of the SpNOX constructs. We used Michaelis-Menten experiments to test the affinity for both NADPH and NADH of F397S mutants of full-length enzyme and DH constructs; such experiments were not possible with F397W because of its very low activity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). F397S mutants show similar results to WT (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) in both constructs indicating that S in this position does not greatly impact affinity for either substrate; this mutation produced an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for both constructs, consistent with the hypothesis that S in this position provides increased access of substrate to the catalytic site.</p>

<title>High resolution structure of the SpNOX Dehydrogenase domain</title>
<p>The use of the full-length SpNOX F397W construct resulted in about 20% of the crystals produced displaying diffraction limits close to 4 Å, with some crystals showing an anisotropic diffraction between 3 and 3.3 Å in a privileged direction of the crystals, as often observed for membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Robert et al., 2017</xref>). Despite the improvement of the crystal quality, the anisotropy precluded resolution without a good model for molecular replacement. However, the soluble SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> domain represents more than 50% of the full-length enzyme, making it a suitable model for use in molecular replacement. We obtained some crystals of both SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> WT and F397W, co-crystallized with FAD. Unfortunately, crystals of the SpNOX F397S mutant with or without NADPH could not be obtained.</p>
<p><italic>De novo</italic> resolution at 1.94 Å of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> F397W was possible because we co-crystallized in the presence of sodium bromide and collected a bromide-SAD dataset (see methods). To solve the SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> WT structure, we used the SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> F397W structure as a model, and achieved 2.5 Å resolution. As expected, SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> presents a typical fold of the FNR superfamily of reductase domain containing two sub-domains, the FAD-binding domain (FBD) and an NADPH-binding domain (NBD) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Both WT and F397W SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> display 3 molecules per asymmetric unit and the two structures are identical. In the asymmetric unit of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> WT, one of the three molecules contains no flavin (Figure S8A). In the asymmetric unit of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> F397W, all molecules of the unit contain a well-defined FAD (Figure S8B). These observations agree with flavin contents observed in solution (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>) and support the hypothesis that the F397W mutant stabilizes FAD binding.</p>

</fig>
<p>In strong correlation with the affinity data obtained for the flavins shown in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the DH domain mainly interacts with the isoalloxazine ring through polar contacts with the protein backbone and a few residues (P234, F235 and S23) belonging to the conserved FAD-1 binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Massari et al., 2022</xref>) (see Figure S1). The DH domain shows almost no contact with the ribitol and adenosine parts of the FAD. With the exception of possible polar contact of the first phosphate group with the backbone of the protein, the rest of the FAD molecule points out into the solvent, in the direction of the missing TM domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>In the wild type, the isoalloxazine ring is sandwiched between FBD residues P234 and F235 on its <italic>si</italic>-face, and the NBD residue F397 on its <italic>re</italic>-face (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Superposition of the different SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> WT molecules from the crystal asymmetric unit shows that the F397 aromatic ring imperfectly occupies the position in front of the <italic>re</italic>-face of the isoalloxazine ring (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), with orientation 40° with respect to the plane of the isoalloxazine ring, and distance at 5.3 Å. In contrast (and as predicted from the homologous FNR structure), the tryptophan of the F397W mutation makes an extensive and much tighter parallel π-stacking interaction at a distance of 3.5 Å from the isoalloxazine ring (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). From these observations, WT SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> could well behave as a flavin reductase, able to use different flavins as substrate through the sole recognition of the isoalloxazine ring. As <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig.3A</xref> shows, the F397W mutant may fix the flavin as a cofactor. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref> shows the sidechains of both the F and W residue overlaid, on which is superimposed a putative binding mode of NADPH based on the pea FNR structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 1999</xref>). Trp at position 397 appears to preclude access of the nicotinamide to the isoalloxazine, preventing direct hydride transfer. Phe in this position, however, leaves more space in this pocket and the sidechain has more degrees of freedom, making it feasible for the nicotinamide to displace it and transfer hydride to the isoalloxazine. These observations most likely explain the drastic difference of activity between WT and F397W; they probably also explain the enhanced activity observed in the F397S mutant which provides even more space near the isoalloxazine (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The increase of the global <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> in the F397S mutant is an additional argument to support hydride transfer as the limiting step in NOX electron transfer.</p>

<title>Structure of full length SpNOX</title>
<p>The high-resolution model of the DH domain of SpNOX allowed resolution of the anisotropic crystals of full length SpNOX-F397W to 3.6 Å.

The density corresponding to the two heme groups is packed in the channel formed by TM helices 2 to 5. The inner and outer heme are respectively coordinated by the imidazole rings of pairs of histidines H69 (TM3)/H129 (TM5) and H82 (TM3)/H142 (TM5), holding them perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vermot et al., 2020</xref>).

<title>FAD binding site in the full length SpNOX: role of the D-Loop region</title>
<p>We observed electronic density corresponding to the FAD cofactor at the interface of the DH and TM domain. FAD binding in the full-length construct preserves the π-stacking interaction with W397 and the interactions with F235 and P234 observed in the DH-only structure. In addition, the full-length SpNOX structure shows that the adenine extremity of FAD is packed in a pocket including the amino acid F399 from the DH domain– providing a potential role for this residue – as well as residues from the D-loop of the TM domain. Indeed, Y122 and R126 could stabilize the adenine ring simultaneously. Y122 interacts through π-stacking with the adenine ring (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). R126 is at a reasonable distance to bridge with the adenine ring and simultaneously a carboxylate of the proximal heme. However, the resolution of the structure makes the accurate positioning of side chains difficult, particularly in this region which displays large electron densities.</p>
<p>To check the validity of our side-chain observations we generated alanine mutants of Y122 and R126 and checked the affinity of several flavins for each mutant (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We determined affinity for NADPH for all mutants; similar affinity in all mutants suggests no effect of these mutations on global enzyme structure (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The results in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows that only the affinity for FAD is impacted by Y122A and R126A, confirming the role of these residues in the interaction with the FAD’s adenine ring, which is missing in the other flavins tested. Y122A diminishes FAD affinity by a factor of 6 and R126A by a factor of 23. This latter suggests that R126 is crucial for FAD affinity; possibly the simultaneous interaction between R125 and both heme and flavin (proposed above) could hold the adenine ring in a position to be sandwiched between Y122 on one side and F399 on the other. Surprisingly, while the position corresponding to Y122 is very highly conserved as an aromatic residue in the full NOX enzyme family, the position corresponding to SpNOX R126 shows a difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the position corresponding to R126 is very highly conserved as an aromatic, while in prokaryotes it is most often a basic residue, although aromatics are not uncommon. The interactions with the TM domain’s D-loop (or lack thereof) provide an explanation for the differences among the affinities of the flavins for the full-length protein (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Access to the distal heme: diverse situations from prokaryotic to eukaryotic enzymes</title>
<p>The FRD found in NOXs but also in MsrQ and STEAP proteins, transfers electrons from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side of the cell. Thus, access of the distal heme is essential to the specificity of the electron acceptor and its product. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> compares the distal heme access of a panel of FRD-containing proteins from prokaryotes and eukaryotes. From the structures available to date, including the present study, some FRDs (MsrQ, SpNOX and CsNOX) exhibit small extracellular loops and free access to the distal heme (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>), while others (NOX2) have long extracellular loops (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>) and sometimes another extracellular domain (DUOX) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>) create a cap that limits access.

In NOX with large caps, the distal hemes are deeply masked, implying that O<sub>2</sub> must diffuse into the protein.

For most of the tunnels identified, bottleneck constriction would require protein dynamics to allow diffusion and the exact pathway for O<sub>2</sub> still remains to be defined.

In addition, an internal pocket in close proximity to the distal heme has been proposed as the site of O<sub>2</sub> reduction through an outer sphere electron transfer mechanism. This pocket is characterized in eukaryotic enzymes by a conserved His and Arg involved in O<sub>2</sub> binding and heme interaction; the residues characteristic of the O<sub>2</sub> reducing center in eukaryotic FRD domains of NOX and DUOX enzymes are not conserved in SpNOX. The importance of the conserved His and Arg in the reducing center pocket of eukaryotes are strongly supported by CGD-induced mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Picciocchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Rae et al., 1998</xref>). A pathological NOX1 variant was used to show that an additional Asn residue, separated from the conserved His by two residues, is necessary for efficient O<sub>2</sub> reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Ward et al., 2023</xref>); this Asn is highly conserved in animal NOX (see Helix 3 motif in Fig. S1) but not prokaryotes. Entry site, tunnel size and reducing center pocket location ensure the selectivity to O<sub>2</sub> as unique electron acceptor for NOXs with large caps.</p>

<p>FRD containing proteins with direct access to the distal heme may reflect more versatility with regard to final electron acceptors. MsrQ, to date the only FRD-containing prokaryotic protein with clearly identified physiological function, provides an interesting case.

The absence of long extracellular loops allows MsrP to dock on MsrQ and to receive electrons directly from the distal heme to its molybdopterin center.

<title>Domain orientation in SpNOX structure: comparison with other NOX structures</title>
<p>The previous crystal structure of a prokaryotic NOX was in fact two independent structures of the separate TM and DH domains of CsNOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Magnani et al., 2017</xref>). With the SpNOX structure presented here we provide the first entire prokaryotic NOX structure, affording a view of the orientation of the TM domain relative to the DH. The importance of the relative orientation of the domains in NOX proteins has been underlined as a critical point in the activation and the efficiency of electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Comparison of the recent structures of an inactive “resting state” NOX2 and of the presumably active “high Ca<sup>2+</sup> state” DUOX1, emphasized the large 49° rotation of the DH domain of one structure relative to the other. This motion leads to a 12.4 Å movement of the FAD, which was suggested as critical for the activation of the electron transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Including SpNOX into this movement analysis is all the more interesting given that SpNOX is constitutively active. Here, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref> shows that in our SpNOX structure, the relative position of TM <italic>vs</italic> DH domain is intermediate between the inactive (NOX2) and active (DUOX) structures. <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref> details the potential intermediate motions of SpNOX: the relative position of SpNOX DH with respect to the inactive state NOX2 DH rotates 13° and translates 5 Å towards the plane of membrane, while the relative position of the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> “activated” state of DUOX1 DH rotates almost an additional 49° and translates an additional 7.6 Å. SpNOX’s domain orientation is much closer to that observed in the NOX2 resting state than that of DUOX1.</p>

</fig>
<p>The relative positions of the cofactors involved in the first steps of electron transfer are highlighted in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>. The distance between hemes in a given FRD domain is invariant; thus, the efficiency of electron transfer depends on two main factors: the distance between the nicotinamide of NAD(P)H and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD, and the distance between the isoalloxazine ring of FAD and the proximal heme. Surprisingly, there is no evident correlation between DH motion from inactive to active state and contraction of the distance between FAD and heme. In fact, this distance actually increases between inactive NOX2 and constitutively active SpNOX, and from SpNOX to ‘activated’ (high Ca<sup>2+</sup>) DUOX. Nonetheless, in all cases these distances, ranging from 7.2 to 10.2 from edge to edge (from methyl group of the flavin ring to the carboxylate of the heme), all remain compatible with biologically relevant electron tunneling probability, calculated as <underline>&lt;</underline> 14 Å. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Page et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>These observations led us to question the paradigm that switching between resting and activated states requires DH motion. The lack of DH motion between the low and the high Ca<sup>2+</sup> state human DUOX1 structures adds further hesitation. The DH domains of these two structures superimpose with a RMSD of 0.246 Å, and the FAD and NADPH of these structures also superimpose perfectly. The distance between the nicotinamide ring of the NADPH and the isoalloxazine ring of the FAD even in the activated DUOX1 structure is surprisingly large for efficient hydride transfer (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>). In line with conclusions from DH homologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hermoso et al., 2002</xref>), our data (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) suggests that the SpNOX F397W sidechain represents the position that would be occupied by the nicotinamide ring of NADPH. The distance between the Trp397 sidechain and the isoalloxazine ring of FAD in our structure is 3.3 Å, similar to the corresponding distance of these moieties in homologous DH domains and suitable for hydride transfer. In the case of DUOX1, it has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2021</xref>) that to enhance hydride transfer, the “high-Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated” state requires ‘tensing’ of the DH from a relaxed orientation, which can be envisioned as the relative motion of the NBD subdomain (containing NADPH) toward the FBD (containing FAD), rather than a large swing or translation of the entire DH domain relative to the TM domain.</p>
<p>These considerations suggest that differences in relative domain orientations in NOXes might represent isoform specificity rather than intermediate activation states. If so, these differences and those of the cofactor distances could fine tune the electron transfer properties and resulting efficiency of ROS production, linking the isoform with its physiological context. In this context, the impact of the lipid environment on domain orientation is suggested by longstanding observations of lipid effects on NOX activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Koshkin and Pick, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Shpungin et al., 1989</xref>) and by the observation of a lipid in the murine DUOX structure that mediates the interaction between the TM and DH domain through a direct connection with the phospho-ADP-ribose part of the NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Sun, 2020</xref>). Structures solved in detergent like ours presented here may be released from interaction with the membrane, increasing flexibility. The question of what happens in NOX2 –whether DH tensing, domain motion, or something else – remains elusive and awaits further structural characterization. In any case the SpNOX domain orientation presented here makes it a rather close model of human NOX2.</p>

<title>A Close-up view of NOX’s NAD(P)H binding domains <italic>vs</italic> the FNR gold standard</title>
<p>The striking difference in distance between NADPH and FAD at the active site (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>) parallels a structural difference between NOX2 and DUOX1 on one hand, and SpNOX on the other. Here we use the well-characterized FNR structure as a basis of comparison for DH domains. The NADPH binding groove has characteristic motifs universally conserved in DH domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Piubelli et al., 2000</xref>) (motifs NADPH1 and NADPH4 in Figure S1); these motifs provide specific contacts with the NADPH ligand, while the critical aromatic in the C-terminal motif is important for FAD stabilization and apparently displaced by NADPH binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kean et al., 2017</xref>). In FNR, the position of the NADPH1 and NADPH4 motifs – representative of the full binding groove for NADPH – are separated from the flavin binding site by a narrow space (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> top left), while in DUOX1 the corresponding space is much wider (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, top right). Superposition of the four DH domains makes it clear that in SpNOX the distance between the binding grooves for the two ligands is short, like in FNR (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> middle left), while the distance between the ligand grooves in NOX2 is longer, like in DUOX1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, middle right). NADPH-binding residues of FNR are mostly conserved in SpNOX (see Figure S11), while the two Arg residues that interact with the 2’-phosphate of NADPH in DUOX 1 are conserved in NOX2, although the side chain of one of those (R446) is not visible in the CryoEM structure of NOX2 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>, bottom left).</p>

</fig>
<p>Although the SpNOX and NOX2 structures lack NADPH, superposition produces an excellent picture of the location of the NADPH in these proteins. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> (bottom) shows that when the proteins are superimposed, the NADPH from pea FNR fits extremely well into the NADPH binding groove of SpNOX and reproduces the short distance between nicotinamide and isoalloxazine seen in FNR. Similarly, the superimposed DUOX1 NADPH fits very well into the corresponding binding groove of NOX2. Even this crude docking with no energy minimization leaves little doubt about the overall NADPH position in SpNOX and NOX2. Our functional characterization of mutants in position 397 strongly support the picture presented here. Of course, new structures for NOX2 and SpNOX in complex with NAD(P)H would be a welcome addition to confirm these observations.</p>
<p>Taking into account the similar interdomain organization and comparable electron pathways (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>) of SpNOX and NOX2, the different topology at the interface of their respective FBD and NBD subdomains would explain the switch from an inactive conformation of NOX2 in its resting state to a constitutively active conformation of SpNOX. This idea is consistent with the idea that electron transfer in the high Ca<sup>2+</sup>-state DUOX1 structure may require a ‘tensing’ motion that brings the two subdomains, and hence their ligand binding grooves, closer together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). The mechanism by which the inactive resting state of NOX2 changes to active, and how this situation fits with the activated state of the DUOX1 structure, remains to be elucidated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The important roles of NOX in human, animal, and plant health and disease explain the field’s focus on eukaryotic NOX. However, prokaryotic NOX’s advantages in production and handling offer opportunities to decipher structural and mechanistic details relevant to the whole family (eg. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Magnani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vermot et al., 2020</xref>)). We present here extensive enzymological characterization of SpNOX activity and also new structural information on both full-length enzyme and the isolated DH. First, the particular effort to optimize conditions for SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> allowed the investigation of the first step of NOX electron transport, hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and Table I). We showed that NADPH and NADH are equivalent electron donors for SpNOX, constituting a significant difference from eukaryotic NOX. Comparison with the full length SpNOX demonstrates that NAD(P)H binding is largely independent from the TM domain, at least in our conditions in which SpNOX is solubilized in LMNG detergent. Comparison of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> obtained from both constructs suggests that the hydride transfer from NAD(P)H to FAD is the rate limiting step in the overall NOX reaction (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Structural and functional characterization of WT and mutant F397W and F397S highlight the critical role of the aromatic at 397: Phe provides flavin isoalloxazine ring interaction and stabilization and also properties that allow entrance of the nicotinamide ring to the active site, similar to the mechanism long accepted in FNR family domains. Parallel analysis of flavin analogs using both DH and full length SpNOX shows that the DH domain alone has no selectivity for flavin type. SpNOX, on the other hand, displays a marked selectivity for FAD with affinity at the nM level, indicating binding contribution from the TM domain. This is supported by interactions visible in the entire SpNOX structure, and a related mutational analysis, highlighting the role of the D-Loop region in the interaction with the adenine ring of the flavin (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>
<p>Structural comparison of NOX structures indicates that accessibility of the distal heme of SpNOX and CsNOX may reflect plasticity in the final electron acceptor, while the inaccessibility of other NOXes may enforce O<sub>2</sub> as a substrate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, this comparison also generates a new conundrum, how to explain hydride transfer in activated states of NOX. SpNOX shares similar domain organization with NOX2, and the orientations and distances between cofactors in the electron transfer pathway are similar (Fig S12 for overlay of both structures). Surprisingly, DUOX1 domain organization and cofactor distances are quite different, raising the possibility that domain organization is isoform specific. Considering the constitutive activity of SpNOX, we believe that the electron pathway as organized in NOX2 is poised for electron transfer, and that the difference in position of the NADPH binding groove could explain the difference between active and inactive states. The “high Ca<sup>2+</sup>” activated state of DUOX1 also displays the distant binding groove suggesting that an additional step might be required to reach an efficient active state. Rather than a global repositioning of the DH, activation of NOX2 may require an internal rearrangement within the DH that brings the NADPH groove closer to the FAD site; a similar rearrangement may be necessary for electron transfer in activated DUOX1. Conformational change within the DH may agree with a previous study concluding that p67<sup>phox</sup>, which activates NOX2, regulates hydride transfer from NADPH to the FAD rather than NADPH binding. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Nisimoto et al., 1999</xref>). In this view, the assembly of p67<sup>phox</sup> with the DH could promote the required rearrangement within the DH domain. However, the resting state of NOX2 has been reported to resist initial binding of NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). This could be a second level of control for NOX2.</p>
<p>During the review process of this work, another group published a pre-print presenting several CryoEM structures of SpNOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubach et al., 2023</xref>). Remarkably, considering the small size of the protein and its solubilization in detergent, they solved several structures from 2.33 to 2.75 Å resolution. Their high-resolution in the TM domain allowed them to improve the orientation of the adenine part of FAD and of the distal heme. However, apart from these adjustments, their Cryo-EM and our crystal structures are essentially the same (residus Y122 of the D loop is stabilizing the adenine from FAD, the distances between the cofactors are the same as well as the access to the active site or the distal heme). The work of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dubach et al., 2023</xref>) includes both functional data and additional structural data that complements ours. For example, they mutated F107, one of the potential aromatic relays for the electron transfer between the hemes. This mutation did not produce any functional impact, supporting the idea of a direct electron transfer from the proximal to the distal heme, although only simultaneous F107 and Y136 mutations would definitively close the interheme “relay” possibility. An important contribution of their Cryo-EM work includes structures of SpNOX with bound NAD(P)H; these fully validate the binding site we anticipated (Fig S11), and confirm the critical roles of residue K250, S348 and Y353 in NAD(P)H binding. In addition, these structures highlight the capacity of the active site to accommodate the F397 side chain, the nicotinamide ring and the flavin ring within the groove where hydride transfer should occur. Their structures document the role of F397 in positioning the nicotinamide core within this groove and in controlling hydride transfer, since the F sidechain is located between the flavin and nicotinamide rings. In one of the NADPH-containing structures, they used a F397A mutation, which mimics the situation in which the F sidechain has moved out from between the nicotinamide and flavin rings, to trap a nicotinamide conformation productive for hydride transfer, approaching 3.6 Å from the isoalloxazine ring. These data are fully consistent with our enzymatic and structural characterization of F397 mutants. Altogether both our structures and theirs strongly support the critical role of F397 in the tuning of the hydride transfer mechanism. Taken together, the observations from both the Cryo-EM and our crystal structures of SpNOX reinforce the need for close proximity of the NADPH and FAD binding grooves for hydride transfer, exemplified in this constitutively active enzyme; this in turn supports our hypothesis, presented herein, that the activated state of <italic>eukaryotic</italic> NOX requires a specific relative motion of the NBD toward the FBD to achieve a productive topology in the DH domain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, SpNOX seems to be a good model of an activated form of NOX2. The molecular tools and structures provided in this work will allow further investigations to understand additional molecular features at work in those fascinating NOX enzymes.</p>

<p>The activity of the purified DH domain was measured under aerobic conditions following simultaneously the oxidation of NAD(P)H (decrease of absorbance at 340 nm, ε = 6.22 M<sup>−1</sup>.cm<sup>−1</sup>) and the reduction of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (increase of absorbance at 550 nm, ε = 21.1 M<sup>−1</sup>.cm<sup>−1</sup>), as a function of time, using a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian).</p>
<p>A typical assay was as follows: 50 mM bis TRIS-propane pH 6.5, 0.003% LMNG supplemented with 200 µM NADPH, 300 mM NaCl, and 5% glycerol, was added to a 2 mm quartz cuvette. Then 0.5 µg.ml<sup>-1</sup> SpNOX<bold><sub>DH</sub></bold> (final) and 10 µM FAD (final) were added, mixing after each addition. For Cyt <italic>c</italic> reductase assay, 100 µM cytochrome <italic>c</italic> was added prior to the addition of the protein. Final assay volume was 500 µl. When full length SpNOX was used alone, not in parallel study with SpNOX<sub>DH</sub>, we used a buffer optimized for activity of the full length enzyme: Tris pH 7, 300 mM NaCl, and 0.003% LMNG.</p>
<p>The inhibition of superoxide production was verified by addition of DPI at a final concentration of 50 µM or Superoxide dismutase (10U) to the reaction mixture after a sufficient time to allow the slope to be characterized in the presence or absence of the inhibitor.</p>

<title>Data analysis of thermostability and activity assays</title>
<p>The results from thermostability and activity assays were analyzed simultaneously using the JMP® statistical software (Version <italic>13.0</italic>. SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, 1989-2019) to plot 2D contour plots of Tm and activity as a function of salt concentrations and glycerol. The median of triplicates was used to compute the graphs, and linear interpolations were done between measurement points to fill the graphs. A 2D linear interpolation was performed on thermostability and activity results as a function of pH and salt concentration using Python® to produce a 3D figure.</p>

<title>Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis for SpNOX and SpNOX<sub>DH</sub></title>
<p>All chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Various NAD(P)H concentrations were obtained by serial dilutions from the saturating NAD(P)H solution in triplicate in a 96-well (flat bottom) Greiner microplate (equilibrated at 25°C). The reaction was initiated (at 25°C) by injection of a mixture of the stabilization buffer (50 mM bis TRIS-propane pH6.5, 300 mM NaCl, 10 µM FAD, 5% glycerol and 0,025 mM LMNG) containing SpNox<bold><sub>DH</sub></bold> (250 ng) and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (100 µM, final concentration) or (50 mM Tris pH 7, 300 mM NaCl, 10 µM FAD and 0,025 mM LMNG) containing SpNOX (250 ng) and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (100 µM, final concentration) and the absorbance at 550 nm was recorded within 3 minutes using a monochromator multimode microplate reader (Clariostar, BMG Labtech) after orbital shaking. Michaelis-Menten saturation curves of SpNOX, initial apparent velocities as a function of NAD(P)H concentration, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (µM), and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (s<sup>-1</sup>) were determined with Prism® software. We determined the kinetic parameters for all flavin analogs using a similar procedure, holding NAD(P)H concentration constant at 200 µM and varying the flavin concentrations; similarly, kinetic parameters of SpNOX<bold><sub>DH</sub></bold> were determined for NAD(P)H based on NAD(P)H oxidation by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm within 3 minutes. Affinity is formally described by <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>, but in the text we use <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> as a “relevant approximation of affinity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Srinivasan, 2022</xref>).</p>

<title>Crystallization of SpNOX DH domains</title>
<p>Crystallization experiments were carried out at the High Throughput Crystallization Laboratory (HTX Lab) at EMBL Grenoble using automated protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cornaciu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dimasi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dupeux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Mariaule et al., 2014</xref>). SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> and SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> F397W were concentrated to 15 mg.ml<sup>-1</sup>. The crystallization experiments were carried out using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method with a crystallization robot (Mosquito, SPTLabtech). 0.1 µL of protein solution and 0.1 µL of reservoir were mixed to equilibrate against 45 µL reservoir solution at 20°C in 96-well CrystalDirect plates (MiTeGen) and automatically imaged in RockImager robot (Formulatrix). Initially, commercially available screening kits from NeXtal (Classic-suite, PEGs, JCSG) and Molecular Dimension (MemTrans, MemMeso, MemGold, PACT, Morpheus) were used to identify initial crystallization conditions that were optimized in subsequent experiments. Optimal crystals of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> grew in crystallization drops with precipitant conditions of 35% PEG-MME500, 0.1M Sodium Citrate pH5. Optimal crystals of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub>F397W grew in crystallization drops with precipitant condition composed of 17% to 20% w/v PEG3350, 0.1M Bis-TRIS propane pH 6.5 and 0.2 M Sodium bromide. Crystals of SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> WT and SpNOX<sub>DH</sub> F397W typically appeared after 24h and reached full size in 7 days with dimensions of respectively 100ξ20ξ10 μm<sup>3</sup> and 80ξ30ξ20 μm<sup>3</sup>. Automated high-throughput crystal cryo-cooling and harvesting were performed with CrystalDirect<sup>TM</sup> Technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cipriani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Márquez and Cipriani, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Zander et al., 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Data collection and structural solution of SpNOX DH F397W</title>
<p>A bromide-SAD dataset was collected at the macromolecular crystallography beamline ID30B of the European Synchrotron radiation facility, equipped with Pilatus3 6M detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">McCarthy et al., 2018</xref>). The wavelength was set above the Br K-edge at 0.9184 Å in order to maximize the anomalous signal, and a highly redundant data set at a resolution of 1.94 Å, including 7200 images with 0.05 degrees oscillation, was collected.</p>
<p>Data processing was performed by the GrenADES parallelproc pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Monaco et al., 2013</xref>) that is based on XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kabsch, 2010</xref>) and scaled using aimless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</xref>) from the CCP4-suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Winn et al., 2011</xref>). Attempts to solve the structure with the molecular replacement method using homologous models failed. Therefore, we experimentally solved the structure by the SAD method, using the bromide anomalous dispersion signal from crystals grown in presence of 0.2M sodium bromide. Experimental phasing and initial model building was performed using CRANK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Skubák and Pannu, 2013</xref>) The final model was obtained by successive rounds of manual and automated refinement using the programs REFMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>), and BUSTER (Bricogne, n.d.).

<p>X-ray diffraction data were collected at ID30A-1/MASSIF-1 beamline at ESRF Grenoble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowler et al., 2015</xref>). A highly redundant data set at a resolution of 2.4 Å, including 3600 images with 0.1 degrees oscillation, was collected.

<title>Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing of full length SpNOX</title>
<p>SpNOX F397W at 4.04 mg.ml<sup>-1</sup> in 50 mM TRIS pH 7, 300 mM NaCl, 0.025 mM LMNG, 0.01 mM FAD was crystallized in 30.5% PEG 300, 0.15 M Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0.15 M NaCl and 0.1 M MES pH 6, using the vapor diffusion method in a 6 µL protein sample plus 6 µL of well hanging drop at 20°C. Hexagonal brick-red crystals were obtained, mounted on mesh litho-loops and flash frozen in native conditions in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at ID30A-1/MASSIF-1 beamline at ESRF Grenoble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bowler et al., 2015</xref>). A dataset of 1800 images was collected with an oscillation range of 0.2° per image and an exposure time of 1.699 s and a crystal to detector distance refined to 500.9 mm. As observed for many membrane protein crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Martin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Robert et al., 2017</xref>), the data collected were very anisotropic going to 3.2 Å resolution in the strongest diffracting direction. After data processing the dataset was finally cut at 3.6 Å to ensure sufficient completeness in the highest resolution shell. Inclusion of further data only resulted in more noise without obvious gain in 2mFo-DFc electron density. Data were initially processed using the program XDS as spherical to the highest resolution possible (3.2 Å) even though spherical statistics were not usable. Staraniso analysis for diffraction anisotropy (<email>staraniso@globalphasing.org</email>) revealed that completeness was 85.4% in the highest resolution shell, therefore revealing that all the data collectable for this crystal had been collected. Data was cut at the diffraction limits suggested by the Staraniso server using only the first 1000 images.</p>
<p>Phases were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>), on amplitudes, with data corrected for anisotropy using Staraniso. The search models were the high-resolution DH domain (PDB 8qq5) and a model of the transmembrane domain obtained using PROMALS3D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Pei et al., 2008</xref>) and I-TASSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Yang and Zhang, 2015</xref>) on the basis of multiple sequence alignment of NOX homologs and validated by structural alignment on CsNOX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Vermot et al., 2020</xref>). The molecular replacement solution was achieved with placing the DH domain first, followed by the TM domain, yielding LLG=91.8 and TFZ=10.9. The phasing resulted in a model with one molecule of SpNOX in the asymmetric unit and the space group P6<sub>4</sub>22. Crystal packing generation showed a sensible solution (classic type II packing of membrane protein and no clash), showing good density for the DH domain and clearly identifiable transmembrane helices, representing a typical initial anisotropic low-resolution map for a membrane protein solved by molecular replacement.</p>
<p>The resulting model was not biologically possible with an obvious error in the positioning of the transmembrane domain, which was inverted by 180° around the longitudinal axis. A new transmembrane domain model was generated on the basis of a sequence alignment between CsNOX and SpNOX and the use of CHAINSAW (CCP4). A new molecular replacement with PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) without modification of the DH domain position resulted in a new orientation of transmembrane domain, which was biologically compatible. Fo-Fc map of the model harbored two positive peaks at 6.1 χτ and 3.6 χτ corresponding to the position of proximal and distal hemes, respectively, sandwiched between two key histidine residues, allowing the sequence assignment of the TM domain. Iterative manual building in COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and LORESTR pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Kovalevskiy et al., 2016</xref>), using TLS (5-183 for TM domain and 184-399 for DH domain) allowed large repositioning of some α–helixes of transmembrane domain. A final comparison of a SpNox model generated with AlphaFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) drove the repositioning of some loops and some sequence shifts in transmembrane helixes not associated with hemes. Final refinement was made with the help of ISOLDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Croll, 2018</xref>) and LORESTR, ramachandran and rotamers outliers were corrected, yielding a final model with R = 26.2% and Rfree = 32.0% that was deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the PDB accession code 8qq7. Crystallographic data statistics are presented in Table S1. The PDB deposition code for the SpNOX F397W is 8qq7.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the properties of prokaryotic NADPH oxidases (NOX) and discuss the implications for NOX regulation and function. The structure of the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Nox protein is an <bold>important</bold> step forward in our understanding of procaryotic NOX enzymes and the characterization and interpretation are <bold>convincing</bold>. The results will be of interest to structural biologists as well as biochemists focusing on enzymatic functions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript describes the crystal structures of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> NOXs. Crystals were obtained for the wild-type and mutant dehydrogenase domain, as well as for the full-length protein comprising the membrane domain. The manuscript further carefully studies the enzyme's kinetics and substrate-specificity properties. Streptococcus pneumoniae NOX is a non-regulated enzyme, and therefore, its structure should provide a view of the NOX active conformation. The structural and biochemical data are discussed on this ground.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is very solid work. The protein chemistry and biochemical analysis are well executed and carefully described. Similarly, the crystallography must be appreciated given the difficulty of obtaining good enzyme preparations and the flexibility of the protein. Even if solved at medium resolution, the crystal structure of the full-length protein conveys relevant information. The manuscript nicely shows that the domain rotations are unlikely to be the main mechanistic element of NOX regulation. It rather appears that the NADPH-binding conformation is pivotal to enzyme activation. The paper extensively refers to the previous literature and analyses the structures comprehensively with a comparison to previously reported structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic NOXs.</p>

<p>The authors describe the structure of the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Nox protein (SpNOX). This is a first. The relevance of it to the structure and function of eukaryotic Noxes is discussed in depth.</p>
<p>One of the strengths of this work is the effort put into preparing a pure and functionally active SpNOX preparation. The protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the purification and optimization of its thermostability and activity are described in detail, involving salt concentration, glycerol concentration, and pH.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>This reviewer would like to compliment the authors for the conscientious revision of the manuscript. Their response to the comments and the detailed explanations of the issues that did not appear clear enough to the reviewer are much appreciated. Their reaction to the review was not only superbly competent but also prominently good natured.</p>
<p>The revised version is perfect and represents a major contribution to our understanding of the molecular details of Nox function. As for the questions not yet answered, I shall quote the authors: &quot;Time will tell&quot;.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript describes the crystal structures of Streptococcus pneumoniae NOXs. Crystals were obtained for the wild-type and mutant dehydrogenase domain, as well as for the full-length protein comprising the membrane domain. The manuscript further carefully studies the enzyme's kinetics and substrate-specificity properties. Streptococcus pneumoniae NOX is a non-regulated enzyme, and therefore, its structure should provide a view of the NOX active conformation. The structural and biochemical data are discussed on this ground.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is very solid work. The protein chemistry and biochemical analysis are well executed and carefully described. Similarly, the crystallography must be appreciated given the difficulty of obtaining good enzyme preparations and the flexibility of the protein. Even if solved at medium resolution, the crystal structure of the full-length protein conveys relevant information. The manuscript nicely shows that the domain rotations are unlikely to be the main mechanistic element of NOX regulation. It rather appears that the NADPH-binding conformation is pivotal to enzyme activation. The paper extensively refers to the previous literature and analyses the structures comprehensively with a comparison to previously reported structures of eukaryotic and prokaryotic NOXs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for these very nice comments about our work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The manuscript is not always very clear with regard to the analysis of NADPH binding. The last section describes a &quot;crevice&quot; featured by the NADPH-binding sites in NOXs. It remains unclear whether this element corresponds to the different conformations of the protein C-terminal residues or more extensive structural differences. This point must be clarified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the referee that our terminology was not very clear. Responding to your comment helped us to improve our explanation: we have changed the text to emphasize the differences we observe in the distances between the FAD binding groove and the entire NADPH binding groove, which includes conserved NADPH-contacting motifs as well as the critical aromatic.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A second less convincing point concerns the nature of the electron acceptor. The manuscript states that this NOX might not physiologically act as a ROS producer. A question then immediately arises: Is this protein an iron reductase?</p>
<p>Can the authors better discuss or provide more data about this point?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The referee has a legitimate point, which was also our first idea. In the initial work on SpNOX, where we discovered bacterial NOX enzymes (see Hajjar et al 2017 in mBio), we evaluated its possible role as an iron reductase. There we showed that SpNOX can reduce CytC directly; however, while some reduction of Fe3+-NTA complex (used classically in ferric reductase activity assay) occurred, this reduction was inhibitable by SOD and occurred indirectly by the superoxide produced, so therefore not a true iron reductase activity. This represents a mixed situation of direct and indirect reduction of an iron-containing acceptor that appears to preclude physiological iron reductase activity since it appears that the protein component of CytC allows it to interact with SpNOX.  As these questions had been already addressed in a previous paper, we did not add anything here and we prefer to underline this possibility of another acceptor and to leave this question open for future works.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors describe the structure of the S. pneumoniae Nox protein (SpNOX). This is a first. The relevance of it to the structure and function of eukaryotic Noxes is discussed in depth.</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses</p>
<p>One of the strengths of this work is the effort put into preparing a pure and functionally active SpNOX preparation. The protein was expressed in E. coli and the purification and optimization of its thermostability and activity are described in detail, involving salt concentration, glycerol concentration, and pH.</p>
<p>This reviewer was surprised by the fact that the purification protocol in the eLife paper differs from those in the mBio and Biophys. J. papers by the absence of the detergent lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). LMNG is only present in the activity assay at a low concentration (0.003%; molar data should be given; by my calculation, this corresponds to 30 μM).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We regret this misunderstanding: our description was not clear enough.  As the referee points out, in previous papers we purified the full length SpNOX with the detergent LMNG. In the current paper, we described only the protocol for SpNOX DH domain variant, a soluble cytoplasmic domain. We have now modified the text to clarify the difference between the purification of fulllength SpNOX variants, which were performed with detergent as cited in Vermot et al 2020, and the purification of DH domains, which are soluble and thus did not require detergent in the purification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In light of the presence of lipids in cryo-EM-solved structures of DUOX and NOX2, it is surprising that the authors did not use reconstitution of the purified SpNOX in phospholipid (nanodisk?).
The issue is made more complicated by the statement on p. 18 of &quot;structures solved in detergent like ours&quot; when no use of detergent in the solubilization and purification of SpNOX is mentioned in the Methods section (p. 21-22).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As stated above, detergent used to purify the full-length version of SpNOX. We did in fact perform some preliminary tests of reconstitution in nanodiscs. Different trials of negative staining studies showed heterogeneous size of SpNOX in nanodiscs and the initial images were not promising. Furthermore, in parallel, we had positive results in crystallography relatively quickly with protein in detergent. We thus focused on refining the crystals, which was a fairly long and mobilizing task; we decided to allocate time and resources to the promising avenue and did not further pursue nanodiscs.</p>
<p>We did not go in theCryo-EM direction because the small size of the protein was initially believed to be a significant barrier to successful Cryo-EM. Perhaps we could have pursued this avenue: while our manuscript here was submitted to eLife, another group deposited a preprint in BioRxiv using CryoEM to solve the structure of SpNOX (see comment below). This structure was solved in detergent so even in this CryEM structure there is no information on the potential roles of lipids as asked by the referee.</p>
<p>In this revised version, we have added a comment, in the last paragraph, in reference to the additional data available today thanks to the other structures generated by this other group (Murphy's group).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Can the authors provide information on whether E. coli BL21 is sufficiently equipped for the heme synthesis required for the expression of the TM domain of SpNOX. Was supplementation with δaminolevulinic acid used</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The production of His-SpNox in E.coli C41(DE3) is without any δ-aminolevulinic acid supplementation. Supplementation was tested but no change was observed regarding the heme content (UV/Visible spectra) so we settled on the purification described by Vermot et al 2020. Initially, for the mBio paper (Haajar et al 2017), we performed heme titrations which gave stoichiometry between 1.35 to 1.5 heme/protein, indicating 2 hemes (these data were not shown). In the end in this work we observed two hemes in the crystal structure, thus confirming that E.coli, at least for this protein, did not need supplementation with δ-aminolevulinic acid .</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The 3 papers on SpNOX present more than convincing evidence that SpNOX is a legitimate Nox that can serve as a legitimate model for eukaryotic Noxes (cyanide resistance, inhibition by DPI, absolute FAD dependence, and NADPH/NADH as the donor or electrons to FAD). It is also understood that the physiological role of SpNOX in S. pneumoniae is unknown and that the fact that it can reduce molecular oxygen may be an experimental situation that does not occur in vivo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>I am, however, linguistically confused by the statement that &quot;SpNOX requires &quot;supplemental&quot; FAD&quot;. Noxes have FAD bound non-covalently and this is the reason that, starting from the key finding of Babior on NOX2 back in 1977 to the present, FAD has to be added to in vitro systems to compensate for the loss of FAD in the course of the purification of the enzyme from natural sources or expression in a bacterial host. I wonder whether this makes FAD more of a cosubstrate than a prosthetic group unless what the authors intend to state is that SpNOX is not a genuine flavoprotein.</p>
<p>We believe there is some confusion between SpNOX – the full length transmembran protein -- and SpNOXDH -- the cytosolic domain only. The sentence pinpointed by the referee was in fact “The strict requirement of FAD addition for SpNOXDH activity suggests that the flavin behaves as a cosubstrate”. This statement was about the isolated cytosolic domain that does not contain the TM part of the protein.</p>
<p>We agree that in WT NOX enzymes (including SpNOX)  FAD is held within the enzyme structure and thus can be considered, by definition, as a prosthetic group. This is supported by the nanomolar affinity for FAD of SpNOX. We did not intend to say that NOX and SpNOX are not genuine flavoproteins.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when isolated, the affinity of DH domain for flavins drops to the µM level. This µM level of affinity does not allow stable maintenance of the flavin in the active site as illustrated by the spectra of Figure 3. This is instead the typical affinity of a substrate or a co-substrate (similar to that of substrate NADPH) that can be exchangeable and diffuse in and out of the active site. The DH domain recognizes and reduces flavins but, as a consequence of its lower affinity, will release to its environment free reduced flavins. Thus the isolated DH behaves as a flavin reductase that uses flavin as substrate. Such enzymes have already been well described (and some of them are of the FNR family). Such enzymes, using flavin as substrate, typically have affinity for flavin in the µM range and share with the SpNOX DH  binding properties centered on the isoalloxazine ring only.</p>
<p>We understand that, in the text, to switch from the SpNOX to the SpNOX DH and for FAD from a prosthetic group to a diffusible co-substrate can be confusing. So, to make it clearer, we modified the following sentences and added references to “some flavin reductases characterization” that could provide support for the reader.</p>
<p>“The strict requirement of FAD addition for SpNOXDH activity and its µM level of affinity suggests that the flavin behaves as a co-substrate rather than a prosthetic group. As an isolated domain, SpNOXDH may work as a flavin reductase enzyme (Gaudu et al, 1994; Fieschi et al 1995; Nivière et al 1996), ..”</p>
<p>We hope that it will help.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>I am also puzzled by the statement that SpNOX &quot;does not require the addition of Cyt c to sustain superoxide production&quot;. Researchers with a Cartesian background should differentiate between cause and effect. Cyt c serves merely as an electron acceptor from superoxide made by SpNOX but superoxide production and NADPH oxidation occur independently of the presence of added Cyt c.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thanks to the referee for pointing out this poor wording. We agree and have amended the text to clarify what we originally meant. It is now:</p>
<p>“SpNOXDH requires supplemental FAD to sustain both superoxide production, which can be observed in the presence of Cyt c (Figure 2A), and NADPH oxidation, which can be observed in the absence of Cyt c (Figure 2B).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The ability of the DH domain of SpNOX (SpNOXDH) to produce superoxide is surprising to this reviewer.The result is based on the inhibition of Cyt c reduction by added superoxide dismutase (SOD) by 40%. In all eukaryotic Noxes superoxide is produced by the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen by electrons originating from the distal heme, having passed from reduced FAD via two hemes. The proposal that superoxide is generated by direct transfer of electrons from FAD to oxygen deserves a more in-depth discussion and relies too heavily on the inhibitory effect of SOD. A control experiment with inactivated SOD should have been done (SOD is notoriously heat resistant and inactivation might require autoclaving).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The initial reports of a NOX DH-domain-only construct (that of human Nox4) producing superoxide are cited in the text. Moreover, natural flavin reductases are known to produce superoxide due to the release of free reduced flavin in the medium.</p>
<p>As explain above, FAD in full length SpNox is a relay for the electrons from NADPH to heme and is internal to the protein and thus devoted to this specific task.</p>
<p>In the case of SpNOX DH, its flavin reductase behavior leads to the release in the medium of free reduced flavin as a nonspecific diffusible electron carrier. It has been already demonstrated that such free reduced flavin can efficiently reduce soluble O2 and be a source of superoxide.</p>
<p>This has been particularly well documented in (Gaudu et al, 1994. J.Biol.Chem). We have added this reference to the text (see the modified sentence in a reply, 2 comments above).</p>
<p>Furthermore, we want to point to the referee that the link between flavin and superoxide production here is not only based on the inhibition by SOD. When we added the flavin inhibitor DPI we observed no more superoxide production from the DH domain (Figure 2C). This supports the role of free-reduced flavin in both the production of superoxide and also part of direct cyt C reduction as observed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>An unasked and unanswered question is that, since under aerobic conditions, both direct Cyt c reduction (60%) and superoxide production (40%) occur, what are the electron paths responsible for the two phenomena occurring simultaneously?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the referee for dedication to a clear understanding of the mechanism used by the SpNOXDH construct. It pushes us to develop a clear description of the mechanism at work here for the readers. Please find below a proposal mechanism describing the electron transfer from NAD(P)H to free flavin that can, as diffusible species, then reduce non-specifically either the O2 or the Cyt.C encountered.</p>

<p>However, it is important to remember that this is not physiological, and rather the result of using  a DH domain isolated from the TM of SpNOX. Nonetheless, it shows that the DH domain is fully functional for NAD(P)H as well as the hydride transfer.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>This reviewer had difficulty in following the argument that the fact that the kcat of SpNOX and SpNOXDH are similar supports the thesis that the rate of enzyme activation is dependent on hydride transfer from nicotinamide to FAD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have amended the text to clarify this point.  If the reaction rate is not affected by the presence or absence of the hemes in the TM domain, this inevitably implies that the rate is NOT limited by the electron transfer to the heme, and ultimately to O2, from the FAD, and thus the hydride transfer step that oxidizes the FAD must be the rate limiting step.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The section dealing with mutating F397 is a key part of the paper. There is a proper reference to the work of the Karplus group on plant FNRs (Deng et al). However, later work, addressing comparison with NOX2, should be cited (Kean et al., FEBS J., 284, 3302-3319, 2017). Also, work from the Dinauer group on the minimal effect of mutating or deleting the C-terminal F570 in NOX2 on superoxide production should be cited (Zhen et al., J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6575-6581, 1998).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out our unintended omission of these important works; we have amended the text and added the citations.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear why mutating F397 to W (both residues having aromatic side chains) would stabilize FAD binding.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a few words, trp’s double ring  can establish larger and stronger vanderWaals contact with the isoalloxazine ring than the phe sidechain. Our discussion regarding this point is extensive in the structural section where we compare the structures with  F and  W in this position. At this time we do not think it is necessary to add anything to the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, what is meant by &quot;locking the two subdomains of the DH domain&quot;? What subdomains are meant?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The two subdomains are the NADPH-binding domain and the FAD-binding domain, which we define on p 11 (“SpNOXDH presents a typical fold of the FNR superfamily of reductase domain containing two sub-domains, the FAD-binding domain (FBD) and an NADPH-binding domain (NBD) “) and which are labeled in Fig. 4.  By “locking” we meant to convey immobilizing them into a specific conformation; we have amended the text to clarify this point.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Methodological details on crystallization (p. 11) should be delegated to the Methodology section. How many readers are aware that SAD means &quot;Single Wavelength Anomalous Diffraction&quot; or know what is the role of sodium bromide?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have amended the text to emphasize the intended point, which is the different origins of the two DH structures: the de novo structure was possible through co crystallization with bromide, and the molecular replacement structure used the de novo structure as a model.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The data on the structure of SpNOX are supportive of a model of Nox activation that is &quot;dissident&quot; relative to the models offered for DUOX and NOX2 activation. These latter models suggested that the movement of the DH domain versus the TM domain was related to conversion from the resting to the activated state. The findings reported in this paper show that, unexpectedly, the domain orientation in SpNOX (constitutively active!) is much closer to that of resting NOX2. One of the criteria associated with the activated state in Noxes was the reduction of the distance between FAD and the proximal heme. The authors report that, paradoxically, this distance is larger in the constitutively active SpNOX (9.2 Å) than that in resting state NOX2 (7.6 Å) and the distance in Ca2+-activated DUOX is even larger (10.2 Å).</p>
<p>A point made by the authors is the questioning of the paradigm that activation of Noxes requires DH domain motion.</p>
<p>Instead, the authors introduce the term &quot;tensing&quot;, within the DH domain, from a &quot;relaxed&quot; to a more rigid conformation. I believe that this proposal requires a somewhat clearer elaboration</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is clear that the distance between the FAD and NADPH shown in the Duox and Nox2 structures is too large for the chemical reaction of hydride transfer. Wu et al used the terms ‘tense’ and ‘relaxed’ to describe conformations of the DH domain corresponding to ‘short distance’ and ‘longer distance’, respectively, between the two ligand binding sites. We quoted this terminology and have amended the text to clarify that we envision a motion of the NBD relative to the FBD, as distinct from a larger motion of the whole DH domain relative to the TM domain.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The statement on p. 18, in connection to the phospholipid environment of Noxes, that the structure of SpNOX was &quot;solved in detergent&quot; is puzzling since the method of SpNOX preparation and purification does not mention the use of a detergent. As mentioned before, this absence of detergent in the present report was surprising because LMNG was used in the methods described in the mBio and Biophys. J. papers. The only mention of LMNG in the present paper was as an addition at a concentration of 0.003% in the activity assay buffers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please see our response to similar points above. Detergent was present for the solubilization of the full-length SpNOX.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The Conclusions section contains a proposal for the mechanism of conversion of NOX2 from the resting to the activated state. The inclusion of this discussion is welcome but the structural information on the constitutively active SpNOX can, unfortunately, contribute little to solving this important problem. The work of the Lambeth group, back in 1999 (cited as Nisimoto et al.), on the role of p67-phox in regulating hydride transfer from NADPH to FAD in NOX2 may indeed turn out to have been prophetic. However, only solving the structure of the assembled NOX2 complex will provide the much-awaited answer. The heterodimerization of NOX2 with p22-phox, the regulation of NOX2 by four cytosolic components, and the still present uncertainty about whether p67-phox is indeed the final distal component that converts NOX2 to the activated state make this a formidable task.</p>
<p>The work of the Fieschi group on SpNOX is important and relevant but the absence of external regulation, the absence of p22-phox, and the uncertainty about the target molecule make it a rather questionable model for eukaryotic Noxes. The information on the role of the C-terminal Phe is of special value although its extension to the mechanism of eukaryotic Nox activation proved, so far, to be elusive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We really thank the referee for the positive comments on our work and the deep interest shown by this careful evaluation.</p>
<p>We understand the arguments of the referee regarding the relevance of our work here to eukaryotic NOX, but we do not share the reservations expressed. While human NOXes need interactions with other proteins or have EF-hand or other domains that control them, SpNOX corresponds exactly to the minimal core common to any NOX isoform. In fact, because SpNOX has only this conserved core, it is unique in that it can work as a constitutively active NOX without protein-protein interactions or regulatory domains. Thus the fundamentals of electron transfer mechanisms of NOX enzyme are present in SpNOX.</p>
<p>There might be some differences in the internal organization from isoform to isoform (as regarding the relative DH domain vs TM domain orientation) but considering the similarity between NOX2 and SpNOX topology we are rather confident that the SpNOX structure will turn out to be a reasonable model of the activated NOX2 structure. History will tell.</p>
<p>In any case, this work on SpNOX allowed us to highlight hydride transfer as the limiting step and also to highlight some structural differences that could be at the source of the regulation in eukaryotic NOX. In itself, we think this is a significant contribution to the field.</p>
<p>We warmly thank both referees for their constructive remarks and their help in the improvement of this manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The manuscript states that the flavin &quot;behaves&quot; like a co-substrate and thereby reports on the Km for the flavins. I feel that this terminology might be confusing. The flavin is unchanged after the reaction, and what matters is the enzyme's affinity for the flavin and the flavin concentration needed to saturate the enzyme (to have it in the fully holo form).</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>See above -- answering many questions from referee2, we have extensively commented on that point (substrate, cofactor, affinity, etc..) and made some adjustments in the text to clarify. We hope it is now satisfactory.</p>

<list-item><p>I could not find the methodological description of the experiments performed to measure the Km for the flavins, and the legend of Figure S4 does not help in this regard. I think that the data (left panels of S4) should be interpreted as binding curves with associated Kd values.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have changed the text to clarify the method used to measure Km for flavins.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A related point is that the manuscript refers to Km as an &quot;affinity&quot;. This is inappropriate and should be avoided, as the Km is not the Kd.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the referee that the Km is not the Kd. However, under the appropriate conditions, to which our experiments conform, Km is accepted as a relevant approximation of affinity (Srinisivan, FEBS Journal, v 289 pp 6086-6098 2022). We have added a sentence to clarify this point and cite this reference in the text.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The environment around the putative oxygen site should be shown. The text indicates that &quot;the residues characteristic of the O2 reducing center in eukaryotic FRD domains of NOX and DUOX enzymes are not conserved in SpNOX.&quot; How does the site look? This point relates to the more general comment above on the oxidizing substrate used by this bacterial NOX.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is a really interesting point that contains many potential biological developments for future studies of this prokaryotic family of NOX enzymes. While we were submitting this work to eLife for evaluation, another group (Murphy's lab) filed a pre-publication in BioRXiv, in which they also solved the structure of SpNOX but this time by CryoEM with an unexpected level of resolution for such a small protein (their paper is not yet published but probably under peer review somewhere). In their work, they made a special effort to identify the O2 reducing center (bacterial NOX sequences alignment, mutation studies, …) They were not able to localize such a site with accuracy. There is also other complementary data between their work and ours. So, we will add a paragraph at the end of the discussion to comment on this parallel work and to emphasize on the complementarity of their studies and what it brings to the final understanding of this enzyme.</p>

<list-item><p>The section &quot;A Close-up View of NOX's NAD(P)H Binding Domains vs the FNR Gold Standard&quot; should be clarified.</p>
</list-item></list>
</disp-quote>
<p>I found it difficult to understand. Is the different conformation of Phe397 creating the crevice?  Could NADPH be modeled in NOX2 and DUOX in the same conformation observed in FNR and modeled in the bacterial NOX? Or would there be clashes, implying the necessity of larger conformational changes to bring the nicotinamide closer to the FAD?</p>
<p>Please see responses above on this point; we have amended the text to clarify. In a few words, we propose that activation in the eukaryotic enzymes would entail NBD subdomain (containing NADPH site) towards the FBD subdomain (containing FAD) through an internal motion within the DH domain. Doing so, they would approach the DH domain topology of SpNOX,  which models  an active state.</p>
