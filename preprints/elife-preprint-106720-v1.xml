<title>Abstract</title><p>While developmental origins are suspected for many adult diseases, the lifespan effects of developmental perturbations have not been well studied. Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (SVD) is a leading cause of stroke and dementia and yet is often an incidental finding in aged patients due to the inaccessibility of brain vasculature to imaging of small vessels. In humans, reduced <italic>FOXF2</italic> is associated with an increased stroke risk and SVD. We use a zebrafish partial <italic>foxf2</italic> loss of function to model its effect on small vessel biology through development and aging. In the zebrafish, <italic>foxf2</italic> is expressed in brain vascular pericytes and promotes vascular stability. We find that the initial pool of pericytes in developing <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants is strongly reduced without affecting the endothelial network. The few brain pericytes present in mutants have strikingly longer processes and enlarged soma. <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after genetic ablation suggesting some recovery is possible. Nonetheless, adult <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brains show regional heterogeneity, with areas of normal pericyte coverage of vessels, but others with severe pericyte depletion. Both pericyte and endothelial morphology is strongly affected in adults. Taken together, <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants fail to generate a sufficient initial population of pericytes and the few pericytes remaining have abnormal cell morphology. Over the lifespan <italic>foxf2</italic>a loss leads to severely abnormal cerebrovasculature. Our work opens new understanding of the progression of genetic forms of human Cerebral Small Vessel Disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Brain microvessels supply billions of neurons and brain cells with required oxygen and nutrients. Pathologies affecting brain microvasculature progress slowly and silently over a lifetime but have devastating consequences from decreased perfusion and vascular destabilization. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) encompasses progressive heterogeneous changes in brain microvessels; it is the most common cause of vascular dementia and a significant contributor to stroke and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Østergaard et al., 2016</xref>). 25% of all strokes are the result of CSVD, yet effective targeted treatments remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Østergaard et al., 2016</xref>). This is in part due to the inability to both detect and assess progressive damage in the brain.</p>
<p>While there are several genes implicated in familial CSVD (i.e., <italic>NOTCH3</italic>, <italic>HTRA1</italic>, <italic>FOXC1</italic>, <italic>COL4A1</italic> and <italic>COL4A2</italic>), there is a lack of suitable <italic>in vivo</italic> models for studying disease development and progression. Research has predominantly focused on <italic>NOTCH3</italic>, but within the last decade, <italic>FOXF2</italic> has emerged as a risk locus involved in CSVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Duperron et al., 2023</xref>). SNPs in the intergenic region between <italic>FOXF2</italic> and <italic>FOXQ1</italic> decrease <italic>FOXF2</italic> expression and significantly increase stroke risk due to the variant decreasing efficiency of <italic>ETS1</italic> binding to a novel <italic>FOXF2</italic> enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Foxf2 promotes mural cell differentiation and vascular stability in the zebrafish brain and is expressed highly in brain pericytes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Brain pericytes interact closely with endothelial cells, contributing to extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation, in addition to providing vasoactivity and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bahrami and Childs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Dave et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Stratman et al., 2009</xref>). In animal models, an absence of brain pericytes results in hemorrhages and accelerates vascular-mediated neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Foxf2 is clearly important for vascular stability across species, as loss of Foxf2 in mice and zebrafish leads to increased brain hemorrhage and alterations in brain pericyte numbers and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Reyahi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Brain tissue from patients with aging-related dementias (i.e. post-stroke dementia, vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease) has reduced deep white matter pericytes and associated BBB disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Ding et al., 2020</xref>) suggesting that pericytes should be examined as mediators of CSVD progression in patients with FOXF2 deficiency.</p>
<p>Genome-wide association (GWA) indicates that carrying a minor allele of an SNP in a <italic>FOXF2</italic> enhancer leads to reduced, but not absent, FOXF2 and is associated with stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). For this reason, we model CSVD using a zebrafish with reduced Foxf2 dosage. Strikingly, while pericytes in embryonic <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants are clearly affected, <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants can survive until adulthood, albeit with a reduced lifespan. How pericytes change across the lifespan while CSVD progresses is unknown.</p>
<p>Here we find that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants have significantly reduced brain pericyte numbers as embryos that do not recover over time. Pericytes in mutant embryos and larvae exhibit morphological abnormalities such as increased soma size, process length and degeneration. We show that processes and soma in the adults are also abnormal, though their morphology differs over the lifespan. Although the initial pool of pericytes is smaller, mutants can regenerate pericytes after ablation. Our analysis suggests that <italic>foxf2</italic> is required within pericytes to modulate numbers but also has a strong effect on morphology. We show that brain pericytes may contribute to the pathological progression of genetic CSVD, starting in embryonic development and continuing across the lifespan. Understanding the early developmental aspects of late-onset vascular conditions like CSVD will aid in the development of effective therapeutic strategies.</p>

<title>Pericyte number is consistently lower in foxf2 mutant embryos and larvae</title>
<p>We have previously described reduced pericyte numbers in <italic>foxf2a</italic><sup>ca71</sup>; <italic>foxf2b</italic><sup>ca21</sup> double homozygous mutants in late embryogenesis at 3 days post fertilization (dpf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Stroke susceptibility in humans is associated with reduced, but not absent, FOXF2 expression. Therefore, to better model progressive cerebrovascular defects that might occur with human FOXF2 deficiency, we developed single homozygous <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants as a model of reduced dosage. Zebrafish <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> genes are the result of genome duplication in zebrafish ∼430 million years ago, and have similar gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Arnold et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Chauhan et al., 2016</xref>). We have detected no difference in function between the two genes, and therefore for this study, we consider <italic>foxf2a</italic> loss of function to be similar to human heterozygous loss of FOXF2 function, a state that is observed in the population in GnomAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2024</xref>).</p>
<p>To understand phenotypic evolution, serial imaging of individual brains of <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants at embryonic stages (3 and 5 dpf), and at larval stages (7 and 10 dpf) was undertaken. Mutants were live-imaged using endothelial <italic>(kdrl:mCherry)</italic> and pericyte <italic>(pdgfrβ:Gal4, UAS:GFP)</italic> transgenic lines. Brain pericytes are closely associated with and extend processes over the endothelium in the midbrain and hindbrain of zebrafish (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-A</xref>’’). In wildtype embryos, the number of pericytes increases progressively from 3 through 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants show significantly fewer pericytes on brain vessels at 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>; mean 21 in wildtype and 10 in mutants). The pericyte deficiency continues through 5, 7, and 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-D</xref>), and although it has variable penetrance, mutant brains with the most pericytes are at best similar to wildtype brains with the fewest pericyte numbers. The same pattern of pericyte reduction is seen <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants from a heterozygous incross suggesting there is no maternal effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E-F</xref>). Abnormal coverage varies among mutant larvae. However, mutants with regional absence in earlier stages, have coverage defects that persist into later stages, suggesting the initial population of pericytes is a key player in extended coverage (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

<p>Double <italic>foxf2a;foxf2b</italic> mutants also have significantly fewer brain pericytes in mutants than wildtype at every stage (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-B</xref>; mean 19 in the wildtype and 9 in mutants at 3 dpf) and have a fully penetrant phenotype (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>). Incomplete penetrance in <italic>foxf2a</italic> single mutants is likely due to variations in <italic>foxf2b</italic> expression among different embryos, as loss of both genes is fully penetrant.</p>
<p>Although we focus on mural cells, Foxf2 is expressed in adult mouse brain endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). We assessed <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> mRNA expression patterns using HCR <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. At 3 dpf, <italic>foxf2a</italic> is co-localized with the pericyte marker <italic>ndufa4l2a</italic> in the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). <italic>foxf2a</italic> also shows low expression in brain endothelium, co-localizing with the blood vessel marker <italic>kdrl</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The expression pattern of <italic>foxf2b</italic> was comparable, with localization observed in pericytes (indicated by <italic>pdgfrβ</italic>) and only weakly in ECs (indicated by <italic>kdrl</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). This is supported by the DanioCell atlas of single-cell sequencing of multiple embryonic stages that shows expression is strongest in mural cells, pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells and low in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Sur et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3</xref>). Thus, while <italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic> are principally expressed in pericytes they have some expression in endothelium during brain development. Pericyte loss or impairment leads to alterations in vascular patterning in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Eilken et al., 2017</xref>). To assess if the endothelial network is affected in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants, we employed a Python workflow using Vessel Metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McGarry et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). We found no statistical difference in total network length between wildtype and mutants at 3 dpf (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>) or hindbrain CtA diameter (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). However, pericyte density (number of pericytes divided by the total network length) is reduced by 40% in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), reflecting the loss of pericytes with no change in vessel network length. Similarly, the coverage of pericytes on vessels (total process coverage from brain pericytes divided by the total network length) is reduced by 39% in mutants (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>). Our data suggests that <italic>foxf2a</italic> depletion predominantly affects embryonic pericytes and not endothelial patterning in developing zebrafish.</p>

<title>Early defects in brain vasculature have lifelong consequences</title>
<p><italic>foxf2</italic> mutant animals can survive to adulthood, albeit with a reduced lifespan (∼1 year instead of &gt;2 years). Are early pericyte deficiencies repaired, or is loss of pericytes unimportant to survival and reproduction, at least to middle-aged adulthood? To understand how early defects in brain pericyte numbers evolve over the lifespan, we dissected adult wildtype and <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant brains (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Gross measurements of standard length (snout to tail) show no significant differences between wildtype and mutants (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>) except for female mutant brain length and width is significantly smaller at 11 months post fertilization (mpf) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C-D</xref>). However, there is no significant difference in the proportional brain: standard length ratio in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants vs. wildtype (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4E</xref>).</p>
<p>To visualize brain pericytes and endothelium in their 3D environment, the dissected brains on pericyte and endothelial double transgenic backgrounds at 3 months post fertilization (mpf), were cleared, stained for GFP and mCherry and imaged using light sheet microscopy. A projected 3D view of the whole brain shows striking defects in pericyte density and coverage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="video1">Movie 1-2</xref>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A-B</xref>). Pericyte morphology is altered, and blood vessel density is visibly reduced in mutant brains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C-D</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We imaged cleared dissected brains at 11 mpf and find similarly striking defects using 3D whole-brain projections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). At the cellular level, pericyte coverage and morphology is altered (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). In the wildtype brain, adult pericytes have a clear oblong cell body with long, slender primary processes that extend from the cytoplasm with secondary processes that wrap around the circumference of the blood vessel. These pericytes form a continuous network of processes to cover the blood vessels in the brain. In <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant adult brains, pericyte soma lose their oblong shape and cell bodies cannot easily be differentiated from processes. Mutant cells also extend thickened linear processes, with no secondary processes encircling the vessels. Mutant pericytes do not form an extensive network with other neighbouring pericytes. We note that there is variable phenotypic penetrance in <italic>foxf2a</italic> adults that is reflective of the incomplete penetrance in <italic>foxf2a</italic> embryos (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>).</p>
<p>To view cellular morphology, we sectioned adult brains and immunolabeled pericytes and endothelium. In wildtype adult brains, we identified three subtypes of pericytes, ensheathing, mesh and thin-strand, previously characterized in murine models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berthiaume et al., 2018a</xref>) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6</xref>). In comparing brain sections from both wildtype and <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants, we observe a reduction in brain pericytes and these pericytes have an unusual morphology. On smaller vessels, mutant pericytes exhibit more linear processes with barely distinguishable soma, markedly differing from the characteristic appearance of wildtype adult pericytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Similarly, <italic>pdgfrβ</italic>-expressing cells on large calibre vessels (mural cells, likely vSMCs) show a drastic alteration in morphology and coverage (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Though mutant embryos do not have evident abnormalities in their endothelium, large, aneurysm-like structures are evident in the adult brain (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7</xref>). These structures also appear to have decreased <italic>kdrl</italic> expression. Thus, both wholemount and sectioned tissue show that brain vascular mural cell number and morphology is drastically impacted in adult <italic>foxf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant brains, with increasing involvement of the endothelium, suggesting a worsening phenotype throughout life.</p>

<title>Morphological abnormalities emerge in the larval brain of mutants</title>
<p>Considering the altered pericyte morphology of adult mutants, we revisited developmental stages to identify when these abnormalities first arise. We analyzed morphology at 3 and 10 dpf using in vivo confocal imaging to understand defects in the cell body (soma) and processes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). We find no significant difference in the soma area at 3 dpf, but at 10 dpf, there is a significant increase in mutant pericyte soma area compared to wildtype (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). In parallel, wildtype pericytes undergo a slight reduction in soma size from 3 to 10 dpf.</p>

<p>The low number of brain pericytes in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants means that distinct pericyte processes can be distinguished and measured. However, in wildtypes, pericyte processes are not easily distinguished. For accurate process length measurements in wildtype we used multispectral labelling with a pericyte-specific Zebrabow transgenic line <italic>(pdgfrβ:Gal4, UAS:Zebrabow)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Pan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Whitesell et al., 2019</xref>). Cre mRNA was injected at the one-cell stage to activate random recombination, allowing us to visualize individual neighbouring pericytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Wildtype processes have a mean length of 81.3 µm vs 102.9 in the mutant at 3 dpf and 96.3 µm vs 147.6 in the mutant at 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Thus, the pericyte process lengths of <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants are significantly increased at 3 and 10 dpf (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>We observed some differences from published analysis of the behaviour of adjacent pericyte processes. In zebrafish development, interactions between adjacent pericytes varied from no contact to slight overlap (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). While direct contact with no overlap is the most common interaction (similar to mouse adult brain pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berthiaume et al., 2018b</xref>)) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>), there are examples of overlap. The average overlap between wildtype pericyte processes at 10 dpf was 5.9 µm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Together, these observations revealed previously unseen pericyte process behaviours in wildtype animals.</p>
<p>To further explore mutant pericyte behaviour, we conducted serial imaging during larval development. Over time, some mutant pericyte processes form disconnected bead-like blebs with cell bodies that disappear over time (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). This pericyte phenotype can occur on vessels with full patency and is not associated with endothelial regression. The bead-like remnants are highly prevalent during larval development in <italic>foxf2a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants but not present in wildtype (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). To visualize process degeneration in real-time, we time-lapse imaged from 4-5 dpf (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). The pericyte can undergo a process reminiscent of cell death with soma blebbing and process degeneration phenotypically resembling neural dendrite degeneration or pruning (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>).</p>

<title>Foxf2a mutants do not have an impaired capacity to repopulate brain pericytes</title>
<p>Zebrafish are known to have regenerative capacity in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Becker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Lepilina et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Otteson and Hitchcock, 2003</xref>), yet <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant embryos that are pericyte-deficient maintain strong brain pericyte defects through aging. We next tested whether <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants lack the capacity to regenerate pericytes. We reduced pericyte numbers in a <italic>foxf2a</italic> heterozygous incross using a cell ablation strategy. Zebrafish expressing <italic>pdgfrβ:Gal4, UAS:NTR-mCherry</italic> and <italic>flk:GFP</italic> transgenes were treated with 5 mM metronidazole (MTZ) at 50 hpf for 1 hour which ablates most pericytes. MTZ is a prodrug substrate that elicits cell death in nitroreductase (NTR)-expressing cells due to its cytotoxic derivatives. We then imaged and counted brain pericytes at 3 dpf (a day after treatment) and 10 dpf (recovery).</p>
<p>At 3 dpf, in the vehicle (DMSO) control group there is the expected significant difference between wildtype and mutant pericyte numbers (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A-B</xref>). Both mutants and wildtypes have a severe reduction in pericytes at 3 dpf post-ablation, and are not significantly different from each other (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). By 10 dpf, pericytes are partially repopulated in both wildtype and mutant ablated groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7C</xref>). Surprisingly, given the initial pericyte number defects in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant embryos, we find no significant difference between any groups (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>; mean 70 in wildtype DMSO treated, 53 in mutant DMSO treated, 43 in wildtype MTZ treated, 33 in mutant MTZ treated). This shows that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants retain their ability to repopulate pericytes following ablation. Thus, while <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes are able to regenerate following induced catastrophic loss, in uninjured animals, the recovery process cannot fully compensate for the depleted pericyte pool in early development.</p>

<title>Dosage sensitivity of Foxf2</title>
<p>The logic for using a reduced dosage of Foxf2 in our studies is to better match the effect of common population variants leading to CSVD. We previously modelled the effect of a high-risk CSVD and stroke-associated SNV on the expression of FOXF2 in human cells, showing that it can reduce expression by ∼50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ryu et al., 2022</xref>). Because there are two <italic>FOXF2</italic> orthologs in zebrafish (<italic>foxf2a</italic> and <italic>foxf2b</italic>), <italic>foxf2a</italic> homozygotes have equivalent FOXF2 dosage as human heterozygotes. Foxf2 is highly dosage sensitive, zebrafish <italic>foxf2a</italic> hets show a significant reduction in brain pericytes, demonstrating a phenotype with a loss of only 25% gene expression. For the phenotypes we examine, <italic>foxf2a</italic> can be incompletely penetrant, while <italic>foxf2a;foxf2b</italic> double mutants are fully penetrant suggesting that variations in <italic>foxf2b</italic> compensate and lead to differences in penetrance. Genetic compensation is common with gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kok et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Rouf et al., 2023</xref>) and would explain variability in disease phenotypes in different individuals with the same mutation.</p>

<title>Impaired embryonic pericyte coverage in Foxf2 deficiency</title>
<p>We show that numbers of brain pericytes are reduced at all stages, embryonic to adult, in <italic>foxf2a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants. We cannot differentiate whether deficient numbers are due to changes in the pericyte precursor population (i.e. <italic>nkx3.1</italic> positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al., 2024</xref>)) upstream of pericyte differentiation, or whether <italic>foxf2a</italic> deficient cells are unable to differentiate into <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> positive pericytes. The deficiency is significant at every stage, including 3 dpf, the earliest time point that pericytes are robustly observed in development. The pericyte deficiency is a primary phenotype, we do not find a significant difference in total vessel network length or hindbrain CtA diameter at 3 dpf in <italic>foxf2a</italic> heterozygotes or mutants. Pericytes provide contractility that maintains basal tone in the embryo from 4 dpf onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bahrami and Childs, 2020</xref>). The result of having deficient pericyte numbers on a normal-sized endothelial network length is that pericyte density and coverage of vessels are significantly decreased. It is intriguing that pericyte process length is increased at both 3 and 10 dpf, and we hypothesize this might be an adaptation to low pericyte number.</p>
<p>A second morphological abnormality of <italic>foxf2a</italic> deficient pericytes is that their soma size is increased at 10 dpf. Pathological changes in soma size have not been observed in brain pericytes and the mechanisms behind hypertrophy remain unclear. Increased neuronal soma size is observed in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or Lhermitte-Duclos disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Dukkipati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kwon et al., 2001</xref>) and is linked to mTor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kwon et al., 2003</xref>). In neuronal populations, moderate soma swelling can be an adaptation for survival, while rapid, drastic swelling indicates imminent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Rousseau et al., 1999</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this occurs in pericyte phenotypes.</p>
<p>Contributing to the reduction in pericyte numbers, we observe degeneration of pre-existing pericytes in <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant but not wildtype animals. This degeneration phenotypically resembles neuronal dendrite remodelling and pruning during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fukui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Greenwood et al., 2007</xref>). Yet it remains unclear if these two distinct populations share similar degeneration mechanisms in response to stress or cellular damage.</p>

<title>Insights on fundamental pericyte process properties</title>
<p>The reasons behind the hypergrowth of pericyte processes in <italic>foxf2a<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutant brains is unclear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berthiaume et al (2018a)</xref> propose that repulsive interactions among pericytes in the adult brain establish boundaries between adjacent pericytes, preventing their processes from overlapping. In this case, one might hypothesize that <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutant pericytes would lack the inhibitory signals normally provided by neighbouring pericytes during essential stages of development, leading to uncontrolled growth.</p>
<p>In mice, adult brain pericytes form a non-overlapping network along capillaries, although their processes occasionally approach each other without overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Berthiaume et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Hill et al., 2015</xref>). Pericyte processes have not been studied in zebrafish or the developing brain. Strikingly, using multispectral (Zebrabow) labelling, we find that there is process overlap in the developing zebrafish brain. Overlaps occur on capillary segments and at branch points.</p>
<p>Previous studies in mice were in the adult mouse brain, and it is possible that overlapping processes in the developing brain could be transient, zebrafish-specific, or they could have been overlooked in the mouse experiments. Testing how pericyte process interactions change during the lifespan would provide insights into the differences observed between these studies.</p>
<p>We have also observed forked extensions at the tips of some pericyte projections at 10 dpf in wildtype embryos, where pericytes are not in contact. Whether these unique structures are involved in attractive/repulsive signals between pericytes or help determine the direction and extent of process growth is unclear, but understanding the fundamental mechanisms governing pericyte-pericyte process interactions would yield valuable insights into development and disease.</p>

<title>Changes in foxf2a mutants across the lifespan</title>
<p>In adult brains, hypertrophic pericyte soma are no longer present; rather, soma take on very unusual, ‘stiff’ shapes and become almost indistinguishable from processes. The adult processes are more linear and shorter than embryonic processes. This may indicate that hypertrophic pericytes do not survive to adulthood or that they change their morphology over time. Given the limited knowledge in this area, the underlying factors driving this shift in pericyte morphology are unclear. Actin is present near the plasma membrane of cells, where it provides structural and mechanical support to allow for motility and determine structure. Given the abnormal shapes of adult pericytes, alterations in actin may contribute to their irregular morphology.</p>
<p>In the adult brain, abnormal <italic>pdgfrβ</italic>-expressing cells are observed on large-calibre vessels and likely represent vSMCs. These cells are also found in regions with aneurysm-like vessels, suggesting that vSMCs may lose functionality over time, leading to increased vulnerability of underlying vessels to dilation and weakening. Loss of <italic>acta2</italic> and, subsequently, vSMCs, has been associated with conditions such as thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Guo et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that loss of <italic>foxf2</italic> in small vessels potentially leads to compensatory mechanisms affecting vSMC structure and function as the organism matures.</p>
<p>In embryonic <italic>foxf2</italic> mutants, brain vessel diameter and network length are not significantly altered. However, abnormalities in vessel organization and <italic>kdrl</italic> expression are evident by adulthood. Our data suggests that <italic>foxf2</italic> deficiency contributes to cumulative vascular defects, further emphasizing the importance of this gene in maintaining proper brain vessel function and organization.</p>

<title>Initial pericyte pool and lifelong vascular health</title>
<p>We genetically ablated pericytes to test the ability for pericyte recovery. Surprisingly, there is no significant difference in pericyte numbers between ablated and non-ablated groups, nor between wild-type and mutant fish, and cells do not appear to be morphologically different, even with severe ablation. Thus, when placed under stress, <italic>foxf2a</italic> mutants can regenerate a portion of their pericytes; yet, under baseline conditions, they remain deficient. Our lab recently demonstrated that pericyte precursors are labeled by <italic>foxf2a</italic> before the establishment of well-known markers such as <italic>pdgfrβ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Ahuja et al., 2024</xref>). This raises the question of whether the original pericyte precursor pool has intrinsic defects due to the absence of <italic>foxf2a</italic> that is essential in the normal development of these cells. Determining whether there is a critical period for pericyte development—and whether early interventions could mitigate these deficits—will be key to understanding cerebrovascular resilience and potential therapeutic strategies. Our findings indicate that reduced <italic>foxf2a</italic> dosage leads to long-term cerebrovascular defects that arise early in development and persist throughout the lifespan, with early and late phenotypes with different morphologies. Further research into pericyte development, signaling pathways, and the impact of early vascular defects on disease progression will be crucial for developing strategies to prevent or treat cerebrovascular conditions.</p>

<p>All pericyte metrics were analyzed using the Fiji counting or tracing tool on flattened Z-stacks from confocal images of the whole zebrafish head. Pericyte counting and analysis were restricted to the mid and hindbrain regions for all metrics. For pericyte process lengths, individual processes extending from one soma were measured and added together to determine the total process length per pericyte in µm. In instances where two processes appeared to merge or cover the same blood vessel, half of the total length was added to each pericyte. For Zebrabow images, only pericytes with processes distinguishable from neighbouring pericytes were measured. For soma size, individual cell bodies were traced, and the area was determined by the software in µm<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Vessel Metrics</title>
<p>Confocal images were analyzed using the Python-based software tool Vessel Metrics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">McGarry et al., 2024</xref>). In general, the total vessel network length was measured starting from below the middle cerebral vein (MCeV) and dorsal longitudinal vein (DLV) until the emergence of the basal communicating artery (BCA). Vessels included in measurements as follows: middle mesencephalic central arteries (MMCtAs), posterior mesencephalic central arteries (PMCtAs), the primordial hindbrain channels (PHBCs) and the posterior region of the basilar artery (BA).</p>
<p>The forebrain vessels (i.e. anterior cerebral veins (ACeVs) were not included). Blood vessel diameter was restricted to the horizontal hindbrain central arteries (CtAs), which were comparable between all images.</p>

<sec id="s5a">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All statistical analysis was completed using GraphPad Prism 10 software, with significance resulting from a p-value of &lt;0.05. Statistical tests conducted are included in figure captions. The D’Agostino-Pearson test was used to assess the normality of data sets, and in cases where the data did not pass the normality test, non-parametric statistics were used. Experimental N’s are located in Appendix A. Results are expressed on graphs as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Only significant p-values are indicated.</p>

<p>This study presents <bold>valuable</bold> findings that advance our understanding of mural cell dynamics and vascular pathology in a zebrafish model of cerebral small vessel disease. The authors provide <bold>compelling</bold> evidence that partial loss of foxf2 function leads to progressive, cell-intrinsic defects in pericytes and associated endothelial abnormalities across the lifespan, leveraging powerful in vivo imaging and genetic tools. The strength of evidence could be further improved by additional mechanistic insight and quantitative or lineage-tracing analyses to clarify how pericyte number and identity are affected in the mutant model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The paper by Graff et al. investigates the function of foxf2 in zebrafish to understand the progression of cerebral small vessel disease. The authors use a partial loss of foxf2 (zebrafish possess two foxf2 genes, foxf2a and foxf2b, and the authors mainly analyze homozygous mutants in foxf2a) to investigate the role of foxf2 signaling in regulating pericyte biology. They find that the number of pericytes is reduced in foxf2a mutants and that the remaining pericytes display alterations in their morphologies. The authors further find that mutant animals can develop to adulthood, but that in adult animals, both endothelial and pericyte morphologies are affected. They also show that mutant pericytes can partially repopulate the brain after genetic ablation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is well written and easy to follow.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The results are mainly descriptive, and it is not clear how they will advance the field at their current state, given that a publication on mice has already examined the loss of foxf2 phenotype on pericyte biology (Reyahi, 2015, Dev. Cell).</p>
<p>(1) Reyahi et al. showed that loss of foxf2 in mice leads to a marked downregulation of pdgfrb expression in perivascular cells. In contrast to expectation, perivascular cell numbers were higher in mutant animals, but these cells did not differentiate properly. The authors use a transgenic driver line expressing gal4 under the control of the pdgfrb promoter and observe a reduction in pericyte (pdgfrb-expressing) cells in foxf2a mutants. In light of the mouse data, this result might be due to a similar downregulation of pdgfrb expression in fish, which would lead to a downregulation of gal4 expression and hence reduced labelling of pericytes. The authors show a reduction of pdgfrb expression also in zebrafish in foxf2b mutants (Chauhan et al., The Lancet Neurology 2016). It would be important to clarify whether, also in zebrafish, foxf2a/foxf2b mutants have reduced or augmented numbers of perivascular cells and how this compares to the data in the mouse. The authors should perform additional characterization of perivascular cells using marker gene expression (for a list of markers, see e.g., Shih et al. Development 2021) and/or genetic lineage tracing.</p>
<p>(2) The authors motivate using foxf2a mutants as a model of reduced foxf2 dosage, &quot;similar to human heterozygous loss of FOXF2&quot;. However, it is not clear how the different foxf2 genes in zebrafish interact with each other transcriptionally. Is there upregulation of foxf2b in foxf2a mutants and vice versa? This is important to consider, as Reyahi et al. showed that foxf2 gene dosage in mice appears to be important, with an increase in foxf2 gene dosage (through transgene expression) leading to a reduction in perivascular cell numbers.</p>
<p>(3) Figures 3 and 4 lack data quantification. The authors describe the existence of vascular defects in adult fish, but no quantifiable parameters or quantifications are provided. This needs to be added.</p>
<p>(4) The analysis of pericyte phenotypes and morphologies is not clear. On page 6, the authors state: &quot;In the wildtype brain, adult pericytes have a clear oblong cell body with long, slender primary processes that extend from the cytoplasm with secondary processes that wrap around the circumference of the blood vessel.&quot; Further down on the same page, the authors note: &quot;In wildtype adult brains, we identified three subtypes of pericytes, ensheathing, mesh and thin-strand, previously characterized in murine models.&quot; In conclusion, not all pericytes have long, slender primary processes, but there are at least three different sub-types? Did the authors analyze how they might be distributed along different branch orders of the vasculature, as they are in the mouse? Which type of pericyte is affected in foxf2a mutant animals? Can the authors identify the branch order of the vasculature for both wildtype and mutant animals and compare which subtype of pericyte might be most affected? Are all subtypes of pericytes similarly affected in mutant animals? There also seems to be a reduction in smooth muscle cell coverage.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding pericyte regeneration data (Figure 7): Are the values in Figure 7D not significantly different from each other (no significance given)?</p>
<p>(6) In the discussion, the authors state that &quot;pericyte processes have not been studied in zebrafish&quot;. Ando et al. (Development 2016) studied pericyte processes in early zebrafish embryos, and Leonard et al. (Development 2022) studied zebrafish pericytes and their processes in the developing fin.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study investigates the developmental and lifelong consequences of reduced foxf2 dosage in zebrafish, a gene associated with human stroke risk and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). The authors show that a ~50% reduction in foxf2 function through homozygous loss of foxf2a leads to a significant decrease in brain pericyte number, along with striking abnormalities in pericyte morphology-including enlarged soma and extended processes-during larval stages. These defects are not corrected over time but instead persist and worsen with age, ultimately affecting the surrounding endothelium. The study also makes an important contribution by characterizing pericyte behavior in wild-type zebrafish using a clever pericyte-specific Brainbow approach, revealing novel interactions such as pericyte process overlap not previously reported in mammals.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This work provides mechanistic insight into how subtle, developmental changes in mural cell biology and coverage of the vasculature can drive long-term vascular pathology. The authors make strong use of zebrafish imaging tools, including longitudinal analysis in transgenic lines to follow pericyte number and morphology over larval development, and then applied tissue clearing and whole brain imaging at 3 and 11 months to further dissect the longitudinal effects of foxf2a loss. The ability to track individual pericytes in vivo reveals cell-intrinsic defects and process degeneration with high spatiotemporal resolution. Their use of a pericyte-specific Zebrabow line also allows, for the first time, detailed visualization of pericyte-pericyte interactions in the developing brain, highlighting structural features and behaviors that challenge existing models based on mouse studies. Together, these findings make the zebrafish a valuable model for studying the cellular dynamics of CSVD.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the findings are compelling, several aspects could be strengthened. First, quantifying pericyte coverage across distinct brain regions (forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain) would clarify whether foxf2a loss differentially impacts specific pericyte lineages, given known regional differences in developmental origin, with forebrain pericytes being neural crest-derived and hindbrain pericytes being mesoderm-derived. Second, measuring foxf2b expression in foxf2a mutants would better support the interpretation that total FOXF2 dosage is reduced in a graded fashion in heterozygote and homozygote foxf2a mutants. Finally, quantifying vascular density in adult mutants would help determine whether observed endothelial changes are a downstream consequence of prolonged pericyte loss. Correlating these vascular changes with local pericyte depletion would also help clarify causality.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The goal of the work by Graff et al. is to model CSVD in the zebrafish using foxf2a mutants. The mutants show loss of cerebral pericyte coverage that persists through adulthood, but it seems foxf2a does not regulate the regenerative capacity of these cells. The findings are interesting and build on previous work from the group. Limitations of the work include little mechanistic insight into how foxf2a alters pericyte recruitment/differentiation/survival/proliferation in this context, and the overlap of these studies with previous work in fox2a/b double mutants. However, the data analysis is clean and compelling, and the findings will contribute to the field.</p>
