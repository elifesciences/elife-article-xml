<title>Abstract</title><p>In animals, mitosis involves the breakdown of the nucleus. The reassembly of a nucleus after mitosis requires the reformation of the nuclear envelope around a single mass of chromosomes. This process requires Ankle2 which interacts with PP2A and promotes the function of Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF). Upon dephosphorylation, BAF dimers cross-bridge chromosomes and bind lamins and transmembrane proteins of the reassembling nuclear envelope. How Ankle2 functions in mitosis is incompletely understood. Using a combination of approaches in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, along with structural modeling, we show for the first time that Ankle2 is a regulatory subunit of PP2A, explaining how it promotes BAF dephosphorylation. In addition, we discovered that Ankle2 interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum protein Vap33, which is required for Ankle2 localization at the reassembling nuclear envelope during telophase. We identified the interaction sites of PP2A and Vap33 on Ankle2. Through genetic rescue experiments, we show that the Ankle2/PP2A interaction is essential for the function of Ankle2 in nuclear reassembly and that the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction also promotes this process. Our study sheds light on the molecular mechanisms of post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum is not merely a source of membranes in the process, but also provides localized enzymatic activity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In animal cells, the disassembly of the nucleus during mitosis allows the segregation of the genetic material via the spindle apparatus, composed of cytoplasmic microtubules and centrosomes. However, this process of open mitosis complicates the transition from mitosis to interphase, as a new nucleus must reassemble around each set of segregated chromosomes. The mechanisms of nuclear reassembly after mitosis remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Hampoelz and Baumbach, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Kono and Shimi, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>The nuclear envelope (NE) is a double membrane that is topologically continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>). The NE is associated with multiple structural proteins that connect it to chromatin and cytoskeleton. Lamins form a semi-rigid cage-like network between chromatin and the inner nuclear membrane while the Barrier-to-Autointegration Factor (BAF) interacts with DNA, Lamins, and transmembrane LEM-Domain proteins within the inner nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sears and Roux, 2020</xref>). Nuclear pore complexes composed of multiple nucleoporins ensure transport across the NE and also interact with structural cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Goldberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Petrovic et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Shevelyov, 2023</xref>). In addition, the LINC complex spans the entire NE to connect chromatin to the cytoskeleton and relay mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Hieda, 2019</xref>). During mitotic entry, the phosphorylation of many of these proteins disrupts their interactions, resulting in nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Archambault et al., 2022</xref>). BAF is phosphorylated by Vaccinia-Related Kinases (VRKs, NHK-1/Ballchen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) at its N-terminus, which impedes its binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Lancaster et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nichols et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, CDK1, PKC and PLK1 phosphorylate Lamins A/C and B, disrupting their polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Liu and Ikegami, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Velez-Aguilera et al., 2020</xref>). As a result of NEB, NE membranes retract into the ER during mitosis.</p>
<p>Correct reassembly of the nucleus after mitosis is critical for cell viability and physiology. During this process, segregated chromosomes gather together and ER membranes are recruited around chromosomes to rebuild the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Deolal et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Schellhaus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Ungricht and Kutay, 2017</xref>). Failure to group chromosomes into a single nucleus results in micronuclei that are prone to rupture and DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). The timely reformation of the nuclear envelope is essential for reestablishing nucleocytoplasmic transport that is needed for the entire gene and protein expression process, including transcription, mRNA export and ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alberts et al., 2015</xref>). Protein Phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylate several proteins to promote their interactions and reassociation with the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Archambault et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Huguet et al., 2019</xref>). How the activities of the enzymes are coordinated in time and space is incompletely understood.</p>
<p>BAF plays a central role in nuclear reassembly. It forms a dimer that binds DNA after anaphase, thereby cross-linking chromosomes into a single cohesive mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). BAF also promotes the recruitment of ER membranes through its interactions with LEM-Domain proteins, and aids in the reassembly of the Lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haraguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>). The dephosphorylation of BAF is required for its recruitment to segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Archambault et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Sears and Roux, 2020</xref>). The B55 regulatory subunit of PP2A promotes this regulation in various organisms, including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, the PP2A-interacting, ER-localized protein Ankle2 is also required for the recruitment of BAF to segregated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Snyers et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, Ankle2/LEM4 contains Ankyrin repeats, a LEM domain, a transmembrane domain, and other predicted structured and unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which Ankle2 functions in nuclear reassembly are unclear (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Mutations in ANKLE2 are associated with microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). The requirement for Ankle2 in the development of the central nervous system was initially discovered through its targeting by the microcephaly-causing Zika virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Ankle2 is required for asymmetric divisions in larval neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Link et al., 2019</xref>). While Ankle2 impacts the asymmetric division protein machinery, it remains unclear whether the loss of its function in nuclear reassembly also contributes to microcephaly.</p>

<p>To investigate Ankle2 molecular functions, we conducted studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We found that Ankle2 forms a complex with the PP2A structural and catalytic subunits, in a mutually exclusive manner with other known regulatory subunits. Our phosphoproteomic analysis validates that BAF dephosphorylation depends on Ankle2. We also identified and characterized a novel interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33, a VAP family protein that promotes Ankle2 localization to the ER during both nuclear reassembly and interphase. We show that the interactions of Ankle2 with PP2A and Vap33 promote BAF recruitment to chromosomes after anaphase. Moreover, the Ankle2/PP2A interaction is essential for post-mitotic nuclear reassembly and development <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that Ankle2 functions as a novel PP2A regulatory subunit required for BAF dephosphorylation, and that Vap33-dependent anchoring of Ankle2 to the ER promotes this function in a localized manner during post-mitotic nuclear reassembly.</p>

<title>Ankle2 interacts with PP2A through its Ankyrin domain</title>
<p>To investigate the molecular functions of Ankle2, we sought to identify its interaction partners. First, we generated D-Mel (D.mel2) stable cell lines expressing GFP-fused Ankle2 (N or C terminal). We performed GFP affinity purifications on lysate of these cells and identified co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry. Cells expressing Flag-GFP were used as control. We found that PP2A-29B (PP2A-A, structural) and Microtubule Star (Mts, PP2A-C, catalytic) were specifically co-purified with both GFP-Ankle2 and Ankle2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1A-B</xref> and Table S1). To test if this association occurs <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated transgenic flies for the expression and purification of Ankle2-GFP in early embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). The maternal driver matα4-GAL-VP16 was used to activate the expression of UASp-Ankle2-GFP in late oocytes and syncytial embryos. Embryos expressing GFP alone were used as control. Again, we found PP2A-29B and Mts specifically co-purified with Ankle2-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C-D</xref> and Table S2). Reciprocally, endogenous Ankle2 was co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP from cells in culture and embryos, along with the regulatory subunits Tws, Wdb and Wrd (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1C-D</xref> and Tables S2, S3). Thus, the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A is conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>To map the region of Ankle2 that binds PP2A, we used a GST pulldown assay. We produced GST-fused fragments of Ankle2 covering its entire sequence in <italic>E. coli</italic> and tested their ability to pulldown PP2A-29B (with GFP-fused to either end) and Mts from D-Mel cells. We initially found that a fragment comprising amino acid (a.a.) residues 275-450 was sufficient to strongly associate with PP2A-29B and Mts, while fragments 1-274, 451-909 or 910-1174 showed no or very weak association with these proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G-H</xref>). The 275-450 region comprises most of the Ankyrin domain. This domain was recently proposed to span a.a. residues 229-399 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>), and our inspection of a structural model generated by AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>) suggested a.a. residues 227-400. We found that the Ankyrin domain (a.a. 227-400 tested) was sufficient for association with PP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig S1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">1H</xref>). To test if the Ankyrin domain region is required for the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A, we used a co-purification assay in D-Mel cells. Ankle2-GFP WT or with a deletion of the Ankyrin domain were purified and the presence of co-purified PP2A-29B-Myc and Mts was probed by Western blot. In this assay, we deleted a region comprising the predicted Ankyrin domain plus a few additional downstream residues showing conservation with human Ankle2 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Lem-4L; (ΔANK: residues 232-415 deleted; S1F). We found that PP2A-29B-Myc and Mts were co-purified with Ankle2<sup>WT</sup>-GFP but not with Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1I</xref>). We conclude that the region of Ankle2 comprising the Ankyrin domain is necessary and sufficient to bind the PP2A-29B/Mts complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Ankle2 functions as a PP2A regulatory subunit to promote BAF dephosphorylation</title>
<p>We hypothesized that Ankle2 functions as a regulatory protein required for PP2A to dephosphorylate some of its substrates. We previously showed that the knockdown of Ankle2 results in the hyperphosphorylation of BAF in its N-terminus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). To identify sites that become hyperphosphorylated in the absence of Ankle2, we used a phosphoproteomic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Emond-Fraser et al., 2023</xref>). We transfected D-Mel cells with dsRNA against Ankle2 or dsRNA Non-Target (NT). Four days later, cells were lysed, proteins were digested with trypsin and phosphopeptides were enriched, and analyzed by quantitative mass spectrometry. Among hyperphosphorylated peptides upon Ankle2 depletion, we found the expected BAF peptide phosphorylated at Thr4 and Ser5 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Phosphorylation at the orthologous sites in human BAF was shown to negatively regulate its ability to interact with DNA, and possibly with LEM-Domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nichols et al., 2006</xref>). Our observation of these Ankle2-dependent sites in BAF validates our approach since BAF is the only reported protein whose phosphorylation state depends on Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, BAF appears to be the only obligatory substrate of Ankle2-dependent dephosphorylation for cell proliferation as lowering the dose of the BAF kinase NHK-1/Ballchen rescues wing development defects caused by the partial depletion of Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Nevertheless, we identified several additional hyperphosphorylated sites in other proteins upon Ankle2 knockdown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and Table S5). Although it is likely that some of the hyper- and hypophosphorylated sites observed reflect indirect alterations of cell physiology upon Ankle2 depletion, our results point at several candidate proteins whose dephosphorylation may depend on Ankle2.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that Ankle2 functions as a regulatory subunit of PP2A. Interestingly, the structural (PP2A-29B) and catalytic (Mts) subunits of PP2A were detected in complex with Ankle2, while none of the known regulatory subunits of PP2A were detected (Tws, Wdb, Wrd or PR72) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1B</xref> and Tables S1, S2). To test if Ankle2 interacts with PP2A as a regulatory subunit, we used a competition assay (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). We co-transfected cells with Ankle2-Myc and PP2A-29B-GFP or FLAG-GFP. We then proceeded to GFP affinity purifications. As expected, Ankle2-Myc was co-purified specifically with PP2A-29B-GFP. The PP2A regulatory subunit Tws was also co-purified specifically with PP2A-29B-GFP. To test if Tws and Ankle2 are mutually exclusive in the PP2A complex, we co-transfected increasing amounts of Myc-Tws plasmid along with Ankle2-Myc and PP2A-29B-GFP. As a result, increasing amounts of Myc-Tws were co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP. Conversely, decreasing amounts of Ankle2-Myc were co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP as the amount of Myc-Tws increased. These results suggest that Tws competes with Ankle2 for binding within the PP2A holoenzyme and reinforce the idea that Ankle2 functions as <italic>bona fide</italic> regulatory subunit of PP2A.</p>
<p>To contextualize and interpret our results, we generated structural predictions of relevant co-complexes using AlphaFold3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>). In models of a complex of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2, PP2A-29B and Mts, the Ankyrin domain consistently directly interacts with Mts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref> shows a representative model), consistent with our pulldown results (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">S1E</xref>). Interestingly, these models also predict that additional regions of Ankle2 engage in interactions with PP2A. A region previously referred to as the Caulimovirus Domain (CD, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) and proposed to mediate an interaction with PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>) is indeed predicted to interact with Mts, on the other side from where the Ankyrin domain binds. Moreover, the modeling shows an adjacent uncharacterized domain (UNC) that is in direct contact with PP2A-29B. However, no interaction with Mts or PP2A-29B was experimentally detected for our GST-fused fragments comprising these regions alone in pulldown assays. It is possible that the UNC and CD domains interact with the PP2A subunits with low affinity. It is also possible that the fragment tested requires additional components to fold into a form that is competent for PP2A binding; in particular, AlphaFold3 predictions show that the complete UNC domain may be made of several segments distal in primary sequence (a.a. residues ∼401-467 + 601-682 + 987-1050). In any case, the deletion of the Ankyrin domain of Ankle2 strongly abrogated its formation of a complex with Mts and PP2A-29B, indicating that it plays a predominant role in the formation of the complex. Importantly, these models display Ankle2 occupying an overlapping position to that of Tws in an analogous PP2A-Tws model (which itself consistent with a crystal structure of human PP2A-B55 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Xu et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-E</xref>). These models account for the mutually exclusive binding of Ankle2 or Tws to the PP2A-29B/Mts complex, and are consistent with the function of Ankle2 as a regulatory subunit of PP2A.</p>

<title>Ankle2 interacts with Vap33 and they colocalize at the endoplasmic reticulum</title>
<p>Besides PP2A, we discovered that Ankle2 interacts with Vap33, an integral protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and a member of the VAP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kamemura and Chihara, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Murphy and Levine, 2016</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Mass spectrometry data suggested that Vap33 was co-purified at the highest levels among Ankle2 interactors. Ankle2 was previously reported to localize at the ER and the NE in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Link et al., 2019</xref>). We found that Ankle2-RFP co-localizes with GFP-Vap33 in D-Mel cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and Video S1). This co-localization is clearest during mitosis, where both proteins are enriched around the presumed spindle in metaphase and around segregated chromosomes in late anaphase/telophase, when NE reassembly takes place. To examine the localization of Ankle2 relative to Vap33 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated transgenic flies for the inducible expression of Ankle2-GFP and RFP-Vap33. We expressed the fusion proteins in syncytial embryos and studied their localization. We found that both proteins co-localized throughout the cell cycle (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and Video S2). In interphase, they localized to the NE and ER membranes. During mitosis, Ankle2-GFP and RFP-Vap33 became enriched on the spindle envelope until they wrapped around newly forming nuclei in telophase. In addition, both proteins were also enriched at the midbody of the central spindle, consistent with the recruitment of ER membranes at this site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bobinnec et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Ankle2 interacts with Vap33 through FFAT motifs</title>
<p>We confirmed the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction in a reciprocal co-purification assay. We found that endogenous Ankle2 was specifically co-purified with GFP-Vap33 or Vap33-GFP from D-Mel cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). To identify the region of Ankle2 responsible for its interaction with Vap33, we used the GST pulldown described above, probing for the interaction of Vap33-Myc with GST-fused fragments of Ankle2. We found that the C-terminal region of Ankle2 (residues 910-1174) is sufficient to interact with Vap33 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). The VAP family of proteins is anchored to the ER via a transmembrane domain and exposes a globular MSP domain to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kamemura and Chihara, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Murphy and Levine, 2016</xref>). The MSP domain interacts with proteins that contain FFAT motifs (2 phenylalanines in an acidic tract) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Loewen et al., 2003</xref>). To test if Vap33 interacts with Ankle2 in this manner, we introduced mutations in the MSP of Vap33 domain predicted to disrupt its ability to bind FFAT motifs based on results with human VAP (K89D, M91D in Vap33) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Kaiser et al., 2005</xref>). We found that this mutant form of Vap33-Myc was unable to interact with GST-Ankle2<sup>910-1174</sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). We then searched for FFAT motifs in Ankle2 using published criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Slee and Levine, 2019</xref>) and identified three candidate motifs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). One of them was a particularly good fit. Mutation of this FFAT motif (Fm) abolished the interaction of the Ankle2 C-terminal fragment with Vap33 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B-C</xref>). To test if the interaction occurs in the same way between proteins expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we used a co-purification assay. We transfected different forms of Ankle2-GFP along with Vap33-Myc and proceeded to GFP affinity purifications followed by Western blot for Myc. In this assay, mutation of the first FFAT motif in Ankle2 diminished but did not abolish its interaction with Vap33 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4E</xref>). We therefore tested the contributions of two other additional FFAT-like motifs (FL1 and FL2, <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). Mutation of FL1 (FL1m) also diminished but did not abolish the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33, while mutation of FL2 (FL2m) did not perturb the Ankle2-Vap33 interaction. Finally, we found that the combined mutation of the FFAT and FL1 motifs in Ankle2 (Fm+FL1m) abolished its interaction with Vap33. Thus, we conclude that Vap33, via its MSP domain, can interact with Ankle2 through two redundant FFAT motifs. Interestingly, subsequent modeling using AlphaFold3 predicted that Vap33 interacts with Ankle2 preferentially through a contact between the MSP domain of Vap33 and the FL1 motif of Ankle2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4F</xref>).</p>

<title>Vap33 is required for the localization of Ankle2 at the ER and reassembling NE</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila</italic> Vap33 is an essential protein presumably responsible for interactions of the ER with multiple cytoplasmic proteins and structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Pennetta et al., 2002</xref>). Nevertheless, we attempted to knock down Vap33 by RNAi in the female germline to examine the effects on Ankle2-GFP localization in embryos. Unsurprisingly, we found that those females were sterile and therefore we could not examine embryos. However, we examined ovaries. In control flies, we observed that Ankle2-GFP was weakly localized to nuclear envelopes and strongly localized to the plasma membrane and to ring canals in nurse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig S2</xref>). By contrast, in Vap33 RNAi ovaries, we found that Ankle2-GFP was largely delocalized from these structures. Whether distinct pools of Ankle2 serve specific functions is a question that remains open. Nevertheless, these results suggested that the localization of Ankle2 depends on Vap33.</p>
<p>To test if Ankle2 requires its interaction with Vap33 for its localization, we generated transgenic flies for the expression of Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP. We then examined its localization in embryos co-expressing RFP-Vap33. In interphase, Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP failed to localize to the ER and NE like Ankle2-GFP, instead appearing diffuse in the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>, to be compared with <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>, and Video S3). Surprisingly, as nuclei entered mitosis, Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP became strongly localized to the nuclear/spindle envelope, similarly to Ankle2-GFP. However, while Ankle2-GFP was retained at those membranous structures in telophase, Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP disappeared from them, returning to a diffuse, cytoplasmic localization. We conclude that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33 is required for the localization of Ankle2 to the ER in interphase, and for its retention at membranes during NE reassembly in telophase.</p>
<p>Since the ER is the source of the reassembling NE after mitosis, we hypothesized that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33 could mediate a localized activity of Ankle2-bound PP2A during nuclear reassembly. In this way, PP2A could dephosphorylate BAF (and potentially other substrates) locally to promote its recruitment near the reforming nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3A</xref>). For this model to be valid, Ankle2 should be able to interact with Vap33 and PP2A simultaneously. We used AlphaFold3 to generate structural models of a complex between Vap33, Ankle2, PP2A-29B and Mts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3B</xref>). The most probable models show that Ankle2 can simultaneously interact with Vap33, PP2A-29B and Mts without steric clash. Our attempts to detect a complex containing Vap33 and PP2A by simple co-IP and Westerns in D-Mel cells gave variable and inconclusive results. However, we detected Vap33 in complex with PP2A-29B-GFP purified from embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>), despite the fact that PP2A-29B-GFP did not appear clearly enriched at the nuclear/spindle envelope in embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3C</xref>). To test if we could promote the formation of the complex, we overexpressed Ankle2-RFP in cells expressing PP2A-29B-GFP and Vap33-Myc. We found that more Vap33-Myc was co-purified with PP2A-29B-GFP under these conditions, compared with cells without Ankle2-RFP overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3D</xref>). This co-purification reflected the specific interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33-Myc because it was abrogated with Vap33<sup>DD</sup>-Myc. Consistent with this result, we found that PP2A-29B-GFP became visibly enriched at the NE upon overexpression of Ankle2-RFP in D-Mel cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig S3E</xref>). These results suggest that a Vap33-Ankle2-PP2A complex can mediate the recruitment of a pool of PP2A at the NE.</p>

<title>Requirements of Ankle2 interactions and motifs for nuclear reassembly</title>
<p>To test the requirements of Ankle2 for its functions in mitosis, we used a rescue assay in D-Mel cells in culture. We depleted endogenous Ankle2 by RNAi and expressed different forms of RNAi-insensitive Ankle2-GFP under the copper-inducible metallothionein promotor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Depletion of Ankle2 alone resulted in nuclear defects including dispersed or aggregated Lamin, fragmented nuclei, DNA devoid of Lamin and hypercondensed DNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-C</xref>). We previously documented these cellular phenotypes, which we showed to occur as a result of defective BAF recruitment to chromosomes and BAF-dependent nuclear reassembly after mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, Western blotting using Phos-tag revealed that BAF became hyperphosphorylated upon Ankle2 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). We verified that expression of Ankle2-GFP rescued the nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>To begin to map the essential regions of Ankle2, we tested the ability of Ankle2<sup>1-</sup> <sup>587</sup>-GFP (N-terminal half) or Ankle2<sup>588-1174</sup>-GFP (C-terminal half) to rescue the nuclear phenotypes. We found that both truncated proteins were unable to rescue nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that each half of Ankle2 contains at least one essential region for its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4</xref>). The N-terminal half of Ankle2 contains the Ankyrin domain region necessary and sufficient for Ankle2 interaction with PP2A (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). We found that Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP was unable to rescue nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-D</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A is essential for its function in BAF dephosphorylation and nuclear reassembly. To map more precisely the C-terminal region(s) of Ankle2 required for its function, we made smaller truncations and deletions in Ankle2-GFP, guided in part by sequence conservation between species. We found that deletion of a.a. residues 607-680, 681-937, 938-997, 992-1040 or 1041-1174 partially or completely abrogated the ability of Ankle2-GFP to rescue nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Figs S4</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">S5</xref>). The 938-997 segment of Ankle2 contains the FFAT motifs required for the interaction with Vap33 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). However, we found that the expression of Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP rescued nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B-D</xref>). These results suggest that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33, while it is required for Ankle2 localization to the reassembling NE in embryos, is dispensable for Ankle2 function in BAF dephosphorylation and nuclear reassembly in D-Mel cells in culture.</p>
<p>Disruption of the interaction with Vap33 prevented the localization of Ankle2 at the ER and the reassembling NE in telophase (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4G</xref>); however, it did not abolish the localization of Ankle2 at the nuclear/spindle envelope at early stages of mitosis. We looked for another motif that could contribute to the membrane localization of Ankle2. Human Ankle2 contains a predicted trans-membrane (TM) domain in its N-terminus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>). Although online prediction tools failed to predict a TM domain in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2, we noticed a highly hydrophobic segment in its N-terminus (a.a. 14-31). To test if it contributes to the membrane localization of Ankle2, we combined a deletion of the N-terminal 50 a.a. residues (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) with the FFAT mutations. The resulting Ankle2<sup>51-1174&amp;Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP was recruited to the NE during prophase, similarly to Ankle2-GFP and Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6</xref>). Ankle2<sup>51-1174&amp;Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP also largely rescued nuclear defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation, although less efficiently than Ankle2-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig S4</xref>). Among various truncated and deleted forms of Ankle2-GFP, only those that lacked C-terminal a.a. residues 938-1174 (Ankle2-GFP 1-587, 1-692 and 1-937) failed to be recruited to the NE during prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig S6</xref>). This region comprises the 3 candidate FFAT motifs identified. These results suggest that Ankle2 relies on its C-terminus for its NE recruitment during prophase, although the FFAT motifs are not strictly required for this recruitment. We do not know how Ankle2 localizes to the nuclear/spindle envelope independently from Vap33 during early stages of mitosis, or the importance of this localization.</p>
<p>Overall, we conclude that in addition to its N-terminal PP2A-interacting Ankyrin domain, Ankle2 requires the integrity of its C-terminal portion for its essential function in nuclear reassembly. The C-terminus of Ankle2 mediates its interaction with Vap33, which is crucial for the localization of Ankle2 to the reassembling NE in telophase. However, our results suggest that the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction is not strictly required for Ankle2’s function in D-Mel cells.</p>

<p>To test the importance of the Ankle2-PP2A interaction, we imaged embryos expressing Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP. We found that RFP-BAF recruitment to the inner core of reassembling nuclei was strongly diminished compared to embryos expressing Ankle2<sup>WT</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> middle, Video S5 and <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Given that BAF recruitment promotes NE reassembly and Ankle2 is a NE-associated protein, we examined whether the recruitment of Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP to the inner core region of the reassembling NE was compromised. Fluorescence quantification of NE-associated proteins at the inner core region allows monitoring of NE reassembly, as this region of the reassembling NE is clearly distinct from the spindle envelope in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Emond-Fraser et al., 2023</xref>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">S8A</xref>). We found that the recruitment of Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP to the core region was delayed (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>), suggesting that the delay in BAF recruitment caused a delay in NE reassembly. Interestingly, RFP-BAF and Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP were both retained longer at the spindle envelope in embryos expressing Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP, compared with embryos expressing Ankle2<sup>WT</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E-F</xref>). We conclude that the ability of Ankle2 to interact with PP2A is required for the timely recruitment of BAF at reassembling nuclei and ensuing NE reassembly.</p>
<p>To test the importance of the Ankle2-Vap33 interaction, we imaged embryos expressing Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP (also depleted of endogenous Ankle2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref> bottom and Video S6). As before, we observed that Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP failed to localize to membranes during interphase and telophase, and that it is partially recruited to the nuclear/spindle envelope from prophase to anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Fig S8B</xref>). This result rules out the possibility that Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP localizes to membranes during mitosis because of a potential complex with endogenous Ankle2. Quantification confirmed that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33 is required for the maintenance of Ankle2-GFP at the spindle envelope during telophase and its recruitment to the inner core region of the reassembling NE, at the time when BAF is normally recruited (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D, F</xref>). Moreover, we found that the recruitment of RFP-BAF at reassembling nuclei was delayed in embryos expressing Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). These results suggest that the ability of Ankle2 to interact with Vap33 contributes to the efficient recruitment of BAF at reassembling nuclei.</p>

<title>The interactions of Ankle2 with PP2A and Vap33 promote its function <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>We examined the importance of Ankle2 and its interactions for embryonic development. Knockdown of endogenous Ankle2 during late oogenesis using the matα4-GAL-VP16 driver did not significantly diminish the ability of females to lay eggs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). However, none of their embryos hatched, indicating a failure in embryonic development in the absence of maternally contributed Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9A-B</xref>). Immunofluorescence revealed that the majority of embryos aborted development in the first mitotic cycle, with a single nucleus/spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9C</xref>). FISH for the X chromosome consistently revealed three foci in the polar body and one or two foci in the mitotic spindle, confirming that the spindle observed corresponded to mitosis and not to meiosis or sperm prior to fertilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Fig S9D-E</xref>). Expression of RNAi-insensitive Ankle2-GFP in this background fully rescued embryo hatching. This rescue was strongly abrogated when Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP was expressed. The weak rescue observed may be in part attributed to the dilution of Gal4 between two UASp elements (UASp-Ankle2 RNAi and UASp-transgene) because a weak rescue was also observed when GFP alone was expressed (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). In any case, these results indicate that the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A is essential during embryo development. Moreover, expression of Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP in the presence of endogenous Ankle2 did not cause a decrease in embryo hatching, ruling out the possibility of toxicity (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref>). By contrast, expression of Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP fully rescued embryo hatching, suggesting that the interaction of Ankle2 with Vap33 is dispensable for embryo development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>

<p>To examine the requirements of Ankle2 interactions in a different context, we turned to wing development. Induction of Ankle2 RNAi in the wing disc pouch using Nubbin-Gal4 (Nub-Gal4) resulted in wingless adults. Simultaneous expression of Ankle2-GFP or Ankle2<sup>Fm+FL1m</sup>-GFP rescued the development of adults with wings of the normal size. However, expression of Ankle2<sup>ΔANK</sup>-GFP resulted in no rescue (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7C</xref>). These results indicate that the interaction of Ankle2 with PP2A but not with Vap33 is essential for its function during cell proliferation in imaginal wing discs. To test if Vap33 promotes Ankle2 function in a sensitized background, we depleted Ankle2 in the wing pouch using a weaker RNAi line. As a result, smaller adult wings developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). We found that introduction of single mutant alleles of <italic>Vap33</italic> in this background enhances the small wing phenotype. This result suggests that although the Ankle2-Vap33 interaction is not essential, it nevertheless promotes Ankle2 function during wing development (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Post-mitotic nuclear reassembly is an essential cellular process, yet its molecular underpinnings remain only partially understood. BAF has emerged as a central player required for connections between chromosomes in telophase, for the adhesion of membranes to chromatin through LEM-Domain proteins and for lamina reassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Haraguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Haraguchi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Samwer et al., 2017</xref>). The recruitment of BAF hinges on its dephosphorylation by PP2A, a process dependent on Ankle2 in various animal species including humans, flies and roundworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mehsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Snyers et al., 2018</xref>). Our study leveraged <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model to elucidate how Ankle2 functions in this process.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate for the first time that Ankle2 functions as a regulatory subunit of PP2A. We found that Ankle2 uses its Ankyrin domain to interact with PP2A. Ankyrin repeats are known to mediate protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Li et al., 2006</xref>). AlphaFold3 predicts an interaction of this domain with PP2A that would position Ankle2 as a regulatory subunit. Indeed, the presence of Ankle2 in the PP2A complex would be mutually exclusive with the presence of known regulatory subunits including B55 (Tws in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) and B56, a hypothesis further supported by our results showing that Tws competes with Ankle2 for binding to PP2A. In addition, Ankle2 co-purified PP2A-29B and Mts without any known PP2A regulatory subunits. Previous work indicated that human Ankle2 uses a similar region to interact with PP2A, comprising part of the Ankyrin domain and a segment immediately preceding it, termed the Caulimovirus Domain (CD, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>). Although the latter region is poorly conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, our modeling suggests that it may participate in the formation of the PP2A-Ankle2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Experimental structural determination of the PP2A-Ankle2 is required to reveal the detailed structure of the complex.</p>
<p>Our unbiased phosphoproteomic analysis confirmed that BAF dephosphorylation depends on Ankle2, despite the absence of a detectable interaction between <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankle2 and BAF, which may be due to the lack of a LEM domain in the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Fishburn et al., 2024</xref>). Moreover, while Ankle2 was shown to bind and inhibit the BAF counteracting kinase VRK1 in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>), we detected no interaction between Ankle2 and NHK-1/Ballchen (VRK1 ortholog) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This suggests that the loss of Ankle2 causes BAF hyperphosphorylation by preventing PP2A-dependent dephosphorylation rather than by preventing inhibition of NHK-1. Our previous genetic analysis in the developing wing suggests that BAF is the most critical substrate of PP2A-Ankle2 during cell proliferation. Indeed, wing developmental defects upon Ankle2 depletion are rescued by lowering the dose of NHK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li et al., 2024</xref>). Ankle2 may enable PP2A to dephosphorylate BAF through a transient interaction independently from the LEM domain and/or by targeting PP2A to a subcellular location that is favorable to the reaction (discussed below). Interestingly, we identified several additional potential substrates of PP2A-Ankle2 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and Table S5). We were so far unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the PP2A-Ankle2 complex to conduct robust <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphatase assays with phosphorylated BAF or other candidate substrates.</p>
<p>We also discovered a novel interaction between Ankle2 and the ER protein Vap33. We show that FFAT motifs in Ankle2 interact with the MSP domain of Vap33. This interaction is required for the localization of Ankle2 to the reassembling NE in telophase, and to the NE and ER in interphase. The recent identification of putative FFAT motifs in human Ankle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Neefjes and Cabukusta, 2021</xref>) suggests that the interaction between Ankle2 and VAP family proteins of the ER may be conserved.</p>
<p>These findings led us to propose a model where Vap33 targets the PP2A-Ankle2 holoenzyme to ER membranes, promoting BAF dephosphorylation and recruitment in a localized manner during nuclear reassembly. Supporting this model, we detected a complex comprising Vap33, Ankle2, PP2A-29B and Mts. Our results using cells in culture, embryos and developing wings indicate that the Ankle2-PP2A interaction is essential for BAF dephosphorylation and recruitment to nascent nuclei in telophase, as well as for nuclear reassembly and animal development. Similarly, we found that the Ankle2-Vap33 interaction, while being less critical, also promotes BAF recruitment during nuclear reassembly in embryos. Conceptually, the novel mechanism we propose implies that the ER is mere more than a passive source of membranes in nuclear reassembly; it implicates the ER as a carrier of localized enzymatic activity needed for the process.</p>
<p>Future work should examine the functions of other protein interactions and potential substrates of PP2A-Ankle2 that we identified, which could implicate this holoenzyme in the regulation of various cellular processes. Particularly intriguing are the interactions we identified between Ankle2 and Cyclin-CDK subunits. The possibility that Ankle2, while functioning as a PP2A subunit, may also impact Cyclin-CDK functions warrants further investigation. Conversely, Cyclin-CDKs may also contribute to the regulation of PP2A-Ankle2 in the cell cycle, an area that remains to be explored.</p>

Then, cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 hours at room temperature, washed three times with PBST, and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies and DAPI for 1 hour avoiding light. Primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-Lamin from mouse (1:200, DSHB Hybridoma Product ADL84.12), anti-GFP from rabbit (1:1000, Torrey Pine Biolabs). Secondary antibodies from mouse and rabbit were respectively coupled to Alexa-647(1:200, Invitrogen) and Alexa-488 (1:200, Invitrogen).</p>

<title>Microscopy</title>
<p>A confocal system Leica SP8 was used for imaging of fixed cells and embryos. Acquired images of cells were subsequently processed with the Lightning system. Live imaging of cells and embryos was performed by a spinning disk confocal system (Yokogawa CSU-X1 5000) mounted on a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1). Cells were cultured on a LabTek II chambered coverglass (#155409, Thermo Fisher Scientific) at least two hours before time-lapse imaging. For live analysis of embryos, 0-2h embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach and then aligned on a coverslip (#P35G-1.5-14-C, MatTek) and covered with halocarbon oil. Films of embryos were taken every 10s with six confocal sections of about 3μm. To monitor Ankle2-GFP (WT and mutants) and RFP-BAF levels, respectively, the mean intensity of GFP and RFP fluorescence in the region of interest were measured directly with Zen software (Zeiss) at different time points. For each point, the mean intensity of GFP and RFP was normalized by subtraction of mean intensity at anaphase onset (T0) in the core region. Images of adult flies were acquired by stereomicroscope with a camera (Canon). Developing wings of adult flies were dissected and quantified using Fiji software (National Institute of Health).</p>

<p>This is an <bold>important</bold> study that reports the mechanism by which Ankle2 (LEM4 in humans) interacts with and recruits PP2A and the ER protein Vap33 to promote BAF dephosphorylation and mediate nuclear membrane reformation, using Drosophila as their model. Using Ankle2 mutants, they find that the ER protein Vap33 is key for the normal interphase localisation of Ankle2/LEM4 and also impacts on the function of Ankle2/LEM4 during mitosis. The authors use a variety of complementary techniques and provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence to support the claims. The conclusions about the subcellular localization of Ankle2 might be <bold>incomplete</bold> since they are drawn from overexpression experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In organisms with open mitosis, nuclear envelope breakdown at mitotic entry and re-assembly of the nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis are important, highly regulated processes. One key regulator of nuclear envelope re-assembly is the BAF (Barrier-to-Autointegration) protein, which contributes to cross-linking of chromosomes to the nuclear envelope. Crucially, BAF has to be in a dephosphorylated form to carry out this function, and PP2A has been shown to be the phosphatase that dephosphorylates BAF. The Ankle2/LEM4 protein has previously been identified as an important regulator of PP2A in the dephosphorylation of BAF but its precise function is not fully understood, and Li and colleagues set out to investigate the function of Ankle2/LEM4 in both Drosophila flies and Drosophila cell lines.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors use a combination of biochemical and imaging techniques to understand the biology of Ankle2/LEM4. On the whole, the experiments are well conducted and the results look convincing. A particular strength of this manuscript is that the authors are able to study both cellular phenotypes and organismal effects of their mutants by studying both Drosophila D-mel cells and whole flies.</p>
<p>The work presented in this manuscript significantly enhances our understanding of how Ankle2/LEM4 supports BAF dephosphorylation at the end of mitosis. Particularly interesting is the finding that Ankle2/LEM4 appears to be a bona fide PP2A regulatory protein in Drosophila, as well as the localisation of Ankle2/LEM4 and how this is influenced by the interaction between Ankle2 and the ER protein Vap33. It would be interesting to see, though, whether these insights are conserved in mammalian cells, e.g. does mammalian Vap33 also interact with LEM4? Is LEM4 also a part of the PP2A holoenzyme complex in mammalian cells?</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>This work is certainly impactful but more discussion and comparison of the Drosophila versus mammalian cell system would be helpful. Also, to attract the largest possible readership, the Ankle2 protein should be referred to as Ankle2/LEM4 throughout the paper to make it clear that this is the same molecule.</p>
<p>A schematic model at the end of the final figure would be very useful to summarise the findings.</p>

<p>The authors first identify Ankle2 as a regulatory subunit and direct interactor of PP2A, showing they interact both in vitro and in vivo to promote BAF dephosphorylation. The Ankyrin domain of Ankle2 is important for the interaction with PP2A. They then show Ankle2 also interacts with the ER protein Vap33 through FFAT motifs and they particularly co-localize during mitosis. The recruitment of Ankle2 to Vap33 is essential to ER and nuclear envelop membrane in telophase while earlier in mitosis, it relies on the C terminus but not the FFAT motifs for recruitments to the nuclear membrane and spindle envelop in early mitosis. The molecular determinants and receptors are currently not known. The authors check the function of the PP2A recruitment to Ankle2/Vap33 in the context of embryos and show this recruitment pathway is functionally important. While the Ankle2/Vap33 interaction is dispensable in adult flies -looking at wing development, the PP2A/Ankle2 interaction is essential for correct wing and fly development. Overall, this is a very complete paper that reveals the molecular mechanism of PP2A recruitment to Ankle2 and studies both the cellular and the physiological effect of this interaction in the context of fly development.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is well written and the narrative is well-developed. The figures are of high quality, well-controlled, clearly labelled, and easy to understand. They support the claims made by the authors.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The study would benefit from being discussed in the context of what is already known on Ankle2 biology in C.elegans and human cells. It is important to highlight the structures shown in the paper are alphafold models, rather than validated structures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors were interested in how Ankle2 regulates nuclear envelope reformation after cell division. Other published manuscripts, including those from the authors, show without a doubt that Ankle2 plays a role in this critical process. However, the mechanism by which Ankle2 functions was unclear. Previous work using worms and humans (Asencio et al., 2012) established that human ANKLE2 could bind endogenous PP2A subunits. The binding was direct and was mediated through a region before and including the first ankyrin repeat in human ANKLE2. In addition to its interaction with PP2A, Asencio et al., 2012 also show that ANKLE2 regulates VRK1 kinase activity. Together PP2A and VRK1 regulate BAF phosphorylation for proper nuclear envelope reformation. Here, the authors provide more evidence for interaction with PP2A by also mapping the domain of interaction to the ankyrin repeat in Drosophila. In addition, the ankyrin repeat is essential for nuclear envelope reformation after division. They show that Ankle2 can bind in a PP2A complex without other known regulatory subunits of PP2A. The authors also identify a novel interaction with ER protein Vap33, but functional relevance for this interaction in nuclear envelope reformation is not provided in the manuscript, which the authors explicitly state. This manuscript does not comment on the activity of Ballchen/VRK1 in relation to Ankle2 loss and BAF phosphorylation or nuclear envelope reformation, even though links were previously shown by multiple studies (Asencio et al., Link et al., Apridita Sebastian et al.,). Nuclear envelope defects were rescued by the reduction of VRK1 in two of these manuscripts. It is possible that BAF phosphorylation phenotypes can be contributed by both PP2A inactivity and VRK1 overactivity due to the loss of Ankle2.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript is a useful finding linking Ankle2 function during nuclear envelope reformation to the PP2A complex. The authors present solid data showing that Ankle2 can form a complex with PP2A-29B and Mts and generate a phosphoproteomic resource that is fundamentally important to understanding Ankle2 biology.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, the main findings/conclusions about subcellular localization might be incomplete since they are drawn from overexpression experiments. In addition, throughout the text, some conclusions are overstated or are not supported by data.</p>
