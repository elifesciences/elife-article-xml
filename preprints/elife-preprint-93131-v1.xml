<title>Abstract</title><p>Fertilization is a crucial event in sexual reproduction culminating in the fusion of the haploid sperm and egg to form a new diploid organism. In mammals, egg receptor JUNO and sperm IZUMO1 directly interact to mediate adhesion between gamete membranes; however, their role in fusion remains enigmatic. Here, we used AlphaFold to predict the structure of other extracellular proteins that are essential for fertilization to determine if they could form a complex that may mediate fusion. We first identified TMEM81, whose gene is expressed by mouse and human spermatids, as a protein that has structural homologies with both IZUMO1 and another sperm molecule essential for gamete fusion, SPACA6. Using a set of proteins known to be important for fertilization and TMEM81, we then systematically searched for predicted direct binary interactions using an unguided approach and identified a pentameric complex of three sperm (IZUMO1, SPACA6 and TMEM81) and two egg (JUNO and CD9) proteins. We show that this complex is structurally consistent with both the expected topology on opposing gamete membranes and the location of predicted N-linked glycans that were not considered during prediction with AlphaFold-Multimer. Our model suggests that these proteins could organize to form a synapse-like complex between the sperm and egg membrane at the point of fertilization. Finally, the structural modeling approach described here could be more generally useful to gain structural insights into highly transient protein complexes that are difficult to detect experimentally.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>By merging the plasma membranes of egg and sperm and combining genetic material to initiate the development of a new individual, gamete fusion is the culmination of fertilization and a fundamental event in the life cycle of sexually reproducing species. Significant advances during the last twenty years have started to unravel the molecular basis of this phenomenon by identifying proteins essential for this process in organisms ranging from unicellular algae to mammals <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Clark, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Deneke and Pauli, 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>. In particular, recognition between egg glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein JUNO and sperm type I transmembrane protein IZUMO1 was found to be essential for the fusion of mouse gametes by mediating the juxtaposition of their plasma membranes <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>)</italic></bold>. In agreement with such a docking function, structural studies showed that, although the architecture of the ectodomain of IZUMO1 is reminiscent of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> invasion proteins, neither molecule resembles known fusogens <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aydin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nishimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>)</italic></bold>; at the same time, mouse IZUMO1 was recently reported to have fusogenic activity <italic>in vitro <bold>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>)</bold></italic>, but whether this reflects a comparable function <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bianchi and Wright, 2023</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of the JUNO/IZUMO1 interaction for gamete fusion, gene ablation experiments in the mouse have identified several other egg and sperm molecules essential for this process. On the female side, these include two phylogenetically close tetraspanin membrane proteins, CD9 and CD81 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Miyado et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kaji et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Miller et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Rubinstein et al. 2006</xref>)</italic></bold>. CD9 concentrates to the gamete adhesion area concomitantly with IZUMO1 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chalbi et al., 2014</xref>)</italic></bold> and is thought to facilitate fusion by reshaping the oocyte’s plasma membrane <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jégou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Umeda et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>. CD81 is 44%-sequence identical to CD9 and can partially rescue the infertility of CD9-deficient mouse eggs <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kaji et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ohnami et al., 2012</xref>)</italic></bold>. On the male side, several surface-expressed molecules are required for mouse gamete fusion in addition to IZUMO1. These include sperm acrosome membrane-associated protein 6 (SPACA6) <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barbaux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lorenzetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Noda et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold> and transmembrane protein 95 (TMEM95) <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>, both of which are type I-transmembrane proteins with an IZUMO1-like ectodomain structure <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nishimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vance et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>.

Finally, two other molecules necessary for mouse gamete fusion are fertilization influencing membrane protein (FIMP), the transmembrane domain-containing isoform of 4930451I11RIK <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Fujihara et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>, and sperm-oocyte fusion required 1 (SOF1) <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Noda et al., 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>. In addition to this gene knockout-derived information, there is biochemical evidence that IZUMO1 is part of rodent sperm multiprotein complexes that include structurally related molecules IZUMO2-4 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Ellerman et al., 2009</xref>)</italic></bold>. More recently, egg Fc receptor-like 3 (FCRL3/MAIA) was also suggested to be involved in human gamete adhesion and fusion by replacing JUNO as an IZUMO1-binding partner <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Vondrakova et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>
<p>The relatively large number of proteins that these studies collectively identified as required for mammalian egg-sperm fusion, together with the lack of conclusive evidence supporting a direct role of the JUNO/IZUMO1 complex in the fusion process itself, suggest that a larger macromolecular complex may orchestrate fusion. However, perhaps because such an assembly exists only transiently due to the need to prevent polyspermy, the identification of additional protein-protein interactions between the aforementioned factors has frustrated independent efforts by multiple laboratories.</p>
<p>Here, we show that, despite the clear centrality of the JUNO/IZUMO1 interaction, its mouse components have such a low affinity that, unlike their human homologs, they cannot be purified as a stable complex. Because the biochemical identification of other egg/sperm fusion factor complexes may be hindered by the fact that their binary affinities also vary significantly among different species, we attack the problem by taking advantage of the momentous advances in protein complex structure prediction using AlphaFold-Multimer <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Burke et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Evans et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>. The rationale for using this approach lies in the fact that the availability of a significant number of sequences for the proteins of interest not only allows AlphaFold to predict possible complexes thereof highly accurately <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>, but also makes it largely insensitive to the species-specific affinity of a given protein-protein interaction.</p>
<p>Consistent with these considerations, the analysis of AlphaFold-Multimer predictions supports the suggestion that JUNO and IZUMO1 are part of a complex that includes additional fusion factors.</p>

<title>Mouse JUNO and IZUMO1 do not form a biochemically stable complex</title>
<p>Whereas mammalian cell-expressed human JUNO and IZUMO1 ectodomains form a stable complex (JUNO<sub>E</sub>/IZUMO1<sub>E</sub>) that can be detected by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), their murine homologs do not (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref></italic></bold>). This is consistent with the low affinity of the interaction between the mouse proteins, whose 0.6-12 µM <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>is significantly higher than the ∼50-90 nM <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> reported for the human JUNO<sub>E</sub>/IZUMO1<sub>E</sub> complex expressed in insect cells <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aydin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Nishimura et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>)</italic></bold>. Notably, the <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of wild-type mouse JUNO<sub>E</sub>/IZUMO1<sub>E</sub> is also higher than the 360 nM <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of the complex between human IZUMO1<sub>E</sub> and JUNO<sub>E</sub> W62A <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aydin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>)</italic></bold>. The latter bears an interface mutation whose introduction into mouse JUNO abolishes its ability to rescue the sperm-fusion impairment of <italic>Juno</italic> null eggs, as well as halves its ability to support sperm binding to JUNO-expressing HEK293T cells <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kato et al., 2016</xref>)</italic></bold>. The low affinity of mouse JUNO<sub>E</sub>/IZUMO1<sub>E</sub> could, in principle, be partially compensated by the avidity resulting from a high local concentration of receptors at the egg/sperm contact point. At the same time, consistent with the considerations made above, the binary interaction between JUNO and IZUMO1 may be stabilized within the context of a larger macromolecular complex.</p>

<title>AlphaFold-Multimer produces high-confidence predictions for both mouse and human JUNO/IZUMO1 ectodomain complexes</title>
<p>To assess whether the significant difference in affinity between the mouse and human complexes was reflected by the confidence of the corresponding AlphaFold-Multimer predictions, we compared the output of AlphaFold runs performed without using templates. This computational experiment showed that AlphaFold-Multimer not only generates a high-confidence model of human JUNO<sub>E</sub>/IZUMO1<sub>E</sub> that accurately reproduces the corresponding crystal structure but also yields a model of mouse JUNO<sub>E</sub>/IZUMO1<sub>E</sub> of comparable confidence (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref></italic></bold>). This is consistent with the expectation that, as long as a significant number of sequences can be aligned to those of a protein complex of interest and the interaction is evolutionarily conserved, the quality of the AlphaFold-Multimer predictions for this complex is not negatively affected by the low affinity that its components may have in a subset of species.</p>

Despite insignificant sequence identities (16-27%), this search also identified transmembrane protein 81 (TMEM81) as a clear structural homolog of the conserved immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of IZUMO1 and SPACA6 (E-values 1.40e-8 - 1.39e-6) (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, B</italic></bold>). The TMEM81 hit was confirmed by the result of a search of the PDB database, carried out by generating an AlphaFold model of the protein’s ectodomain and using it as input for Dali <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holm, 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>, which matched it to the crystal structure of human IZUMO1 (PDB 5JK9 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>)</italic></bold>) with a Z-score of 11.3 (significantly above the Z-score threshold of 8, which indicates very good structural superpositions <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Holm, 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>). Notably, TMEM81 is conserved in vertebrates <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">NCBI, 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>, and its gene is expressed in both mouse and human spermatids <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Yue et al., 2014</xref>)</italic></bold>. Like IZUMO1-3, SPACA6, and TMEM95, TMEM81 is predicted to be a type I transmembrane protein with a large extracellular domain; moreover, it was previously anonymously suggested to be a β-sheet-rich molecule that may be structurally related to IZUMO1 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wikipedia, 2020</xref>)</italic></bold>. Accordingly, the characteristic four-helix bundle (4HB) of IZUMO1 and SPACA6 is replaced by a three-stranded β-sheet in the AlphaFold model of TMEM81; however, the positioning of two invariant disulfide bonds that orient these highly different elements relative to the conserved Ig-like domain is remarkably similar in the three molecules (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></italic></bold>).</p>

<title>Prediction of interactions between human proteins associated with gamete fusion</title>
<p>To infer whether a larger macromolecular complex may be involved in gamete fusion, we used AlphaFold-Multimer in template-free mode to examine all pairwise interactions of the human homologs of the 4 egg and 11 sperm proteins mentioned above, plus TMEM81. Since we also considered the possibility that each of these 15 different molecules may also homodimerize, this amounted to a total of 120 unique combinations. Analysis of the corresponding predictions revealed a cluster of 7 possible interactions centered around IZUMO1, 5 of which were direct (JUNO, CD9, CD81, SPACA6, TMEM81) and 2 indirect (IZUMO4 (via JUNO), SOF1 (via SPACA6)). In addition, we detected isolated homodimeric interactions for IZUMO4 and DCST1, as well as heterodimeric interactions for IZUMO2/IZUMO3, TMEM95/FIMP and DCST1/DCST2 (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></italic></bold>). Notably, the ∼260 Å-long mace-shaped heterodimeric assembly predicted for DCST1/DCST2 is consistent with experimental evidence for interaction between the two proteins <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Noda et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>

The 8-protein complex predictions also indicate that IZUMO4 does not interact with the rest of the assembly (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></italic></bold> <italic>and <bold>Figure S1A</bold></italic>), consistent with the observation that its predicted binary interaction with JUNO (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref></italic></bold>) is incompatible with the JUNO/IZUMO1 interface (<bold><italic>Figure S1D</italic></bold>). Finally, pDockQ and visual analysis of the predictions for the 8-protein complex indicate that SOF1 is mainly disordered and does not make significant contacts with other components (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref></italic></bold> <italic>and <bold>Figure S1A</bold></italic>). Taken together, these considerations leave egg JUNO and CD9 and sperm IZUMO1, SPACA6 and TMEM81 as subunits of a 5-protein complex that can be consistently modeled with acceptable ranking confidence and pDockQ scores (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>, C</italic></bold>). Consistent with their central role in interfacing the egg and sperm plasma membranes, JUNO and IZUMO1 constitute the core of this putative assembly, where they interact in the same way that was observed crystallographically <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aydin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>)</italic></bold> and reproduced computationally <bold><italic>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>)</italic></bold>. On the opposite side of the JUNO/IZUMO1 interface, the hinge region and 4HB of SPACA6 wrap around the 4HB of IZUMO1, generating a concave surface that interacts with the long extracellular loop (LEL) of CD9. Finally, TMEM81 adopts the same N-to-C orientation of IZUMO1 and SPACA6 and, by inserting its Ig-like module between the two proteins, links their C-terminal regions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we have taken advantage of the latest developments in protein structure and interaction prediction to model protein complex formation in the mammalian egg-sperm fusion synapse. We report the supramolecular organization of five cell surface proteins (three sperm and two egg) that form a core complex likely to be important for gamete recognition and fusion.</p>
<p>Because the only specific information about the target molecules that is used as input for AlphaFold-Multimer is their primary sequence, the neural network model does not incorporate any knowledge of data associated with the system’s biology. As a result, biological information on egg-sperm fusion can be used as an independent criterion to validate the predictions. Firstly, because the majority of proteins involved in this process are either C-terminally membrane-anchored or transmembrane proteins, a basic feature expected in a gamete fusion synapse is that the C-termini of its egg subunits or the egg subunits themselves should all be located on the opposite side of the corresponding elements from sperm, relative to the gamete interface. This is true for the 5-component complex predictions (<bold><italic><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref></italic></bold>). On the egg plasma membrane side, JUNO and CD9 are positioned so that the GPI anchor attached to the C-terminus of the former (which is not modeled by AlphaFold, whose predictions are currently restricted to amino acids) would be located in correspondence with the transmembrane domains of CD9. Similarly, the general orientation and high flexibility of the juxtamembrane regions of IZUMO1, SPACA6, and TMEM81 are compatible with the fact that, in the context of the full-length proteins, these elements are connected to the single-spanning transmembrane helices that anchor the corresponding molecules to the sperm plasma membrane.</p>
<p>A second feature common to all the subunits in the modeled complexes is the presence of N-glycosylation sites. Because AlphaFold has no explicit knowledge of sequons and does not model carbohydrates, the N-glycans that decorate the native molecules could, in principle, interfere with predicted interfaces. As shown in <bold><italic><xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref></italic></bold>, the predicted complex architecture is compatible with the location of all the possible N-glycosylation sites of JUNO, IZUMO1, SPACA6, and TMEM81, for both human and mouse homologs (amounting to a total of ten sites). One possible exception is a sequon within the short extracellular loop (SEL) of CD9, which is conserved in both species (corresponding to human N52 and mouse N50, respectively) but whose glycosylation remains to be experimentally verified. Interestingly, this site is located in relatively close proximity to where loop 3 of JUNO protrudes towards the region between the LEL and SEL of CD9 <bold><italic>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7A</xref>)</italic></bold>. This suggests that if the conserved sequon of CD9 is glycosylated, this may interfere with the only minor contact that the protein makes with JUNO within the predicted complex. Notably, a fusion synapse architecture where CD9 makes little or no contact with JUNO but interacts with the 4HB of IZUMO would immediately explain the experimental observation that, in mouse oocytes, CD9 is recruited to the gamete fusion site only upon binding of JUNO to IZUMO1 <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chalbi et al., 2014</xref>)</italic></bold>. Moreover, the predicted CD9/IZUMO1 interface agrees with previous suggestions that the two proteins may interact, based on the observation that their sequences co-evolve <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Claw et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Vicens and Roldan, 2014</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>

<p>Although there is a general agreement that the CD9 LEL plays an important role in gamete fusion, which of its residues are responsible for this is debated; in particular, an early suggestion that the 173-SFQ-175 motif of mouse CD9 LEL is required for fusion was recently challenged <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Umeda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>)</italic></bold>. Against this background, it is interesting to note that, in our predictions, the conserved CD9 Phe at the center of the SFQ tripeptide (175-TFT-177 in human) stacks against α-helix 2 of the IZUMO 4HB <bold><italic>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>)</italic></bold>. Not far from this interaction, the third α-helix of CD9 LEL makes hydrophobic contacts with IZUMO1 α2 and α4. These interactions are close to L115, a conserved IZUMO1 α4 residue thought to contribute to egg binding and fusion <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Inoue et al., 2013</xref>)</italic></bold>, and directly involve W113, another conserved α4 amino acid that was recently implicated in fusion <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>)</italic></bold>. Notably, W113 bridges CD9 and SPACA6 by inserting between their LEL and double CXXC motif elements, respectively, while W88 — another IZUMO1 residue suggested to be important for fusion <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>)</italic></bold> — also interacts hydrophobically with SPACA6 at the opposite side of IZUMO1’s 4HB <bold><italic>(<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>)</italic></bold>.</p>
<p>Whereas all the data above is in good agreement with the structural predictions described in this manuscript, two aspects should be considered with caution. First, it remains unclear why, despite the fact that IZUMO1 complementation rescues the disappearance of SPACA6 from the mature sperm of IZUMO1 null mice <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Inoue et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold>, attempts to biochemically identify a complex between IZUMO1 and SPACA6 have been met with limited success <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Noda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Vance et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>. Based on the predicted complex architecture, one obvious possibility would be that, in order to be stable, the interaction also requires the presence of TMEM81. One reason could be the low affinity of the interactions between these proteins, which is typical of extracellular receptor-ligand interactions and makes them difficult to detect experimentally <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wright and Bianchi, 2016</xref>)</italic></bold>. Also, to avoid any inappropriate membrane fusion events, the individual components of the complex may be purposefully spatially segregated until brought together at the moment of fusion, again making it difficult to detect this complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. The type of structural modeling approach described here could play a role in understanding the function of dynamic and transiently formed protein complexes in a range of biological processes that would otherwise be difficult to identify, although care should be taken as some complexes might be predicted due to interactions between homologs. Second, because it is difficult to assess the confidence of the interface between CD9 and IZUMO1+SPACA6 due to its relatively limited extent (combined interface area ∼730 Å<sup>2</sup>), it cannot be excluded that some protein other than CD9 may be the true counterpart of IZUMO1+SPACA6. In other words, it is, in principle, also possible that AlphaFold-Multimer simply recognizes that the concave surface generated by the combined 4HBs of IZUMO1 and SPACA6 is likely to engage in additional interactions and thus tries to fill it with another suitable input subunit.</p>
<p>Of direct relevance to these questions is an independent study, submitted back to back with the original preprint of the present manuscript, which provides experimental data for the existence of a trimeric IZUMO1/SPACA6/TMEM81 complex in zebrafish and suggests that this interacts with egg Bouncer <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Deneke et al., 2023</xref>)</italic></bold>. Considering that the mammalian orthologue of Bouncer is expressed on sperm instead of the egg <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fujihara et al., 2021</xref>)</italic></bold> and that role of CD9 in egg-sperm fusion is much more important in mammals than in fish <bold><italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Greaves et al., 2022</xref>)</italic></bold>, the combination of our studies raises the intriguing possibility that, during the course of evolution, CD9 may have substituted Bouncer as a binding partner of the IZUMO1/SPACA6/TMEM81 complex.</p>

<p>This study offers <bold>useful</bold> insights into the structural architecture of the mammalian egg-sperm fusion synapse, shedding light on the role of specific proteins in fertilization. The strength of the findings lies in the potential identification of a pentameric complex involved in gamete fusion by utilizing a new multimer structure prediction tool, AlphaFold Multimer. The absence of experimental validation weakens the strength of evidence supporting these claims and leaves this work <bold>incomplete</bold>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the Alphafold-multimer program, which predicts the tertiary structure of the macromolecular complex, the authors analyzed the interaction of essential factors involved in sperm-egg fusion. In particular, the authors predicted that the presence of a large complex of the novel factor TMEM81 with IZUMO1, SPACA6, JUNO, and CD9.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors postulated that the type I transmembrane sperm protein TMEM81 may be involved in gamete fusion, as predicted by the Alphafold-multimer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>All data except Figure 1 are mere predictive models, and their physiological importance is extremely unreliable. In addition, the data lacks experimental validation compared to another group's preprint (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.27.550750v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.27.550750v1</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Fertilization is a crucial event in sexual reproduction, but the molecular mechanisms underlying egg-sperm fusion remain elusive. Elofsson et al. used AlphaFold to explore possible synapse-like assemblies between sperm and egg membrane proteins during fertilization. Using a systematic search of protein-protein interactions, the authors proposed a pentameric complex of three sperm (IZUMO1, SPACA6, and TMEM81) and two egg (JUNO and CD9) proteins, providing a new structural model to be used in future structure-function studies.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The study uses the AlphaFold algorithm to predict higher-order assemblies. This approach could offer insights into a highly transient protein complex, which is challenging to detect experimentally.</p>
<p>
2. The article predicts a pentameric complex between proteins involved in fertilization, shedding light on the architectural aspects of the egg-sperm fusion synapse.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. The procedures and discriminator scores used to evaluate specific from non-specific complexes were developed previously by the same authors. Therefore, in this manuscript, they are not contributing a new method.</p>
<p>
2. The proposed model, which is a prediction from a modeling algorithm, lacks experimental validation of the identity of the components and the predicted contacts.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that in an independent study, Deneke et al. provide experimental evidence of the interaction between IZUMO1/SPACA6/TMEM81 in zebrafish. This is an important element that supports the findings presented in this manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Sperm-egg fusion is a critical step in successful fertilization. Although several proteins have been identified in mammals that are required for sperm-egg adhesion and fusion, it is still unclear whether there are other proteins involved in this process and how the reported proteins complex and/or cooperate to complete the fusion process. In this study, the authors first identified TMEM81 as a structural homologue of IZUMO1 and SPACA6, and using AlphaFold-Multimer, a recent advance in protein complex structure prediction, predicted the interactions between human proteins associated with gamete fusion. While the prediction is compelling and well discussed, the experimental evidence to verify this interaction is lacking, so the prediction remains a hypothesis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors present a pentameric complex formation of four previously reported proteins involved in egg/sperm interaction together with TMEM181 using a deep learning tool, AlphaFold-Multimer.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While it is intriguing to see that some of the proteins involved in sperm-egg interaction are successfully predicted to be assembled into a single multimeric structure by AlphaFold-Multimer, it is necessary to experimentally validate the interactions. As there are more candidate proteins in the process, it will be necessary to test other possible protein interactions to prove the adequacy of the candidates chosen by the authors, as similar analysis with some other proteins will provide more rationale for further 3D multi-protein modeling. In addition, the lack of biochemical data to support the predicted bindings between proteins limits the proposed complex to remain mainly hypothetical.</p>
