<title>Abstract</title><p>Amino acids play critical roles in the activation and function of lymphocytes. Here we show that the non-essential amino acid, asparagine, is essential for optimal activation and proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. We demonstrate that asparagine depletion at different time points after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and function. Furthermore, asparagine depletion at specific time points during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation reduces cytokine production in multiple CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. In an adoptive transfer model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), myelin oligodendrocyte-specific pathogenic T helper 17 cells differentiated under Asn-deficient conditions exhibited reduced encephalitogenic potential and attenuated EAE severity. In a model of EAE induced by active immunization, therapeutic depletion of extracellular Asn significantly reduced disease severity. These results identify asparagine as a key metabolic regulator of the pathogenicity of autoreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and suggest that targeting asparagine metabolism may be a novel therapeutic strategy for autoimmunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Naive T cell activation and clonal expansion are bioenergetically demanding processes that require substantial changes in energy and substrate utilization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> Following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, activated T cells increase their metabolic activity and shift towards the use of anabolic pathways such as aerobic glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and mitochondrial biogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> This metabolic transition depends on the uptake of extracellular nutrients and is enabled by the rapid upregulation of nutrient transporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> Among these, the uptake of exogenous amino acids is important for sustaining intracellular biosynthetic processes including nucleotide biosynthesis, ATP generation, and nascent protein synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Amino acids are fundamental building blocks for the synthesis of nascent proteins but have additional functions during T cell activation. Amino acids serve as substrates for nucleic acid biosynthesis, support post translational modifications of proteins and are critical for maintaining redox balance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> The reliance of activated T cells on the non-essential amino acids glutamine, serine, alanine, and arginine is well established.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> For example, activated T cells critically depend on uptake of serine, which provides glycerol and carbon units for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> Similarly, uptake of alanine is required for T cell proliferation and the efficient exit from quiescence following TCR stimulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> Extracellular asparagine (Asn) has recently garnered attention as a nutrient important for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation and function, however its role in helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses has not been explored.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> In fact, a number of extracellular amino acid dependencies have yet to be characterized in the specific context of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function. To address this gap, we assessed the requirement for extracellular non-essential amino acids during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and proliferation. Through this analysis, we uncovered a critical role for extracellular Asn in supporting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses.</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells depend on extracellular Asn for optimal proliferation, activation, and differentiation into helper cells, despite upregulating the Asn-generating enzyme Asn synthetase (ASNS). The absence of extracellular Asn impairs TCR-induced metabolic reprogramming and results in dysfunctional mitochondria. Our findings reveal that early or delayed Asn depletion during the course of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) attenuates disease severity. In an adoptive transfer model of EAE, pathogenic T helper 17 cells differentiated in the absence of extracellular Asn accumulate poorly in the central nervous system (CNS) and exhibit defects in protein synthesis and metabolic fitness ex vivo. Collectively, our results suggest that extracellular Asn bioavailability is a key metabolic checkpoint that regulates the functional responses of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p>

<title>Extracellular asparagine (Asn) is essential for optimal activation and proliferation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells</title>
<p>To investigate the requirement for non-essential amino acids in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, we performed experiments under culture conditions where amino acids were individually added or withdrawn from media. For single amino acid addition experiments, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated on plates coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and cultured in DMEM media with glutamine. Non-essential amino acids lacking in standard DMEM formulation, but present in the conventional RPMI formulation, were individually added. After 24 hours of stimulation in these culture conditions, only the addition of Asn was sufficient to fully activate CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and promote expression of canonical activation markers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, D-I</xref>). After 72 hours of activation in these culture conditions, only Asn addition led to significant proliferation, as measured by CTV dye dilution (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-C</xref>). To assess the essentiality of non-essential amino acids for activation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we activated naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in RPMI lacking nine non-essential amino acids or RPMI depleted of each non-essential amino acid for 24 hours. Depletion of Asn or glutamine resulted in reduced expression of activation markers CD44, CD25, and PD-1, and phenocopied the effects seen when all nine non-essential amino acids were reduced (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-K</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>). However, Asn deprivation resulted in the greatest defect in expression of activation markers compared to other amino acids (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J-K</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A</xref>). These results show that Asn is essential for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation in these culture conditions.</p>

<p>To further evaluate the extent to which extracellular Asn depletion affects CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and proliferation, we employed two orthogonal approaches to deplete Asn. We activated naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in media treated with PEGylated asparaginase (PEG-AsnASE), an enzyme that catabolizes asparagine into aspartate and ammonia, or in custom-formulated RPMI media specifically lacking Asn. Viability did not significantly differ between complete or Asn-deficient media conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1L</xref>), however, cells cultured in Asn-deficient media displayed reduced expression and frequencies of CD25, CD44, CD69, and PD-1 positive cells after 24 hours in culture (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1M-N</xref>, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1B-G</xref>). These results were mimicked with PEG-AsnASE treated media. In contrast, at longer culture periods after TCR stimulation, cells demonstrated increased apoptosis as indicated by Annexin V staining at 48 hours (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1I-J</xref>) and reduced viability after 72 hours in Asn-deficient media (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1H</xref>). Proliferation was also impaired by the depletion of Asn after 3 days of TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1O-P</xref>). In sum, CD4 <sup>+</sup> T cells exhibit a requirement for extracellular Asn at early stages of activation.</p>
<p>Asparagine is described as a non-essential amino acid and thus can be produced endogenously. Considering the essentiality of extracellular Asn during the early stages of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, we next explored whether CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells lack the intracellular machinery needed for endogenous production of Asn (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>). To evaluate the levels of Asn metabolism proteins present in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we used a publicly available bulk RNA-seq dataset consisting of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differentiated in vitro under T helper 1 (TH1), non-pathogenic T helper 17 (npTH17), and pathogenic T helper 17 (pTH17) polarizing conditions for 1, 6, 12, 20 or 48 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B-C</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> These data suggest that the Asn synthesizing enzyme, asparagine synthase (<italic>Asns</italic>), increases in expression upon activation under all polarizing conditions, whereas the asparagine catabolizing enzyme, <italic>Asrgl1</italic>, expression demonstrates little change upon activation. We validated these findings in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells activated under non polarizing conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-E</xref>) using quantitative PCR (qPCR). To confirm that the observed transcriptional changes correspond to protein expression levels, we assessed ASNS protein expression by western blotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). The changes in ASNS protein levels reflected the transcriptional changes of <italic>Asns</italic>. Notably, when naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were activated in Asn-limited media, there was greater production of ASNS compared to cells cultured in Asn sufficient media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). Together, these results show that activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells possess the enzymatic machinery to generate Asn in both Asn-depleted and Asn-replete conditions.</p>

To interrogate when extracellular Asn is needed for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and proliferation, we depleted extracellular Asn using PEG-AsnASE at different time points following activation, including 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 hours post TCR activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). Depletion of extracellular Asn significantly inhibited CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation, even when PEG-AsnASE was added to cultures at 48 hours post TCR activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I-J</xref>). The anti-proliferative effects of PEG-AsnASE treatment were statistically significant at time points corresponding to increased ASNS expression, including 24 and 36 hours after TCR activation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F-G</xref>). In addition, depletion of extracellular Asn at various time points after TCR activation impaired the activation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, reducing the proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing activation-associated markers (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2A-C</xref>). Expression levels of these markers were also reduced in the absence of Asn and never fully recovered to levels observed in control conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K-L</xref>).

<p>Given our results showing that asparagine deprivation results in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria, we next sought to understand how Asn availability affects overall T cell metabolic reprogramming by measuring mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic flux (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), as measured by the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), was significantly decreased in the absence of extracellular Asn under mitochondrial stress test conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). PEG-AsnASE treatment at 6, 12 or 24 hours post TCR activation led to decreased OCR and ATP production, while PEG-AsnASE treatment at 36 hours post activation did not blunt mitochondrial respiration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E-G</xref>). These results suggest that continuous Asn availability during the early stages of TCR activation is necessary to promote mitochondrial respiration. Under glycolysis stress test conditions, depletion of extracellular Asn similarly reduced the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), resulting in decreased glycolysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-I</xref>). These findings indicate that extracellular Asn availability determines the extent of TCR-induced glycolytic flux and mitochondrial respiration during CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Complementary studies using DMEM media supplemented with Asn showed a significant increase in OCR under mitochondrial stress test conditions, resulting in heightened basal respiration and maximal respiration (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J-M</xref>). In contrast, DMEM media supplemented with alanine, aspartate, glutamate, or proline failed to sufficiently increase OCR under mitochondrial stress test conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J-M</xref>).

Our studies extend this understanding by revealing that extracellular Asn availability is essential for optimal activation and proliferation of helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. This dependency is tightly linked to protein synthesis. By targeting this metabolic dependency, we show that Asn depletion can be used to ameliorate disease severity during autoimmunity driven by pTH17 cells. This is effective whether extracellular Asn is depleted prophylactically or later during active EAE. Our observations suggest that Asn deprivation could potentially restrict the function of pathogenic effector T cells in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.</p>

The relative expression levels of ASNS and timing of Asn depletion also can influence the differentiation states of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> While Asn depletion early during the differentiation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells favored the maintenance of an effector phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, depletion of extracellular Asn late during CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation promoted polarization towards a central memory phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> We find that Asn depletion at early stages of T helper subset polarization inhibits lineage-defining cytokine production. However, further studies are needed to examine the requirement of Asn during later stages of activation and differentiation, as well as its role in supporting the longevity of CD4<sup>+</sup> helper T cell responses. In addition, it remains to be determined whether the generation of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells or their recall responses similarly depend on extracellular Asn availability.</p>
<p>How does Asn depletion impair the proliferation and functional activity of T cells? In this work, we demonstrate that Asn functions as a proteinogenic amino acid, thereby promoting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation and lineage-defining cytokine production. These results are consistent with observations in mammalian cell systems, which highlight the essentiality of Asn in the setting of glutamine deprivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup> Studies have shown that simultaneous glutamine and Asn depletion cripples T cell activation and proliferation, similar to the effects seen when ASNS-deficient T cells are deprived of extracellular Asn.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> Asn essentiality in glutamine deficient conditions is also reflected by their shared role as amino acid exchange factors. In a cell model of liposarcoma, Asn and glutamine export promoted import of amino acids crucial for one-carbon metabolism and mTOR activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup> Since both mTOR activation and one-carbon metabolism are upregulated after TCR stimulation, it is possible that Asn-mediated amino acid exchange activity contributes an additional functional role in supporting CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell activation and proliferation. Our work shows that Asn availability is important for the maintenance of mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, and its depletion promotes accumulation of depolarized mitochondria with a phenotype similar to those observed in exhausted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> Given that Asn can directly bind to and enhance the activity of LCK<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, a key TCR signaling kinase, it is possible that Asn might also interact with other proteins related to mitochondrial respiration. Future studies determining the interactome of Asn in activated T cells will be crucial for uncovering novel regulatory functions of Asn beyond protein synthesis.</p>
<p>Our finding that Asn deprivation can ameliorate the severity of EAE, even after the priming of CNS-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, warrants further investigation in models of autoimmunity and immune dysregulation. It would be interesting to explore whether therapeutic asparaginase could be utilized to prevent the induction or severity of colitis or delay the spontaneous development of diabetes in NOD mice mediated by islet-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Future studies should investigate whether targeted delivery of asparaginases to tissues with autoreactive T cells, such as the inflamed synovium in arthritis, can similarly ameliorate autoimmunity without compromising anti-pathogen immune response essential for the host. In addition, Asn depletion may be beneficial in managing life-threatening immune-related adverse events that some cancer patients develop with immune checkpoint blockade.</p>
<p>In summary, our studies reveal that extracellular Asn availability represents a metabolic vulnerability for the activation and differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, largely due to the requirement for Asn in sustaining protein synthesis. Therapeutic Asn depletion by targeted asparaginase treatment may provide a conceptually novel strategy for autoimmunity.</p>

<p>Non-essential amino acids such as glutamine have been known to be required for T cell general activation through sustaining basic biosynthetic processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis, ATP generation, and protein synthesis. In this <bold>important</bold> study, the authors found that extracellular asparagine (Asn) is required not only for T cells to generally refuel metabolic reprogramming, but to produce helper T cell lineage-specific cytokine, for instance, IL17. In particular, the importance of Asn in IL17 production was <bold>convincingly</bold> demonstrated in the mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitei (EAE) model, mimicking human multiple sclerosis disease.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors reveal that the availability of extracellular asparagine (Asn) represents a metabolic vulnerability for the activation and differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells. To deplete extracellular Asn, they employed two orthogonal approaches: activating naive CD4+ T cells in either PEGylated asparaginase (PEG-AsnASE)-treated medium or custom-formulated RPMI medium specifically lacking Asn. Importantly, they demonstrate that Asn depletion not only impaired metabolic reprogramming associated with CD4+ T cell activation but also reduced CD4+ helper T cell lineage-specific cytokine production, thereby ameliorating the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The experiments presented here are comprehensive and well-designed, providing compelling evidence for the conclusions. The conclusions will be important to the field.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) EAE is the prototypic T cell-mediated autoimmune disease model, and both Th1 and Th17 cells are implicated in its pathogenesis. In contrast, Th2 and Treg cells and their associated cytokines (such as IL-4 and IL-10) have been shown to play a role in the resolution of EAE, and potentially in the modulation of disease progression. Thus, it will be important to determine whether Asn depletion affects the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into corresponding subsets under Th2 and Treg polarization conditions, as well as the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokine production.</p>
<p>(2) EAE is characterized by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to neurological deficits. Myelin destruction is directly correlated with the severity of the disease. For Figure 6, did the authors perform spinal cord histological analysis by hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) or Luxol fast blue (LFB) staining? This is important to rigorously examine pathological EAE symptoms.</p>

<p>While the importance of asparagine in the differentiation and activation of CD8 T cells has been previously reported, its role in CD4 T cells remained unclear. Using culture media containing specific amino acids, the authors demonstrated that extracellular asparagine promotes CD4 T cell proliferation. Consistent with this, depletion of extracellular asparagine using PEG-AsnASE suppressed CD4 T cell activation. Proteomic analysis focusing on asparagine content revealed that, during the early phase of T cell activation, most asparagine incorporated into proteins is derived from extracellular sources. The authors further confirmed the importance of extracellular asparagine in vivo, demonstrating improved EAE pathology.</p>
<p>While the data are well organized and convincing, the mechanism by which asparagine deficiency leads to altered T cell differentiation remains unclear. It is also necessary to investigate the transporters involved in asparagine uptake. In particular, elucidating whether different T cell subsets utilize the same or distinct transport mechanisms would provide important insight into the immunoregulatory role of asparagine.</p>
<p>(1) The finding that asparagine supplementation promotes T cell proliferation under various amino acid conditions is highly significant. However, the concentration at which this effect occurs remains unclear. A titration analysis would be necessary to determine the dose-dependency of asparagine.</p>
<p>(2) The effects of asparagine deficiency occur during the early phase of T cell activation. Thus, it is likely that the transporters responsible for asparagine uptake are either rapidly induced upon activation or already expressed in the resting state. Since this is central to the focus of the manuscript, it is interesting to identify the transporter responsible for asparagine uptake during early T cell activation. A recent paper (DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.ads350) reported that macrophages utilize Slc6a14 to use extracellular asparagine. Is this also true for CD4+ T cells?</p>
<p>(3) Given that depletion of extracellular asparagine impairs differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, it is possible that TCR signaling is compromised under these conditions. This point should be investigated by targeting downstream signaling molecules such as Lck, ZAP70, or mTOR. Also, does it affect the protein stability of master transcription factors such as T-bet and RORgt?</p>
<p>(4) Is extracellular asparagine also important for the differentiation of helper T cell subsets other than Th1 and Th17, such as Th2, Th9, and iTreg?</p>
<p>(5) Asparagine taken up from outside the cell has been shown to be used for de novo protein synthesis (Figure 3E), but are there any proteins that are particularly susceptible to asparagine deficiency? This can be verified by performing proteome analysis, and the effects on Th1/17 subset differentiation mentioned above should also be examined.</p>
<p>(6) While the importance of extracellular asparagine is emphasized, Asns expression is markedly induced during early T cell activation. Nevertheless, the majority of asparagine incorporated into proteins appears to be derived from extracellular sources. Does genetic deletion of Asns have any impact on early CD4+ T cell activation? The authors indicated that newly synthesized Asns have little impact on CD8+ T cells in the Discussion section, but is this also true for CD4+ T cells? This could be verified through experiments using CRISPR-mediated Asns gene targeting or pharmacological inhibition.</p>
