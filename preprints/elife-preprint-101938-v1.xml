<title>Summary</title><p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> causes mild human infections as well as life-threatening invasive diseases. Since the mutations known to enhance virulence to date account for only half of the severe invasive infections, additional mechanisms/mutations need to be identified. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study of <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains to comprehensively identify pathology-related bacterial genetic factors (SNPs, indels, genes, or k-mers). Japanese (<italic>n</italic>=311) and global (<italic>n</italic>=666) cohort studies of strains isolated from invasive or non-invasive infections revealed 17 and 1,075 SNPs/indels and 2 and 169 genes, respectively, that displayed associations with invasiveness. We validated one of them, a non-invasiveness-related point mutation, <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C, by structure predictions and introducing it into a severe invasive strain and confirmed that the mutant showed slower growth in human blood. Thus, we report novel mechanisms that convert <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> to an invasive phenotype and a platform for establishing novel treatments and prevention strategies.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> is a human-restricted gram-positive pathogen associated with a wide spectrum of diseases. While <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> often causes non-invasive diseases, including pharyngitis and impetigo in children, it is also known as a “flesh-eating bacterium” owing to its involvement in life-threatening invasive diseases, such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In 2005, more than 0.6 million people were estimated to have invasive <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, and the reported incidence of invasive <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infections continues to increase globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. In cases of severe infection, rapid bacterial growth and profound metabolic acidosis necessitate urgent surgical inspection and extended debridement with empiric antibacterial chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, even with proper treatment, the mortality rate of patients with <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infections remains 23–81%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, although several protective vaccine candidates against <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> exist, no safe and effective commercial vaccine has yet been licensed for human use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>S. pyogenes</italic> has been classified into at least 240 <italic>emm</italic> types based on the <italic>emm</italic> gene hypervariable region sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Since the mid to late 2000s, <italic>emm</italic>89 strains have been increasingly isolated from samples obtained from patients with invasive diseases, becoming one of the most frequently identified lineages in developed countries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. For example, in the United Kingdom, no more than ten cases of invasive diseases caused by <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> were reported annually in the 1990s. In the 2010s, however, approximately 150 cases were reported out of the 1,000–1,500 invasive cases caused by all <italic>emm</italic> types of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> in each year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Similarly, in Japan, in the 2010s, there was an increase in the number of patients with <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>-induced severe invasive infections. In 2018, <italic>emm</italic>89 strains were isolated from 36% of patients diagnosed with <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>-induced severe invasive infections, following <italic>emm</italic>1 strains, which were isolated from 57% of patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><italic>S. pyogenes emm</italic>89 strains have been genetically sub-clustered into three clades according to the <italic>nga</italic> promoter region patterns and the presence/absence of the <italic>hasABC</italic> locus, which is responsible for hyaluronan capsule synthesis. Clade 3 is distinct from clades 1 and 2 in terms of two features: overexpression of virulence factors NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) and streptolysin O (SLO), owing to mutations in the promoter region of the <italic>nga-ifs-slo</italic> operon, and the lack of a hyaluronan capsule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Although clade 3 strains have frequently been isolated from invasive diseases, their numbers from non-invasive infections have also increased. We previously reported no difference in the isolation frequencies of clade 3 strains between invasive and non-invasive diseases, at least in Japan, and concluded that the mutations in clade 3 are not responsible for the gain of invasiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, there must be other genetic features within the <italic>emm</italic>89 strains that determine their phenotypes.</p>
<p>During infections caused by <italic>emm</italic>1 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, mutations in the two-component system, CovR/S, promote high virulence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. These mutations cause the upregulation of DNase, hyaluronan capsule, IL-8 protease, C5a peptidase, streptokinase, NADase, SLO, and superantigen SpeA, as well as the downregulation of cysteine protease SpeB and streptolysin S<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. The resulting mutants can prevent neutrophil death and subsequently promote tissue destruction and systemic infections. Epidemiologically, Ikebe <italic>et al.</italic> reported that nonsense mutations in <italic>covR</italic> and/or <italic>covS</italic> are present in 46.3% of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains isolated from severe invasive infections in Japan, but only 1.69% of isolates from non-severe ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, these studies indicated that the <italic>covR</italic>/<italic>S</italic> mutation is not responsible for all invasive clinical strains. Thus, we hypothesize that other mechanisms are involved in the development of invasiveness.</p>
<p>In the present study, we aimed to explore novel hypervirulent mechanisms of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on S. <italic>pyogenes</italic>. Our GWAS focused on the <italic>emm</italic>89 lineage of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> to detect lineage-specific factors and minimize false positives due to lineage differentiation. For a comprehensive analysis, we constructed the core genome and pan-genome of <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains and evaluated the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on core gene alignment and accessory clusters of orthologous genes (COGs). In addition, we performed a k-mers-based GWAS to detect SNPs in the intergenic regions and multiple mutations. We collected and sequenced <italic>emm</italic>89 clinical strains isolated in Japan during 2016–2021, in addition to public <italic>emm</italic>89 genome sequences. Using these sequences, we investigated the bacterial factors associated with severe invasive infections in Japan and globally, using GWAS. Based on the bacterial protein structural predictions, we then selected candidates with high potential relevance to the phenotype. Finally, we introduced an SNP related to non-invasiveness into a clinical strain isolated from a severe invasive infection and examined the alteration of the bacterial phenotype through an <italic>ex vivo</italic> infection assay.</p>

<title>Collection of <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> clinical isolates in Japan and construction of cohorts</title>
<p>We collected clinical <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains isolated between 2016 and 2021 from patients with non-invasive and severe invasive infections in Japan. The Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan has defined the clinical criteria of severe invasive β-hemolytic streptococcal infections as STSS, based on the STSS 2010 Case Definition of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US, with minor modifications, including the addition of encompassing symptoms in the central nervous system (Table S1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For the <italic>emm</italic>89 clinical isolates, we collected T serotype TB3264 and untypable strains, in addition to <italic>emm</italic> genotype-identified strains. T-typing is a serologically-based approach that is often used as an alternative or supplement to <italic>emm</italic> typing. T-antigens are trypsin-resistant surface antigens exhibiting extensive antigenic diversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Isolates of a given <italic>emm</italic> type frequently share the same T serotype pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. The T serotype TB3264 corresponds to the genotype <italic>emm</italic>89 or <italic>emm</italic>94<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. A total of 207 clinical isolates were collected with the cooperation of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and ten public health institutes nationwide (Tables S2 and S3). We performed draft genome sequencing of the strains and identified their <italic>emm</italic> types. In total, 150 of these were determined as <italic>emm</italic>89, followed by 24 and 19 strains as <italic>emm</italic>4 and <italic>emm</italic>12, respectively. To focus on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying severe invasive infections in the <italic>emm</italic>89 cohort, we used 150 <italic>emm</italic>89 strains for subsequent analyses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>, Tables S2, and S3). We previously determined the draft genome sequences of 161 <italic>emm</italic>89 strains isolated in Japan between 2011 and 2019 and determined their phenotypes using the same criteria (Table S2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. We combined these two sets and finally considered a total of 311 <italic>emm</italic>89 strains, including 135 severe invasive and 176 non-invasive isolates, as the Japanese cohort.</p>

<p>We also collected public genome sequences of <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains isolated from nine countries to further characterize the genetic properties of the Japanese cohort (Table S2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. In this study, the phenotypes of these strains were considered invasive if the diagnoses included severe infections, STSS, invasive infections, necrotizing fasciitis, bacteremia, or sepsis, and isolation sites were described as normally sterile sites, such as the blood, brain, kidney, muscular tissue, or brain. Consequently, we identified 666 strains in the global cohort, including 420 isolates from invasive cases and 246 from non-invasive ones (Table S2).</p>

<title>Pan-genome and phylogenetic analyses reveal both shared and distinct features in the Japanese and global cohorts</title>
<p>To determine the core genes and gene distribution in both cohorts, we performed pan-genome analyses. In the Japanese cohort, 1,417 core genes common to more than 99% of all isolates were determined out of the 3,334 different genes detected within the 311 strains. In contrast, the global cohort was more diverse, with 4,743 different genes, of which 1,327 were core genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we calculated the phylogenetic relationships based on the maximum likelihood of the core gene sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and S2). The tree for the global cohort branched into four clusters, with clusters A, B1, B2, and B3. Cluster B3 included 640 genetically similar strains isolated mainly from Europe, North America, and Japan, whereas cluster A comprised 19 strains isolated from Oceanian countries, Kenya, Lebanon, the US, and Japan (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). The phylogenetic tree for the Japanese cohort could also be clustered as in the case of the global cohort, with no significant difference in the proportions of strains classified into each sub-cluster (chi-square test, <italic>p</italic>=0.13; Figure S2 and Table S4). Thus, we concluded that the overall phylogenetic features of <italic>emm</italic>89 strains were distributed similarly in Japan and other areas, especially Europe and North America. Within cluster B3, we identified a non-invasive strain from Japan that had no identical pattern to the reported <italic>nga</italic> promoter variations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. This pattern is likely a subtype of clade 3 as it shares the haplotype A<sub>–27</sub>G<sub>–22</sub>T<sub>–18</sub>, which is distinctive of clade 3, but has a mutation in the –10 box (Figure S2)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Thus, we named this novel <italic>nga</italic> promoter variation type 3.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that in cluster B3, 522 strains (80.9%) were ST101, and 96 strains (14.8%) were ST646 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, ST646 was the second most dominant type and a Japan-specific lineage. Moreover, they only differed in the 295<sup>th</sup> nucleotide in the <italic>murI</italic> locus, one of the seven loci that determine MLST, suggesting that both lineages have a genetically close relationship. Eight novel MLSTs were determined (ST1450, 1451, 1452, 1454, 1455, 1456, 1461, and 1463) and 15 novel MLST strains were detected in the Japanese cohort (Figure S1). Taken together, using phylogenetic approaches, we found that most strains from Japan and countries in Europe and North America share genetically close relationships, with only one unique lineage in Japan, ST646.</p>

<title>GWASes detect SNPs/indels associated with invasiveness that are both common and specific to Japan and other countries</title>
<p>To discover all types of genetic variants in whole genes within <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> associated with (severe) invasiveness, we applied pan-genome analysis and performed three types of independent GWASes targeting SNPs in core genes, the presence or absence of all genes, and other variants located in intergenic regions spanning several nucleotides.</p>
<p>We extracted SNPs and single-nucleotide indels from core gene alignments and detected 24,627 and 47,060 SNPs/indels in the Japanese and global cohorts, respectively. Subsequent GWASes identified SNPs/indels associated with severe invasiveness in a Japanese cohort and invasiveness in a global cohort. To control for population bias, we calculated pairwise distance matrices and selected seven and three dimensions for the analyses of the Japanese and global cohorts, respectively (Figure S3A and S3B). For each cohort, we performed a permutation test by conducting 1,000 iterations of calculations with randomly permuted phenotypes, with the significance level set at the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the 1,000 minimal <italic>p</italic>-values (<italic>p</italic>=5.75×10<sup>-4</sup> and <italic>p</italic>=5.75×10<sup>-4</sup> for the Japanese and global cohorts, respectively). The GWAS of the Japanese cohort detected 17 SNPs/indels in 13 core genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Table S5). Of the 17 significant variants, there were 7 single-nucleotide deletions (SNDs), 7 SNPs causing non-synonymous amino acid substitutions, and 3 SNPs causing synonymous substitutions. The <italic>covS</italic> gene (also known as <italic>csrS</italic>), encoding a sensor kinase of the two-component system CovR/S, contains four SNDs with the lowest <italic>p</italic>-values (<italic>p</italic>=1.16×10<sup>−7</sup> for the 39<sup>th</sup>, 40<sup>th</sup>, and 46<sup>th</sup> nucleotides, and <italic>p</italic>=1.15×10<sup>−6</sup> for the 125<sup>th</sup> nucleotide). These four deletions were associated with severe invasive infections.</p>

<p>We also performed a GWAS for the global cohort and detected 1,075 SNPs/indels significantly related to invasive infections among the 360 core genes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref> and Table S6). Among the significant SNPs/indels, 725 caused synonymous substitutions and 319 caused non-synonymous substitutions or frameshift mutations. Moreover, 19 SNPs induced nonsense mutations, whereas the effects of 12 SNPs/indels were unpredictable because of a lack of reference sequences (Table S3). Notably, 96 SNPs/indels accumulated in a single gene, <italic>murJ</italic>, which is involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis, whereas 53 and 51 SNPs/indels were detected in <italic>murE</italic> and <italic>group_1008</italic>, respectively (Figure S3C). The SNP with the lowest <italic>p</italic>-value (<italic>p</italic>=1.35×10<sup>−14</sup>) was <italic>lacE,</italic> which encodes the EIICB component of the lactose-specific phosphotransferase system (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). This mutation was associated with an invasive phenotype and waws mainly observed in strains isolated in the US. Compared with the significant 17 SNPs/indels in the Japanese cohort, 10 SNPs/indels were also detected in the global cohort, including 4 SNDs in <italic>covS</italic> and 1 SNP each in 6 loci (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Deletions at the <italic>covS</italic> locus were common among strains from several countries, including Japan.

<title>GWAS on COGs reveals 2 and 109 genes associated with severe invasiveness in the Japanese cohort and invasiveness in the global cohort, respectively</title>
<p>Next, we examined the associations of accessory COGs with severe invasiveness and global invasiveness in Japanese patients. A permutation test determined significance levels as <italic>p</italic>-values of 1.09×10<sup>-4</sup> and 7.72×10<sup>−5</sup> for the Japanese and global cohorts, respectively. Two significant genes were detected in the GWAS for the Japanese cohort: <italic>group_184</italic>, which encodes a hypothetical protein, and <italic>divIC</italic>, which encodes a septum formation initiator protein (<italic>p</italic>=8.81×10<sup>−6</sup> and <italic>p</italic>=6.72×10<sup>−6</sup>, respectively; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> and Table S7). Although analysis of the global cohort revealed the presence of 169 genes that were significantly related to invasiveness, no genes were identical or homologous to the two genes detected in the Japanese cohort (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, and Table S8). Among the 169 genes, 25 encoded phage-related genes and 14 encoded mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as transposase, integrase, and recombinase. The gene with the lowest <italic>p-</italic>value was <italic>group_829</italic>, which encodes a transposase and is related to the invasive phenotype (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and Table S8).

We identified several gene distribution patterns associated with invasiveness, suggesting that multiple independent genetic factors cause invasive infections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, genes associated with invasiveness were found to encode mobile genetic factors and transporters, whereas major virulence factors were not significantly associated with invasiveness.</p>

<title>K-mers-based GWAS detects both distinctive and identical variants compared to the SNPs- and COGs-based GWASes</title>
<p>To detect SNPs/indels and multiple mutations in the entire genome, we extracted 31-nt-length k-mers from whole genomes and performed a GWAS. The k-mers-based GWAS can handle polymorphisms spanning more than one base, such as indels, inversions, and translocations, in both the coding and non-coding regions.</p>
<p>In the Japanese cohort, the k-mers-based GWAS detected two regions containing causative variants associated with severe invasiveness (Table S9). As shown in the de-Bruijn graphs, overlapping k-mers were concatenated into a single node, and edges represent variability among the sequences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A–F</xref>). The set of connected nodes and edges comprising each de-Bruijn graph is called a complex. Nodes were determined to be significant if their <italic>q</italic>-value was less than 0.05. Significant nodes are shown in red and blue, indicating an association with severe invasive or non-invasive infections, respectively. The complex comprising the nodes with the lowest <italic>q</italic>-value (<italic>q</italic>=1.49×10<sup>−2</sup>) was Comp_11 in the <italic>covS</italic> locus (Table S9). The causative mutations in <italic>covS</italic> were an SND and 10 nucleotide polymorphisms (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). This deletion resulted in a frameshift mutation that shortened the length of CovS from 500 to 35 amino acids, leading to increased invasiveness, as previously reported in other <italic>emm</italic> types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Another complex significantly associated with severe invasiveness is Comp_2 (<italic>q</italic>=4.22×10<sup>−2</sup>; Table S9). Comp_2 is a highly variable region containing eight hypothetical protein-coding genes, with high similarity within the first 75 bp. Significant k-mers were also mapped to the first 26 bp of <italic>group_184</italic> and 20 bp upstream (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). These findings suggest that <italic>group_184</italic> possibly contributes to severe invasiveness through not only its presence but also by that of the upstream region.</p>

</fig>
<p>Next, we analyzed the global cohort and identified mutations that were significantly associated with invasiveness in five regions (Table S10). The mutation with the lowest <italic>q</italic>-value (<italic>q</italic>=1.90×10<sup>-2</sup>) existed in Comp_7 and was identical to the SND in <italic>covS</italic> present in the k-mers-based GWAS of the Japanese cohort. Thus, this SND is global, as are the four SNDs detected in the SNPs/indels-based GWAS.</p>
<p>Two significant k-mers were present in Comp_6, which were found to be an intergenic region of 270 bp (<italic>q</italic>=1.90×10<sup>−2</sup>; Table S10 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). In Comp_24, with a high sequence variation containing <italic>group_141</italic>, <italic>group_142</italic>, and <italic>group_143</italic>, which encode transposases, the presence of a 281-bp sequence consisting of several k-mers was significantly associated with the invasive phenotype (<italic>q</italic>=1.90×10<sup>−2</sup>; Table S10 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>). In Comp_10, n27458, the <italic>sagG</italic> locus encoding the ATP-binding protein of the efflux transporter of SLS, was significantly correlated with the non-invasive phenotype (<italic>q</italic>=2.40×10<sup>-2</sup>; Table S10 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>). However, a significant SNP in n27458, <italic>sagG</italic> (A882G), was found to cause a synonymous mutation. The other significant mutation was present in the <italic>fhuB</italic> locus, encoding a putative ferrichrome transport system permease (<italic>q</italic>=2.40×10<sup>-2</sup>; Table S10). This mutation was identical to SNP T218C detected in the SNP/indels-based GWAS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, this mutation changes the 73<sup>rd</sup> residue from valine to alanine in FhuB, which is a putative ferrichrome transport system permease. Therefore, the k-mer approach identified multiple variants, including the mutation identified in the SNPs/indels-based GWAS, <italic>fhu</italic>B SNP T218C. In addition, while the mutation detected in <italic>covS</italic> differed from that detected in the SNPs/indels-based GWAS, both caused frameshift mutations.</p>

<title>AlphaFold-based prediction of the impact of the identified mutations on function</title>
<p>To assess the impact of mutations on protein function, we predicted the protein structure using AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Here, we present structural predictions for three representative proteins: LacE, whose mutation was observed mainly in invasive strains from the US; CovS, whose invasion-related deletions prevailed worldwide; and FhuB, which carries a prominent mutation in the Japanese cohort and is associated with non-invasiveness.</p>
<p>The invasive-related SNP in <italic>lacE</italic> substitutes the 554th glycine in LacE with valine. LacE was predicted to be a membrane protein with nine transmembrane regions (Figure S4A). LacE is the EIICB component of the lactose-specific phosphotransferase system, and the EIIC and EIIB domains correspond to the transmembrane and intracellular regions, respectively. As shown in magenta in the model, the 554<sup>th</sup> residue is predicted to be in the intracellular EIIB domain (Figure S4B).</p>
<p>Next, we predicted a homodimerized CovS model using AlphaFold, as the CovS of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> forms homodimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. SOSUI predicted that CovS has two transmembrane regions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Mutations detected in the SNP/indels- and k-mers-based GWASes were predicted to shorten the CovS protein to 35 and 45 amino acids, respectively. As the intracellular domain of CovS is in the C-terminal region and is involved in the phosphorylation of the transcriptional regulator CovR, frameshift mutations leading to CovS truncation would inactivate the protein, and thus, CovR function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As described above, the SNP T218C in the <italic>fhuB</italic> locus substitutes the 73<sup>rd</sup> valine of FhuB with alanine. FhuB is a component of an ATP-binding cassette transporter system that utilizes ferrichrome, which is one of the carriers of Fe<sup>3+</sup>. FhuB is predicted to localize to the cell membrane and form a channel with FhuG (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). SOSUI suggested that FhuB and FhuG are 9-transmembrane proteins. The FhuBG complex can bind to one molecule of the extracellular ferrichrome-binding lipoprotein, FhuD, and two molecules of the intracellular ATP-binding protein, FhuC. Therefore, we constructed a structural model of the FhuBCCDG complex (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), which implied that the 73<sup>rd</sup> residue of FhuB exists in a region adjacent to FhuD. The hydrophobicity of the side chain was attenuated by the mutation, which potentially affected ferrichrome transport (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). The SNP G538A in <italic>fhuD</italic> was Japan-specific, significantly related to severe invasiveness, and caused the V180I mutation in FhuD (Figure S3C). The prediction suggested that the</p>
<p>180<sup>th</sup> residue is in an α-helix distant from the active site or the interactive sites with FhuB. Both valine and isoleucine are branched-chain amino acids, and the amino acid residue is located on a rigid structure, the α-helix (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, we believe that this mutation is less likely to cause structural changes than the other non-synonymous mutations.</p>

<title>The <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C mutation inhibits the growth of a severe invasive strain in human blood</title>
<p>Based on the GWAS results and predicted protein structures, we focused on the SNP <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C. We constructed a mutant strain, in which the SNP <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C was introduced, to further investigate its potential virulence. We selected the strain TK02 which carries the wild-type (WT) allele T218 in <italic>fhuB</italic> and was originally isolated from a sample obtained from a patient with severe invasive infection in Japan. We used a several times-passaged TK02 strain, TK02’, as a WT strain and introduced the SNP <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C into it <italic>via</italic> allelic exchange mutagenesis with a thermo-sensitive shuttle vector.

<p>To reveal the effects of the SNP on invasiveness, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the WT and <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C strains in THY broth and human blood. Principal component analysis revealed that the differences in the overall transcriptional profiles between the strains were more remarkable in blood than in THY (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>, 6B, and Tables S11–14).

<p>Next, to investigate the effects of SNP on bacterial survival in human blood, we performed a bactericidal assay using human blood. At 2 and 3 h after incubation, the <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C mutant strain exhibited a significantly decreased survival rate than that of the WT strain (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). To further determine the blood components that the attenuated survival of the mutant can be attributed to, we compared bacterial survival rates in erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, plasma, heat-inactivated plasma, and brain heart infusion broth (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>–<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7G</xref>). Notably, after incubation with erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear cells, or plasma, the <italic>fhuB</italic> T218C mutant strain exhibited a significantly lower survival index than that of the WT strain, at 2 and 3 h after incubation, as observed in whole blood (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7C</xref>–<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref> and 7G). However, there were no significant differences between the survival rates of the WT and mutant strains in heat-inactivated plasma, suggesting that the mutant strain is susceptible to complement (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, the polymorphism T218C in <italic>fhuB</italic> impaired the survival of severe invasive strains in human blood through interactions with erythrocytes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study focused on <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> causing globally expanding invasive infections. We constructed a workflow for bacterial GWAS and explored the bacterial genetic factors related to severe or invasive infections to reveal the plausible mechanisms of pathogenesis. We independently performed GWASes for Japanese and global cohorts to investigate the associations of variants with strictly defined phenotypes in severe invasive <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infections and with phenotypes in a broader context of invasive infections. Several GWASes have been conducted on <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> to date. Davies <italic>et al.</italic> extracted k-mers from the genomes of 1,944 strains of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> with broad <italic>emm</italic> genotypes and assessed their associations with invasiveness, and Kachroo <italic>et al.</italic> performed GWAS on k-mers using 442 <italic>emm</italic>28 strains isolated from either invasive or non-invasive infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. However, no studies have described the combined analysis of SNPs, genes, and k-mers exclusively using <italic>emm</italic>89 strains that share genetically close genomes and, thus, a large number of core genes. The investigations we performed led to the discovery of a tremendous number of causative variants, including not only SNPs in core genes but also accessory genes and insertions spanning intergenic regions.</p>
<p>Spontaneous mutations in <italic>covR</italic>/<italic>S</italic> genes potentiate the transition from localized to invasive infection by M1T1 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. We demonstrated that some SNDs in the <italic>covS</italic> locus were significantly related to the phenotypes in both the SNPs/indels- and k-mers- based GWASes. CovS forms a two-component system with CovR that regulates the transcription of operons encoding virulence factors when phosphorylated by the histidine sensor kinase CovS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Sumby <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that systemic invasive infections are caused by the overexpression of virulence factors through the inactivation of CovS, as a result of the introduction of a depletive mutation in the <italic>covS</italic> locus after infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Several mutation sites causing such overexpression, such as the 7 nt insertion in <italic>covS</italic> of <italic>emm</italic>1 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> and the insertion of adenine at the 877<sup>th</sup> nucleotide, have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Ikebe <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated variations in the lengths of mutant CovS proteins by analyzing the gene sequences of 164 STSS strains in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. In line with their study, we found that the shortening of CovS that potentially occurred owing to frameshifts caused by SNDs is significantly associated with invasive infections, potentially contributing to the upregulation of virulence factors and invasiveness.</p>
<p>In contrast, we observed several factors associated with invasiveness to be independent of <italic>covR</italic>/<italic>S</italic> mutations. Based on conformational predictions, we selected SNPs with non-synonymous substitutions that were likely to affect protein function. Our transcriptomic analysis suggested that the Japan-specific <italic>fhuB</italic> mutation contributes to the growth rate of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> in human blood by adapting to the environment. In addition, <italic>emm</italic>89 clade 3 carries the identical promoter region pattern of the <italic>nga</italic> operon as <italic>emm</italic>1 strains, and the pattern conferred similarly high expression of <italic>nga</italic> and <italic>slo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Our RNA-seq data demonstrated that a severe invasive Japanese strain without <italic>covS</italic> mutations increased the expression of <italic>speB</italic>, <italic>nga</italic>, <italic>slo</italic>, and genes in the <italic>sag</italic> operon in the blood. Although <italic>covR</italic>/<italic>S</italic> mutations downregulate the expression of SpeB and SLS, SpeB and SLS act as virulence factors, allowing <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> to invade host tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. These data suggest that severe invasive infections have multiple gene expression profiles in addition to <italic>covR</italic>/<italic>S</italic> mutation-induced profiles within a single lineage, <italic>emm</italic>89, and that the synergy between optimizing bacterial survival in human blood and upregulating multiple virulence factors contributes to the development of severe invasive infections.</p>
<p>In addition, we propose two possible roles of the <italic>FhuB</italic> V73A mutation in the pathogenesis of severe invasive infections. First, the mutation in <italic>FhuB</italic> could increase bacterial susceptibility to free radicals generated in the presence of ferric ions in the blood. Generally, ferric ions are essential for the survival of almost all living organisms. Catalyzed by ferric ions, the Fenton and Haber–Weiss reactions generate hydroxyl radicals in erythrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Previously, we provided evidence that the iron in erythrocytes partially inhibits pneumococcal growth <italic>via</italic> a free radical-based mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Although no significant difference was observed in the intracellular ferric ion concentration in the present study, the structural changes in FhuB may have caused an increased generation of free radicals in bacterial cells and the prevention of bacterial survival in human blood. Second, the <italic>FhuB</italic> mutation could affect bacterial transcriptional profiles and result in reduced fitness for survival in human blood. We also observed a lower survival rate of the mutant strain with polymorphonuclear cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref>). Lower <italic>emm</italic> transcription in the mutant may lead to attenuated immune evasion. The M protein can bind C4-binding protein and factor H and inactivate the deposited C4b and C3b, leading to limited surface opsonization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. Furthermore, complements could have inhibited the proliferation of the mutant strain, as suggested by the activation of the membrane attack complex (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7E</xref>). Although the mechanisms of the <italic>FhuB</italic> V73A mutation in the interaction with each blood component must be further elucidated, our results indicated that the 73<sup>rd</sup> residue of FhuB is a key factor for bacterial survival in human blood during systemic infection.</p>
<p>Recently, He <italic>et al.</italic> reported that antibodies against the ferrichrome-binding protein FtsB, also known as FhuD, decrease blood bacterial burden and skin abscess formation in murine models infected with <italic>emm</italic>1 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. FhuD is a lipoprotein that has been studied as a potential vaccine candidate against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. The detailed function and effect of the FhuBCCDG complex in <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> remain unknown; however, at least in <italic>emm</italic>1 strains, the complex can be expressed and localized abundantly on the cell membrane. Hence, this complex may be a promising target for vaccines against <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>.</p>
<p>Our gene-based GWAS revealed no significant correlation with the distribution of genes encoding virulence factors. This finding minimizes the possibility that invasive infections are the result of the acquisition of virulence factors by non-invasive strains and indirectly supports the hypothesis that changes in gene expression profiles cause invasive infections. Although no vaccine has been commercialized against <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, given the possibility that the pathogen has multiple gene expression patterns, even within a single lineage, it may be difficult to develop a universal vaccine with a single antigen, and a vaccine containing multiple antigens may be effective.</p>
<p>In the global cohort, 169 genes were related to the phenotype, including 25 phage- and 14 MGE-related genes. The genome of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> is rich in prophages, phage-like chromosomal islands, and MGEs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Prophages and MGEs sometimes function as vectors of virulence factors and antibiotic-resistance genes through interspecies and intraspecific transmission. Common superantigen-coding genes, such as <italic>speA</italic>, <italic>speC</italic>, <italic>speG</italic>, <italic>speH</italic>, <italic>speI</italic>, <italic>speJ</italic>, <italic>speK</italic>, and <italic>speL</italic>, and DNase-coding genes, such as <italic>spd1</italic>, are exogenous genes derived from prophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, in the genome of <italic>S. pyogenes,</italic> there are broad MGEs where <italic>erm</italic> and <italic>mefA</italic> related to macrolide resistance and <italic>tetM</italic> involved in resistance to tetracyclines are located<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. In the present study, we observed no direct association between invasiveness and virulence or antibiotic-resistance genes located in the prophages and MGEs. One possible explanation is that significantly related genes reflect the process of not only gain but also loss of factors affecting the fitness cost. Given that we also identified hypothetical genes associated with this phenotype, we assumed that there is an unknown mechanism contributing to the pathogenesis of invasive infections.</p>
<p>In the present study, MLST analysis revealed that 522 of the 666 strains belonged to ST101. Following ST101, ST646 was the second most prevalent lineage in the Japanese cohort and was not detected in any other country. In addition, the difference between ST101 and ST646 was found only at the 295<sup>th</sup> nucleotide in <italic>mulI</italic>, among the seven genes subjected to MLST typing. Our phylogenetic trees also suggested that ST101 and ST646 have a close phylogenetic relationship. Five previous studies have described ST646 in <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, and all of them reported <italic>emm</italic>89 ST646 strains isolated in Japan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Furthermore, all ST646 strains were isolated from the 4,249 <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains in the MLST database PubMLST<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>. Therefore, ST646 appears to be specific to <italic>emm</italic>89 strains and a unique lineage in Japan. Notably, Ubukata <italic>et al.</italic> also reported that ST646 strains began increasing after 2012, whereas the ST101 lineage was dominant until 2008<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. Taken together, we conclude that ST646 is possibly a relatively new and Japan-specific lineage of <italic>emm</italic>89 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>.</p>
<p>Our study had three limitations. First, because we sequenced bacterial genomes using short-read sequencing, we could not detect large bacterial genome rearrangements by comparing complete genome sequences. Thus, we were unable to investigate the effects of long genomic structural dynamics, such as inversions, on pathogenesis. Second, the clinical information associated with the isolates was limited; therefore, our analyses did not reflect host information, such as age, sex, and underlying health conditions. Third, we only used bacterial genetic distances based on core genome sequences as covariates in the GWAS. A combined GWAS of the host and pathogen in <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> infection would highlight the relationship between host risk factors and bacterial genetic variants.</p>
<p>In this study, we revealed the genotype-phenotype associations found in not only the known factors represented by <italic>covS</italic> but also factors that are related to invasiveness, including <italic>fhuB</italic>. Moreover, we experimentally validated the contribution of the <italic>fhuB</italic> mutation to bacterial survival in human blood. This study demonstrates the potential of our genomic statistical approach for elucidating the pathogenesis of invasive infections. Further analyses of the invasiveness-related factors identified in this study could provide a platform for establishing novel treatments and preventive strategies against invasive infections.</p>

<title>Clinical isolates in Japan</title>
<p>Clinical isolates were collected from public health institutions in Tokyo, Osaka, Yamaguchi, Fukushima, Kobe, Kyoto, Amagasaki, Sapporo, and Niigata, Japan. We defined the strains collected as STSS according to the Infectious Diseases Control Law in Japan. Non-invasive strains were defined based on diagnostic names, including asymptomatic, pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or non-invasive infections. Strains with no diagnostic names for the non-STSS strains were defined as non-invasive based on the isolate sites. Information on all the strains included in this study is presented in Table S3. The collected <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> strains were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in Todd Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY; both from BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and stored in THY broth with 30 % glycerol (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), at –80°C.</p>

All collected sequences were subjected to quality checks using Fastp v.0.20.1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. For newly isolated strains in Japan, <italic>emm</italic> typing was performed using the emm-typing-tool v.0.0.1, and only sequences of strains determined as <italic>emm</italic>89 were used for the following analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. All <italic>emm</italic>89 sequence data were then subjected to <italic>de novo</italic> assembly using SKESA v.2.4.0, with default parameters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>. Next, the MLST of each sequence was performed using MLST v.2.19.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup>.

Roary generated a core gene alignment and the distribution of all genes among the strains. To extract SNPs/indels from core genes, including single-nucleotide indels, snp-sites v.2.5.1 with the option “-v” was used. The output files were further processed using BCFtools v.1.9, with the parameter “norm -m –”, enabling analysis of multiple alleles in the GWAS. In parallel, k-mers were extracted using DBGWAS v.0.5.3, and the length of k-mers was set as 31 nt using the “-k 31” parameter of DBGWAS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>

<p>To investigate the associations between phenotypes and genotypes, including SNPs/indels and genes, we performed a GWAS using pyseer v.1.3.4<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref></sup>. The VCF file of SNPs/indels or the gene distribution matrix was designated as the genotype. To remove biases derived from lineages, we added information on the genetic distances between all pairs of strains as covariates using mash v.2.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. Briefly, <italic>de novo</italic> assemblies were compressed through conversion into minimum hash values using the command “mash sketch -s 10000.” Subsequently, the commands “mash dist” and “square_mash” were utilized to generate a genetic distance matrix expressed with Jaccard coefficients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>. The obtained matrix underwent eigenvalue decomposition, and the number of eigenvalues used for multidimensional scaling was visually determined using the plot of the relationships between the eigenvalues and contribution ratios. The number of eigenvalues and the distance matrix were then added as pyseer parameters. The pyseer calculation was iterated 1,000 times with randomized phenotypes, and the 5-percentile value of the minimal <italic>p-</italic>value in each calculation was set at the significance level. Using R and the package ggplot2, the results were visualized as a Manhattan plot for the SNPs/indels-based GWAS and a volcano plot for the genes-based GWAS, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref></sup>.

All <italic>E. coli</italic> strains were cultured in Luria Bertani broth, at 37°C, with agitation. For selection and maintenance of mutants, antibiotics were added to the media at the following concentrations: carbenicillin (Nacalai Tesque), 100 µg/mL for <italic>E. coli</italic>; and spectinomycin (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation), 100 µg/mL for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>.</p>

<title>Transcriptomic analysis</title>
<p>The <italic>fhuB</italic> WT and mutant strains were harvested in 30 mL of THY broth, of which 1 mL was dispensed into 10 mL of THY and the remainder was centrifuged and resuspended in 2 mL of heparinized human blood. Bacterial mixtures with THY or blood were dispensed into three aliquots and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. THY samples were centrifuged and resuspended in RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). For each blood sample, 2 volumes (1 mL) of RNA protection bacteria reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were added. L5, included in the PureLink™ Total RNA Blood Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), was added to remove erythrocytes. The bacterial cell wall was mechanically lysed in Lysing Matrix B using a MagNA Lyser (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). After centrifugation, the total bacterial RNA was extracted using a Quick-RNA™ Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Full-length cDNA was generated using the SMART-Seq<sup>®</sup> HT Kit (Takara Bio), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Pair-end libraries were generated using a Nextera XT DNA Kit and sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 system (both from Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequenced data were preprocessed using Trimmomatic v.0.33 and FastQC v.0.12.1. The reads were mapped to the complete MGAS27061 genome (NCBI reference sequence: NZ_CP013840.1) using STAR v.2.7.0a. After a second quality check using FastQC, read counting was performed using featureCounts v.1.5.2 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Differentially expressed genes were identified using iDEP v.0.96 and gene annotations from NCBI and Prokka were combined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref></sup>. Plots were created using iDEP and the R package ggplot2.</p>

<title>Intracellular ferric ion assay</title>
<p>Human plasma was obtained through centrifugation of heparinized human blood, after 30 min of incubation at 37°C. The WT and <italic>fhuB</italic> mutant strains were harvested at the exponential phase, resuspended into 1 mL of THY or serum, and then incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Viable bacterial cells were counted as colony-forming units (CFUs) by plating the diluted samples onto THY agar plates. Intracellular ferric ions were measured using a QuantiChrom™ Iron Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 50 µL of standards or samples in 96-well plates were mixed with 200 µL QuantiChrom™ Working Reagent and incubated at 20–24°C for an hour. The optical density at the wavelength of 600 nm was measured using an Infinite<sup>®</sup> 200 Pro F Plex Instrument (TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). The assay was repeated three times, and the results of the respective experiments were combined. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test.</p>

<title>Bactericidal assay</title>
<p>The bactericidal assay was performed as described previously, with minor modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">76</xref></sup>. Briefly, whole blood was collected from healthy adults. Human neutrophils and erythrocytes were prepared using PolymorphPrep™ (Serumwerk Bernburg, Bernburg, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Heparinized human blood was centrifuged at 500 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min, to isolate erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, which were then suspended in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640 medium containing L-glutamine and Phenol Red (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical Corporation). Heat-inactivated plasma was prepared at 56°C for 30 min.</p>
<p>Subsequently, 195 µL of heparinized human whole blood, erythrocytes in RPMI-1640, polymorphonuclear leukocytes in RPMI-1640, plasma, heat-inactivated plasma, or brain heart infusion broth (BD Biosciences), and 5 µL of early exponential phase bacteria with 0.9–2.0×10<sup>4</sup> CFUs/well were mixed in 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C, in an atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, for 1, 2, and 3 h. Viable bacterial cells were counted as CFUs by plating the diluted samples onto THY agar plates. The growth index was calculated as the number of CFUs at a specified time point divided by the number of CFUs in the initial inoculum. The assay was repeated three times, and the results of the respective experiments were combined. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test. Differences were considered statistically significant at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, using Prism v.7.0c (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p>

<p>Studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Osaka University Graduate School of Dentistry (approval nos. H26-E43 and H29-E16-2). The donors provided written informed consent to participate in the human blood bactericidal assay. For the <italic>S. pyogenes</italic> collection, as we retrospectively obtained clinical isolates of <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, we utilized an opt-out consent procedure instead of obtaining written informed consent from the patients.</p>

<p>This study provides a <bold>valuable</bold> and timely analysis of invasive and non-invasive Streptococcus pyogenes emm89 isolates, which have become a dominant serotype in the past decade. Using genome sequencing of 311 strains from Japan and comparing them with 666 global strains, the authors present <bold>compelling</bold> evidence in support of the identification of genetic factors linked to the invasive phenotype of emm89. The findings are both theoretically and practically significant in medical microbiology.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors sequenced emm89 serotype genomes of clinical isolates from patients in Japan, where the number of invasive Group A Streptococcus (GAS), especially those of the emm89 serotype, has drastically increased over the past 10-15 years. The sequences from this cohort were compared against a large collection of publicly available global isolates, yielding a total of almost 1000 genomes in the analysis. Because the researchers focused on the emm89 serotype, they could construct a common core genome, with subsequent ability to analyze genomic differences in accessory genes and intergenic regions that contributed to the invasive phenotype using multiple types of GWAS analysis (SNP, k-mer). Their analysis demonstrates some mutations responsible for invasiveness are specific to the Japanese strains, and that multiple independent virulence factors can contribute to invasiveness. None of the invasive phenotypes were correlated with new gene acquisition. Together, the data support that synergy between bacterial survival and upregulation of virulence factors contributes to the development of severe infection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• The authors verify their analysis by confirming that covS is one of the more frequently mutated genes in invasive strains of GAS, as has been shown in other publications.</p>
<p>• A mutation in one of the SNPs attributed to invasiveness (SNP fhuB) was introduced into an invasive strain. The authors demonstrate that this mutant strain survives less well in human blood. Therefore, the authors have experimental data to support their claims that their analysis uncovered a new mutation/SNP that contributed to invasiveness.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• It would be helpful for the authors to highlight why their technique (large scale analysis of one emm type) can yield more information than a typical GWAS analysis of invasive vs. non-invasive strains. Are SNPs easier to identify using a large-scale core genome? Is it more likely evolutionarily to find mutations in non-coding regions as opposed to the core genome and accessory genes, and this is what this technique allows? Did the analysis yield unexpected genes or new genes that had not been previously identified in other GWAS analyses? These points may need to be made more apparent in the results and deserve some thought in the discussion section.</p>
<p>• The Alpha-fold data does not demonstrate why the mutations the authors identified could contribute to the invasive phenotype. It would be helpful to show an overlay of the predicted structures containing the different SNPs to demonstrate the potential structural differences that can occur due to the SNP. This would make the data more convincing that the SNP has a potential impact on the function of the protein. Similarly, the authors discuss modification of the hydrophobicity of the side chain in the ferrichrome transporter (lines 317-318) due to a SNP, but this is not immediately obvious in the figure (Fig. 5).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to identify genetic determinants associated with the invasion profile of Streptococcus pyogenes strains of the emm89 type, which has been increasingly linked to invasive infections. The study leverages both in-house sequenced genomes and publicly available genomic data. Several GWAS approaches are applied to these datasets, leading to the identification of potential genetic targets. For these targets, the authors conduct additional analyses, including three-dimensional structural modeling of the encoded proteins, as well as the development of mutant strains. The functional impact of these mutations is further explored through transcriptomic comparisons between the mutants and wild-type strains</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this manuscript include the large amount of data analyzed and the various methodologies applied. The identification of CovS, a gene known to influence the invasion profile, as a significant variation further validates the methodology employed in this study. Then, the gene fhuD is an intriguing target, identified through both bioinformatics and wet lab approaches.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I do not identify any additional weaknesses in the manuscript, beyond those already acknowledged by the authors themselves.</p>
