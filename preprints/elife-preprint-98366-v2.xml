<title>Abstract</title><p>This study investigates the variability among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in their responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Recognizing that patients with advanced-stage NSCLC rarely qualify for surgical interventions, it becomes crucial to identify biomarkers that influence responses to ICI therapy. We conducted an analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from 33 lung cancer biopsy samples, with a particular focus on 14 core samples taken before the initiation of palliative ICI treatment. Our objective was to link tumor and immune cell profiles with patient responses to ICI. We discovered that ICI non-responders exhibited a higher presence of CD4+ regulatory T cells, resident memory T cells, and TH17 cells. This contrasts with the diverse activated CD8+ T cells found in responders. Furthermore, tumor cells in non-responders frequently showed heightened transcriptional activity in the NF-kB and STAT3 pathways, suggesting a potential inherent resistance to ICI therapy. Through the integration of immune cell profiles and tumor molecular signatures, we achieved an discriminative power (AUC) exceeding 95% in identifying patient responses to ICI treatment. These results underscore the crucial importance of the interplay between tumor and immune microenvironment, including within metastatic sites, in affecting the effectiveness of ICIs in NSCLC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Treatment landscape in cancer has rapidly evolved with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). Among various immune checkpoints, antibody-targeting programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have demonstrated clinical benefits over conventional systemic chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). They have been approved as either monotherapy in patients with high PD-L1 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> or combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy regardless of PD-L1 expression <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Moreover, the clinical benefits were validated in unresectable stage III NSCLC as consolidation therapy after definitive chemoradiotherapy or early stage NSCLC (Ib-IIIA) as adjuvant therapy after curative surgery <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>There have been many efforts to elucidate the predictive biomarkers of PD-(L)1 inhibitors. The PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue evaluated via immunohistochemistry has been incorporated as a companion diagnostic biomarker from the early clinical trials, which enhanced the response rate up to 46% in patients with PD-L1 â¥50% and showed an overall survival rate of up to 26.3 months <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Other biomarkers, such as tumor mutation burden or gene expression profile, also demonstrated a positive predictive value <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. Recent large-scale meta-analysis of clinico-immunogenomics shows that both tumor- and T cell intrinsic factors exert a substantial impact on ICI response <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, supporting the necessity of in-depth investigation of high-throughput profiles of tumor and microenvironment.</p>
<p>ICI treatment modifies systemic immune responses, which can be monitored by alterations in the proportion of specific immune cell populations. An increase in PD-1+Ki67+CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood after PD-1 inhibitor treatment is associated with better outcomes in patients with NSCLC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. This cell type has also been identified in tumor tissues prior to the ICI treatment, where it is linked to clinical outcomes, and shows impaired production of classical effector cytokines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. More specifically, PD-1 expression is upregulated upon antigen recognition <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, indicating that certain T cells in the tumor microenvironment are actively engaged as tumor-specific T cells. Beyond CD8+ T cells, other immune cell types, such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells or regulatory T cells, which regulate tumor-specific T cell immunity may also influence therapeutic outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Overall, the multicellular regulation of the tumor-immune microenvironment emphasizes the importance of profiling systemic tumor and immune cells at single cell resolution to investigate factors associated with responses to ICI treatment.</p>

<title>Variability and features of the lung cancer samples</title>
<p>We conducted scRNA-seq on 33 lung cancer samples from 26 patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) between August 2017 and December 2019 to understand how cellular dynamics in lung cancer affect treatment sensitivity to PD-(L)1 inhibitors, used alone or in combination (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> and Table S1). Immune checkpoint therapy provides clinical benefit in advanced metastatic NSCLC across different treatment lines <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Notably, our samples have been collected from various tissue sites. In the scRNA-seq analysis, all specimens were used for the cell type profiling in an unbiased manner. For the evaluation of clinical outcomes, only refined 14 core samples from 11 patients were used to minimize sample specific variations. Exclusion criteria from the core group encompass samples with treatment applied as adjuvant therapy, acquired after ICI treatment, no tumor content, non-evaluable for the clinical response, or histology other than non-small cell lung cancer such as nuclear protein in testis (NUT) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Of the 11 core patients, 8 had adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 3 had squamous cell carcinoma (SQ). Clinical outcomes of ICI were partial response (PR) in four patients, stable disease (SD) in two patients, and progressive disease (PD) in five patients. Patients were classified as responders (PR) and non-responders (SD and PD) according to ICI response.</p>

<p>Due to the diversity of sample collection sites, our data may be influenced by varied immune cell composition at different sample collection sites. Therefore, we analyzed immune and stromal cell subsets across early-stage (tLung) and late-stage (tL/B) lung tumors, and metastatic lymph nodes (mLN), comparing them to normal lung (nLung) and lymph node (nLN) tissues. This analysis was conducted on public scRNA-seq data from 43 samples from 33 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> (Fig. S1a-c). Although there were differences in tissue-specific resident populations, we found that the immune cell profiles, especially T/NK cells of mLN were similar to those of primary tumor tissues (Fig. S1d-g).</p>

<title>Classification of immune cell subset in lung cancer</title>
<p>Global cell-type profiling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref> and Table S2) illustrates the cellular composition of each sample as epithelial/tumor cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, T/natural killer (NK) cells, B/plasma cells, myeloid immune cells, and mast cells. Individual samples show variations in epithelial/tumor content as well as in immune cell composition (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d,e</xref>). For further analysis of immune cell subtypes, we applied sequential subclustering on global immune cell clusters. As scRNA-seq shows limited performance in separating CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, antibody-derived tag (ADT) information <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> was used to complement the transcriptome data and to predict CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NK cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Finally, fourteen CD4+ and fourteen CD8+ T cell subclusters were identified excluding &lt;5% ambiguous cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and Table S2). In the CD4+ T cell compartment, naÃ¯ve-like T cells (TN, CD4_cluster0) and central memory T cells (TCM, CD4_cluster1) expressing <italic>SELL, TCF7, LEF1,</italic> and <italic>CCR7</italic> genes or tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM, CD4_clusters3, 5, 6) expressing <italic>NR4A1, MYADM,</italic> and <italic>PTGER4</italic> genes were abundant in most samples. Regulatory T cells (Treg, CD4_cluster2) with <italic>FOXP3, CTLA4, ICOS,</italic> and <italic>BATF</italic> expression were also abundant, which has been demonstrated as tumor-specific alterations in the tissue microenvironment <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In the CD8+ T cell compartment, effector memory T cells (TEM), effector T cells (TEFF), effector memory CD45RA positive cells (TEMRA) (CD8_clusters0, 2, 3, 8) expressing <italic>PRF1</italic> and <italic>IFNG</italic> were dominant over TN/TCM (CD8_clusters4, 5) types. Exhausted T cells (TEX, CD8_clusters1, 12) expressed multiple checkpoint genes (<italic>HAVCR2</italic> and <italic>PDCD1</italic>) along with high levels of <italic>PRF1</italic>, <italic>IFNG</italic>, <italic>CXCR3,</italic> and <italic>CXCL13</italic>. Co-expression of cytotoxic effectors and checkpoint molecules in TEX clusters indicates that cluster populations may retain functional capacity as cytotoxic effector T cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Further, clonotype analysis of TCR supported the T cell subset classification demonstrating higher clonal expansion in the CD8+ T cell compartment than that in CD4+ T cells, with the highest levels within the TEX subclass (Fig. S2a-c).</p>

<p>Compared to T cell clusters, fewer B/plasma cells were detected as follicular (B_clusters 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 11), germinal center (B_cluster 10), and plasma/mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) B cells (B_clusters 3, 7, 12) (Fig. S3a,b and Table S2). Plasma/MALT B cells manifested higher levels of clonal expansion of BCR than follicular B cells (Fig. S3c,d). Identical clonality of some follicular B and plasma cells suggests in situ maturation and differentiation of B cells to plasma cells in tumor tissues (Fig. S3c, clonotype 16).</p>
<p>Myeloid cells were composed of monocytes, dendritic cells, and a large number of macrophages (Fig. S3a,b and Table S2). CD14+CD16-classical monocytes (Myeloid_clusters1,6) were predominantly found over non-classical CD14<sup>lo</sup>CD16+ types (Myeloid_cluster15). Alveolar macrophages (Alveolar Mac, Myeloid_cluster0) expressed well-defined marker genes such as <italic>MARCO</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, and <italic>MCEMP1</italic> along with anti-inflammatory genes such as <italic>CD163, APOE,</italic> and <italic>C1QA/B/C</italic>. Monocyte-derived macrophages represent heterogeneous populations with a similar gene expression profile to alveolar macrophages (Mo-Mac, Myeloid_clusters2, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13), with an elevated chemokine gene expression (CXCL10+ Mo-Mac, Myeloid_clusters4, 14, 16), or with active cell cycle progression (Proliferating Mac, Myeloid_cluster7). Dendritic cells were categorized as CD1c+ (Myeloid_cluster8, <italic>CD1C</italic> and <italic>ITGAX</italic>), activated (Myeloid_cluster17, <italic>CCR7</italic> and <italic>LAMP3</italic>), and CD141+ (Myeloid_cluster19, <italic>CLEC9A</italic> and <italic>XCR1</italic>) subclusters.

<title>Immune cell landscape fostering the ICI response</title>
<p>In global cell-type profiling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,c</xref>), abundance in T, NK, or myeloid cell types shows no difference between responders and non-responders (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d, e</xref>). Nonetheless, as specific differentiation features within the cell types may influence the response to ICI treatment, we compared the response groups using the proportion of subclusters within CD4+ T, CD8+ T, NK, B/plasma, and myeloid cells. After subclustering (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and Fig. S3a), three subsets of CD4+ T cells, i.e., Treg, TRM, and CD4+ T helper 17 (TH17), were significantly (p&lt;0.01) overrepresented in the non-responder group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In contrast, among CD8+ T cell populations, TEM subsets demonstrated a modest level of association with the patients who responded well against progressive disease (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d, p</xref>=0.06). TCR clonotype analysis supported the cellular dynamics such that clonal expansion was more prominent in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells over CD4+ Tregs in the responder group (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> and Fig. S2c). Overall landscape in each cell type (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>) suggests that CD4+ Treg and TRM as well as follicular B cells may interfere with the ICI response, whereas CD8+ T cell activation (TEM, TEMRA/TEFF, and TEX), mature NK cells, and CXCL10+ Mo-Mac cells support the ICI response. The balance between separate immune cell types informs immune regulatory axes that may be targeted to favor the activation of tumor-reactive immunity.</p>

<title>Tumor cell signatures associated with ICI response</title>
<p>We investigated the associations between genomic characteristics in tumor and ICI response. The constraints of mutation analysis with 10x chromium data complicated the direct correlation between tumor mutation burden and ICI outcome. Rather, we assessed copy number alterations (CNA) indirectly, via chromosomal gene expression patterns. These analyses revealed a moderate correlation between low levels of CNA, including both gain and loss of heterozygosity, and positive responses to ICI (Fig. S4). This finding is consistent with the result from previous genetic association studies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess gene expression characteristics of tumors influencing ICI response, we separated malignant tumor cell clusters from normal epithelial cell types (Fig. S5). Subsequent DEG analysis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref> and Table S3) identified genes in poor response groups linked to the regulation of cell death, cell motility, and cell activation (Fig. S6 and Table S4). The DEGs were refined later by combinations of various tumor signatures separating responder and non-responder groups (Table S5).</p>

<p>Next, to explore the existence of gene programs and modules influencing the ICI response, we applied factorization using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and scINSIGHT <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Among 30 factors from NMF across all malignant cells, we identified factors showing high loadings for a specific RECIST group as NMF programs p1â¼4 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b, c</xref>). There were clear distinction among RECIST groups according to the gene expression levels associated with these NMF programs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref> and Table S5). To identify gene modules consistent across different patients, we examined RECIST-specific modules though scINSIGHT analysis <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Unfortunately, we found that contributions to these gene modules varied significantly among patients. To mitigate this variability, we adjusted the RECIST-specific modules by combining genes from the original modules (Table S5). The refined gene modules showed a specific gene expression pattern for each RECIST group, similar to the NMF programs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Overall, both genes and their functional categories segregated depending on the selection techniques used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g, h</xref>). However, transcription factors governing the signatures derived from DEG, NMF, and scINSIGHT analyses consistently delineated between responders and non-responders (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>). Responder-specific gene signatures showed associations with the transcription factors Regulatory Factor X Associated Ankyrin Containing Protein (RFXANK), Regulatory Factor X Associated Protein (RFXAP), and Regulatory Factor X5 (RFX5). This RFX protein complex has emerged as a positive biomarker for the immune response in diverse cancer types <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Non-responder-specific gene signatures were regulated by Activator Of Transcription 3 (STAT3) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B Subunit 1 (NFKB1), known to play roles in PD-L1 regulation and T cell activation in cancer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We also adopted principal component analysis (PCA) to isolate correlated gene signatures variably expressed in tumor cells (Fig. S7, and Table S4, S5). Among the top 10 PCs, negatively correlated genes in PC2, PC7, and PC8 distinguished the tumor cells in the poor response groups, whereas positively correlated genes in PC6 and PC9 were upregulated in the better response groups (Fig. S8a-c). Tumor cells from the PR group had low PC2.neg scores, suggesting low growth factor/type I interferon response signaling as a tumor cell-specific positive predictor of the ICI response. Conversely, high levels of growth factor/type I interferon response signaling in tumor cells may present intrinsic resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone or in combination. Type I interferon is known to drive anti-tumor effect directly or indirectly on tumor and surrounding immune cells, but also acts to counter the anti-tumor effect by inducing CD8+ T cell exhaustion and up-regulating immune-suppressive genes on tumor cells <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. We assessed whether tumor cell signatures are applicable in association with ICI response in other tumors. They had a modest influence on the response to ICI treatment of melanoma (Fig. S8d) in bulk gene expression data <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These tumor cell signatures were specifically linked to elucidating the ICI response, but did not demonstrate any prognostic value for LUAD or lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) in the TCGA RNA sequencing data (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Combination of tumor signatures and immune cell dynamics classify ICI response</title>
<p>Immune cell dynamics or tumor signature alone has a limited capacity to profile the therapeutic outcome of PD-(L)1 inhibitor alone or in combination (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). Similar to the immune cell blocks and tumor signatures that were over-represented in the poor response group, each of CD4+ Treg, CD4+ TH17, PC7.neg, INT.down, and UNION.down was significantly associated with ICI response in univariate regression analysis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). PC7.neg denotes genes negatively correlated with PC7, a principal component extracted from PCA that distinguishes tumor cells in poor response groups. INT.down and UNION.down represent the intersection and union of down-regulated genes in the responder group, respectively. The variation in ICI response was not affected by clinical variables of tissue origin, cancer subtype, pathological stage, and smoking status. When we performed a combined analysis of the top tumor-immune features to classify response, the discriminative power (AUC) was improved to over 95% (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Overall, features of the non-responders, especially CD4+ Treg, B/Plasma cells, INT.down, and UNION.down, showed a higher estimate than those of responders.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ICI alone, or in combination with chemotherapy, are considered standard first-line therapy for patients with NSCLC. NSCLC may harbor large numbers of genetic perturbations due to genotoxic environmental exposure, which likely generate high mutation burden or neoantigens <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. The neoantigen-directed T cell response is hampered by diverse immune suppressive mechanisms exerted by tumor cells and the immune regulatory network <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Current ICIs targeting PD-(L)1 aim one angle of many suppressive mechanisms, and identifying the features of non-responders will reveal additional regulatory angles to improve ICI response.</p>
<p>Immune regulatory network would determine the balance between activation and suppression of tumor-directed immunity. In previous studies, prediction of the response to ICI highlighted CD8+ cytotoxic effector T cells and CD4+ Tregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. The involvement of effector CD8+ T cells is consistent in most studies regardless of the cellular origin (blood or tissues) or tumor type (melanoma, lung cancer) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Their phenotypes slightly differ depending on the cellular resolution of the study. Our data provided the highest resolution cell types, and CD8+ TEM cells (<italic>GZMK</italic>, <italic>CXCR4</italic> expression) were overrepresented in the responders. By comparison, Tregs were underrepresented in the responder group. Previously, our group reported a contrasting result demonstrating an increase in Tregs in the posttreatment blood samples (not baseline) in the responder group <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. This discrepancy can be explained by the differences in the measurements, sites, and timing of sampling, and the resolution of subpopulations. In mouse preclinical models, PD-L1 inhibitor treatment induces T cell expansion of all phenotypes including CD4+/CD8+ TEFF and Tregs <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Thus, Treg expansion captured in the posttreatment blood samples may represent overall immune activation in human patients. Alternatively, heterogeneity of Tregs and complex effects of PD-(L)1 inhibition on this cell type may contribute to variable results in response prediction.</p>
<p>The identification of an abundance of CD4+ TRM cells as a negative predictor of ICI response is an unexpected finding, considering that higher frequencies of TRM cells in lung tumor tissues are generally associated with better clinical outcomes in NSCLC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>. This is largely due to their role in sustaining high densities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and promoting anti-tumor responses. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that TRM cell subsets coexpressing PD-1 and TIM-3 are relatively enriched in patients who respond to PD-1 inhibitors <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, recent findings suggest that pre-existing TRM-like cells in lung cancer may promote immune evasion mechanisms, contributing to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that the roles of TRM subsets in tumor immunity are highly context-dependent.</p>
<p>Similarly, CD4+ TH17 cells, which were overrepresented in the non-responder groups, exhibit context-dependent roles in tumor immunity and may be associated with both unfavorable and favorable outcomes <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In exploring tumor cell signatures linked to ICI response, non-responder attributes were regulated by STAT3 and NFKB1. The STAT3 and NF-ÎºB pathways are crucial for Th17 cell differentiation and T cell activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>. Notably, STAT3 activation in lung cancer orchestrates immunosuppressive characteristics by inhibiting T-cell mediated cytotoxicity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. The combined influence of the Th17/STAT3 axis and TRM cell activity in predicting ICI response underscores the complexity of these pathways and suggests that their roles in tumor immunity and therapy response warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>In search of tumor cell signatures associated with the response to ICI, we adopted two approaches, an individual gene level comparison between the responder and non-responder group and a feature extraction approach to decompose data using the NMF and PCA. Both approaches highlighted attributes of non-responders governed by key transcription factors, which play a significant role in immune response regulation. The ability to predict ICI response based on tumor signatures was as accurate as predictions based on immune cell behavior. Integrating data from both immune and tumor cells enhanced the discriminative power (AUC) for identifying responder, suggesting the presence of both interactive and distinct mechanisms of resistance.</p>
<p>Our study has limitations. Primarily, most samples were obtained from metastatic lymph nodes rather than original tumor tissues, potentially not reflecting the tumor microenvironment accurately. However, prior study <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup> and Fig. S1 have shown that the immune microenvironment within metastatic lymph nodes closely resembles that of lung tumor tissues, rather than normal lymph nodes. On a positive note, our findings indicate that the immune landscape of metastatic lymph nodes can predict ICI response. Another challenge is the small sample size and the issue of gene expression drop-out, necessitating further studies with a larger patient cohort. Despite these limitations, our study stands out by employing high-throughput scRNA-seq to both tumor cells and immune microenvironment, offering a comprehensive analysis of the multicellular factors that affect ICI response in patients with advanced NSCLC.</p>

<title>In silico classification of CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cells</title>
<p>We characterized CD4+ T, CD8+ T, and NK cell populations by combined analysis of gene and protein expression using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing data from primary tumor and normal lungs. Among the cells in clusters annotated as T/NK cells, we identified CD3-expressing cells with CD3D or CD3E or CD3G &gt;0 at the RNA level. CD4 and CD8 positive cells were then identified with a cutoff at 55th percentile of antibody-derived tags (ADT) level. NK cells were identified based on the RNA expression level of NK cell markers (<italic>XCL1</italic>, <italic>NCAM1</italic>, <italic>KLRD1</italic>, and <italic>KLRF1</italic>) in CD3 negative cells.

<p>The authors utilized single-cell RNA-seq profiling of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient tumor samples to generate <bold>useful</bold> insights into the determinants of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) responsiveness in NSCLC patients. While some of the findings add weight to the current literature, the analysis is <bold>incomplete</bold> due to the small cohort size and heterogeneous population which has limited their ability to draw statistically supported conclusion after adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing, as well as the lack of functional characterization of the findings. This study would benefit from external cohorts to both validate the findings and justify the statistical analysis undertaken.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study the variability of patient response of NSCLC patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors using single-cell RNA sequencing in a cohort of 26 patients and 33 samples (primary and metastatic sites), mainly focusing on 11 patients and 14 samples for association analyses, to understand the variability of patient response based on immune cell fractions and tumor cell expression patterns. The authors find immune cell fraction and clonal expansion differences, as well as tumor expression differences between responders and non-responders, partly validating previous hypotheses, and partly suggesting new markers for ICI response. Integrating immune and tumor sources of signal the authors claim to improve prediction of response markedly, albeit in a small cohort and using in-sample metrics.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The problem of studying the tumor microenvironment, as well as the interplay between tumor and immune features is important and interesting and needed to explain heterogeneity of patient response and be able to predict it.</p>
<p>
- Extensive analysis of the scRNAseq data with respect to immune and tumor features on different axes of hypothesis relating to immune response and tumor immune evasion using state of the art methods.</p>
<p>
- The authors provide an interesting scRNAseq data set with well-curated cell types linked to outcomes data, which is valuable</p>
<p>
- High-quality immune cell type annotation including annotations based on additional ADT data</p>
<p>
- Integration of TCRseq to confirm subtype of T-cell annotation and clonality analysis</p>
<p>
- Interesting analysis of cell programs/states of the (predicted) tumor cells and characterization thereof</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- Generally a very heterogeneous and small cohort where adjustments for confounding is hard. Additionally, there are many tests for association with outcome, where necessary multiple testing adjustments negate signal and confirmation bias likely, so biological take-aways have to be questioned.</p>
<p>
- The authors claim a very high &quot;accuracy&quot; performance, however given the small cohort and possible overfitting due to in-sample ROC the generalization of this to other cohorts is questionable.</p>
<p>
- Due to the small cohort with a lot of variability, more external validation is needed to be convincingly reproducible, especially when talking about AUC/accuracy of a predictor.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors have utilised deep profiling methods to generate deeper insights into the features of the TME that drive responsiveness to PD-1 therapy in NSCLC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strengths of this work lie in the methodology of integrating single cell sequencing, genetic data and TCRseq data to generate hypotheses regarding determinants of IO responsiveness.</p>
<p>Some of the findings in this study are not surprising and well precedented eg. association of Treg, STAT3 and NFkB with ICI resistance and CD8+ activation in ICI responders and thus act as an additional dataset to add weight to this prior body of evidence. Whilst the role of Th17 in PD-1 resistance has been previously reported (eg. Cancer Immunol Immunother 2023 Apr;72(4):1047-1058, Cancer Immunol Immunother 2024 Feb 13;73(3):47, Nat Commun. 2021; 12: 2606 ) these studies have used non-clinical models or peripheral blood readouts. Here the authors have supplemented current knowledge by characterization of the TME of the tumor itself.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the study is hampered by the small sample size and heterogeneous population and whilst the authors have attempted to bring in an additional dataset to demonstrate robustness of their approach, the small sample size has limited their ability to draw statistically supported conclusions. There is also limited validation of signatures/methods in independent cohorts and no functional characterisation of the findings. Because of these factors, this work (as it stands) does have value to the field but will likely have a relatively low overall impact.</p>

<p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors study the variability of patient response of NSCLC patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors using single-cell RNA sequencing in a cohort of 26 patients and 33 samples (primary and metastatic sites), mainly focusing on 11 patients and 14 samples for association analyses, to understand the variability of patient response based on immune cell fractions and tumor cell expression patterns.

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Generally, a very heterogeneous and small cohort where adjustments for confounding are hard. Additionally, there are many tests for association with outcome, where necessary multiple testing adjustments would negate signal and confirmation bias likely, so biological takeaways have to be questioned.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comment. We made multiple testing adjustments as suggested in âRecommendations for Authors.â</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>RNAseq is heavily influenced by the tissue of origin (both cell type and expression), so the association with the outcome can be confounded. The authors try to argue that lymph node T-cell and NK content are similar, but a quantitative test on that would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the influence of tissue of origin on immune and stromal cell populations. In the revised Figure S1g, we quantified the similarity using Euclidean distances of centroids between sample groups based on their tissue of origin in the PC1 and PC3 plot.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors claim a very high &quot;accuracy&quot; performance, however, given the small cohort and lack of information on the exact evaluation it is not clear if this just amounts to overfitting the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the concern about the high âaccuracyâ potentially indicating overfitting. To address this, we revised the manuscript to clarify the use of 'accuracy,' 'AUC,' and 'performance' with clearer expressions in the following sections: Abstract (Line 57), Results (Line 264), Discussion (Lines 320-321), Methods (Lines 546-547), Legends for Figure 5c and Figure S8b.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Especially for tumor cell program/state analysis the specificity to the setting of ICIs is not clear and could be prognostic.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. As outlined in the âTable 2 in the revised manuscriptâ, we conducted a multivariate survival analysis of tumor signature candidates using the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD, n = 533) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC, n = 502) cohorts to evaluate their prognostic potential. No tumor cell programs or states were found to be associated with overall survival in either LUAD or LUSC. We added descriptions related to Table 2 in the Results (Lines 249-251) and Methods (Lines 530-542) section.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Due to the small cohort with a lot of variability, more external validation is needed to be convincingly reproducible, especially when talking about AUC/accuracy of a predictor.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Expanding the cohort size was difficult due to limited resources. We recognize the challenges posed by the small and heterogeneous cohort. We have acknowledged these limitations and applied statistical corrections to address them.</p>

There is also limited validation of signatures/methods in independent cohorts, no functional characterization of the findings, and the discussion section does not include discussion around the relevance/interpretation of key findings that were highlighted in the abstract (eg. role of Th17, TRM, STAT3, and NFKb). Because of these factors, this work (as it stands) does have value to the field but will likely have a relatively low overall impact.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the challenges posed by the small and heterogeneous cohort. To address this, we tempered our claims related to accuracy by applying statistical testing corrections. We also appreciate the feedback on functional characterization and have expanded the discussion in the revised manuscript to include an overview of specific cell populations and genes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Related to the absence of discussion around prior TRM findings, the association between TRM involvement in response to IO therapy in this manuscript is counter to what has been previously demonstrated (Cell Rep Med. 2020;1(7):100127, Nat Immunol. 2017;18(8):940-950., J Immunol. 2015;194(7):3475-3486.). However, it should be noted that the authors in this manuscript chose to employ alternative markers of TRM characterisation when defining their clusters and this could indicate a potential rationale for differences in these findings. TRM population is generally characterised through the inclusion of the classical TRM markers CD69 (tissue retention marker) and CD103 (TCR experienced integrin that supports epithelial adhesion), which are both absent from the TRM definition in this study. Additional markers often used are CD44, CXCR6, and CD49a, of which only CXCR6 has been included by the authors. Conversely, the majority of markers used by the authors in the cell type clustering are not specific to TRM (eg. CD6, which is included in the TRM cluster but is expressed at its lowest in cluster 3 which the authors have highlighted as the CD8+ TRM population). Therefore, whilst there is an interesting finding of this particular cell cluster being associated with resistance to ICI, its annotation as a TRM cluster should be interpreted with caution.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can sometimes fail to detect the expression of classical cell type markers due to incomplete capture of a cellâs transcriptome. To determine cell identity, we utilized cell type markers established in previous scRNA-seq studies. In response to your comments, we have added the expression levels of classical TRM markers, including CD69, CD103 (ITGAE), CD44, CXCR6, and CD49a (ITGA1), in the revised Figure 2c. Although these markers were not exclusively expressed in TRM clusters, TRM clusters exhibited relatively high levels of these genes while lacking other clustersâ specific marker genes.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>General suggestions:</p>
<p>When analyzing the association of cell type proportions with outcomes, some adjustment for multiple testing should be considered (either sampling-based, e.g. permutation test, or adjustment based on assumptions of independence of tests, e.g. Bonferroni).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your comments. As suggested, we calculated the adjusted p-value using the False Discovery Rate for the association of cell type proportions with outcomes in Figure 3a. The heatmap in Reviewer's ONLY Figure 1, using the adjusted p-value consistently showed the expected grouping of cell types and outcomes. However, the significance did not meet the conventional statistical cutoff criteria. We acknowledge this limitation, which results from statistical testing based on ratio values.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>A formal test of clonotype differences (normalized to cell type fraction) would be great as the shown plot 2e could be confounded by cell number and type differences between responders and non-responders.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have revised Figure 2e to display the relative clonotype differences versus CD4+ and CD8+ T cell fractions in each sample. The relative clone size of each cell was calculated by dividing the size of each clone by the total number of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells, respectively.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It could be made a bit more clear when the core group of patients was used (only when associating with outcomes?) and when all other patients were used as well (only cell type annotation?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer correctly noted, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on all specimens, but only the core group of patients was used for the comparative analysis between the responder and non-responder groups. This information has been detailed in the manuscript (Lines 103-105).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For immune cells, it would be interesting to look at expression patterns (NMF, scINSIGHT) as well, not just immune cell fractions and expansion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In contrast to tumor signatures, immune cell programs are more directly tied to their functional characteristics. Therefore, we focused on annotating immune cells based on their functional properties and conducted comparative analyses between responders and non-responders.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Multiple testing is necessary for the univariate association analysis. Some adjustments for confounders in a multivariate model (despite the size) could be informative.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As shown in âReviewer's ONLY Table 1â, we conducted a multivariate regression analysis of immune and tumor signatures for ICI response, adjusting for clinical variables such as tissue origin, cancer subtype, pathological stage, and smoking status. However, the results were not significant, likely due to the heterogeneity and small size of the cohort.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>It is not clear from the manuscript how &quot;accuracy&quot; is measured. The terms &quot;accuracy&quot; and &quot;AUC&quot;, as well as &quot;performance&quot; are used interchangeably, a section in the methods with the precise definition is needed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the manuscript to clarify the terms 'accuracy,' 'AUC,' and 'performance' by using clearer expressions in the following sections: Abstract (Line 57), Results (Line 264), Discussion (Lines 320-321), Methods (Lines 546-547), Legends for Figure 5c and Figure S8b.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Furthermore, it has to be clear if this is in-sample performance or if there was some train/test split or cross-validation used. Given the small cohort size and wealth of features finding some combination of predictors that could overfit on responders/non-responders would not be surprising.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer has noted, we acknowledge the statistical limitations due to the small cohort size. We have revised the sentence on Lines 545-547 âClassification models of responders and non-responders for PC signatures and combinatorial indexes between tumor and/or immune cells were generated based on in-sample performanceâ¦â.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Suggestions to improve readability:</p>
<p>Line 84: The sentence should be reformulated to improve understanding.</p>

<p>We have revised sentences in lines 81-93.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>&quot;Tumor-infiltrating PD-1 positive T cells have higher capacity of tumor recognition than PD-1 negative T cells&quot; Please look to rephrase this sentence as this is not entirely accurate: PD-1 is upregulated in tumor-experienced T cells as a consequence of antigen recognition ie those cells that recognise tumor will increase PD-1, whereas the sentence as it's currently written indicates that PD1+ cells have an intrinsically increased capacity to kill tumors, which is incorrect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have revised the sentence âTumor-infiltrating PD-1 positive T cells have higher capacity of tumor recognition than PD-1 negative T cellsâ in lines 86-88 as âMore specifically, PD-1 expression is upregulated upon antigen recognition (PMID29296515), indicating that certain T cells in the tumor microenvironment are actively engaged as tumor-specific T cells.â in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Cancer subtype abbreviations (eg. SQ, ADC, NUT) are used in figures in the main article and so should be defined in the main text (they are currently only explained in the legend for the supplementary table).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As per the reviewerâs suggestion, the manuscript has been revised to include definitions of cancer type abbreviations in lines 108-110.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Figure S1d-f does not appear to corroborate the statement that &quot;Although there were differences in tissue-specific resident populations, we found that the immune cell profiles, especially T/NK cells of mLN were similar to those of primary tumor tissues indicating the activation of immune responses were 118 consistently observed at metastatic sites (Figure S1d-f).&quot; The diagrams are complex (please explain all abbreviations) and it is not clear how the authors have come to this conclusion. Additionally, cell quantity does not indicate that the 'activation of immune responses' is consistently observed at metastatic sites as these cells could be dysfunctional/bystander.</p>

<p>In the revision, we have quantified the diagrams (Figure S1f) to more clearly highlight the differences in tissue-specific resident populations. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate the impact of tissue origin on immune and stromal cell populations. In the revised Figure S1g, we illustrated the quantitative similarity between sample groups using Euclidean distances in the PC plot based on their tissue of origin. Additionally, the legends for Figures S1d and S1e have been updated to include definitions for all abbreviations.</p>
<p>We agree with the reviewer's comment that cell quantity alone may not fully reflect activation of antigen-specific immune responses, even though we annotated the functional T cell subtypes. To better focus on the comparisons of cellular profiles between metastatic sites (mLN) and primary tumors (tLung and tL/B), we removed the sentence ââ¦indicating the activation of immune responses were consistently observed at metastatic sites (Fig. S1d-f).â from the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>In Figure 2c, classical markers for TRM (CD103, CD69) should be included in the description for the definition of the TRM clusters, or their exclusion appropriately explained. The findings regarding the negative correlation between follicular B cells and ICI response are surprising. Figure S3, the cluster identified as Follicular B cells contains MS4A1 (CD20) and HLA-DRA. Classical markers are CD20 (pan-B cell), CD21 (CR2), CD23, and IgD/IgM (double positive), and as such it is not clear if the authors have appropriately annotated this cluster as representing follicular B cells. These classical markers should be included in the interpretation of the cell clustering or their exclusion appropriately explained.</p>

<p>We appreciate your comments. In response, we have added the expression levels of classical TRM markers such as CD69, CD103 (ITGAE), CD44, CXCR6, and CD49a (ITGA1), in the revised Figure 2c. Additionally, we revised the dot plot showing the mean expression of marker genes in each cell cluster for B/Plasma cells (revised Figure S3b) by incorporating classical markers for Follicular B cells, such as CD21 (CR2), CD23 (FCER2), IgD (IGHD), IgM (IGHM).</p>

<p>Figure 2f is rather confusing for the reader. I would recommend changing to an alternative plot that shows logP and response in a different way. If keeping to this plot type please clarify why plotting response vs PD, and whether the lower left quadrant indicates patients with progressive disease and the top right indicates responders as the interpretation is not clear currently.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your feedback. To address the concerns raised, we have updated the figure legend for Figure 2f to clarify the interpretation of the quadrants: âThe lower left quadrant shows cell types overrepresented in the poor responder groups, while the upper right quadrant indicates cell types overrepresented in the better responder groupsâ. This clarification aims to help readers understand that the lower left quadrant reflects cell types associated with worse treatment outcomes, while the upper right quadrant reflects cell types associated with improved therapeutic responses.</p>

<p>The terms &quot;PC7.neg, INT.down, and UNION.down&quot; are included in the results with no explanation to the reader of what they are or how to interpret them. The methods description &quot;We constructed DEGs with 470 intersections (INT) and union (UNION) of up- or down-regulated genes for comparisons&quot; does not sufficiently describe how they were generated/calculated and, therefore, this is difficult for the reader to interpret in the final results section. Please add an additional explanation for the reader in the final section of the results/Figure 5 and in the methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we added additional explanation in the Results section (lines 258-261): âPC7.neg denotes genes negatively correlated with PC7, a principal component extracted from PCA that distinguishes tumor cells in poor response groups. INT.down and UNION.down represent the intersection and union of down-regulated genes in the responder group, respectively.â. We also explained the details in the Methods section (lines 489-495): âWe reconstructed DEGs as four groups: INT.up, INT.down, UNION,up, and UNION.down, based on with the intersection (INT) and union (UNION) of up- or down-regulated genes for pairwise comparisons between responder versus non-responder, PR versus PD, and PR versus SD. INT.up and INT.down represent the intersection of up- and down-regulated genes in the responder group, respectively. UNION.up and UNION.down represent the union of up- and down-regulated genes in the responder group, respectively.â</p>

<p>The TRM and Th17+ T cell populations are highlighted in the abstract as being related to ICI resistance, but these populations of cells are not even mentioned in the discussion. Likewise, STAT3 and NFkb pathways are also highlighted in the abstract but absent in the discussion section. Please discuss the relevance of these findings, particularly given the prior studies demonstrating the opposite impact of TRM populations in NSCLC.</p>

<p>We have expanded the discussion in the revised manuscript (Lines 295-313) to address the roles of TRM and Th17+ T cell, as well as the STAT3 and NF-ÎºB pathways, in association with ICI resistance in NSCLC.</p>
<p>âThe identification of an abundance of CD4+ TRM cells as a negative predictor of ICI response is an unexpected finding, considering that higher frequencies of TRM cells in lung tumor tissues are generally associated with better clinical outcomes in NSCLC (PMID28628092). This is largely due to their role in sustaining high densities of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and promoting anti-tumor responses. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that TRM cell subsets coexpressing PD-1 and TIM-3 are relatively enriched in patients who respond to PD-1 inhibitors (PMID31227543). However, recent findings suggest that pre-existing TRM-like cells in lung cancer may promote immune evasion mechanisms, contributing to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies (PMID37086716). These observations suggest that the roles of TRM subsets in tumor immunity are highly context-dependent.</p>
<p>Similarly, CD4+ TH17 cells, which were overrepresented in the non-responder groups, exhibit context-dependent roles in tumor immunity and may be associated with both unfavorable and favorable outcomes (PMID34733609; PMID30941641). In exploring tumor cell signatures linked to ICI response, non-responder attributes were regulated by STAT3 and NFKB1. The STAT3 and NF-ÎºB pathways are crucial for Th17 cell differentiation and T cell activation (PMID24605076; PMID32697822). Notably, STAT3 activation in lung cancer orchestrates immunosuppressive characteristics by inhibiting T-cell mediated cytotoxicity (PMID31848193). The combined influence of the Th17/STAT3 axis and TRM cell activity in predicting ICI response underscores the complexity of these pathways and suggests that their roles in tumor immunity and therapy response warrants further investigation.â</p>
