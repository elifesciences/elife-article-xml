<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Senescent cells, which are characterized by multiple features such as increased expression of Senescence-Associated β-galactosidase activity (SA β-gal) and cell cycle inhibitors such as p21 or p16, accumulate with tissue damage and dysregulate tissue homeostasis. In the context of skeletal muscle, it is known that agents used for chemotherapy such as Doxorubicin cause buildup of senescent cells, leading to the inhibition of tissue regeneration. Senescent cells influence the neighboring cells via numerous secreted factors which form the senescence-associated secreted phenotype (SASP). Lipids are emerging as a key component of SASP that can control tissue homeostasis. Arachidonic acid-derived lipids have been shown to accumulate within senescent cells, specifically 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, which is an electrophilic lipid produced by the non-enzymatic dehydration of the prostaglandin PGD<sub>2</sub>. In this study, we show that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is also released by Doxorubicin-induced senescent cells as a SASP factor. Treatment of skeletal muscle myoblasts with the conditioned medium from these senescent cells inhibits myoblast fusion during differentiation. Inhibition of L-PTGDS, the enzyme that synthesizes PGD<sub>2</sub>, diminishes the release of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> by senescent cells and restores muscle differentiation. We further show that this lipid post-translationally modifies Cys184 of HRas in skeletal muscle cells, causing a reduction in the localization of HRas to the Golgi, increased HRas binding to RAF RBD, and activation of cellular MAPK-Erk signaling (but not the Akt signaling). Mutating C184 of HRas prevents the ability of 15d- PGJ<sub>2</sub> to inhibit the differentiation of muscle cells and control the activity of HRas. This work shows that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> released from senescent cells could be targeted to restore muscle homeostasis after chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Senescent cells are important drivers of aging and damage-associated loss of tissue homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Childs et al., 2015</xref>). Anti-cancer chemotherapy presents an important context where treatment with chemotherapeutics such as Doxorubicin (Doxo) causes widespread cellular senescence which inhibits tissue homeostasis and regeneration, including in skeletal muscles(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Francis et al., 2022</xref>). It has been shown that Doxo causes systemic inflammation and leads to the emergence of senescent cells across tissues(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Di Leonardo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hu and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robles and Adami, 1998</xref>). Senescent cells negatively affect tissue homeostasis and regeneration by releasing factors including proteins like growth factors, matrix metalloproteases, cytokines, and chemokines, and small molecules like fatty acid derivatives(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Campisi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Dilley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Krtolica et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Parrinello et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Shelton et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Yang et al., 2006</xref>). The release of these factors from senescent cells is called the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP). It is expected that these SASP factors and their mechanisms of action will vary depending on cellular and tissue contexts. Identifying SASP factors and their underlying mechanistic targets will be critical for building an understanding of how senescent cells control tissue homeostasis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Davalos et al., 2010</xref>). Lipids are a less explored family of SASP factors, and it is important to understand how they affect tissue regeneration(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Hamsanathan and Gurkar, 2022</xref>). We have previously shown that senescent cells have increased intracellular levels of prostaglandin 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wiley et al., 2021</xref>), a non-enzymatic dehydration product of prostaglandin PGD<sub>2</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>). In the context of skeletal muscle, PGD<sub>2</sub> and 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> have been shown to negatively regulate muscle differentiation via mechanisms that do not depend on a cognate receptor(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hunter et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Veliça et al., 2010</xref>). Here we study the role of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> as a member of the SASP and identify the mechanisms by which it might negatively affect muscle regeneration. 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> has been previously shown to covalently modify multiple proteins like MAPK1, MCM4, EIF4A-I, PKM1, GFAP etc. in endothelial and neuronal cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Marcone and Fitzgerald, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>). 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> was shown to be covalently modifying HRas in NIH3T3, Cos1, and IMR90 cell lines(Luis Oliva et al., 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wiley et al., 2021</xref>). We further studied HRas as an important target that might mediate the effects of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> on muscle differentiation via covalent modification. We investigated HRas as a possible effector of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> because (i) HRas belongs to the Ras superfamily of small molecule GTPases and is a known regulator of key cellular processes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Davis et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Harvey, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Kirsten and Mayer, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001</xref>). (ii) constitutively active HRas mutant (HRas V12) has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts by inhibiting MyoD and Myogenin expression(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Konieczny et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lassar et al., 1989</xref>; Olson,’ et al., 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Van Der Burgt et al., 2007</xref>). (iii) Downstream signaling of HRas is important for muscle homeostasis as skeletal and cardiac myopathies are observed in individuals carrying constitutively active mutants of HRas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Engler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Konieczny et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; Olson,’ et al., 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Scholz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Van Der Burgt et al., 2007</xref>). HRas is highly regulated by lipid modifications, it undergoes reversible palmitoylation and de-palmitoylation at C-terminal cysteines, which regulate the intracellular distribution and activity of HRas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Gutierrez et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Lu and Hofmann, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>). In this study, we show that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is synthesized and released by senescent myoblasts upon treatment with Doxo. 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, taken up by the myoblasts, covalently modifies HRas at cysteine 184 and activates it. We also show that previously reported inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> depends on HRas C-terminal cysteines, notably cysteine 184. This study provides a mechanism by which prostaglandins secreted as SASP inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts, affecting muscle homeostasis in patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p>

<title>Doxorubicin (Doxo) treatment induces senescence in mouse skeletal muscles and C2C12 mouse myoblasts</title>
<p>Doxorubicin-mediated DNA damage has been shown to induce senescence in cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Di Leonardo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Hu and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robles and Adami, 1998</xref>). Therefore, we injected B6J mice intraperitoneally with Doxorubicin (Doxo) (5mg/kg) every 3 days for 9 days and observed induction of DNA damage-mediated senescence in hindlimb skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>). We observed an increase in the expression of p21 and increased nuclear levels of the DNA damage marker γH2A.X in mouse Gastrocnemius muscles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A and B</xref>). We also observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of known senescence markers (p16 and p21), SASP factors (CXCL1, CXCL2, TNF1α, IL6, TGFβ1) in skeletal muscles of mice treated with Doxo compared to that of mice treated with saline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These observations suggest that there is induction of senescence in skeletal muscles of mice upon treatment with Doxo.</p>

<title>Doxo-mediated senescence induces synthesis and release of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> in C2C12 myoblasts and mouse skeletal muscle</title>
<p>Synthesis of prostaglandins by senescent cells has previously been reported(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wiley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Wiley and Campisi, 2021</xref>). Specifically, levels of PGD<sub>2</sub> and its metabolite 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> have been shown to be significantly increased in senescent cells. Therefore, we measured the levels of mRNA of enzymes involved in the synthesis of PGD<sub>2</sub>/15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (PTGS1, PTGS2, and PTGDS), in the gastrocnemius muscle of mice after treatment with Doxo. We observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of PTGS1, PTGS2, and PTGDS enzymes in the skeletal muscle of mice treated with Doxo (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We also observed a time-dependent increase in the mRNA levels of PTGS1, PTGS2, PTGDS, and PTGES enzymes in C2C12 cells treated with Doxo compared to Day 0 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>). Expression of enzyme PTGES was elevated on Day 4, whereas the expression of Prostaglandin D synthase (PTGDS) increased only after Day 8, reaching maximum expression on Day 12. These observations suggest an increase in the synthesis of prostaglandins in senescent cells.</p>
<p>15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is a non-enzymatic dehydration product of PGD<sub>2</sub>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>). We observed an increase in the mRNA levels of synthetic enzymes of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> in senescent C2C12 cells. Therefore, we measured the levels of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> released by senescent C2C12 cells using targeted mass spectrometry (Fig. S1C, D, E, and F). The concentration of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> was quantified by monitoring the transition of the m/z of ions from 315.100 → 271.100 using a SCIEX 6500 mass spectrometer. We plotted a standard curve using purified 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (Fig. S1F) to quantify the concentration of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>. We used the representative peaks from the conditioned medium collected from C2C12 cells incubated in 0.2% serum medium for 3 days (Quiescent cells) and C2C12 cells treated with Doxo (150 nM) (Senescent cells) to measure the concentration of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> released by quiescent cells or senescent C2C12 cells. We observed a significant increase (∼100 fold) in the concentration of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> in the conditioned medium from senescent cells as compared to that in quiescent cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>). This suggests that senescent C2C12 cells release 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> in the medium.</p>

<title>Prostaglandin PGD<sub>2</sub> and its metabolites in the conditioned medium of senescent cells inhibit the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts</title>
<p>15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (the final non-enzymatic dehydration product of PGD<sub>2</sub>) has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hunter et al., 2001</xref>). We observed the release of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> by senescent cells, showing that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is a SASP factor (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).

Therefore, we tested whether 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, the terminal dehydration product of PGD<sub>2</sub>, is required for the inhibitory effect of SASP on the differentiation of myoblasts. We treated C2C12 myoblasts with the conditioned medium of senescent cells or senescent cells treated with 30 µM of AT-56 (a well-characterized inhibitor of prostaglandin D synthase (PTGDS))(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; Shunfeng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Hu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Irikura et al., 2009</xref>) and measured the differentiation of myoblasts by calculating the fusion index. We observed a significant decrease (∼20%) in the fusion index of the C2C12 myoblasts treated with the conditioned medium of senescent cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), suggesting that SASP factors decrease the differentiation of myoblasts.

We measured the effect of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> on the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. We treated C2C12 myoblasts with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (10 µM) or DMSO in DMEM 10% Serum medium for 72 hours and observed a significant decrease in the proliferation of C2C12 cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The doubling time of C2C12 cells was also increased upon treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (57.24 hours) compared to DMSO (13.76 hours). This suggests that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> decreases the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts.</p>
<p>We measured the differentiation of C2C12 mouse and primary human myoblasts after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>. To rule out the toxic effects of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> on cell physiology, we treated C2C12 cells with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (1 µM, 2 µM, 4 µM, 5 µM, and 10 µM) in the C2C12 differentiation medium, and measured the viability of cells after 24 hours of treatment, using an MTT viability assay. We judged that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> was not cytotoxic up to 5 µM in the C2C12 differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2A</xref>). Based on this, we treated differentiating myoblasts with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (1 µM, 2 µM, and 4 µM) for 5 days to measure the effects of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> treatment on differentiation of myoblasts. We observed a dose-dependent decrease in the mRNA levels of MyoD, MyoG, and MHC in differentiating C2C12 cells after treatment with 15dPGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).

We also observed a dose-dependent decrease in the protein levels of MHC in differentiating primary human myoblasts upon treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>).

HRas was identified to be covalently modified by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> at cysteine 184 in NIH3T3 and Cos1 cells(Luis Oliva et al., 2003). Therefore, we tested whether 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> could covalently modify HRas in C2C12 cells. We treated C2C12 cells expressing the EGFP-tagged wild-type HRas with biotinylated 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (5 µM). We then immunoprecipitated biotinylated 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> using streptavidin. We observed a significant increase (∼3.5 fold) in the pulldown of HRas upon treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>biotin compared to DMSO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting an interaction between 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> and HRas. To measure the role of individual C-terminal cysteines in the binding of HRas with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, we treated C2C12 cells expressing the EGFP-tagged C181S and C184S mutants of HRas with biotinylated 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (5 µM), and immunoprecipitated using streptavidin.

RAF-RBD binds to the activated HRas upon activation of HRas, allowing FRET between EGFP and mCherry(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>).

We measured the efficiency of FRET between EGFP and mCherry using an ImageJ plugin, FRET analyzer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hachet-Haas et al., 2006</xref>). We compared the mean acceptor normalized FRET index in C2C12 myoblasts co-expressing EGFP-HRas WT and mCherry-RAF-RBD before and after treatment of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (10 µM) for 1 hour. We observed a significant increase (∼30%) in the mean acceptor normalized FRET index upon treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). This suggests that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> activates HRas. To measure the role of individual C-terminal cysteines in 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> mediated activation of HRas, we co-expressed EGFP-HRas C181S or C184S with mCherry-RAF-RBD in C2C12 myoblasts.

We tested the effects of treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> on these two downstream signaling pathways by measuring the phosphorylation of Erk (42 kDa and 44 kDa) and Akt proteins in C2C12 cells. We treated C2C12 cells with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (5 µM and 10 µM) or DMSO for 1 hr (after 24 hrs. of serum starvation) and observed a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Erk (T202/Y204) (42 kDa) but not of Erk (44 kDa) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>). We did not observe an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt (S473) in C2C12 cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref>).

<p>15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> contains a reactive electrophilic center in its cyclopentenone ring, that can react with cysteine residues of proteins(Luis Oliva et al., 2003). We tested its role in activating the MAPK signaling pathway. We measured the phosphorylation of Erk (42kDa and 44 kDa) in C2C12 cells after treatment with cells with 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (10 µM), a 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> analog which is devoid of the electrophilic center, for 1 hr (after 24 hr. of serum starvation). We observed that the phosphorylation of Erk (42 kDa and 44 kDa) in C2C12 cells treated with 9,10-dihydro-15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> was significantly reduced (∼70%) as compared to the treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>).

Reversible palmitoylation of cysteine 181 and cysteine 184 in the C-terminal tail of HRas regulate intracellular distribution and signaling of HRas.

This observation suggested that PGD<sub>2</sub> might inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts by a receptor-independent mechanism, possibly by its spontaneous non-enzymatic dehydration to 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>. 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> has been suggested to be an endogenous ligand of PPARγ(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Li et al., 2019</xref>). However, the inhibition of PPARγ did not abrogate the inhibition of differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, suggesting the existence of other possible mechanisms(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Hunter et al., 2001</xref>). 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> has varied effects on cell physiology in a context-dependent manner. On one hand, 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> promotes tumorigenesis by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cell line MCF7(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Choi et al., 2020</xref>), 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> inhibits the proliferation of A549, H1299, and H23 lung adenocarcinoma cells via induction of ROS and activation of apoptosis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Slanovc et al., 2024</xref>). Here, we show that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> inhibits the proliferation and the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B, C</xref> and D).</p>
<p>15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> contains an electrophilic cyclopentenone ring in its structure, allowing 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> to covalently modify and form Michael adducts with cysteine residues of proteins(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Shibata et al., 2002</xref>). A previous proteomic study in endothelial cells showed biotinylated 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> covalently modified over 300 proteins, which regulate several physiological processes including cell cycle (MAPK1, MCM4), cell metabolism (Fatty acid synthase, Isocitrate dehydrogenase), apoptosis (PDCD6I), translation (Elongation factor 1 and 2, EIF4A-I), intracellular transport (Importin subunit β1, Exportin 2, Kinesin 1 heavy chain)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Marcone and Fitzgerald, 2013</xref>). Another proteomic study in neuronal cells suggested that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> modifies several proteins including chaperone HSP8A, glycolytic proteins Enolase 1 and 2, GAPDH, PKM1, cytoskeleton proteins Tubulin β2b, β actin, GFAP, etc(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Yamamoto et al., 2011</xref>). This study also showed modification of peptide fragments homologous to IκB kinase β, Thioredoxin, and a small molecule GTPase HRas. 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> has been shown to covalently modify HRas in NIH3T3 and Cos1 cells(Luis Oliva et al., 2003) and IMR90 cells(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">Wiley et al., 2021</xref>). Modification by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> led to the activation of HRas, judged by an increase in GTP-bound HRas. It is clear that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is capable of modifying numerous proteins in different contexts. Despite these observations, the functional relevance of these modifications in numerous contexts remains to be mapped. Here we focused on the role of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> in the context of senescence and skeletal muscle differentiation. In this study, we showed that 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> covalently modifies HRas at cysteine 184 but not cysteine 181 in C2C12 myoblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We showed by FRET microscopy that modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> in HRas WT and HRas C181S activates HRas in C2C12 cells, but 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is unable to activate HRas C184S in this context (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B, C, and</xref> D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3A</xref> and B). This observation shows a direct link between the modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> and the activation of HRas GTPase.</p>
<p>HRas activates two major downstream signaling pathways, the HRas-MAPK and the HRas-PI3K pathway(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Pylayeva-Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). We showed that covalent modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> via the electrophilic cyclopentenone ring activates HRas (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C and D</xref>) and activates the HRas-MAPK pathway, demonstrated by an increase in the phosphorylation of Erk after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E and F</xref>). However, we did not observe activation of the HRas-PI3K pathway, as we did not see an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Fig. S3C</xref>). MAPK and PI3K pathways are known regulators of muscle differentiation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bennett and Tonks, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Rommel et al., 1999</xref>), where inhibition of the RAF-MEK-Erk pathway or activation of the PI3K pathway promotes the differentiation of myoblasts. Preferential activation of the HRas-MAPK pathway over the HRas-PI3K pathway after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> can be a possible mechanism by which 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> can inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts. HRas is known to regulate the differentiation of myoblasts in different contexts. Constitutively active HRas signaling by expression of oncogenic HRas mutant (HRas V12) leads to inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Konieczny et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lassar et al., 1989</xref>; Olson,’ et al., 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Van Der Burgt et al., 2007</xref>). Here we showed that the inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts after 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is partially rescued in cells expressing the C184S mutant of HRas but not the wild type or the C181S mutant (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">S4E</xref>). HRas C184S did not get modified by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). These observations suggest that the inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> is partially dependent on the covalent modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Cysteine 181 and 184 in the C-terminal of HRas regulate the intracellular distribution of HRas between the plasma membrane and the Golgi by reversible palmitoylation and de-palmitoylation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>). Inhibition of the palmitoylation of C-terminal cysteine 181, either by treatment with protein palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate or mutation of cysteine to serine, leads to accumulation of HRas at the Golgi. Intracellular localization of HRas maintains two distinct pools of HRas activity, where the plasma membrane pool shows a faster activation followed by short kinetics and the Golgi pool shows a slower activation but a sustained activation(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Agudo-Ibáñez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Busquets-Hernández and Triola, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Lorentzen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>). We showed that the covalent modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> alters the intracellular distribution of HRas. We showed that the covalent modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> leads to an increase in the localization of the wild-type HRas at the plasma membrane compared to the Golgi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). We did not observe any changes in the intracellular distribution of HRas C181S or HRas C184S after treatment with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). HRas C184S is not modified by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub>, but HRas C181S is modified by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). This suggests that the intracellular redistribution of HRas due to covalent modification by 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> at cysteine 184 requires palmitoylation of cysteine 181.</p>
<p>Previous reports suggest that downstream signaling of HRas depends on the intracellular localization of HRas(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Rocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Santra et al., 2019</xref>). For example, targeted localization of HRas at the ER membrane induced expression of cell-migration genes. Localization of HRas at the plasma membrane showed a strong correlation with the expression of cell cycle genes, particularly the MAPK signaling pathway. Localization of HRas at the plasma membrane also showed a negative correlation with genes associated with the PI3K-Akt pathway. Here we showed that the intracellular distribution of HRas regulates differentiation of myoblasts. In order to show this, we used the constitutively active mutant of HRas (HRas V12) which has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Engler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Konieczny et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Lassar et al., 1989</xref>; Olson,’ et al., 1987; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Scholz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Van Der Burgt et al., 2007</xref>). We expressed cysteine mutants of HRas V12 in C2C12 myoblasts and found that HRas V12 C181S localized predominantly at the Golgi whereas HRas V12 and HRas V12 C184S localized at both the plasma membrane and the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4A</xref>). When differentiated, we observed that C2C12 cells expressing HRas V12 C181S differentiated but HRas V12 or HRas V12 C184S did not differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4B, C</xref>, and D). These observations suggest alteration of intracellular distribution of HRas affects the HRas-mediated inhibition of the differentiation of myoblasts.</p>
<p>Doxorubicin (Doxo) is a widely used chemotherapy agent for the treatment of cancers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Johnson-Arbor and Dubey, 2022</xref>). Treatment with Doxo induces senescence. Doxo-mediated DNA damage leads to p53, p16, and p21-dependent senescence in human fibroblasts(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Di Leonardo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Robles and Adami, 1998</xref>). On the other hand, treatment with doxorubicin leads to a decrease in muscle mass and cross-sectional area, leading to chemotherapy-induced cachexia(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Hiensch et al., 2020</xref>). Several mechanisms have been proposed behind chemotherapy-induced cachexia, including the generation of reactive oxygen species(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Gilliam and St. Clair, 2011</xref>), activation of proteases like calpain and caspases(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Smuder et al., 2011</xref>), and impaired insulin signaling(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">de Lima Junior et al., 2016</xref>). This study provides a possible mechanism behind chemotherapy-induced loss of muscle mass and functioning. Induction of senescence in myoblasts by treatment with Doxo could lead to increased synthesis and release of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> by senescent cells which could be taken up by myoblasts in the microenvironment. The lipid could covalently modify and activate HRas at cysteine 184 to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts. Therefore, targeting the synthesis and release of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> by senescent cells could serve as an important target to promote skeletal muscle homeostasis in cancer patients.</p>

Constructs of wild-type HRas were PCR amplified from a previously available HRas construct in the lab with construct-specific primers. Proper nucleotide additions were made to the forward primer to maintain the EGFP ORF, marking a 7 amino acid linker between the proteins. The construct sequences were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

<title>Confocal microscopy for measuring HRas distribution between the Golgi and the plasma membrane</title>
<p>C2C12 cells expressing EGFP-tagged HRas WT/ HRas-C181S/ HRas-C184S + GalT-TagRFP were starved overnight in DMEM starvation medium and treated with DMSO or 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (10 µM) in DMEM complete medium for 24 hrs, with a medium change @ 12 hrs post-treatment. The cells were then fixed with the fixative solution @ R. T., washed with PBS, and stained for plasma membrane with Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA-633) (Invitrogen). The cells were washed with PBS and were then mounted on glass slides in ProLong Gold Antifade Mounting medium (Invitrogen). C2C12 cells expressing EGFP-tagged HRas V12/ HRas V12-C181S/ HRas V12-C184S were also fixed with the fixative solution @R. T., washed with PBS, stained with WGA-633, and mounted on slides in Prolong gold antifade medium (Invitrogen). The cells were imaged with the FV3000 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus-Evident) using appropriate lasers and detectors. Preliminary image processing was done using ImageJ (NIH), while batch analysis of HRas at the plasma membrane and the Golgi complex was done using a custom MATLAB script, where EGFP-HRas image was overlayed onto the GalT-TagRFP and WGA-633 image to obtain HRas localization at the Golgi complex and the Plasma Membrane respectively. A ratio of mean HRas intensity at the Golgi complex to that of at the Plasma membrane (R<sub>mean</sub>) was calculated and was used to compare HRas distribution between treatments.</p>

<title>FRET confocal microscopy to measure the intracellular activity of HRas</title>
<p>C2C12 cells expressing EGFP-tagged HRas WT/HRas C181S/HRas C184S and mCherry-RAF-RBD were starved overnight in the DMEM starvation medium. The cells were imaged with the FV3000 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus-Evident) using the following lasers and detectors:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Donor Channel: 488nm excitation, 510 (+/-) 20nm detection.</p></list-item>

<list-item><p>FRET Channel: 488nm excitation, 630 (+/-) 50nm detection.</p></list-item>
</list>
The cells were then treated with 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> (10 µM) for 1 hour and were imaged using the same imaging parameters. C2C12 cells expressing EGFP-HRas or mCherry-RAF RBD only were used to calculate the bleed-through corrections (EGFP emission @ 630 (+/-) 50nm, and Excitation of mCherry by 488 nm laser). Preliminary processing was done using ImageJ (NIH). The FRET index was calculated using the FRET and co-localization analyzer plugin(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Hachet-Haas et al., 2006</xref>). The FRET index was then divided by the intensity of the Acceptor channel to normalize the variation in the expression of mCherry.

<title>Quantification of myotube fusion index</title>
<p>Differentiated C2C12 myoblasts were immunostained for MHC and DAPI and were imaged on the FV3000 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus-Evident). Analysis of the fusion index was done using the Myotube Analyzer Software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Noë et al., 2022</xref>). DAPI and MHC images were thresholded to remove background noise. The images were converted to binary masks and the channels were overlayed to obtain the no. of nuclei overlaying with MHC<sup>+ve</sup> fibers. The fusion index was calculated as the percentage ratio of no. nuclei overlaying the MHC<sup>+ve</sup> fibers to the total no. of nuclei in the field of view.</p>

<title>Lipid extraction and detection of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> by mass spectrometry</title>
<p>For lipid extraction, cell pellets were resuspended in 3ml of a methanol solvent [water: methanol: 2:1, 1% formic acid (FA)] whereas only 1 ml of methanol with 3% FA was added to the 2 ml of CM, making a uniform sample volume of 3 ml. Subsequently, 1 ml of ethyl acetate was added to each sample and mixed vigorously. Phase separation was done by centrifuging the mixture (12000xg, 4℃ for 10 mins), and the organic phase containing the lipid was collected. This process was repeated thrice in total and all the organic phases were combined and dried under a nitrogen stream at RT. The residues were resuspended in 100 µl of 50% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% FA and were subjected to mass spec analysis using the Waters® Acquity UPLC class I system The detection of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> was performed using an electrospray ionization source (ESI) operating in the negative ion mode and a quadrupole trap mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX QTRAP 6500) connected to a Waters® Acquity UPLC class I system (Waters, Germany) outfitted with a binary solvent delivery system with an online degasser and a column manager with a column oven coupled to a UPLC autosampler. 5 µl samples were injected into the union for analysis. Solvent A consisted of 0.1% ammonium acetate in water and solvent B was 0.1% ammonium acetate in a mixture of acetonitrile/water (95:5). For each run, the LC gradient was: 0 min, 20% B; 0.5 min, 20% B; 1.5 min, 90% B; 2.5 min, 20% B; 3min, 20% B. Analyte detection was performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM), 315.100 → 271.100 and 315.100 → 203.100. Source parameters were set as follows: capillary voltage 3.8 kV, desolvation gas flow 25 L/h, source temperature 350 °C, ion source gas 1 flow 40 L/h, and ion source gas 2 flow 40 L/h. Acquisition and quantification were completed with Analyst 1.6.3 and Multiquant 3.0.3, respectively (method adopted from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Morgenstern et al., 2018</xref>)). For the standards, 2ml media of different known concentrations (50nM, 100nM, 250nM, and 500nM) of 15d-PGJ<sub>2</sub> were prepared and subjected to the same extraction procedure as that of CM. A standard curve was plotted with the known concentration and the mass spec peak area, and the concentration of the lipid in samples was calculated.</p>

<p>This manuscript outlines an interaction between senescence-related 15d-PGJ2 and the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts, with potential implications for muscle health. This manuscript is <bold>useful</bold> in understanding the role of lipid metabolite 15d-PGJ2 in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. However, in its current form, the manuscript is <bold>incomplete</bold> as there are several concerns in the statistical analysis, lack of clarity on the mechanistic details, and concerns about the use of an immortalized C2C12 myoblasts cell line to draw major conclusions related to senescence-associated secreted phenotype.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that upon treatment with Doxorubicin (Doxo), there is an increase in senescence and inflammatory markers in the muscles. They also show these genes get upregulated in C2C12 myoblasts when treated with conditioned media or 15d-PGJ2. 15dPGJ2 induces cell death in the myoblasts, decreases proliferation (measured by cell numbers), and decreases differentiation and fusion. 15d-PGJ2 modified Cys184 of HRas, which is required for its activation as indicated by the FRET analysis with RAF RBD. They also showed that 15d-PGJ2 activates ERK signaling, but not Akt signaling, through the electrophilic center. 15d-PGJ2 inhibits Golgi localization of HRAS (only WT, not C181 or C184 mutant). They also showed that expressing the WT HRas followed by 15d-PGJ2 treatment led to a decrease in the levels of MHC mRNA and protein, and this defect is dependent on C184. This is a well-written manuscript with interesting insights into the mechanism of action of 15d-PGJ2. However, some clarification and experiments will help the paper advance the field significantly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data clearly shows that 15d-PGJ2 has a negative role in the myoblast cells and that it leads to modification of HRas protein. Moreover, the induction of biosynthetic enzymes in the PGD2 pathway also supports the induction of 15d-PGJ2 in Doxorubicin-treated cells. Both conditioned media experiments and the 15d-PGJ2 experiments show that 15d-PGJ2 could be the active component secreted by the senescent myoblasts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The genes that are upregulated in the muscles upon injection with Doxo are also markers for inflammation. Since Doxo is also known to induce systemic inflammation, it is important to delineate these two effects (Inflammatory cells vs senescent cells). The expression of beta Gal and other markers of senescence in the tissue sections will help to delineate these.</p>
<p>In Figure 2, where the defect in the differentiation of myoblasts upon treatment with 15d-PGJ2 is shown, most of the cells die within 48 hours at higher concentrations, making it difficult to perform the experiments. This also shows that 15d-PGJ2 was toxic to these cells. Lower concentrations show a decrease in the differentiation based on the lower number of nuclei in fibers and low expression of MyoD, MyoG, and MHC. However, it is unclear if this is due to increased cell death or defective differentiation. It would be a lot more informative if the cell count, cell division, and cell death could be plotted for these concentrations of the drug during the experiment. Also, in the myoblast experiments, are the effects of treatment with Dox reversible?</p>
<p>In Figure 3, most of the experiments are done at a high concentration, which induces almost complete cell death within 48 hours. Even at such a high concentration of 15dPGJ2, the increase in ERK phosphorylation is minimal.</p>
<p>The experiment Figure 4C shows that C181 and C84 mutants of the HRas show higher levels in Golgi compared with WT. However, this could very well be due to the defect in palmitoylation rather than the modification with 15d-PGJ2. Though the authors allude to the possibility that intracellular redistribution of HRas by 15d-PGJ2 requires C181 palmitoylation, the direct influence of C184 modification on C181 palmitoylation is not shown. To have a meaningful conclusion, the authors need to compare the palmitoylation and modification with 15d-PGJ2.</p>
<p>To test if the inhibition of myoblast differentiation depends on HRas, they overexpressed the HRas and mutants in the C2C12 lines. However, this experiment does not take the endogenous HRAs into consideration, especially when interpreting the C184 mutant. An appropriate experiment to test this would be to knock down or knock out HRas (or make knock-in mutations of C184) and show that the effect of 15d-PGJ2 disappears. Moreover, in this specific experiment, it is difficult to interpret without a control with no HRas construct and another without the 15d-PGJ2 treatment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the overall study does not delineate the toxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 from its effect on the differentiation.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Swarang and colleagues identified the lipid metabolite 15d-PGJ2 as a potential component of senescent myoblasts. They proposed that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits myoblast proliferation and differentiation by binding and regulating HRas, suggesting its potential as a target for restoring muscle homeostasis post-chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The regulation of HRas by 15d-PGJ2 is well controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I still think the novelty is limited by previous published findings. The authors themselves noted that the accumulation of 15d-PGJ2 in senescent cells has been reported in various cell types, including human fibroblasts, HEPG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and HUVEC endothelial cells (PMCID: PMC8501892). Although the current study observed similar activation of 15d-PGJ2 in myoblasts, it appears to be additive rather than fundamentally novel. The covalent adduct of 15d-PGJ2 with Cys-184 of H-Ras was reported over 20 years ago (PMID: 12684535), and the biochemical principles of this interaction are likely universal across different cell types. The regulation of myogenesis by both HRas and 15d-PGJ2 has also been previously extensively reported (PMID: 2654809, 1714463, 17412879, 20109525, 11477074). The main conceptual novelty may lie in the connection between these points in myoblasts. But as discussed in another comment, the use of C2C12 cells as a model for senescence study is questionable due to the lack of the key regulator p16. The findings in C2C12 cells may not accurately represent physiological-relevant myoblasts. It is recommended that these findings be validated in primary myoblasts to strengthen the study's conclusions.</p>
<p>(2) The C2C12 cell line is not an ideal model for senescence study.</p>
<p>
C2C12 cells are a well-established model for studying myogenesis. However, their suitability as a model for senescence studies is questionable. C2C12 cells are immortalized and do not undergo normal senescence like primary cells as C2C12 cells are known to have a deleted p16/p19 locus, a crucial regulator of senescence (PMID: 20682446). The use of C2C12 cells in published studies does not inherently validate them as a suitable senescence model. These studies may have limitations, and the appropriateness of the C2C12 model depends on the specific research goals.</p>
<p>
In the study by Moustogiannis et al. (PMID: 33918414), they claimed to have aged C2C12 cells through multiple population doublings. However, the SA-β-gal staining in their data, which is often used to confirm senescence, showed almost fully confluent &quot;aged&quot; C2C12 cells. This confluent state could artificially increase SA-β-gal positivity, suggesting that these cells may not truly represent senescence. Moreover, the &quot;aged&quot; C2C12 cells exhibited normal proliferation, which contradicts the definition of senescence. Similar findings were reported in another study of C2C12 cells subjected to 58 population doublings (PMID: 21826704), where even at this late stage, the cells were still dividing every 2 or 3 days, similar to younger cells at early passages. More importantly, I do know how the p16 was detected in that paper since the locus was already mutated. In terms of p21, there was no difference in the proliferative C2C12 cells at day 0.</p>
<p>
In the study by Moiseeva et al. in 2023 (PMID: 36544018), C2C12 cells were used for senescence modeling for siRNA transfection. However, the most significant findings were obtained using primary satellite cells or confirmed with complementary data.</p>
<p>
In conclusion, while molecular changes observed in studies using C2C12 cells may be valid, the use of primary myoblasts is highly recommended for senescence studies due to the limitations and questionable senescence characteristics of the C2C12 cell line.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding source of increased PGD in the conditioned medium, I want to emphasize that it's unclear whether the PGD or its metabolites increase in response to DNA damage or the senescence state. Thus, using a different senescent model to exclude the possibility of DNA damage-induced increase will be crucial.</p>
<p>(4) Similarly for the in vivo Doxorubicin (Doxo) injection, both reviewers have raised concerns about the potential side effects of Doxo, including inflammation, DNA damage, and ROS generation. These effects could potentially confound the results of the study. The physiological significance of this study will heavily rely on the in vivo data. However, the in vivo senescence component is confounded by the side effects of Doxo.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 2A lacks an important control from non-senescent cells during the measurement of C2C12 differentiation in the presence of conditioned medium. The author took it for granted that the conditioned medium from senescent cells would inhibit myogenesis, relying on previous publications (PMID: 37468473). However, that study was conducted in the context of myotonic dystrophy type 1. To support the inhibitory effect in the current experimental settings, direct evidence is required. It would be necessary to include another control with conditioned medium from normal, proliferative C2C12 cells.</p>
<p>(6) Statistical analyses problems.</p>
<p>
Only t-test was used throughout the study even when there are more than two groups. Please have a statistician to evaluate the replicates and statistical analyses used.</p>
<p>
For the 15d-PGJ2/cell concentration measurements in Figure 1F, there were only two replicates, which was provided in the supplementary table after required. Was that experiment repeated with more biological replicates?</p>
<p>
For figure 1C, Fig 1F, 1G, 1J, 2C, 2E, 3A, 3E, 3F, 4D, 4E, please include each data points in bar graphs as used in Fig 1D, or at least provide how many biological replicates were used for each experiment?</p>
<p>
There is no error bar in a lot of control groups (Fig 2C, 2E, 3EF, 4E, S4B).</p>
<p>
For qPCR data in Figure 1C, the author responded in that the data in was plotted using 2-ΔCT instead of 2-ΔΔCT to show the variability in the expression of mRNAs isolated from animals treated with Saline. This statement does not align with the method section. Please revise.</p>
<p>(7) For Figure 1, the title may not be appropriate as there is insufficient data to support the inhibition of myoblast differentiation.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out Doxo induces systemic inflammation along with inducing DNA damage-mediated senescence. Therefore, along with the inflammatory markers of the SASP (CXCL1/2, TNF1α, IL6, PTGS1/2, PTGDS) we also observed an increase in the mRNA levels of canonical markers of DNA damage-mediated senescence. We observed an increase in the mRNA levels of cell cycle and senescence associated proteins p16 and p21 (Fig. 1C). We also observed an increased nuclear accumulation of p21 (Fig. 1A) and increased levels of phosphorylated H2A.X in the nucleus (Fig. 1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 2, where the defect in the differentiation of myoblasts upon treatment with 15d-PGJ2 is shown, most of the cells die within 48 hours at higher concentrations, making it difficult to perform the experiments. This also shows that 15d-PGJ2 was toxic to these cells. Lower concentrations show a decrease in the differentiation based on the lower number of nuclei in fibers and low expression of MyoD, MyoG, and MHC. However, it is unclear if this is due to increased cell death or defective differentiation. It would be a lot more informative if the cell count, cell division, and cell death could be plotted for these concentrations of the drug during the experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We measured the viability of C2C12 cells after 24 hours of treatment with 15d-PGJ2 using the MTT assay and observed that the viability of cells was decreased after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (10 µM) but not with 15d-PGJ2 (1 µM, 2 µM, 4 µM, or 5 µM) (see Fig. S2A of the updated manuscript). The results and figures of the manuscript have been updated accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, in the myoblast experiments, are the effects of treatment with Dox reversible?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The treatment with Doxorubicin is irreversible as the senescent phenotype was not reversed after withdrawal of Doxorubicin, even after 20 days.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3, most of the experiments are done at a high concentration, which induces almost complete cell death within 48 hours.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 3 is an acute experiment for only 1 hour, at which time no cell death was observed. Specifically, we measured the phosphorylation of Erk and Akt proteins after 1 hour of treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (10 µM) during which we did not observe any cell death.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Even at such a high concentration of 15dPGJ2, the increase in ERK phosphorylation is minimal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observe a ~30% increase in the phosphorylation of Erk proteins after treatment with 15d-PGJ­2 in 0.2% serum medium compared to treatment with vehicle (DMSO). This is reproducible and significant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experiment Figure 4C shows that C181 and C84 mutants of the HRas show higher levels in Golgi compared with WT. However, this could very well be due to the defect in palmitoylation rather than the modification with 15d-PGJ2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data does not suggest higher levels of C184S mutant in the Golgi compared with WT (Fig. S4A). We observed that the ratio of HRas levels in the Golgi to the HRas levels in the plasma membrane were similar in C2C12 cells expressing HRas C184S and HRas WT (Fig. S4A graph columns 1 and 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Though the authors allude to the possibility that intracellular redistribution of HRas by 15d-PGJ2 requires C181 palmitoylation, the direct influence of C184 modification on C181 palmitoylation is not shown. To have a meaningful conclusion, the authors need to compare the palmitoylation and modification with 15d-PGJ2.</p>

<p>Palmitoylation of HRas C181S is required for the localization of HRas at the plasma membrane. The inhibition of palmitoylation of C181, either by mutation (C181S) or treatment with protein palmitoyl transferase inhibitor (2-Bromopalmitate), results in the accumulation of HRas at Golgi(Rocks et al., 2005) (Fig. S4A). Modification of HRas at C184 by 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3A) could inhibit the palmitoylation of HRas at C181. However, our data does not support this hypothesis as modification of HRas WT by 15d-PGJ2 does not increase the level of HRas at the Golgi, like in the case of inhibition of cysteine palmitoylation due to C181S mutation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To test if the inhibition of myoblast differentiation depends on HRas, they overexpressed the HRas and mutants in the C2C12 lines. However, this experiment does not take the endogenous HRAs into consideration, especially when interpreting the C184 mutant. An appropriate experiment to test this would be to knock down or knock out HRas (or make knock-in mutations of C184) and show that the effect of 15d-PGJ2 disappears.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Endogenous HRas (wild type) is present in the C2C12 cells overexpressing the EGFP-tagged HRas constructs. Therefore, we only observe a partial rescue in the differentiation after 15d-PGJ2 treatment in C2C12 cells expressing the C184S mutant (Fig. 4D and E). However, since HRas is expressed under high expression CMV promoter and in the absence of other regulatory elements, the overexpressed constructs do show a dominant effect over the endogenous HRas, showing cysteine mutant dependent inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 4D and E).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, in this specific experiment, it is difficult to interpret without a control with no HRas construct and another without the 15d-PGJ2 treatment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The mRNA levels of MyoD, MyoG, and MHC in C2C12 cells expressing HRas constructs after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 were normalized to the mRNA levels in C2C12 cells expressing corresponding constructs and were treated with vehicle (DMSO). mRNA levels in C2C12 cells treated with vehicle were not shown as they were normalized to 1. MHC protein levels in C2C12 cells expressing HRas constructs after 15d-PGJ2 treatment were normalized to that in C2C12 cells treated with vehicle (DMSO). Since the hypothesis to study the effect of HRas cysteine mutations on the differentiation of myoblasts after treatment with 15d-PGJ2, C2C12 cells expressing HRas WT serve as adequate control. Fig. 2 shows the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on muscle differentiation when HRas was not overexpressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, the overall study does not delineate the toxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 from its effect on the differentiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The inhibition of differentiation in C212 cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 cannot be attributed to the general toxicity of 15d-PGJ2 in cells. We show that the inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts after 15d-PGJ2 depends on modification of HRas at C184 i.e. failure to modify HRas at C184 (Fig. 3A) and resultant activation (Fig. 3B) by 15d-PGJ2 rescues this inhibition of differentiation of C2C12 cells (Fig. 4D and E), dissecting the inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts by 15d-PGJ2 from general toxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 on cell physiology.</p>
<p>Please note that the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on cell physiology is context-specific. On one hand, 15d-PGJ2 has been shown to exert tumor-suppressor effects by inhibiting the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and lung adenocarcinoma cells (de Jong et al., 2011; Slanovc et al., 2024), 15d-PGJ2 also exerts pro-carcinogenic effects by induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells MCF7 and inhibition of tumor-suppressor protein p53 in MCF7 and PC-3 cells (Choi et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2010).</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, Swarang and colleagues identified the lipid metabolite 15d-PGJ2 as a potential component of senescent myoblasts. They proposed that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits myoblast proliferation and differentiation by binding and regulating HRas, suggesting its potential as a target for restoring muscle homeostasis post-chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The regulation of HRas by 15d-PGJ2 is well controlled.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) I still think the novelty is limited by previous published findings. The authors themselves noted that the accumulation of 15d-PGJ2 in senescent cells has been reported in various cell types, including human fibroblasts, HEPG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and HUVEC endothelial cells (PMCID: PMC8501892). Although the current study observed similar activation of 15d-PGJ2 in myoblasts, it appears to be additive rather than fundamentally novel. The covalent adduct of 15d-PGJ2 with Cys-184 of H-Ras was reported over 20 years ago (PMID: 12684535), and the biochemical principles of this interaction are likely universal across different cell types. The regulation of myogenesis by both HRas and 15d-PGJ2 has also been previously extensively reported (PMID: 2654809, 1714463, 17412879, 20109525, 11477074). The main conceptual novelty may lie in the connection between these points in myoblasts. But as discussed in another comment, the use of C2C12 cells as a model for senescence study is questionable due to the lack of the key regulator p16. The findings in C2C12 cells may not accurately represent physiological-relevant myoblasts. It is recommended that these findings be validated in primary myoblasts to strengthen the study's conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is the first study to show a molecular mechanism where activation of HRas signaling in skeletal myoblasts due to covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2 at C184 of HRas inhibits the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The C2C12 cell line is not an ideal model for senescence study.</p>
<p>C2C12 cells are a well-established model for studying myogenesis. However, their suitability as a model for senescence studies is questionable. C2C12 cells are immortalized and do not undergo normal senescence like primary cells as C2C12 cells are known to have a deleted p16/p19 locus, a crucial regulator of senescence (PMID: 20682446). The use of C2C12 cells in published studies does not inherently validate them as a suitable senescence model. These studies may have limitations, and the appropriateness of the C2C12 model depends on the specific research goals.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Several reports have shown that cells undergo senescence independent of p16 expression. MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells have been shown to undergo DNA damage mediated and Oncogene induced senescence as seen after treatment with Doxorubicin (PMID: PMC7025418) and expression of constitutively active HRas (PMID: 17135242), despite the homozygous deletion of p16 locus (ISBN 9780124375512 Chapter 17 Table 2) by upregulation of cell cycle inhibitor protein p21. In this study, we observe an increase in the senescence markers in C2C12 cells after treatment with Doxo (Fig. 1). We also observed an increase in the markers of DNA damage-mediated senescence in MCF7 after treatment with Doxo (Data will be included in the revised manuscript). Based on these observations, we have concluded that C2C12 cells undergo senescence despite lacking the p16/p19 locus.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In the study by Moustogiannis et al. (PMID: 33918414), they claimed to have aged C2C12 cells through multiple population doublings. However, the SA-β-gal staining in their data, which is often used to confirm senescence, showed almost fully confluent &quot;aged&quot; C2C12 cells. This confluent state could artificially increase SA-β-gal positivity, suggesting that these cells may not truly represent senescence. Moreover, the &quot;aged&quot; C2C12 cells exhibited normal proliferation, which contradicts the definition of senescence. Similar findings were reported in another study of C2C12 cells subjected to 58 population doublings (PMID: 21826704), where even at this late stage, the cells were still dividing every 2 or 3 days, similar to younger cells at early passages. More importantly, I do know how the p16 was detected in that paper since the locus was already mutated. In terms of p21, there was no difference in the proliferative C2C12 cells at day 0.</p>
<p>In the study by Moiseeva et al. in 2023 (PMID: 36544018), C2C12 cells were used for senescence modeling for siRNA transfection. However, the most significant findings were obtained using primary satellite cells or confirmed with complementary data.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while molecular changes observed in studies using C2C12 cells may be valid, the use of primary myoblasts is highly recommended for senescence studies due to the limitations and questionable senescence characteristics of the C2C12 cell line.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding source of increased PGD in the conditioned medium, I want to emphasize that it's unclear whether the PGD or its metabolites increase in response to DNA damage or the senescence state. Thus, using a different senescent model to exclude the possibility of DNA damage-induced increase will be crucial.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Though Senescence can be induced by several stress stimuli like DNA damage, Oncogene expression, ROS, Mitochondrial Dysfunction, etc., DNA damage remains critical for the induction of the SASP (reviewed in PMID: 20078217). Also, other models of senescence, like Oncogene Induced Senescence (reviewed in PMID: 17671427), ROS Induced Senescence (PMID: 24934860), Mitochondrial Dysfunction Associated Senescence (MiDAS) (PMID: 26686024) have shown upregulation of DNA damage-associated signaling pathways. In this study, we have explored the SASP of cells undergoing senescence upon chemotherapy drug Doxorubicin-mediated DNA damage.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Similarly for the in vivo Doxorubicin (Doxo) injection, both reviewers have raised concerns about the potential side effects of Doxo, including inflammation, DNA damage, and ROS generation. These effects could potentially confound the results of the study. The physiological significance of this study will heavily rely on the in vivo data. However, the in vivo senescence component is confounded by the side effects of Doxo.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur that this is a limitation of this study and the subsequent work will demonstrate the origin of prostaglandin biosynthesis after treatment with Doxo in vivo.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Figure 2A lacks an important control from non-senescent cells during the measurement of C2C12 differentiation in the presence of conditioned medium. The author took it for granted that the conditioned medium from senescent cells would inhibit myogenesis, relying on previous publications (PMID: 37468473). However, that study was conducted in the context of myotonic dystrophy type 1. To support the inhibitory effect in the current experimental settings, direct evidence is required. It would be necessary to include another control with conditioned medium from normal, proliferative C2C12 cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Conditioned medium of senescent cells of several types, like senescent myoblasts in case of DM1 (PMID: 37468473), adipocytes undergoing senescence due to H2O2 treatment, Insulin Resistance, and Replicative senescence (PMID: 37321332), has been shown to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts. Therefore, in this study, we measured the effect of prostaglandin PGD2 and its metabolites on the differentiation of myoblasts by inhibiting the biosynthesis of PGD2 in senescent myoblasts by treatment with AT-56. We inhibited the synthesis of PGD2 in senescent cells by treatment with AT-56, and then collected the conditioned medium. Conditioned medium collected from senescent C2C12 cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) served as a control for the experiment.</p>

<p>This manuscript provides useful information about the lipid metabolite 15d-PGJ2 as a potential regulator of myoblast senescence. The authors provide experimental evidence that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits myoblast proliferation and differentiation by binding and regulating HRas. However, the manuscript is incomplete in its current form, as it lacks robust support from the data regarding the main conclusions related to senescence and technical concerns related to the senescence models used in this study.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors show that upon treatment with Doxorubicin (Doxo), there is an increase in senescence and inflammatory markers in the muscles. They also show these genes get upregulated in C2C12 myoblasts when treated with conditioned media or 15d-PGJ2. 15dPGJ2 induces cell death in the myoblasts, decreases proliferation (measured by cell numbers), and decreases differentiation and fusion. 15d-PGJ2 modified Cys184 of HRas, which is required for its activation as indicated by the FRET analysis with RAF RBD. They also showed that 15d-PGJ2 activates ERK signaling, but not Akt signaling, through the electrophilic center. 15d-PGJ2 inhibits Golgi localization of HRAS (only WT, not C181 or C184 mutant). They also showed that expressing the WT HRas followed by 15d-PGJ2 treatment led to a decrease in the levels of MHC mRNA and protein, and this defect is dependent on C184. This is a well-written manuscript with interesting insights into the mechanism of action of 15d-PGJ2. However, some clarification and experiments will help the paper advance the field significantly.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The data clearly shows that 15d-PGJ2 has a negative role in the myoblast cells and that it leads to modification of HRas protein. Moreover, the induction of biosynthetic enzymes in the PGD2 pathway also supports the induction of 15d-PGJ2 in Doxorubicin-treated cells. Both conditioned media experiments and the 15d-PGJ2 experiments show that 15d-PGJ2 could be the active component secreted by the senescent myoblasts.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The genes that are upregulated in the muscles upon injection with Doxo are also markers for inflammation. Since Doxo is also known to induce systemic inflammation, it is important to delineate these two effects (inflammatory cells vs senescent cells). The expression of beta Gal and other markers of senescence in the tissue sections will help to delineate these.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As pointed out Doxo induces systemic inflammation along with inducing DNA damage-mediated senescence. Therefore, along with the inflammatory markers of the SASP (CXCL1/2, TNF1α, IL6, PTGS1/2, PTGDS) we also observed an increase in the mRNA levels of canonical markers of DNA damage-mediated senescence. We observed an increase in the mRNA levels of cell cycle and senescence associated proteins p16 and p21 (Fig. 1C). We also observed an increased nuclear accumulation of p21 (Fig. 1A) and increased levels of phosphorylated H2A.X in the nucleus (Fig. 1B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 2, where the defect in the differentiation of myoblasts upon treatment with 15d-PGJ2 is shown, most of the cells die within 48 hours at higher concentrations, making it difficult to perform the experiments. This also shows that 15d-PGJ2 was toxic to these cells. Lower concentrations show a decrease in the differentiation based on the lower number of nuclei in fibers and low expression of MyoD, MyoG, and MHC. However, it is unclear if this is due to increased cell death or defective differentiation. It would be a lot more informative if the cell count, cell division, and cell death could be plotted for these concentrations of the drug during the experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We measured the viability of C2C12 cells after 24 hours of treatment with 15d-PGJ2 using the MTT assay and observed that the viability of cells was decreased after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (10 µM) but not with 15d-PGJ2 (1 µM, 2 µM, 4 µM, or 5 µM) (see Fig. S2A of the updated manuscript). The results and figures of the manuscript have been updated accordingly.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Also, in the myoblast experiments, are the effects of treatment with Dox reversible?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The treatment with Doxorubicin is irreversible as the senescent phenotype was not reversed after withdrawal of Doxorubicin, even after 20 days.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In Figure 3, most of the experiments are done at a high concentration, which induces almost complete cell death within 48 hours.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 3 is an acute experiment for only 1 hour, at which time no cell death was observed. Specifically, we measured the phosphorylation of Erk and Akt proteins after 1 hour of treatment with 15d-PGJ2 (10 µM) during which we did not observe any cell death.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Even at such a high concentration of 15dPGJ2, the increase in ERK phosphorylation is minimal.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observe a ~30% increase in the phosphorylation of Erk proteins after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 in 0.2% serum medium compared to treatment with vehicle (DMSO). This is reproducible and significant.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The experiment Figure 4C shows that C181 and C84 mutants of the HRas show higher levels in Golgi compared with WT. However, this could very well be due to the defect in palmitoylation rather than the modification with 15d-PGJ2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our data does not suggest higher levels of C184S mutant in the Golgi compared with WT (Fig. S4A). We observed that the ratio of HRas levels in the Golgi to the HRas levels in the plasma membrane were similar in C2C12 cells expressing HRas C184S and HRas WT (Fig. S4A graph columns 1 and 5).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Though the authors allude to the possibility that intracellular redistribution of HRas by 15d-PGJ2 requires C181 palmitoylation, the direct influence of C184 modification on C181 palmitoylation is not shown. To have a meaningful conclusion, the authors need to compare the palmitoylation and modification with 15d-PGJ2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Palmitoylation of HRas C181S is required for the localization of HRas at the plasma membrane. The inhibition of palmitoylation of C181, either by mutation (C181S) or treatment with protein palmitoyl transferase inhibitor (2-Bromopalmitate), results in the accumulation of HRas at Golgi(Rocks et al., 2005) (Fig. S4A). Modification of HRas at C184 by 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 3A) could inhibit the palmitoylation of HRas at C181. However, our data does not support this hypothesis as modification of HRas WT by 15d-PGJ2 does not increase the level of HRas at the Golgi, like in the case of inhibition of cysteine palmitoylation due to C181S mutation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>To test if the inhibition of myoblast differentiation depends on HRas, they overexpressed the HRas and mutants in the C2C12 lines. However, this experiment does not take the endogenous HRAs into consideration, especially when interpreting the C184 mutant.

However, since HRas is expressed under high expression CMV promoter and in the absence of other regulatory elements, the overexpressed constructs do show a dominant effect over the endogenous HRas, showing cysteine mutant dependent inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts after treatment with 15dPGJ2 (Fig. 4D and E).</p>

<p>The mRNA levels of MyoD, MyoG, and MHC in C2C12 cells expressing HRas constructs after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 were normalized to the mRNA levels in C2C12 cells expressing corresponding constructs and were treated with vehicle (DMSO). mRNA levels in C2C12 cells treated with vehicle were not shown as they were normalized to 1. MHC protein levels in C2C12 cells expressing HRas constructs after 15d-PGJ2 treatment were normalized to that in C2C12 cells treated with vehicle (DMSO). Since the hypothesis to study the effect of HRas cysteine mutations on the differentiation of myoblasts after treatment with 15d-PGJ2, C2C12 cells expressing HRas WT serve as adequate control. Fig. 2 shows the effect of 15dPGJ2 on muscle differentiation when HRas was not overexpressed.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Moreover, the overall study does not delineate the toxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 from its effect on the differentiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The inhibition of differentiation in C212 cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 cannot be attributed to the general toxicity of 15d-PGJ2 in cells. We show that the inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts after 15d-PGJ2 depends on modification of HRas at C184 i.e. failure to modify HRas at C184 (Fig. 3A) and resultant activation (Fig. 3B) by 15d-PGJ2 rescues this inhibition of differentiation of C2C12 cells (Fig. 4D and E), dissecting the inhibition of differentiation of myoblasts by 15d-PGJ2 from general toxic effects of 15d-PGJ2 on cell physiology.</p>
<p>Please note that the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on cell physiology is context-specific. On one hand, 15d-PGJ2 has been shown to exert tumor-suppressor effects by inhibiting the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and lung adenocarcinoma cells (de Jong et al., 2011; Slanovc et al., 2024), 15d-PGJ2 also exerts pro-carcinogenic effects by induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cells MCF7 and inhibition of tumor-suppressor protein p53 in MCF7 and PC-3 cells (Choi et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2010).</p>

<p>Literature does not support this statement, and it is important to clarify this misimpression for the field as a whole.</p>
<p>Let us clarify-</p>
<p>Covalent modification of HRas by 15d-PGJ2 has been reported only twice in the literature(Luis Oliva et al., 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2011) in fibroblasts and neurons respectively.</p>
<p>Interaction between Hras and 15d-PGJ2 in skeletal muscles has not been shown before, even though both Hras and 15d-PGJ2 are shown to be key regulators of muscle homeostasis.</p>
<p>Activation of Hras by 15d-PGJ2 was reported first by Luis Oliva et al (Luis Oliva et al., 2003). However, this study does not comment on the functional implications of activation of Hras signaling.</p>
<p>Recently, our lab contributed to a study where the functional implication of activation of Hras signaling due to covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2 was shown in the maintenance of senescence phenotype (Wiley et al., 2021).</p>
<p>15d-PGJ2 was shown to inhibit the differentiation of myoblasts by Hunter <italic>et al</italic> (Hunter et al., 2001). This study hypothesized that the inhibition of myoblast differentiation is via 15d-PGJ2 mediated activation of the PPARγ signaling, the study also showed inhibition of myoblast differentiation independent of PPARγ activity, suggesting the presence of other mechanisms.</p>
<p>This is the first study to show a molecular mechanism where activation of Hras signaling in skeletal myoblasts due to covalent modification by 15d-PGJ2 at C184 of Hras inhibits the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are major technical concerns related to the senescence models, limiting data interpretation regarding the relevance to senescent cells.</p>
<p>Major concerns:</p>
<p>(1) The C2C12 cell line is not an ideal model for senescence study due to its immortalized nature and lack of normal p16 expression. A more suitable myoblasts model is recommended, with a more comprehensive characterization of senescence features.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>C2C12 is a good model for DNA damage-based senescence that is used in this manuscript. Several reports in the literature have shown the induction of senescence in C2C12 cells. Moiseeva et al 2023 show induction of senescence in C2C12 cells after etoposide-mediated DNA damage. Moustogiannis et al 2021 show the induction of replicative senescence in C2C12 cells. In this study, we show that C2C12 cells undergo DNA damage-mediated senescence after treatment with Doxo. We measured the induction of senescence in C2C12 cells upon DNA damage using several physiological (Nuclear Size, Cell Size, and SA β-gal) and molecular markers (mRNA levels of p21 and SASP factors (IL6 and TGFβ), protein levels of p21) of senescence (see Fig. 1 of the updated manuscript). The results and the figures in the manuscript have been updated accordingly.</p>
<p>(2) The source of increased PGD or its metabolites in the conditioned medium is unclear. Including other senescence models, such as replicative or oncogeneinduced senescence, would strengthen the study.</p>
<p>Fig. 1E shows time-dependent increase in the expression of PGD2 biosynthetic enzymes in senescent C2C12 cells. Fig. 1F shows an increase in the levels of 15dPGJ2 secreted by senescent C2C12 cells in the conditioned medium. This data shows that senescent C2C12 cells are the source of PGD and its metabolites in the conditioned medium.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Again, C2C12 is not suitable for replicative senescence due to its immortalized status.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We and others have shown that C2C12 cells undergo senescence, and this manuscript only used DNA damage induced senescence.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In the in vivo part, it is unclear whether the increased expression of PTGS1, PTGS2, and PTGDS is due to senescence or other side effects of DOXO.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We concur that this is a limitation of this study and the subsequent work will demonstrate the origin of prostaglandin biosynthesis after treatment with Doxo <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure 2A lacks an important control from non-senescent cells during the measurement of C2C12 differentiation in the presence of a conditioned medium.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 2A tests the effect of prostaglandin PGD2 and its metabolites secreted by the senescent cells on the differentiation of myoblasts. Therefore, we inhibited the synthesis of PGD2 in senescent cells by treatment with AT-56, and then collected the conditioned medium. Conditioned medium collected from senescent C2C12 cells treated with vehicle (DMSO) served as a control for the experiment, whereas differentiation of C2C12 cells without any treatment serves as a positive control.</p>
