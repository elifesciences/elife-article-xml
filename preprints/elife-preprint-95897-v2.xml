<title>Abstract</title><p>The myometrium plays a critical role during pregnancy as it is responsible for both the structural integrity of the uterus and force generation at term. Emerging studies in mice indicate a dynamic change of the myometrial epigenome and transcriptome during pregnancy to ready the contractile machinery for parturition. However, the regulatory systems underlying myometrial gene expression patterns throughout gestation remain largely unknown. Here we investigated human term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies for transcriptome, enhancer histone mark cistrome, and chromatin conformation pattern mapping. More than thirty-thousand putative enhancers with H3K27ac and H3K4me1 double positive marks were identified in the myometrium. Enriched transcription factor binding motifs include known myometrial regulators AP-1, STAT, NFkB, and PGR among others. Putative myometrial super enhancers are mostly colocalized with progesterone receptor occupying sites and preferentially associated with highly expressing genes, suggesting a conserved role of PGR in regulating the myometrial transcriptome between species. In human myometrial specimens, inferred PGR activities are positively correlated with phospholipase C like 2 (<italic>PLCL2)</italic> mRNA levels, supporting that PGR may act through this genomic region to promote <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. PGR overexpression facilitated <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression in myometrial cells. Using CRISPR activation, we assessed the functionality of a PGR putative enhancer 35-kilobases upstream of the contractile-restrictive gene <italic>PLCL2</italic>. In summary, results of this study serve as a resource to study gene regulatory mechanisms in the human myometrium at the term pregnancy stage for further advancing women’s health research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The myometrium is the muscular component of the uterus. Throughout gestation, the myometrium maintains contractile quiescence until labor, where uterine contractility facilitates parturition. Pre-term birth, often characterized by aberrant myometrial activity before term, results in the termination of pregnancy prior to 37 weeks gestation. Complications associated with pre-term birth account for 35% of neonatal death and contribute to lifelong physical and socioeconomic multi-morbidities to surviving neonates and mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Chawanpaiboon, Vogel et al. 2019</xref>). It is therefore critical to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance and shift of myometrial quiescence throughout gestation.</p>
<p>The myometrium undergoes extensive structural and functional remodeling in preparation for parturition through genomic regulatory mechanisms which influence gene expression throughout pregnancy. Major transcription factor families have been identified to contribute throughout the remodeling process. Studies on the role of steroid hormone receptors in myometrial remodeling suggest that the withdrawal of functional progesterone signaling at term results from a stoichiometric shift favoring the PGR-A isoform over PGR-B. This shift is associated with increased activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression at term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Mesiano, Chan et al. 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Merlino, Welsh et al. 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Nadeem, Shynlova et al. 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex subunits have been observed to act as PGR coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Dai, Litman et al. 2003</xref>) and have dynamic expression patterns throughout gestation in both humans and rodent models. For example, FOS:JUN heterodimers are implicated to be critical for the initiation of labor through transcriptional regulation of gap junction proteins such as Gja1 (Gap junction alpha 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Mitchell and Lye 2001</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Mitchell and Lye 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Balducci, Risek et al. 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Contributing to the dynamic nature of the myometrial transcriptome during term is the epigenome and its reprogramming. Studies investigating epigenetic markers related to gene activation in the mouse myometrium have revealed that the promoters for contractility-driving genes, such as Gja1, are epigenetically activated well before the onset of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shchuka, Abatti et al. 2020</xref>). Considering this, the myometrial epigenome’s role in parturition disorders, such as preterm birth, has thus been under investigation. For example, it is known that altered DNA methylation is linked with preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Barcelona de Mendoza, Wright et al. 2017</xref>), including at the promoters of genes associated with myometrial contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Erickson, Myatt et al. 2023</xref>) and fetal membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Wang, Ogawa et al. 2008</xref>). However, differential myometrial DNA methylation at CpG islands in the promoters of contractility-driving genes is not thought to be a major contributor to preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Mitsuya, Singh et al. 2014</xref>). Given that DNA methylation mediated gene regulation often occurs outside of CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Irizarry, Ladd-Acosta et al. 2009</xref>), there is still work to be done at this interface. Regardless, whether through epigenetic or transcriptomic gene regulatory programs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of genes critical for myometrial reprogramming and quiescent maintenance are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the cellular processes involved in shaping the myometrium’s dynamic state of quiescence at pregnancy through the epigenetic and transcriptomic profiling of the human myometrium. Because of the relevance of genomic regulatory mechanisms in coordinating myometrial activity, we identified candidate cis-acting regulatory regions using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) assays of surrogate histone enhancer markers H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Creyghton, Cheng et al. 2010</xref>) and H3K4me1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heintzman, Stuart et al. 2007</xref>) alongside chromatin conformation capture assays in term pregnant myometrial tissues. Using this data, we investigated cis-acting regulatory regions for the gene phospholipase C like 2, which encodes for the protein PLCL2 and has been implicated in the modulation of calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Uji, Matsuda et al. 2002</xref>) and maintenance of myometrial quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peavey, Wu et al. 2021</xref>). Putative enhancers upstream of the PLCL2 transcriptional start site were subjected to functional assessment using CRISPR activation-based assays. Here, we identified a genomic region 35-kilobases upstream of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional start site involved in <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize this genomic region through the identification of candidate <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcriptional regulators co-localizing with this cis-acting element using integrative cistrome and transcriptome analysis and have demonstrated PGR to be a direct regulator for <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. These findings build upon our understanding of myometrial remodeling throughout gestation and will be pertinent for the development of medical interventions aiming to address pre-term birth.</p>

<title>Epigenomic Landscape in Term Pregnant Myometrial Specimens</title>
<p>To better understand the regulatory network shaping the myometrial transcriptome before labor, we analyzed transcriptome and putative enhancers in individual human myometrial specimens. Using RNA-seq, we identified actively expressed RNAs, while ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 was used to map putative enhancers. Active genes were associated with nearby putative enhancers based on their genomic proximity. Additionally, chromatin looping patterns were mapped using Hi-C to further link active genes and putative enhancers within the same chromatin loops. The ChIP-seq assay identified an average of 44238 H3K27ac and 74325 H3K4me1 positive genomic regions in three term-pregnant, nonlabor myometrial biopsies (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). An RNA-Seq assay revealed an average of 12157 active genes in these specimens that manifested expression levels of fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) greater or equal to 1 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). A High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C) assay further found a total of 27162 chromatin loops from two of the three myometrial specimens (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, subject 1 and 3). We failed to identify chromatin loops in the second subject’s biopsy due to limited sample availability. Together, these results delineate a map of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 positive signals in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor, which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.</p>

<p>When comparing the present study to previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dotts, Reiman et al. 2023</xref>), 8563 genomic regions carry common H3K27ac-positive histone marks. However, significant variations on the number and location of H3K27ac-positive intervals are present across the six samples among these two studies (Figure S1). Depending on the number of mapped intervals, the 8563 common regions constitute between 20.7% to 71.5% of total H3K27ac-positive intervals across the six myometrial specimens (Figure S1). Notably, the fraction of intervals commonly identified in the present study’s three specimens ranges between 56.4% and 70.0% of each of their total H3K27ac-positive regions, while the Dotts dataset has a wider range between 28.0% and 74.0%. With a less stringent criterium, most the H3K27ac-positive intervals are found in at least two samples, ranging between 75.4% and 98.3% (Figure S1). These data together highlight the degree of variation on mapping the epigenome among specimens and datasets.</p>

<title>Putative Enhancers for Gene Regulation in the Human Myometrium</title>
<p>Since H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marked genome regions are associated with enhancers for gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Creyghton, Cheng et al. 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Heintzman, Stuart et al. 2007</xref>), we define the regions that have overlapping H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks as putative myometrial enhancers at the term pregnant nonlabor stage (Dataset S1). Among the three specimens, 13114 putative enhancers are commonly present (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). A significant variance on the location of myometrial putative enhancers is also seen among biopsies as evident by the observation that these common putative enhancers make up less than half of the total putative enhancers in each individual specimen (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). More than one-third of these 13114 common putative enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase vicinity of actively high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15), while a much smaller fraction of them (13.3%) are associated with actively low-expressing genes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Motif enrichment analysis on these common putative enhancers further reveals an overrepresentation of binding motifs for myometrial transcription factors AP-1, STAT5, and NFκB, steroid hormone receptors PGR and NR3C1, and smooth muscle transcription regulators SRF and ELK1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and Dataset S2). These findings collectively suggest that the putative myometrial enhancers bring together smooth muscle and hormonal control programs for the regulation of myometrial gene expression at term pregnancy.</p>

Across the three human subjects, 540 putative super enhancers are commonly identified in the term pregnant nonlabor myometrial specimens (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and Dataset S3). More than 40% of the 540 putative super enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase distance to high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15), while only 7.3% of putative myometrial super enhancers are found near low-expressing genes (5 &gt; FPKM &gt;=1) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Compared with the regular putative enhancers, the putative myometrial super enhancers are found more frequently near active genes that are expressed at relatively higher levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, 76% of the putative super-enhancers co-localize with known PGR-occupied regions in human myometrial tissue, compared to 20% co-localization observed in regular enhancers (Figure S2). Further examining the myometrial active genes that are associated with putative super enhancers revealed an enrichment of gene functions in cytoskeleton organization, extracellular-receptor interaction, transcription regulation, mRNA stability, and estrogen signaling (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref> and Dataset S4). Taken together, these results establish the association among the putative myometrial enhancers, the potential regulatory program within these super enhancers, and the cellular functions of the genes they may control.</p>

<title>Cis-acting elements for the control of the contractile gene <italic>PLCL2</italic></title>
<p>We previously demonstrated the positive correlation of PLCL2 and PGR expression in a mouse model and PLCL2’s function on negatively modulating oxytocin-induced myometrial cell contraction (Peavy et al., 2021). However, the mechanism that underlies PGR’s regulation of PLCL2 remains unclear. Taking advantage of the mapped myometrial cis-acting elements, we aimed to identify the cis-acting elements that may contribute to the PLCL2 transcriptional regulation with a special interest on the PGR-related enhancers.</p>
<p>The Hi-C assay identified a chromatin loop with one end at the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcription start site (TSS) and the other end at approximately 90-kilobases upstream of the TSS (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Within this chromatin loop, ChIP-Seq results revealed seven genomic regions that are marked with H3K27ac in all three myometrial specimens (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Six of the seven regions are also co-localized with previously published genome occupancy of transcription regulators curated by the ReMap Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hammal, de Langen et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). For the purpose of functional screening, we focus on H3K27ac signals instead of using H3K27ac/H3K4me1 double positive criterium to cast a wider net. Eight guide RNAs (gRNAs) were designed to target these seven candidate regions for CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) based screening of <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene regulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). The two previously reported gRNAs (PLCL2-7 and PLCL2-8) were able to elevate the endogenous <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA levels significantly higher than the non-targeting gRNA in immortalized human myometrial cells (hTERT-HM) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peavey, Wu et al. 2021</xref>). gRNAs PLCLC2-1, PLCL2-3, PLCL2-5, and PLCL2-6 also significantly increased <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression above the levels of the non-targeting group (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, results from the Perturb-Seq assay found that the PLCL2 gene ranks high in the differentially expressed gene list of the PLCL2-5 gRNA expressing cells compared with the non-targeting gRNA expressing cells (Dataset S4), in line with the qRT-PCR assay finding in which the gRNA PLCL2-5 induced <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression to the greatest extent among the upstream non-coding genome targeting gRNA (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, gRNA PLCL2-5 was capable of mediating the increase of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcript abundance in another uterine mesenchymal cell type T-HESC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Collectively, these findings support the PLCL2-5 targeted genomic region as a cis-acting element for regulation of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene.</p>

<title>PGR as an upstream regulator for the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene in the human myometrium</title>
<p>After determining its cis-acting element role, the PLCL2-5 targeted genomic region was further examined to identify upstream regulators that control myometrial <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression. This was achieved by first identifying transcription factor occupancy in this genome region in any tissues/cells that are documented in public databases (ReMAP Atlas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Hammal, de Langen et al. 2022</xref>), followed by filtering for factors that have known mRNA and/or protein expression in hTERT-HM cells and tissues using publicly available transcriptomic and histological data including the Human Protein Atlas (Human Protein Atlas <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://proteinatlas.org">proteinatlas.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Uhlen, Fagerberg et al. 2015</xref>) and published RNA-Seq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Stanfield, Amini et al. 2019</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wu, Anderson et al. 2020</xref>). The resulting candidate upstream regulators for the myometrial <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene are documented in <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Since the <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA abundance is much lower in the hTERT-HM cells than in the myometrial tissues, these candidate upstream regulators were further grouped into candidate activators and repressors based on an assumption that a candidate activator would be expressed higher in human myometrial tissue, and a candidate repressor being expressed higher instead in the hTERT-HM cells, holding the <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA levels down. Candidate activators for the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene include known myometrial regulators such as PGR, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1), and AP-1 (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, the mediator complex protein subunit MED1, cohesion complex members RAD21 and SMC3, and many epigenomic modifiers are among the list of the candidate repressors (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These findings not only provide candidates for subsequent functional assessment, but also highlight potential pathways for future investigations on the regulation of the contractile gene <italic>PLCL2</italic> expression in the myometrium.</p>

<p>We previously demonstrated the regulation of mouse <italic>Plcl2</italic> gene by the myometrial PGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wu, Wang et al. 2022</xref>). To further test whether such a regulatory mechanism is also present in the human, the CRISPRa technology was employed to increase the expression of PGR mRNA and proteins in hTERT-HM cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Given that the PGR640 gRNA led to higher PGR protein production (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>), this gRNA was utilized to stimulate myometrial <italic>PGR</italic> expression for subsequent experiments. Indeed, RT-qPCR results showed that PGR overexpression increased <italic>PLCL2</italic> mRNA abundance in hTERT-HM cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>), demonstrating a consistent finding with the mouse model.</p>

<p>To further explore this regulatory relationship in the human myometrial tissue, we examined the degree of correlation between the inferred PGR activity and the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcript abundance in myometrial biopsies. Gene expression profiles of myometrial specimens from 13 proliferative-phase, 6 secretory-phase, 14 post-menopausal, and 10 Provera-treated human subjects were determined by the RNA-Seq assay (Dataset S6) to take advantage of the wide spectrum of progesterone signaling activities in these samples. Inferred myometrial PGR activities, represented as T-scores (Dataset S6), were derived from this normalized gene expression matrix of 43 human myometrial specimens with the previously published mouse myometrial <italic>Pgr</italic> gene signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wu, Wang et al. 2022</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li, Bushel et al. 2021</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Temporally and spatially regulated gene expression is the foundation of tissue phenotype manifestation. Shchuka and colleagues utilize the mouse model to show that the myometrial epigenome is readily programed for parturition-associated gene induction days ahead of the term pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Shchuka, Abatti et al. 2020</xref>), laying the ground for subsequent laboring event. We chose to study the human myometrium at the term pregnant nonlabor stage in order to examine the association between the epigenome landscape and the gene expression pattern not only for preparing the myometrium for parturition, but also for maintaining myometrial quiescence. We also performed a mullti-omic study on a myometrial specimen from each individual human subject to better align all the datasets together, reflecting specimen and subject individuality. While the variation among specimens is substantial, we were able to identify myometrial cis-acting elements commonly shared among three individuals. As a proof of principle, we subsequently used this information to functionally screen for genomic regions that may mediate the regulation of the contractile-suppressing gene <italic>PLCL2</italic>. The H3K27ac marked 35-kilobase upstream region as a result of the screening then serves as a bridge to identify PGR as one of the upstream regulators for modulating <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene expression in human myometrium. These findings showcase the value of these datasets as a resource for future investigations on the mechanisms of myometrial gene regulation.</p>
<p>Variations across cistromic datasets for the human myometrium are significant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Figure S1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dotts, Reiman et al. 2023</xref>). Contributing factors likely include but are not limited to subject-to-subject differences and batch effects from sample preparations. Taking the H3K27ac marked genomic regions as an example, regions commonly identified in the specimens of this study’s three subjects account for 55.9%, 67.7%, and 57.9% of total H3K27ac-positive intervals in each individual sample, despite our best attempt to reduce the batch effect. Heterogeneity on cell type compositions, likely due to the sampling location, could be a major contributing factor to the variation. It is also speculated that the genomic regions with subject-to-subject variances could be transiently present and thus the signal could not be captured across samples. In addition, the underlying health conditions, medications, and environmental challenges among others may also affect the epigenomic profile. Variations could also arise from differences in the detection threshold. We identified an average of 44238 H3K27ac marked regions per specimen, while Dotts and colleagues found nearly 19000 per sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dotts, Reiman et al. 2023</xref>). Reagent and sample handling could confound with biological variances of specimens leading to this difference. Future investigations using standardized sample preparation protocols at the single cell resolution may help to reduce this variation.</p>
<p>Results from the CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq assay demonstrate the capability of this technology to screen for cis-acting elements that are in topological vicinity of the gene of interest. This assay is particularly useful on genes that are expressed at low levels in the screening platform, i.e., the cells. The dCas9VPR activator can generate satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios to be detected by single cell RNAseq. The advantage of assaying with this system is that each individual cell serves as a container to generate data points instead of relying on multiple wells on cell culture plates. Multiplexing with multiple gRNAs can be achieved by using the gRNA sequence as a unique barcode of the cell, enabling the simultaneous collection of numerous data points for each individual gRNA. In the present study, 56.7% of tested cells carried one species of detectable gRNAs, permitting the study of the resulting effect under a single gRNA. Moreover, another 27.0% of assayed cells have more than one species of detectable gRNAs, which open the possibility to study interactions between different cis-acting elements. However, we failed to use this approach for the purpose of identifying target genes of a putative enhancer of interest (Dataset S4). Challenges such as difficulties on defining the criteria of the associated genes and unsatisfactory signal-to-noise ratios on genes already at high baseline levels should be considered in future experimental designs. Taken together, results of the present study support the use of the CRISPRa-based Pertub-Seq assay under a defined scope.</p>
<p>PLCL2 and its paralog PLCL1 are catalytically inactive members of the phospholipase C family functioning as negative regulators of calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Kanematsu, Takeuchi et al. 2005</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Takenaka, Fukami et al. 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Uji, Matsuda et al. 2002</xref>). Both of them are expressed in human myometrial tissues and are able to attenuate oxytocin-induced muscle cell contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peavey, Wu et al. 2021</xref>). <italic>PLCL1</italic> mRNA abundance is higher in the myometrium at term pregnancy than the non-gravid stage, while <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcript levels remain comparable between the two stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Wu, Anderson et al. 2020</xref>). Data from cultured human endometrial stromal cells and the genetically engineered mouse model reveal progesterone signaling as the upstream regulator of <italic>PLCL1</italic> and <italic>PLCL2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Muter, Brighton et al. 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Peavey, Wu et al. 2021</xref>). The present study further demonstrates the PGR-dependent regulation of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene in the human myometrial cells, suggesting that this pathway is conserved between human and mouse. Importantly, the identification of the cis-acting element 35-kilobase upstream of the <italic>PLCL2</italic> gene opens an avenue to investigate the impact of interactions between PGR and other myometrial transcription regulators on the mechanism of action that controls the myometrial contractile machinery. The future findings in this space could provide insight on progesterone signaling modification and identify progesterone signaling modifiers for the development of novel therapy that targets parturition disorders.</p>

To obtain a comprehensive set of peaks across all H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets, the peak intervals from each dataset were merged using BedTools.</p>

<title>Identification of super enhancers</title>
<p>H3K27ac-positive enhancers were defined as regions of H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in each sample. The enhancers within 12.5Kb were merged by using bedtools merge function with parameter “-d 12500”. The combined enhancer regions were called super enhancers if they were larger than 15Kb. The common super enhancers from multiple samples were used for downstream analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Whyte, Orlando et al. 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Colocalization of super enhancers and PGR genome occupancy was compared by calling peaks from previously published PGR ChIP-seq data (GSM4081683 and GSM4081684). The percentages of enhancers and super enhancers that manifest PGR occupancy were calculated by overlapping the genomic regions in each category with PGR occupancy regions.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq analysis of Term Myometrial Specimens</title>
<p>The raw paired-end reads (51-bp, paired-end) were initially processed by applying a filter with an average quality score of 20. Adaptor sequences were subsequently removed from reads using cutadapt version 1.12. The processed reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using the STAR aligner version 2.5.2b. The gene expression levels in each sample were determined by counting the total number of paired-end reads mapped to each gene using DESeq2 R package version 1.12.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Love, Huber and Anders 2014</xref>). The gene expression count matrix was normalized based on ratio of total mapped read pairs in each sample to 56.5 million. Only the genes with average normalized count across all samples larger than one were used for further analysis. The Bioconductor package edgeR was applied to the gene expression count matrix to detect differentially expressed genes between groups of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Robinson, McCarthy and Smyth 2010</xref>). The false discovery rate (FDR) of differentially expressed genes was estimated using the Benjamini and Hochberg method.</p>

<title>RNA-Seq analysis of Provera Treated Human Myometrial Specimens</title>
<p>The raw paired-end reads (76-bp, paired-end) were processed by applying a filter with an average quality score of 20. Adaptor sequences were removed from reads using cutadapt (v1.12). The processed reads were then aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using the STAR aligner (v2.5.2b). Fragments Per Kilobase Million (FPKM) was calculated for each gene in each sample by using Cufflinks version 2.0.2.</p>

<title>Hi-C</title>
<p>The raw reads (51-bp, paired-end) generated from HiC library were mapped to human reference genome (hg38; Genome Reference Consortium Human GRCh38 from December 2013) using HiCUP version 0.7.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Wingett, Ewels et al. 2015</xref>). The uniquely mapped di-tag passing quality filtering with distance larger than 10Kb were used for downstream analysis. Chromatin loops were identified using “hiccups” function of Juicer version 1.8.9 with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Durand, Shamim et al. 2016</xref>). The A/B compartments were predicted at 100Kb resolution using “eigenvector” function of Juicer. The Hi-C quality control data are provided in Dataset S8, and the summary table is available in Dataset 7.</p>

<p>Enriched motifs were identified by HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) v4.11 with default background sequences matching the input sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Heinz, Benner et al. 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Inferred myometrial PGR activities and the correlation analysis</title>
<p>The inferred PGR activities were represented by the T-score, which was derived by inputting the mouse myometrial <italic>Pgr</italic> gene signature, based on the differentially expressed genes between control and myometrial <italic>Pgr</italic> knockout groups at mid-pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Wu, Wang et al., 2022</xref>), into the SEMIPs application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Li, Bushel et al., 2021</xref>). The T-scores were computed using this signature alongside the normalized gene expression counts (FPKM) from 43 human myometrial biopsy specimens.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The use of a multi-omics approach to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying parturition and myometrial quiescence adds novelty to the study. The identification of myometrial cis-acting elements and their association with gene expression, particularly the regulation of the PLCL2 gene by PGR opens the door to further investigate the impact of PGR and other regulators.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Multi-Omic Approach: The paper employs a comprehensive multi-omic approach, combining ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq assays, which allow for a thorough investigation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying myometrial gene expression.</p>
<p>
(2) Clinical Relevance: Investigating human myometrial specimens provides direct clinical relevance, as understanding the molecular mechanisms governing parturition and myometrial quiescence can have significant implications for the management of pregnancy-related disorders.</p>
<p>
(3) Functional work: For functional screening, They have used CRISPRa-based screening of PLCL2 gene regulation using immortalized human cell-line hTERT-HM and T-hESC to add more dimension to the work which strengthens their finding of PGR-dependent regulation of the PLCL2 gene in the human myometrial cells.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) Variability in epigenomic mapping: The significant variations in the number and location of H3K27ac-positive intervals across different samples and studies suggest potential challenges in accurately mapping the myometrial epigenome. This variability may introduce uncertainty and complicate the interpretation of results.</p>
<p>
(2) Sample specificity: The study focuses on term pregnant nonlabor myometrial specimens, limiting the generalizability of the findings to other stages of pregnancy or labor.</p>
<p>
(3) Limited Understanding of Regulatory Mechanisms: While the study identifies potential regulatory programs within super-enhancers, the exact mechanisms by which these enhancers regulate gene expression and cellular functions in the myometrium remain unclear. Further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate these processes.</p>
<p>
(4) Discordant analysis: Why regular enhancers are being understood in terms of motif enrichment of transcription factors and super-enhancers in terms of pathways enriched for active genes? This needs a clear reason.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In &quot;Assessment of the Epigenomic Landscape in Human Myometrium at Term Pregnancy&quot; the authors generate a number of genome-wide data sets to investigate epigenomic and transcriptomic regulation of the myometrium at term pregnancy. These data provide a useful resource for further evaluation of gene regulatory mechanisms in the myometrium and include the first Hi-C data published for this tissue. There is a comparison to previously published histone modification data and integration with RNA-seq to highlight potential enhancer-gene regulatory relationships. The authors further investigate putative enhancers upstream of the PLCL2 gene and identify a candidate region that may be regulated by the PGR (progesterone receptor) signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are in the multi-omics nature of the design as several genome-wide data sets are generated from the same patient samples. Extending this type of approach in the future to a larger number of samples will allow for additional investigation into gene regulation as correlation between epigenomic features and gene expression across a larger number of samples can reveal regulatory relationships.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>One of the most interesting aspects of this study is the generation of the first Hi-C data for the human pregnant myometrium, however, there is minimal description in the results section of the Hi-C data analysis and the only data shown are the number of loops identified and one such loop that includes the PLCL2 promoter shown in figure 3A. The manuscript would benefit from a more extensive analysis of the Hi-C data, for example, the analysis of TADs (topological associating domains) would be interesting to add and could be used to evaluate to what extent H3K27ac domains and putative regulated genes fall within the same TAD.</p>
<p>The authors present some convincing evidence on the transcriptional regulation of the PLCL2 gene using Perturb-Seq to identify putative upstream enhancer regions and PGR over-expression showing PGR can act as an activator. These two experiments on their own are interesting, however, they are not as mechanistically integrated as they could be to clarify the molecular mechanisms. Deletion of the putative enhancer upstream of PLCL2 followed by over-expression of PGR would clarify the mechanistic relationship between the proposed enhancer, PGR and PLCL2 expression. Does PGR act through the proposed enhancer? In addition, reporter assays using this proposed enhancer region with and without increased expression of PGR and mutation of any PRE sequences would also provide mechanistic insight. Although CRISPRa and Perturb-Seq can be used to identify potential regulatory regions, the best approach to verify the requirement for a particular enhancer in regulating a specific gene is a deletion approach.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have addressed my comments that were directly sent to them, however, my comments in the public review, specifically the superficial nature of the Hi-C analysis were not addressed.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the comments to reviewer 3 were unaddressed and declared out of the scope of this study, as these were points of accuracy in the data analysis they are very much in scope.</p>
<p>I hope the authors reconsider presenting a more thorough analysis.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. investigate active H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks in term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies, linking putative enhancers and super enhancers to gene expression levels. Through their findings, they reveal the PGR-dependent regulation of the PLCL2 gene in human myometrial cells via a cis-acting element located 35-kilobases upstream of the PLCL2 gene. By targeting this region using a CRISPR activation system, they were able to increase the elevate the endogenous PLCL2 mRNA levels in immortalized human myometrial cells.</p>
<p>This research offers novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression in myometrial tissues, advancing our understanding of pregnancy-related processes.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>(1) A more comprehensive analysis of the epigenetic and transcriptomic data would have strengthened the paper, moving beyond basic association studies. Currently, it is challenging to assess the quality and significance of the data as much of the information is lacking.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>- The combination of ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and CRISPRa Perturb-Seq approaches to investigate gene regulation and expression in myometrial cells.</p>
<p>
- The use of CRISPR activation system to specifically target cis-acting elements.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>- The manuscript would strongly benefit from a deeper analysis of the Omic datasets. Furthermore, expanding figures/graphs to effectively contextualize these datasets would be greatly beneficial and would add more value to this research.</p>
<p>
- Limited sample size, coupled with variability in results and overall lack of details, compromises the robustness of result interpretation.</p>
<p>
- Additional efforts are needed to dissect the proposed regulatory mechanisms.</p>
<p>
- While the discussion provided helpful context for understanding some of the experiments performed, it lacked interpretation of the results in relation to the existing literature.</p>
<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have improved the manuscript by enhancing its readability and organization. Tables were added to present key information more clearly, and figures were refined for better visualization. Additionally, more details were included, particularly in the methods and bioinformatics analyses sections, ensuring a more comprehensive and precise presentation of the data.</p>
<p>However, in many cases, reviewers' questions and concerns were addressed in the response to reviewers rather than incorporated into the manuscript, or it was noted that these points would be explored in future studies.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Sample size: If the sample size of the study is increased, more confidence and new insights can be inferred about myometrial enhancer-mediated gene regulation in term pregnancy. Such a small sample size (N = 3) limits the statistical power of the study. As mentioned in the manuscript they failed to identify chromatin loops in the second subject's biopsy is observed due to a limited sample.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment about the sample size. We sincerely hope the result of this study would increase the interest of stakeholders to fund future projects in a larger scale.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure quality: There is a lack of good representations of the results (e.g., screenshots of tables as figure panels!) as well as missing interpretations that might add value to the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Figure 1B and 2B have been converted to the pie chart format.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) Definition of super-enhancer: The definition of super-enhancer is not clear. Also, the computational merging of enhancers to define super-enhancers should be described better.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Added more details about tool and parameter setting in the Method section of “Identification of super enhancers”:</p>
<p>“Identification of super enhancers</p>
<p>H3K27ac-positive enhancers were defined as regions of H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in each sample. The enhancers within 12.5Kb were merged by using bedtools merge function with parameter “-d 12500”. The combined enhancer regions were called super enhancers if they were larger than 15Kb. The common super enhancers from multiple samples were used for downstream analysis.”</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Assay-Specific Limitations: Each assay employed in the study, such as ChIP-Seq and CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq, has its limitations, including potential biases, sensitivity issues, and technical challenges, which could impact the accuracy and reliability of the results. These limitations should be addressed properly to avoid false-positive results and improve the interpretability of the results.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The major limitations of the CRISPRa-based Perturb-Seq protocol in this study are the use of the hTERT-HM cells and the two-vector system for transduction. While hTERT-HM cells are a much easier platform in terms of technical operation, primary human myometrial cells are generally considered retaining a molecular context that is closer to the in vivo tissues. Due to the limitation on the efficiency of having two vectors simultaneously present in the same cell, hTERT-HM cells are much more affordable and operationally feasible to conduct the experiment. Future advancements on the increase of viral vector payload capacity may overcome this challenge and open the venue to perform the assay on primary human myometrial cells.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Sample collection and comparison: There is mention of matched gravid term and non-gravid samples whereas no description or use of control samples was found in the results. Also, the comparison of non-labor samples with labor samples would provide a better understanding of epigenomic and transcriptomic events of myometrium leading to laboring events.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The description has been updated:</p>
<p>“Collection of myometrial specimens</p>
<p>Permission to collect human tissue specimens was prospectively obtained from individuals undergoing hysterectomy or cesarean section for benign clinical indications (H-33461). Gravid myometrial tissue was obtained from the margin of the hysterotomy in women undergoing term cesarean sections (&gt;38 weeks estimated gestational age) without evidence of labor. Non-gravid myometrial tissue was collected from pre-menopausal women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions. Specimens from gravid women receiving treatment for pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, pregnancy-related hypertension, or pre-term labor were excluded.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Lack of clarity:</p>
<p>(6a) It is written as 'Chromatin Conformation Capture (Hi-C)'. I think Hi-C is Histone Capture and 3C is Chromosome Conformation Capture! This needs clear writing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As the reviewer suggested, to make it clear, we have changed the text “A high throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) assay” to “A High-throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (Hi-C) assay”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6b) In multiple places, 'PLCL2' gene is written as 'PCLC2'.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrected as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6c) What is the biological relevance of considering 'active' genes with FPKM {greater than or equal to} 1? This needs clarification.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In RNA-seq analysis, the gene expression levels are often quantified using FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads). Setting a threshold of FPKM for defining &quot;active&quot; genes in RNA-seq analysis is biologically relevant, because it helps to distinguish between genuinely expressed genes and background noise. It helps researchers focus on genes, which are more likely to have a significant biological impact. A common threshold for defining &quot;active&quot; genes is FPKM ≥ 1. Genes with FPKM values below this threshold may be transcribed at very low levels or could be background noise.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6d) The understanding of differentially methylated genes at promoters is underrated as per the authors. But, why leaving DNA methylation apart, they selected histone modification as the basis of epigenetic reprogramming in terms of myometrium is unclear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>DNA methylation indeed plays a crucial role in evaluating the impact of cis-acting elements on gene regulation. Large-scale studies, such as the comprehensive analysis of the myometrial methylome landscape in human biopsies (Paul et al., JCI Insight, 2022, PMID: 36066972), have provided valuable insights. When integrated with histone modification and chromatin looping data, contributed by our group and collaborators, future secondary analyses leveraging machine learning are poised to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying myometrial transcriptional regulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6e) How does the identification of PGR as an upstream regulator of PLCL2 gene expression in human myometrial cells contribute to our understanding of progesterone signaling in myometrial function?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In a previous study, we demonstrated a positive correlation between <italic>PLCL2</italic> and <italic>PGR</italic> expression in a mouse model and identified PLCL2's role in negatively modulating oxytocin-induced myometrial cell contraction (Peavy et al., PNAS, 2021, PMID: 33707208). The present study builds on this by providing evidence for a direct regulatory mechanism in which PGR influences <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcription, likely through a cis-acting element located 35 kb upstream. These findings suggest that PLCL2 acts as a mediator of PGR-dependent myometrial quiescence prior to labor, rather than merely participating in a parallel pathway. Further in vivo studies are necessary to delineate the extent to which PLCL2 mediates PGR activity, particularly the contraction-dampening function of the PGR-B isoform.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Grammatical error: The manuscript has numerous grammatical errors. Please correct them.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Corrections have been made as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Use of single-cell data: Though from the Methods section, it can be understood that single-cell RNA-seq was done to identify CRISPRa gRNA expressing cells to characterize the effect of gene activation, some results from single-cell data e.g., cell clustering, cell types, gRNA expression across clusters could be added for better elucidation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As reviewer suggested, we have prepared a file “PerturbSeq_summary.xlsx” (Dataset S9) to provide additional results of perturb-seq data analysis. It includes 2 spreadsheets, “Cell_per_gRNA” for clustering and “Protospacer_calls_per_cell” for gRNA expression across clusters.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The following are a number of grammatical issues in the abstract. I suggest having a careful read of the entire manuscript to identify additional grammatical issues as I may not be able to highlight all of these issues.</p>
<p>(1a) &quot;The myometrium plays a critical component during pregnancy.&quot; change component to role.</p>
<p>(1b) &quot;It is responsible for the uterus' structural integrity and force generation at term,&quot; à replace &quot;,&quot; with &quot;.&quot;</p>
<p>(1c) Also, I suggest rephrasing the first 2 sentences to: The myometrium plays a critical role during pregnancy as it is responsible for both the structural integrity of the uterus and force generation at term.</p>
<p>(1d) &quot;Here we investigated the human term pregnant nonlabor myometrial biopsies for transcriptome, enhancer histone mark cistrome, and chromatin conformation pattern mapping.&quot; Remove &quot;the&quot;, and modify to &quot;Here we investigated human term pregnant&quot;.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Corrections have been made as suggested.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Sentence fragment: Studies on the role of steroid hormone receptors in myometrial remodeling have provided evidence that the withdrawal of functional progesterone signaling at term is due to a stoichiometric increase of progesterone receptor (PGR) A to B isoform-related estrogen receptor (ESR) alpha expression activation at term. (Mesiano, Chan et al. 2002) (Merlino, Welsh et al. 2007) (Nadeem, Shynlova et al. 2016).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The statement has been updated:</p>
<p>“Studies on the role of steroid hormone receptors in myometrial remodeling suggest that the withdrawal of functional progesterone signaling at term results from a stoichiometric shift favoring the PGR-A isoform over PGR-B. This shift is associated with increased activation of estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) expression at term (Mesiano, Chan et al. 2002) (Merlino, Welsh et al. 2007) (Nadeem, Shynlova et al. 2016).”</p>

<p>(3) FOS:JUN heterodimers are implicated to be critical for the initiation of labor through transcriptional regulation of gap junction proteins such as Cx43 (Nadeem, Farine et al. 2018) (Balducci, Risek et al. 1993).</p>
<p>Use Gja1 (Gap junction alpha 1) as the current correct gene, not Cx43.</p>
<p>Also, several references predate Nadeem, Farine et al. 2018 and are more appropriate to use as references for the role of Ap-1 proteins in regulating Gja1; PMID: 15618352 and PMID: 12064606 were the first to show this relationship in myometrial cells.</p>

<p>(7) &quot;Six of the seven regions are also co-localized with previously published genome occupancy of transcription regulators curated by the ReMap Atlas&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Please clarify if this Atlas includes myometrial tissues or not and clarify the cell types included in the atlas.</p>
<p>According to the UCSC Genome Browser and the reference by Hammal et al. (2022), the current ReMap database includes PGR ChIP-seq data from human myometrial biopsies, available under NCBI GEO accession number GSE137550, alongside data from various other cell and tissue types. ReMap provides valuable insights into potential functional cis-acting elements in the genome from a systems biology perspective. However, tissue specificity requires independent validation.</p>

<p>(8) &quot;Notably, 76% of the putative super-enhancers are co-localized with known PGR-occupied regions in the human myometrial tissue (Figure S2). This is significantly higher than the 20% co-localization in the regular enhancer group (Figure S2).&quot;</p>
<p>Because there is a huge difference in the size of the putative super enhancer regions and the isolated enhancers this comparison is not appropriate as conducted. The comparison needs to account for the difference in size of the regions. Please provide P values for significance statements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge the reviewer's concern that our initial statement was overstated and potentially misleading, given the substantial difference in size between putative super-enhancer regions and regular enhancers. Rather than emphasizing the enrichment, it would be more accurate to simply describe our observation that super-enhancers encompass more PGR-occupied regions.</p>
<p>Here is the updated version:</p>
<p>“Notably, 76% of the putative super-enhancers co-localize with known PGR-occupied regions in human myometrial tissue, compared to 20% co-localization observed in regular enhancers (Figure S2).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Title is extremely misleading, as here we do not get a view of the epigenomic landscape, but rather sparce data related to H3K27ac and H3K4me (focusing on enhancers) and chromatin conformation associated with the PLCL2 transcription start site (TSS).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, the title is modified to “Assessment of the Histone Mark-based Epigenomic Landscape in Human Myometrium at Term Pregnancy”.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Improve the first result paragraph by providing a clear rationale for the experiments and their objectives, as well as introducing the samples used. Rather than simply listing approaches and end results in Table 1, offer concise explanations for the experiments alongside the supporting data presented in detailed figures. Using appropriate figures/graphs to effectively contextualize these datasets would be greatly appreciated by readers and would add more value to this research. Currently, it is difficult for us to assess and appreciate the quality of the data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The following statement is included in the beginning of the Result section:</p>
<p>&quot;To better understand the regulatory network shaping the myometrial transcriptome before labor, we analyzed transcriptome and putative enhancers in individual human myometrial specimens. Using RNA-seq, we identified actively expressed RNAs, while ChIP-seq for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 was used to map putative enhancers. Active genes were associated with nearby putative enhancers based on their genomic proximity. Additionally, chromatin looping patterns were mapped using Hi-C to further link active genes and putative enhancers within the same chromatin loops.&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The statistics for every sequencing approach need to be provided for each sample (e.g., RNA-seq: number of total reads, number of mapped reads, % of mapped reads; ChIP-Seq: number of mapped reads, % of mapped reads, % of duplicates).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have generated the summary table of each dataset included in this study (Dataset S7) [NGS-summary.xls].</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) Figure S1: The rationale behind comparing the Dotts study and yours regarding H3K27ac-positive regions needs to be better defined. Why is this performed if the data will not be used afterwards? What are the conserved regions associated with vs the ones that are variable? Is this biologically relevant? Why not use only the regions conserved between the 6 samples, to have more robust conclusions?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The purpose of comparing our data with the Dotts dataset is to highlight the degree of variation across studies. In this study, we focused on addressing specific biological questions using our own dataset rather than developing methodologies for meta-analysis. Future advancements in meta-analysis techniques could leverage the combined power of multiple datasets to provide deeper insights.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) Perhaps due to a lack of details, I am unable to ascertain how the putative myometrial enhancers were defined. In Dataset S1, it is stated, &quot;we define the regions that have overlapping H3K27ac and H3K4me1 marks as putative myometrial enhancers at the term pregnant nonlabor stage (Dataset S1)&quot;. Within Dataset S1, for subjects 1, 2, and 3, H3K27ac and H3K4me1 double-positive enhancers are shown in term pregnant, non-labor human myometrial specimens, with approximately 100 regions corresponding to 131 (sample 1), 127 (sample 2), and 140 (sample 3) common peaks. However, in Figure 1a, reference is made to the 13114 putative enhancers commonly present across the three specimens. Is Dataset S1 intended to represent only a small fraction of the 13114 putative enhancers? Detailed analyses need to be conducted and better showcased.</p>
</disp-quote>

<p>(6) For the gene expression analyses of RNA-seq data, FPKM values were utilized. However, it is unclear why the gene expression count matrix was normalized based on the ratio of total mapped read pairs in each sample to 56.5 million for the term myometrial specimens. I would recommend exercising caution regarding the use of FPKM expression units, as samples are normalized only within themselves, lacking cross-sample normalization. Consequently, due to external factors unaccounted for by this normalization method, a value of 10 in one sample may not equate to 10 in another.</p>

<p>We value the reviewer’s input. This question will be addressed in future secondary data analyses with suitable methodologies, as it is beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 1b, the authors have categorized their 12157 active genes into 3 bins based on FPKM values: &gt;5 FPKM &gt;1, &gt;15 FPKM &gt;5, and &gt;15 FPKM. However, in the text, they describe these as 'actively high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15)'. I would advise caution regarding the interpretation of these values, as an FPKM of 15 is not typically associated with highly expressed genes. According to literature and resources such as the Expression Atlas, an FPKM of 15 is generally considered to represent a low to medium expression level.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback. This question will be revisited during secondary data analyses using appropriate methodologies, as it falls outside the scope of the present study.</p>
<p>To increase readability and clarity, we modified the sentence as following: More than 40% of the 540 putative super enhancers are located within a 100-kilobase distance to high-expressing genes (FPKM &gt;= 15), while only 7.3% of putative myometrial super enhancers are found near low-expressing genes (5 &gt; FPKM &gt;=1) (Figure 2B).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) Out of the 12157 active genes, approximately two-thirds have an FPKM &gt;15. Was this expected? How does this correspond to what is observed in the literature, particularly in other similar studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30988671/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30988671/</ext-link> ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35260533/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35260533/</ext-link> ) .</p>

<p>This is indeed an intriguing question that merits further exploration in future secondary analyses.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(9) It is also surprising to see that for the motif enrichment analysis (Fig. 1C), the P-values are small. This is probably because the percentage of target sequences with the motif is very similar to the percentage of background sequences with the motif. For instance, for selected genes in Figure 1C: AP-1 (50.68% vs. 46.50%), STAT5 (28.08% vs. 25.04%), PGR (17.90% vs. 16.12%), etc. Can one really say that you have a biologically relevant enrichment for values that are so close between target sequences and background sequences?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Reviewer’s comment is noted. Biological relevance shall be experimentally examined though wet-lab assays in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(10) For Figure 2, again not convinced that FPKM &gt;= 15 can be used to say: Compared with the regular putative enhancers, the putative myometrial super-enhancers are found more frequently near active genes that are expressed at relatively higher levels (Figure 1B and Figure 2B). A higher threshold should be used if they want to say this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>To compare the association of putative enhancers with active genes expressed at different levels, we categorized the active genes into three groups based on their FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) values. These groups are defined as follows: the top third active genes (FPKM ≥ 15), the middle third active genes (5 ≤ FPKM &lt; 15), and the bottom third active genes (1 ≤ FPKM &lt; 5). By &quot;active genes expressed at relatively higher levels,&quot; we refer specifically to the top third active genes with FPKM values of 15 or higher, indicating their relatively higher expression levels compared to the other groups of active genes.</p>

<p>(11) More detailed explanations and methods are needed regarding how the data for Figure S2 was obtained.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The following details were added to the methods section:</p>
<p>“Colocalization of super enhancers and PGR genome occupancy was compared by calling peaks from previously published PGR ChIP-seq data (GSM4081683 and GSM4081684). The percentages of enhancers and super enhancers that manifest PGR occupancy were calculated by overlapping the genomic regions in each category with PGR occupancy regions.”</p>

<p>(12) In Figure 2C, there is no information provided on the genes used to obtain the results. It would be helpful to include examples of these genes, along with their expression values, for instance.</p>

<p>The expression levels of the 346 active genes that are associated with myometrial super enhancers are included in Dataset S4, along with results of the updated gene ontology enrichment analysis using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) of Knowledgebase v2024q4.

<p>(13) The linking of PLCL2-related data to the first part of the story is lacking, and the rationale behind it is missing. This entire section should be more detailed, and the data should be expanded to better reflect the context.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As suggested, we included the following statement at the beginning of the section “Cis-acting elements for the control of the contractile gene PLCL2”:</p>
<p>“We previously demonstrated the positive correlation of PLCL2 and PGR expression in a mouse model and PLCL2’s function on negatively modulating oxytocin-induced myometrial cell contraction (Peavy et al., 2021). However, the mechanism underlies the PGR regulation of PLCL2 remains unclear. Taking advantage of the mapped myometrial cis-acting elements, we aimed to identify the cis-acting elements that may contribute to the PLCL2 transcriptional regulation with a special interest on the PGR-related enhancers.”</p>
<p>The context is that our results provide additional evidence to support a direct regulation mechanism of PGR on the <italic>PLCL2</italic> transcription, likely though the 35-kb upstream cis-acting element. This finding suggests that PLCL2 likely plays a mediator’s role of PGR dependent myometrial quiescence before laboring rather than a mere passenger on a parallel pathway. Further studies using in vivo models are needed to determine the extent of PLCL2 in mediating PGR, especially PGR-B isoform’s contraction-dampening function.</p>

<p>(15) The authors state: &quot;For the purpose of functional screening, we focus on H3K27ac signals instead of using H3K27ac/H3K4me1 double positive criterium to cast a wider net.&quot; However, it is unclear how many of the targeted regions contained H3K27ac/H3K4me1 peaks. Were enhancers or super-enhancers targeted, and if so, how did they compare to H3K27ac sites?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The numbers of H3K27ac/H3K4me1 double positive peaks are recorded in Figure 1A. Compared to the numbers of H3K27ac intervals (Table 1), the H3K27ac/H3K4me1 double positive peaks are 62.9%, 70.7%, and 61.2% of corresponding H3K27ac intervals in each individual specimen.</p>

<p>(16) For the first set of data (Table 1), the authors state, &quot;Together, these results reveal an epigenomic landscape in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor, which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.&quot; While it is acknowledged that an epigenetic landscape exists in all tissues, there is a lack of clarity regarding this landscape in the current manuscript, as we are only presented with a table containing numbers.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This sentence has been revised to: “Together, these results delineate a map of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 positive signals in the human term pregnant myometrial tissue before the onset of labor, which we use as a resource to investigate the molecular mechanisms that prepare the myometrium for subsequent parturition.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(17) For S1, the authors conclude: These data together highlight the degree of variation in mapping the epigenome among specimens and datasets. This conclusion seems somewhat perplexing, and I find myself in partial disagreement. Firstly, providing a clear rationale for this section would strengthen the conclusions. It's important to consider what factors may contribute to this variability. It could simply be attributed to differences in experimental settings, such as variations in samples, protocols used, antibodies, sequencing departments, or overall data quality. Deeper analyses of the data could have provided more information.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that deeper analyses are needed in order to extract more information among studies. However, appropriate methods for meta-analyses should be carefully evaluated and employed for this purpose. We humbly believe that such a task should belong to future studies that may combine available datasets for secondary analyses, leveraging the collective contribution of the reproductive biology community.</p>

<p>Added more details about tool and parameter setting in the Method section of “Identification of super enhancers”.</p>
<p>“Identification of super enhancers</p>
<p>H3K27ac-positive enhancers were defined as regions of H3K27ac ChIP-seq peaks in each sample. The enhancers within 12.5Kb were merged by using bedtools merge function with parameter “-d 12500”. The combined enhancer regions were called super enhancers if they were larger than 15Kb. The common super enhancers from multiple samples were used for downstream analysis.”</p>

<p>(21) Regarding the RNA-Seq analysis of Provera-treated human Myometrial Specimens, the continued use of FPKM is not ideal due to potential differences in RNA composition between libraries. Additionally, clarification is needed on why Cufflinks 2.0.2 was used, considering it is no longer supported.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) is used in RNA-Seq analysis, because it allows for the normalization of gene expression data, accounting for differences in gene length and sequencing depth, and facilitates comparability across different genes and libraries. This makes it one of the essential tools for accurately measuring and comparing gene expression levels in various biological and clinical research contexts.</p>
<p>CuffLinks was once a popular tool for analyzing RNA-seq data, transcriptome assembly, and DEG identification. Its usage has declined in recent years due to the emergence of newer and more advanced tools. The main reason is that it was used for RNA-seq analysis at early stage of this study a few years ago. For the purpose of comparison and consistency, we continued using this tool for later RNA-seq analysis. If we start a new project now, we will choose newer tools, such as HISAT2, Salmon, and DEseq2.</p>
