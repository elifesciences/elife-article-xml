<title>Abstract</title>
<p>As the first step of food ingestion, the swallow is under rigorous sensorimotor control. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying swallow control at a molecular and circuitry level remain largely unknown. Here, we find that mutation of the mechanotransduction channel genes <italic>nompC, Tmc</italic>, or <italic>piezo</italic> impairs the regular pumping rhythm of the cibarium during feeding of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. A group of multi-dendritic mechanosensory neurons, which co-express the three channels, wrap the cibarium and are crucial for coordinating the filling and emptying of the cibarium. Inhibition of them causes difficulty in food emptying in the cibarium, while their activation leads to difficulty in cibarium filling. Synaptic and functional connections are detected between the pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons and the motor circuit that controls swallow. This study elucidates the role of mechanosensation in swallow, and provides insights for a better understanding of the neural basis of food swallow.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pharyngeal sensory organs serve as the final checkpoint before food ingestion, monitoring the chemical and physical properties of food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Real-time sensory feedback generated during swallow peristalsis is vital to the process of expelling food bolus from the mouth to esophagus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>.The pharyngeal sensation can also impact the internal state and appetite of animals, while feeding status can in turn affect swallowing behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. In humans, tactile and pressure receptors on the tongue and palate receive sensory inputs from distributed areas (e.g., bolus texture, shape, and size) and relay information to the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Chewing and ingesting tough or viscous foods can cause increased “oro-exposure time” and reduced food intake as a result<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The pharynx contains a plethora of gustatory and mechanosensory neurons, and their functions are being gradually elucidated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, particularly regarding the significance of pharyngeal mechanosensation in the process of food ingestion. Physical properties of the food offer important information regarding its texture and influence animals’ inclination to eat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>. Although it has been exclusively studied how the food texture is sensed by peripheral sensory organs in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, how the internal sensory neurons monitor the quality of food to regulate ingestion remains elusive.</p>
<p>Feeding behaviors such as chewing and sucking require rhythmic and coordinated contraction of muscle groups, and are thought to be controlled by central pattern generators (CPGs). CPGs have been proposed to control many complex motor behaviors in different systems. They are defined as a neural assembly by their intrinsic oscillation and independence from sensory input<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. In mammals, the muscles that coordinate food swallow are controlled by the CPGs in the brain stem<sup>2,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. However, the identity of CPGs and their downstream circuits remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the swallow is driven by food pumping induced by the suction and compression of the cibarium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Pump frequency is independent of the concentration of sucrose or feeding state, but is largely regulated by food viscosity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Silence of certain groups of motor neurons could disrupt pumping and ingestion, while activation could elicit arrhythmic pumping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Rhythmic fluid ingestion has also been studied in other insects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, but the molecular and neural basis controlling ingestion is still uncovered.</p>
<p>Here we identify a group of multi-dendritic mechanosensory neurons in the fly’s cibarium (md-C neurons) which are essential for swallow control. Inhibition of these neurons leads to difficulty in cibarium emptying and lower ingestion efficiency, while activation of them causes higher pump frequency and sometimes difficulty in cibarium filling. md-C neurons interact with the motor neurons in the brain to control swallowing. Our work provides insights into the regulation mechanism of swallow.</p>

<title>Mechanotransduction channel genes are required for swallowing behavior</title>
<p>Flies exhibit a rhythmic swallow pattern when ingesting food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). The whole action is composed of two steps: food is sucked into the cibarium (filling) and then expelled into the foregut (emptying). The frequency is not influenced by the taste but the viscosity of the food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, suggesting that the mechanical force exerted by food bolus passing the cibarium is essential in maintaining the swallow rhythm. We thus tested the swallowing behavior of the mutant alleles of three mechanotransduction channel genes (<italic>nompC, piezo, Tmc</italic>), and found that these flies exhibited a lower pump frequency compared to control groups. Disruption of the mechanoreceptor function had a profound impact on the emptying phase of swallowing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-1D</xref>, video 1), with filling and emptying taking longer and the filling/emptying time ratio decreasing significantly (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A-C</xref>). About 1/3 of <italic>nompC</italic> mutants exhibited difficulty in cibarium emptying (emptying time &gt; 0.3s), indicating the essential role of mechanotransduction channel genes in swallowing behavior. However, the mutant animals did not show a significant impairment in feeding efficiency, likely due to an increased volume of each pump (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings suggest that mechanosensation mainly contributes to the emptying phase of swallowing.</p>

<p>We investigated the involvement of mechanoreceptors in regulating swallow frequency in response to food viscosity. We fed flies with a water solution containing varying concentrations of methylcellulose to increase viscosity and found that flies with mutated <italic>Tmc</italic> or <italic>piezo</italic> genes consistently exhibited incomplete emptying when fed with water solutions containing 1% MC or higher concentrations, while only about 20% <italic>nompC</italic> mutants and wild-type flies sporadically exhibited incomplete filling when fed with water solution of the same viscosity (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1E-H</xref>, video 4). These findings suggest that all three mechanoreceptors are necessary for sensing the swallowing process and providing feedback to the downstream motor circuit to regulate pump strength, while for foods with certain viscosity, <italic>Tmc</italic> or <italic>piezo</italic> mutants pump might be unable to support complete cibarium emptying due to weakened muscle motion. We propose that <italic>nompC</italic> plays a role in initiation, while <italic>Tmc</italic> and <italic>Piezo</italic> control the driving strength of swallowing.</p>
<p>Moreover, double mutation of <italic>Tmc</italic> and <italic>nompC</italic> led to a more severe emptying difficulty, with pump frequency and ingestion rate both decreasing significantly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and food tends to stay in the pharyngeal area for a longer time (Video 1). As a result, a higher pump volume was detected, although the overall intake efficiency was decreased due to the incomplete swallow process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the double mutant of <italic>Tmc</italic> and <italic>piezo</italic> showed a pump frequency of about 5Hz, similar to flies of the mutant of either gene (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on our findings that <italic>Tmc, nompC</italic> and <italic>piezo</italic> are important for swallowing, we reasoned that neurons co-expressing these genes may play an essential role in swallow control. So, we explored the expression pattern of each gene, or the intersection between each two of the three genes in the brain and in the cibarium, and identified a set of mutil-dendritic sensory neurons in the cibarium (<xref rid="figS2" ref-type="fig">Figure S2</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). In the brain, SEZ was commonly labelled by either driver, while <italic>Tmc-GAL4-nompC-QF</italic> intersection shows a clear projection pattern (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). And by expressing nuclear-localized RFP, RedStinger, we revealed that somata of these multi-dendritic neurons situated in the cibarium but not in the brain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). These multi-dendritic neurons in the cibarium may sense the swallowing process, and project to SEZ to interact with the neural circuits that control ingestion.</p>

<title>md-C neurons are essential for swallow control</title>
<p>To explore the role of these pharyngeal multi-dendritic neurons, we expressed TNT (tetanus toxin)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup> in <italic>Tmc</italic> positive neurons to block the synaptic transmission, and found that flies’ swallowing became arrhythmic and the pump frequency decreased significantly, with about 48.1% (n=27) flies displayed difficulty in cibarium emptying (Video 2; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A, 2D</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Tmc</italic> was also reported to participate in food texture sensation and proprioceptive control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, to restrict the manipulation to a more specific cell population, we used the FLP-out system to express Kir2.1 in neurons expressing both TMC and NOMPC. The intersection exclusively labels two pairs of neurons around the cibarium (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) and they were named as md-C (cibarium multi-dendritic) neurons for brevity. We found that flies with md-C neurons inhibited displayed severe dysphagia, during which flies could hardly ingest water from the cibarium into the foregut. In some cases, water in the cibarium seemed to be pumped along the esophagus. However, no water was visible in the flies’ crop, indicating that water in the cibarium was not successfully emptied (Video 2). As a result, flies’ intake volume decreased dramatically (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that md-C neurons are necessary for rhythmic pump and food ingestion.</p>
<p>We performed a double RNAi experiment for <italic>nompC</italic> and <italic>Piezo</italic> using <italic>Tmc-GAL4</italic> as a driver as the double mutant of these genes is lethal. Knocking down the expression level of <italic>nompC</italic> and <italic>Piezo</italic> resulted in a significantly lower pump frequency, similar to the frequency observed in flies with knockdown of either <italic>nompC</italic> or <italic>Piezo</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). These results suggest that the channels may function complementarily.</p>
<p>While inhibiting md-C neurons caused difficulty in cibarium emptying, activating them optogenetically resulted in difficulty in cibarium filling. We activated md-C neurons with CsChrimson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> or ReaChR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. In some cases, no dye could be seen in the cibarium although flies strongly extended their proboscis against water (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, video 3). This phenomenon could last for seconds but after several trials, flies can usually recover. In other cases, flies with md-C neurons activated show incomplete filling, indicated by decreased cibarium expansion, which was usually not observed in control groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, when flies consistently pump at a normal range (observed dye boundary in the cibarium is wider than 90% width of mouthpart), their pump frequency increased significantly (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). Flies with md-C neurons activated showed a reduced volume per pump (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with the small range of pump caused by incomplete filling. We thus speculated that the activation of md-C neurons could accelerate the emptying process but inhibit the filling process, which is opposite to their inhibition. md-L neurons in the labellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> could also be labelled by the intersection of <italic>Tmc-GAL4</italic> and <italic>nompC-QF</italic>. To test whether the activation of md-C neurons alone was sufficient for the inhibition of cibarium filling, we cut the flies’ labellum to ablate md-L neurons. We found that light-stimulation of md-C neurons still triggered filling difficulty despite the absence of md-L neurons, while these flies could pump at a normal range in the dark (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B-C</xref>, video 5). We thus reasoned that md-C neurons in the cibarium but not md-L neurons were responsible for mechanical sensation during swallowing. We stained the muscles in the cibarium with phalloidin and labeled md-C neurons with GFP and found that both md-C neurons and muscles were in close proximity around cibarium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons could be activated by muscle stretch during the expansion of cibarium.</p>

<p>Next, we wondered whether md-C neurons were activated by the action of swallowing. By expressing GCaMP6s in md-C neurons and cutting a small window in the head capsule, we could detect the fluorescent change of the md-C neurons’ projections in the brain when flies were swallowing sugar food. An increase of fluorescence in the SEZ was observed when flies were ingesting food (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J-K</xref>). As food ingestion delivered both gustatory and mechanosensory information, we asked whether md-C neurons were sensitive to taste input. The whole fly head was put into saline and a small window was cut. When sucrose was added to the saline, no signal changes were detected (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4K</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons responded to mechanical force but not gustatory cues during food ingestion.</p>

<title>md-C neurons form synapses with motor neurons</title>
<p>So far, we have shown that md-C neurons regulate swallowing probably by sensing the expansion of the cibarium. But how do they coordinate with the downstream neural circuits to control the swallow? Two groups of motor neurons, MN11 and MN12, have been reported to control the muscles that execute the swallow process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. We thus asked whether md-C neurons relay information of the cibarium volume to the motor neurons to control the swallow. We first tested their potential synaptic connection with GRASP (GFP reconstitution across synaptic partners)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, expressing one part of GFP in md-C neurons and the other part in MN12 or MN11. Signals could be detected in the SEZ where the neural projections of the two group neurons overlapped (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons may directly synapse onto the motor control circuit in the SEZ. By expressing P2X<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>, an ATP receptor in <italic>Tmc</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons, we also found that calcium transients could be observed in MN12 and MN11 when activating md-C neurons, while the control group show no significant differences (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-I</xref>). Considering synaptic connections between md-C and motor neurons, we suppose activation of md-C triggered by food bolus, could directly stimulate motor neurons to accelerate swallowing. These results suggest that motor neurons associated with swallowing are activated by sensory input in the cibarium to coordinate food ingestion during swallowing.</p>

<sec id="s3">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we find that a group of mechanosensory neurons in the pharynx respond to the mechanical force generated by the expansion of the cibarium during food ingestion. These neurons form synaptic and functional connections with motor neurons in the brain, and may constitute an essential part of the neural circuit that controls the swallow.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Multiple channels function in the same neurons</title>
<p>The mutants of either <italic>nompC, Tmc</italic>, or <italic>piezo</italic> showed defects in the swallow rhythm. However, we found that <italic>nompC</italic> seemed to play a more critical role as its mutation caused difficulty in emptying, while double mutation of <italic>Tmc</italic> and <italic>piezo</italic> did not. We speculated that <italic>nompC</italic> might be involved in swallowing liquid foods, as we used water in most experiments. While the md-C neurons also expressed both TMC and Piezo, we think these three channels could play different roles depending on physical properties of foods. The information generated by these three channels might be integrated in md-C neurons and helps the flies to distinguish the quality of food and regulate swallow.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3b">
<title>Interaction between md-C neurons and the feeding control circuit</title>
<p>It was demonstrated that motor neuron 12 controlled muscle 12 to fill cibarium with food, while motor neuron 11 controlled muscle 11 to expel the foods into the foregut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. In accordance with this model, we have found that the activation of md-C neurons could activate MN11, and over-stimulation of md-C neurons could cause difficulty in filling, incomplete filling and/or higher pump frequency. On the other hand, silencing md-C neurons blocks the emptying process because expanding of cibarium fails to activate MN11 which controls emptying, leading to difficulty in swallow. Additionally, when pharyngeal mechanosensation was impaired by the mutation of the mechanotransduction channel genes, MNs may not receive enough activation to drive muscle 11 contraction to completely empty the foods in cibarium, resulting in a slower pump rhythm, especially when foods are of high viscosity.</p>
<p>However, the circuits that control the swallow could be more complex than the circuit proposed above. It has been reported that the ingestion of foods is completed in a sequential activity of MNs where most parts of the proboscis are engaged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Besides the bottom-up interaction between md-C neurons and MN12/11 demonstrated in this study, a top-down feedback mechanism may also exist. For example, we have found that knocking down GABA<sub>A</sub>-R in md-C neurons leads to a lower pump frequency (<xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref>), suggesting that md-C neurons receive inhibitory signals during swallowing. Although it is unclear which neurons inhibit md-C neurons, we believe this is likely through a presynaptic mechanism on the axon termini of md-C neurons. Besides, activating md-C induced calcium transients in MN12 and MN11(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D-I</xref>), indicating that motor neurons were stimulated by activation of md-C neurons. It is believed that sequential contraction of muscles would cause fluid bolus move through the proboscis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, we thus hypothesize that md-C neurons might sequentially stimulate motor neurons during swallowing. Also, it is possible that sequential activation generated by MNs and md-C might crosstalk with CPGs, which together form a steady pump frequency, depending on the mechanical quality of foods (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>Central pattern generators (CPGs) in the control of swallow rhythm</title>
<p>It’s widely accepted that most rhythmic behaviors of animals are controlled by the CPGs in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. For example, brain stem CPGs control the patterns of suck, lick, mastication, swallow, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. Two lines of evidence supports the notion that mechanical feedback from the cibarium during ingestion regulates the activity of CPGs or their downstream circuits that execute the pattern generated by CPGs. 1, High viscosity of food caused a reduction of pumping frequency while the rhythm remained essentially regular, indicating that the pattern was modulated rather than blocked. 2, Manipulation of md-C neurons could interfere with the highly rhythmic pumping. Although the CPGs that control swallow in <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain are still elusive, our data provides an entry point to elucidate the CPGs circuits and the neural circuits associated with them. As their activity can be modulated by md-C neurons, they can be potentially identified by searching for the downstream of md-C neurons.</p>

<title>Feeding assay</title>
<p>All flies were kept in a 24-26°C incubator under 12-12 hr light: dark cycle and about 40-60% humidity. Mated female flies were collected at eclosion and aged for 3-10 days. For neuronal silencing experiments, flies bearing Kir2.1 or TNT were kept for 7-10 days before the feeding assay. For rdl knockdown experiment in md-C neurons, 14-16 days-old flies were used. One day prior to the behavioral assays, flies were transferred to empty vials for 24 hours for water deprivation (12h for flies with <italic>nompC</italic> and <italic>Tmc</italic> mutated or flies with Kir2.1 expressed in md-C neurons).</p>
<p>Before experiments, flies were anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and mounted onto a glass slide with nail polish. They were then allowed to recover in a humid chamber for 2 hours. All behavioral experiments were carried out at room temperature and 40%–60% humidity. Individual flies were fed with a pipette filled with water, sugar or methylcellulose water solutions. Consumption of single flies was calculated by measurable glass capillary. Ingestion rate was calculated by consumption divided by ingestion time, feeding lasted for 4-7 seconds except the experiment where Kir2.1 was used lasted for one minute. For illustration, 0.25 ng/Ml brilliant blue food dye (Shi-tou, GB 7655.1) was added to the solution. 60 fps camera was adopted to record the feeding behavior and flies with total feeding duration of more than 2 seconds were analyzed.</p>
<p>For optogenetics experiments, female flies expressing CsChrimson or ReaChR were raised on food containing 10 Mm all-trans retinal at 25°C and 40-60% humidity in a light-proof vial. Experiments were performed with 7 to 10-day-old mated female flies in a dark room. One day before the test, flies were transferred into empty light-proof vials for water deprivation. Before and during feeding, flies were stimulated by 1.3 Mw/cm<sup>2</sup> 590 nm light.</p>

<title>Immunostaining and microscopy</title>
<p>The brains and cibaria of 3-10-day-old female flies were dissected in PBST dissection buffer containing 0.015% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS, followed by fixation in 4% PFA solution for 30 minutes on a shaker at room temperature. Samples were then washed four times for 20 minutes each with wash buffer (0.3% Triton in 1x PBS). The tissues were transferred to block buffer (1x heat-inactivated normal goat serum with 0.3% Triton in 1x PBS), and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Primary antibodies were added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies used included Rabbit-RFP (Rockland 39707, diluted 1:500), Rabbit-GFP (Invitrogen A11122, diluted 1:500), Mouse-nc82 (Hybridoma Band DSHB, Brunchpilot, diluted 1:500), and Mouse-GFP (Sigma-Aldrich G6539, diluted 1:200). Samples were washed four times for 20 minutes each, and then incubated with secondary antibodies on the following day. The secondary antibodies were used at a 1:200 dilution and were all from Invitrogen: Alexa Fluor 555 anti-Rabbit (A-21428), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-Mouse (A11001), and Alexa Fluor 647 anti-Mouse (A-21235). After incubation for 5 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C, tissues were washed four times for 20 minutes each. The brains and cibaria were attached to a slide for imaging. Confocal imaging was performed using an Olympus FV1000 microscope with a 20X air lens.</p>

<title>Functional imaging</title>
<p>Calcium imaging was carried out with an Olympus BX51WI microscope with 40X water immersion objective, Andor Zyla camera and Uniblitz shutter. To perform calcium imaging in md-C neurons during swallowing, flies were food-deprived for 12 hours and heads were fixed in the place using nail polish, the antennae and the cuticle above the SEZ were carefully removed and the exposed brain was bathed in AHL buffer. For <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, brains were dissected in a recording chamber containing saline (NaCl 140 Mm, KCl 2 Mm, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 4.5 Mm, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.5 Mm, HEPES-NaOH 5 Mm, PH 7.1). 1.5 Mm CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to the saline before use. ROIs and fluorescence changes were selected with ImageJ as peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> = (F<sub>peak</sub> – F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> was the average fluorescence of 10 images when expressing GCaMP6s in md-C before manipulation. While for GCaMP6s expressed in MNs, F<sub>0</sub> was the average fluorescence of 30 images in MNs before adding 20Ml water or 20Ml water solution of 250Mm ATP to dishes containing 2Ml AHL buffer.</p>

<p>This <bold>useful</bold> study investigates the role of mechanotransduction channels in controlling food ingestion in Drosophila and localizes the role of some of these genes to sensory neurons in the fly pharynx. The evidence supporting several of the authors claims is <bold>incomplete</bold> and would benefit from additional investigation. With additional evidence, this paper would be of interest to biologists interested in mechanosensation and feeding behavior.</p>

<p>Qin et al. set out to investigate the role of mechanosensory feedback during swallowing and identify neural circuits that generate ingestion rhythms. They use Drosophila melanogaster swallowing as a model system, focusing their study on the neural mechanisms that control cibarium filling and emptying in vivo. They find that pump frequency is decreased in mutants of three mechanotransduction genes (nompC, piezo, and Tmc), and conclude that mechanosensation mainly contributes to the emptying phase of swallowing. Furthermore, they find that double mutants of nompC and Tmc have more pronounced cibarium pumping defects than either single mutants or Tmc/piezo double mutants. They discover that the expression patterns of nompC and Tmc overlap in two classes of neurons, md-C and md-L neurons. The dendrites of md-C neurons warp the cibarium and project their axons to the subesophageal zone of the brain. Silencing neurons that express both nompC and Tmc leads to severe ingestion defects, with decreased cibarium emptying. Optogenetic activation of the same population of neurons inhibited filling of the cibarium and accelerated cibarium emptying. In the brain, the axons of nompC∩Tmc cell types respond during ingestion of sugar but do not respond when the entire fly head is passively exposed to sucrose. Finally, the authors show that nompC∩Tmc cell types arborize close to the dendrites of motor neurons that are required for swallowing, and that swallowing motor neurons respond to the activation of the entire Tmc-GAL4 pattern.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
-The authors rigorously quantify ingestion behavior to convincingly demonstrate the importance of mechanosensory genes in the control of swallowing rhythms and cibarium filling and emptying</p>

-The authors demonstrate that a small population of neurons that express both nompC and Tmc oppositely regulate cibarium emptying and filling when inhibited or activated, respectively</p>
<p>
-They provide evidence that the action of multiple mechanotransduction genes may converge in common cell types</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
-A major weakness of the paper is that the authors use reagents that are expressed in both md-C and md-L but describe the results as though only md-C is manipulated</p>
<p>
-Severing the labellum will not prevent optogenetic activation of md-L from triggering neural responses downstream of md-L. Optogenetic activation is strong enough to trigger action potentials in the remaining axons. Therefore, Qin et al. do not present convincing evidence that the defects they see in pumping can be specifically attributed to md-C.</p>
<p>
-GRASP is known to be non-specific and prone to false positives when neurons are in close proximity but not synaptically connected. A positive GRASP signal supports but does not confirm direct synaptic connectivity between md-C/md-L axons and MN11/MN12.</p>
<p>
-As seen in Figure Supplement 2, the expression pattern of Tmc-GAL4 is broader than md-C alone. Therefore, the functional connectivity the authors observe between Tmc expressing neurons and MN11 and 12 cannot be traced to md-C alone</p>
<p>Overall, this work convincingly shows that swallowing and swallowing rhythms are dependent on several mechanosensory genes. Qin et al. also characterize a candidate neuron, md-C, that is likely to provide mechanosensory feedback to pumping motor neurons, but the results they present here are not sufficient to assign this function to md-C alone. This work will have a positive impact on the field by demonstrating the importance of mechanosensory feedback to swallowing rhythms and providing a potential entry point for future investigation of the identity and mechanisms of swallowing central pattern generators.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, the authors describe the role of cibarial mechanosensory neurons in fly ingestion. They demonstrate that pumping of the cibarium is subtly disrupted in mutants for piezo, TMC, and nomp-C. Evidence is presented that these three genes are co-expressed in a set of cibarial mechanosensory neurons named md-C. Silencing of md-C neurons results in disrupted cibarial emptying, while activation promotes faster pumping and/or difficulty filling. GRASP and chemogenetic activation of the md-C neurons is used to argue that they may be directly connected to motor neurons that control cibarial emptying.</p>
<p>The manuscript makes several convincing and useful contributions. First, identifying the md-C neurons and demonstrating their essential role for cibarium emptying provides reagents for further studying this circuit and also demonstrates the important of mechanosensation in driving pumping rhythms in the pharynx. Second, the suggestion that these mechanosensory neurons are directly connected to motor neurons controlling pumping stands in contrast to other sensory circuits identified in fly feeding and is an interesting idea that can be more rigorously tested in the future.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are several shortcomings that limit the scope of the paper and the confidence in some claims. These include:</p>
<p>a) the MN-LexA lines used for GRASP experiments are not characterized in any other way to demonstrate specificity. These were generated for this study using Phack methods, and their expression should be shown to be specific for MN11 and MN12 in order to interpret the GRASP experiments.</p>
<p>b) There is also insufficient detail for the P2X2 experiment to evaluate its results. Is this an in vivo or ex vivo prep? Is ATP added to the brain, or ingested? If it is ingested, how is ATP coming into contact with md-C neuron if it is not a chemosensory neuron and therefore not exposed to the contents of the cibarium?</p>
<p>c) In Figure 3C, the authors claim that ablating the labellum will remove the optogenetic stimulation of the md-L neuron (mechanosensory neuron of the labellum), but this manipulation would presumably leave an intact md-L axon that would still be capable of being optogenetically activated by Chrimson.</p>
<p>d) Average GCaMP traces are not shown for md-C during ingestion, and therefore it is impossible to gauge the dynamics of md-C neuron activation during swallowing. Seeing activation with a similar frequency to pumping would support the suggested role for these neurons, although GCaMP6s may be too slow for these purposes.</p>
<p>e) The negative result in Figure 4K that is meant to rule out taste stimulation of md-C is not useful without a positive control for pharyngeal taste neuron activation in this same preparation.</p>
<p>In addition to the experimental limitations described above, the manuscript could be organized in a way that is easier to read (for example, not jumping back and forth in figure order).</p>

<p>Swallowing is an essential daily activity for survival, and pharyngo-laryngeal sensory function is critical for safe swallowing. In Drosophila, it has been reported that the mechanical property of food (e.g. Viscosity) can modulate swallowing. However, how mechanical expansion of the pharynx or fluid content sense and control swallowing was elusive. Qin et al. showed that a group of pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons, as well as mechanosensory channels (nompC, Tmc, and Piezo), respond to these mechanical forces for regulation of swallowing in Drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
There are many reports on the effect of chemical properties of foods on feeding in fruit flies, but only limited studies reported how physical properties of food affect feeding especially pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons. First, they found that mechanosensory mutants, including nompC, Tmc, and Piezo, showed impaired swallowing, mainly the emptying process. Next, they identified cibarium multidendritic mechanosensory neurons (md-C) are responsible for controlling swallowing by regulating motor neuron (MN) 12 and 11, which control filling and emptying, respectively.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the involvement of md-C and mechanosensory channels in controlling swallowing is convincing, it is not yet clear which stimuli activate md-C. Can it be an expansion of cibarium or food viscosity, or both? In addition, if rhythmic and coordinated contraction of muscles 11 and 12 is essential for swallowing, how can simultaneous activation of MN 11 and 12 by md-C achieve this? Finally, previous reports showed that food viscosity mainly affects the filling rather than the emptying process, which seems different from their finding.</p>

<p>A combination of optogenetic behavioral experiments and functional imaging are employed to identify the role of mechanosensory neurons in food swallowing in adult Drosophila. While some of the findings are intriguing and the overall goal of mapping a sensory to motor circuit for this rhythmic movement are admirable, the data presented could be improved.</p>
<p>The circuit proposed (and supported by GRASP contact data) shows these multi-dendritic neurons connecting to pharyngeal motor neurons. This is pretty direct - there is no evidence that they affect the hypothetical central pattern generator - just the execution of its rhythm. The optogenetic activation and inhibition experiments are constitutive, not patterned light, and they seem to disrupt the timing of pumping, not impose a new one. A slight slowing of the rhythm is not consistent with the proposed function.</p>
<p>The mechanosensory channel mutants nompC, piezo, and TMC have a range of defects. The role of these channels in swallowing may not be sufficiently specific to support the interpretation presented. Their other defects are not described here and their overall locomotor function is not measured. If the flies have trouble consuming sufficient food throughout their development, how healthy are they at the time of assay? The level of starvation or water deprivation can affect different properties of feeding - meal size and frequency. There is no description of how starvation state was standardized or measured in these experiments.</p>
<p>The brain is likely to move considerably during swallow, so the GCaMP signal change may be a motion artifact. Sometimes this can be calculated by comparing GCaMP signal to that of a co-expressed fluorescent protein, but there is no mention that this is done here. Therefore, the GAaMP data cannot be interpreted.</p>
