<title>Abstract</title><p>Evolution of gene expression frequently drives antibiotic resistance in bacteria. We had previously (Patel and Matange, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2021) shown that in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, mutations at the <italic>mgrB</italic> locus were beneficial in trimethoprim and led to overexpression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), encoded by the <italic>folA</italic> gene. Here, we show that DHFR levels are further enhanced by spontaneous duplication of a genomic segment encompassing <italic>folA</italic> and spanning hundreds of kilobases. This duplication was rare in wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, its frequency was elevated in a <italic>lon</italic>-knockout strain, altering the mutational landscape early during trimethoprim adaptation. We then exploit this system to investigate the relationship between trimethoprim pressure and <italic>folA</italic> copy number. During long-term evolution, <italic>folA</italic> duplications were frequently reversed. Reversal was slower under antibiotic pressure, first requiring the acquisition of point mutations in DHFR or its promoter. Unexpectedly, despite resistance-conferring point mutations, some populations under high trimethoprim pressure maintained <italic>folA</italic> duplication to compensate for low abundance DHFR mutants. We find that evolution of gene dosage depends on expression demand, which is generated by antibiotic and exacerbated by proteolysis of drug-resistant mutants of DHFR. We propose a novel role for proteostasis as a determinant of copy number evolution in antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The dosage of a gene, i.e., copy number relative to the genome, directly impacts its level of expression and can alter organismal phenotype and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Mutations that increase copy numbers, termed as gene duplications and amplifications (GDAs), are implicated in diverse biological phenomena including cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>], speciation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>], reproductive isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>] and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. GDAs are important for rapid adaptation since their frequencies of occurrence are higher by several orders of magnitude (∼1000-fold) than point mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]. Following the initial GDA mutation, however, amplified genes could be lost over time, pseudogenized, sub-functionalized or neo-functionalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>]. Which of these possibilities is realized depends on the nature and strength of selection imposed by the environment, as well as the fitness cost associated with maintaining multiple gene copies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>].</p>
<p>In bacteria, GDA mutations are frequently encountered during adaptation to antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>] or heavy metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]. They occur by RecA-dependent nonequal recombination as well as RecA-independent processes and often involve repeat sequences such as in IS-elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. Amplified genes in drug-resistant bacteria code for effectors of resistance such as drug inactivating enzymes, drug target modifiers or “by-pass” mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>], but may also compensate for resistance-associated fitness costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. More recently, the view that GDAs are less “hard-wired” than point mutations has emerged. For instance, transient alterations in gene dosage are a common mechanism of heteroresistance, i.e. resistant sub-populations within a drug-sensitive bacterial isolate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]. There is also evidence to suggest that copy number variations are more common in bacteria than appreciated. It is estimated that as many as 20% of cells in a bacterial population may harbour a duplication of some genomic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. These copy number polymorphisms create within-population heterogeneities in gene expression, serving as a bet-hedging strategy with adaptive value in fluctuating environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>].</p>
<p>Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a ubiquitous enzyme crucial for growth and division. It catalyzes the formation of tetrahydrofolate, an important cofactor in nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis. DHFR is coded by an essential gene in most organisms and its deletion or pharmacological inhibition results in cell death or growth stasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>]. Not surprisingly, anti-folates are effective therapeutic agents for diverse pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]. For instance, methotrexate, used in the treatment of cancers and autoimmune conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], pyrimethamine, used as an anti-malarial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>], and trimethoprim, used as an anti-bacterial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>], all of which are competitive inhibitors of DHFR. Interestingly, copy number amplification and consequent overexpression of DHFR confers resistance in all three systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. Thus, the gene dosage of DHFR appears to be tightly regulated across evolutionarily divergent organisms, making it a useful system to understand the principles underlying selection and evolutionary fate of GDA mutations.</p>
<p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DHFR is coded by the <italic>folA</italic> gene. Several mutation hot spots for trimethoprim resistance have been identified in this enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Additionally, mechanisms that transcriptionally up-regulate <italic>folA</italic> expression are also known in trimethoprim resistant <italic>E. coli</italic>. These include cis-regulatory mutations in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter and trans-acting loss of function mutations in <italic>mgrB</italic>, which upregulate <italic>folA</italic> transcription in a PhoQP-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. Earlier work from our group identified Lon, a conserved quality control protease in bacteria, as a post-translational regulator of trimethoprim resistance. Lon degraded mutant DHFRs and reduced their half-lives <italic>in vivo</italic>, directly affecting genotype-phenotype relationships of resistance-conferring mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>]. In this study, we first compare early mutational events in wild type and Lon-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> challenged with trimethoprim. We show that a large genomic duplication encompassing <italic>folA</italic> confers trimethoprim resistance in both genetic backgrounds, though its frequency of occurrence is elevated in <italic>lon-</italic>knockout <italic>E. coli</italic>. We then use this system to ask what factors determine the fate of duplicated <italic>folA</italic> gene copies during evolution at different trimethoprim pressures.</p>

<title>A large IS-flanked duplication encompassing <italic>folA</italic> mediates rapid adaptation to trimethoprim in <italic>E. coli</italic></title>
<p>We had previously evolved 5 replicate populations of wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 MG1655 in sub-MIC trimethoprim (300 ng/mL) for 25 generations. We then isolated and sequenced the genome of a dominant trimethoprim-resistant clone from each population (designated as WTMPR1-5). These sequencing results have been reported earlier, in Patel and Matange (2021) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Briefly, all isolates harboured loss-of-function mutations in the <italic>mgrB</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A) that resulted in PhoQP-dependent up-regulation of DHFR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Additionally, isolates WTMPR1, 3 and 5 had mutations at the active site of DHFR, while WTMPR4 harboured a large genomic duplication of ∼0.6 Mb encompassing the <italic>folA</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A, B). We performed similar evolution experiments starting with an isogenic <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> strain to ask if early adaptation to trimethoprim was altered by Lon-deficiency. Among trimethoprim-resistant isolates derived from <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic>, designated as LTMPR1-5, four harboured mutations at the <italic>mgrB</italic> locus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A). However, none of them had mutations in DHFR or its promoter. Instead, LTMPR2-4 had evolved GDA mutations similar to WTMPR4, while LTMPR1 had a duplication in an overlapping but shorter genomic stretch (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A, B). In all trimethoprim-resistant isolates, duplicated genomic regions were flanked by IS-elements (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> B). Isolates with and without genomic duplications showed comparable trimethoprim IC50 values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A), indicating that GDA mutations were an alternate genetic path to evolving resistance and occurred more frequently in Lon-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Seeking to explain the higher frequency of GDA mutations in the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout, we asked whether IS-transposases were sensitive to proteolysis by Lon. Indeed, heterologously expressed InsB and InsL had greater stability in the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout (Figure S1), suggesting that their accumulation may contribute to higher GDA frequency in <italic>E. coli</italic> Δ<italic>lon</italic>. If true it would follow that a higher proportion of GDA mutants would be isolated from <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> during adaptation to other environments as well. In agreement with this prediction, GDA mutations were detected after evolution of <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> in 2 of the 5 additional growth conditions tested, namely antibiotic-free and spectinomycin-supplemented media (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> C, S2). In all cases duplications were flanked by IS elements (Figure S2). Further, the regions of the genome that were duplicated were similar among isolates derived from the same environment, but different across environments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A, S2). On the other hand, wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> did not show GDA mutations in any of the other tested conditions.</p>
<p>The duplicated genomic region in trimethoprim-resistant isolates included genes previously associated with resistance to trimethoprim, namely, <italic>folA</italic> which codes for DHFR, and <italic>acrA</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, which code for components of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> B). In one of the isolates, i.e. LTMPR1, the amplified stretch encompassed <italic>folA</italic> but not <italic>acrAB</italic> without affecting trimethoprim IC50 values (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> A, B). We therefore reasoned that duplication of <italic>folA</italic> was the main effector of adaptation to trimethoprim. Immunoblotting showed that DHFR protein was indeed overproduced in isolates LTMPR1 and WTMPR4 over and above the increase mediated by inactivation of <italic>mgrB</italic> alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> A).</p>

</fig>
<p>Though DHFR overproduction may contribute to the selection of genomic amplifications in trimethoprim-resistant bacteria, ∼173 (LTMPR1) and ∼531 (WTMPR4) other genes were also duplicated in these isolates. To understand the global transcriptional burden imposed by this amplification, we analysed the gene expression profiles of WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 using RNA-sequencing (Supplementary File 1). Since both isolates had loss-of-function mutations in <italic>mgrB</italic>, which cause large changes in global gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>], we also analysed the transcriptomes of <italic>E. coli ΔmgrB</italic> and <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic> strains for comparison (Supplementary File 1). The level of <italic>folA</italic> mRNA was higher in LTMPR1 (2.3-fold) and WTMPR4 (5.7-fold) over respective controls (Supplementary File 1), in agreement with immunoblotting data. Other duplicated genes were mildly overexpressed by ∼1.7-fold on an average in LTMPR1 (over <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic>) and ∼1.3-fold in WTMPR4 (over <italic>E. coli ΔmgrB</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> B, Supplementary File 1). However, there was large variation in expression level among duplicated genes in these isolates (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> B), indicating that increase in gene dosage did not necessarily result in enhanced expression levels. Instead, global gene expression profiles of WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 were correlated with <italic>E. coli ΔmgrB</italic> and <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic> respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> C, D) and most of the top 50 up/down-regulated genes in WTMPR4 and LTMPR1 could be attributed to loss of <italic>mgrB</italic> alone (Figure S3). In line with this result, strains with and without genomic amplifications had comparable fitness costs (∼20 %) in drug-free media, which could also be attributed to inactivation of <italic>mgrB</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> E). Thus, we concluded that large GDA mutations encompassing <italic>folA</italic> led to DHFR overexpression and represented an alternate mechanism for trimethoprim-resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> with undetectable additional cost.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Maintenance of <italic>folA</italic> duplication is linked to antibiotic-generated demand for DHFR expression</title>
<p>We next investigated the evolutionary fate of duplicate <italic>folA</italic> gene copies by evolving the LTMPR1 isolate, which harboured the shortest duplication, in the absence of antibiotic. We also evolved this isolate at sustained drug pressure, i.e. trimethoprim at the same concentration at which it had originally emerged (300 ng/mL). Using three replicate populations in each condition, we asked how DHFR expression and trimethoprim IC50 values changed over ∼252 generations of evolution and used genome sequencing to identify the underlying mutational basis. As controls, we performed similar evolution experiments with WTMPR4 (which harboured a GDA and a functional Lon protease) and WTMPR5 (which harboured a <italic>folA</italic> point mutation and a functional Lon protease).</p>
<sec id="s2b1">
<title>Evolution in trimethoprim-free media</title>
<p>In drug-free conditions, trimethoprim IC50 of LTMPR1 rapidly declined and a concomitant loss of colony formation on trimethoprim-supplemented plates occurred (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> A, B). Evolved WTMPR4, but not WTMPR5, showed similar loss of colony formation on trimethoprim indicating that resistance mediated by GDA mutations was far less stable than point mutations regardless of the presence of Lon (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> B). For LTMPR1, these trends were explained by a decline in DHFR expression levels over evolution and reversion to a single <italic>folA</italic> copy (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> C, D, S4). Mutation in <italic>mgrB</italic> was, however, consistently maintained till the end of the experiment (Supplementary File 2). In line with these data, trimethoprim IC50s of evolving populations stabilized at a value similar to <italic>E. coli ΔlonΔmgrB</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> A). Interestingly, a second GDA mutation (“GDA-2”, ∼2.2 Mb to 3.3 Mb) emerged in these populations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> D, S4). The GDA-2 mutation was apparently lost and regained multiple times during the experiment (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> D, S4), suggesting a dynamic maintenance in the population rather than fixation. Further, the region of the genome amplified in GDA-2 was similar to what we had observed when <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> was evolved in drug-free media (Figure S2, S4), indicating that GDA-2 was likely a fitness enhancing mutation and unrelated to trimethoprim adaptation.</p>

<p>To further investigate the emergence of GDA-2 during evolution of LTMPR1 in drug-free media we sequenced 6 randomly picked colonies from each of the lineages at the final time point (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> E). All the sequenced isolates had a single copy of <italic>folA</italic> and a majority of isolates showed the presence of GDA-2, corroborating population sequencing results (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> E, Supplementary File 2). Interestingly, some of the isolates that did not harbour GDA-2 had evolved mutations in the <italic>rpoS</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> E, Supplementary File 2). Loss-of-function mutations in RpoS are fixed at late time points during adaptation to trimethoprim and enhance the fitness of <italic>E. coli</italic> without conferring resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. We also sequenced a few randomly picked isolates from WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 evolved lines (2 from each of the 3 replicate lineages in each case) to check for the presence of GDA-2 and <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations. As expected, all WTMPR4 isolates had reverted to a single copy of <italic>folA</italic>, while WTMPR5 isolates retained their ancestrally inherited <italic>folA</italic> mutation. None of them had evolved the GDA-2 mutation, while a few of the isolates from WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 lines had acquired <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> F, G).</p>
<p>Consistent with earlier studies, and the role of mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> in general fitness enhancement in <italic>E. coli</italic>, we found that an LTMPR1-derived isolate with mutant <italic>rpoS</italic> recovered fitness in drug-free media (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> A). Interestingly, an isolate with the GDA-2 mutation had also recovered fitness (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> A). Coupled with the fact that the GDA-2 mutation occurred only in a <italic>lon</italic>-deficient background, and GDA-2 and <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations were mutually exclusive we wondered whether the fitness enhancing effects of GDA-2 were also mediated by reduced RpoS activity. Lon is known to reduce the levels of RpoS during the exponential growth phase of <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>]. Therefore, in a <italic>lon</italic>-knockout we reasoned that at least some targets of RpoS would be overexpressed. To test this prediction, we analysed the transcriptome of <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> and specifically looked at the expression levels of 168 known targets of RpoS (Supplementary File 3). Of these, 41 genes were overexpressed in the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout by at least 1.5-fold over wild type, including genes induced in the stationary phase and by various stresses such as <italic>poxB</italic>, <italic>aidB</italic> and <italic>cbpA</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> B, C). Levels of <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA were however unaffected in this strain. Next, we compared the expression levels of these 41 RpoS-targets in LTMPR1 and <italic>E. coli Δlon ΔmgrB</italic> with <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> as the reference and found that most had similar expression levels in these three strains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> C). Indeed a few of these genes showed higher expression levels in LTMPR1 and <italic>E. coli Δlon ΔmgrB</italic>, which was not unexpected since loss of <italic>mgrB</italic> is known stabilize RpoS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Finally, we checked their expression in isolates derived from LTMPR1 which harboured either GDA-2 or <italic>rpoS</italic> mutations. Indeed, in both isolates RpoS target genes were down-regulated indicating a re-setting of RpoS activity (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> C). Further, in the isolate harbouring GDA-2, <italic>rpoS</italic> mRNA levels were themselves lowered to 0.49x of <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> (Supplementary File 3). Finally, deletion of <italic>rpoS</italic> from <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> enhanced the fitness of the strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> D). Thus, evolution of LTMPR1 in antibiotic-free media was characterized by rapid reversal of GDA-mediated resistance and acquisition of mutations that enhanced fitness by reducing the levels of RpoS-transcribed genes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> D).</p>

<title>Evolution at constant trimethoprim pressure</title>
<p>In the presence of trimethoprim (300 ng/mL), antibiotic resistance level and DHFR expression remained high over the course of evolution of LTMPR1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> A, B, C). WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 too remained resistant, and in the case of WTMPR4 an increased colony forming efficiency was observed at a late time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> B). These data suggested that under drug pressure high <italic>folA</italic> copy number was likely to be maintained. Indeed, population sequencing of LTMPR1 lineages showed that the ancestral GDA mutation was maintained until 196 generations of evolution in all three replicates (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> D, S5).

<p>In agreement with population sequencing, none of the resistant isolates derived from LTMPR1 Line A at the final time point showed the ancestral GDA. Instead, they all harboured a C<sub>-35</sub>T mutation in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter that is known to up-regulate DHFR expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>] (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> E, Supplementary File 4). Among Line B isolates, many had retained the ancestral duplication, without acquiring any additional mutations in <italic>folA</italic>. One of the isolates from this Line that had reverted to a single <italic>folA</italic> copy had gained the A<sub>-64</sub>T <italic>folA</italic> promoter mutation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> E, Supplementary File 4). In Line C too we found that isolates that had lost the ancestral GDA had evolved a point mutation in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter (+TG<sub>-30</sub>) or a Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg mutation in DHFR (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> E, Supplementary File 4). We found similar results in sequenced isolates from WTMPR4 lineages, i.e. loss of GDA and gain of a point mutation either in <italic>folA</italic> or its promoter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> F). WTMPR5-derived isolates did not accumulate additional mutations in <italic>folA</italic> but did acquire mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> G), showing that at this drug pressure additional mutations in <italic>folA</italic> were not required. Interestingly, two isolates from LTMPR1 Lines B and C had evolved new GDA mutations encompassing <italic>folA</italic>. In one of the Line B isolates (Isolate 2) the ancestral GDA was replaced by 5x amplification of a shorter genomic region (∼12 kb) encompassing <italic>folA</italic> (Figure S6). Both ends of this newly amplified region were flanked by IS1A (Figure S6). On the other hand, one of the Line C isolates (Isolate 5) had an expanded duplication beyond what was originally found in LTMPR1 (Figure S6). Also, both copies of <italic>folA</italic> in this isolate coded for DHFR-Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> E, S6), suggesting that the original GDA was lost and an extended GDA mutation was gained after fixation of the mutant <italic>folA</italic> allele. Thus, even under drug pressure, in most bacteria GDA mutations were reversed. Notably, reversion to a single <italic>folA</italic> copy was slower than in drug-free media as it first required the fixation of point mutations at the <italic>folA</italic> locus. However, in a smaller sub-population, more than one <italic>folA</italic> gene copy was maintained. This maintenance was dynamic and likely involved repeated loss and gain of GDA mutations.</p>
<p>To further investigate the replacement of GDA by point mutants, we checked to see if under drug pressure point mutants could invade a population harbouring GDA mutations. We allowed LTMPR1-derived isolates with point mutations in <italic>folA</italic> (marked with Δ<italic>lacZ::Kan</italic>) to compete with a GDA-harbouring isolate from the same time point in evolution (to nullify the effects of other media adaptations) and asked how rapidly the former could invade a population of the latter. Since for this assay we used point mutant strains genetically marked with Δ<italic>lacZ::Kan</italic> we verified the neutrality of the Δ<italic>lacZ::Kan</italic> marker by checking if the marked isolate could invade its unmarked parent. Indeed, in the presence of trimethoprim (300 ng/mL) point mutants were enriched over the GDA mutant in co-culture by about 100-fold (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> A) recreating the results of our evolution experiment. A possible explanation for this finding may be higher resistance level conferred by <italic>folA</italic> point mutations than GDA. However, most isolates with <italic>folA</italic> point mutations or harbouring GDAs had similar IC50 values as the ancestral LTMPR1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> B). These isolates also had comparable doubling times in the presence of 300 ng/mL trimethoprim (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> B). Thus, though there were no large observable differences in growth rate or drug IC50 values between strains, point mutants could indeed invade and outcompete GDA mutations, reflecting either small differences in fitness between them or their relative stabilities in culture.</p>

<title>Maintenance of high <italic>folA</italic> gene copy number under drug pressure is driven by unstable mutants of DHFR</title>
<p>Though sustained drug pressure did extend the lifetime of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication, acquisition of trimethoprim-resistant point mutations facilitated reversion to a single gene copy. We therefore asked whether <italic>folA</italic> duplication could be maintained under conditions of increasing antibiotic pressure, i.e., trimethoprim concentrations starting at 1 μg/mL and ending at 10 μg/mL over 252 generations of evolution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> A). Under these conditions, trimethoprim IC50 values increased sharply over the course of evolution eventually reaching ∼40 to ∼160-fold higher than ancestral LTMPR1 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> A). Colony formation at high trimethoprim concentrations also increased at later generations of evolution (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> B), reflecting the high drug pressure.

<p>Curiously, we observed that the 3 replicate lineages of LTMPR1 showed different trends in DHFR expression. Line A maintained a high level of DHFR protein for the duration of the experiment. On the other hand, Lines B and C showed high DHFR expression until 196 generations, after which it sharply declined (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> C). Genome sequencing revealed that all 3 lines convergently evolved the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg mutation in DHFR early during evolution and had fixed this mutation by 196 generations. All 3 lines also retained <italic>folA</italic> duplication until this time point (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> D, S7). Subsequently, Line A evolved an additional C<sub>-35</sub>T <italic>folA</italic> promoter mutation and had partially lost the ancestral GDA (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> D, S7, Supplementary File 5). In Lines B and C, a second missense mutation in DHFR, i.e. Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp, appeared between 196 and 252 generations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> D, Supplementary File 5). Line B also showed an Ile<sub>94</sub>Leu mutation in DHFR at low frequency at generation 252 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> D, Supplementary File 5). Unexpectedly, despite acquiring these additional mutational hits and lower DHFR expression level, bacteria in LTMPR1 Lines B and C retained two copies of <italic>folA</italic> in contrast to Line A (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> D, S7, Supplementary File 5).</p>
<p>Individual resistant clones from each of the lineages provided greater insight into the genetic trajectories of evolution. In LTMPR1 Line A, 2 of the 6 sequenced isolates had lost gene duplication and acquired the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg coding and C<sub>-35</sub>T promoter mutations in <italic>folA</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> E, Supplementary File 5). Interestingly, the other 4 sequenced isolates from Line A retained the ancestral GDA and harboured the same combination of <italic>folA</italic> point mutations, but only in 1 of the 2 gene copies (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> E, Supplementary File 5). Ten of the twelve isolates from LTMPR1 Lines B and C, on the other hand, retained <italic>folA</italic> duplication. In all ten isolates, both copies of <italic>folA</italic> had acquired Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg and Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> E, Supplementary File 5). Unlike LTMPR1, all sequenced isolates of WTMPR4 at 252 generations of evolution had lost their GDA mutation and gained 2 <italic>folA</italic> mutations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> F). WTMPR5 too had gained an additional <italic>folA</italic> mutation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> G). Notably, none of the isolates from WTMPR4 and WTMPR5 lineages had the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg and Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp combination of mutations that occurred repeatedly in LTMPR1 lineages.</p>
<p>We next sought to understand why some LTMPR1 bacteria had retained high <italic>folA</italic> copy number despite acquiring multiple point mutations in the drug target. To address this question, we first asked what the advantage of <italic>folA</italic> duplication was in the two different mutational trajectories that were observed for LTMPR1. Isolates from Line A had similar IC50 values for trimethoprim regardless of whether they had one or two copies of <italic>folA</italic> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> A). On the contrary, isolates from Line B that harboured only one copy of mutant <italic>folA</italic> (coding for DHFR-Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp) displayed ∼3.5-fold lower IC50 than those that harboured two copies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> A). Immunoblotting showed that isolates from Line A had similar expression level of DHFR (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> B). However, DHFR protein level was significantly compromised by the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutation combination and double the number of <italic>folA</italic> gene copies restored this defect (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> B). Thus, higher gene dosage of DHFR was dispensable once a promoter up-regulatory mutation was fixed. On the other hand, bacteria with alleles of DHFR harbouring multiple missense mutations continued to benefit from overexpression due to <italic>folA</italic> duplication.</p>

<p>Mutations at position Trp<sub>30</sub> in DHFR are accompanied by lower <italic>in vivo</italic> proteolytic stability due to perturbation of the hydrophobic core of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. This, in turn, affects the expression level of DHFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. Interestingly, residue Tyr<sub>151</sub> lies in the same hydrophobic pocket as Trp<sub>30</sub> (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> C). To test the effect of combination of mutations at these sites on trimethoprim resistance and DHFR expression, we first heterologously expressed wild type DHFR, Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg or Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp single mutants and the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp double mutant in wild type <italic>E. coli</italic>. As expected, DHFR Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg expression increased the IC50 of trimethoprim. Surprisingly, neither DHFR Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp, nor the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp double mutant conferred resistance to the antibiotic. Indeed, both mutants conferred lower IC50 values than wild type DHFR. This effect was due to loss of hydrophobicity at the Tyr<sub>151</sub> position, as DHFR-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Leu and DHFR-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Phe conferred similar IC50 values as wild type DHFR (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> D). Since the Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg-Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutation combination had evolved in a <italic>lon</italic>-deficient background, we next expressed these mutants in <italic>E. coli Δlon.</italic> Here too, DHFR Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg conferred trimethoprim resistance, while the Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp mutant did not. Strikingly, the combination of Trp<sub>30</sub>Arg and Tyr<sub>151</sub>Asp conferred very high-level trimethoprim resistance (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> D) demonstrating synergistic epistasis that was contingent on the absence of Lon protease. The levels of expression of DHFR mutants in wild type and <italic>lon</italic>-deficient bacteria mirrored trimethoprim resistance levels indicating that clearance by Lon altered their genotype-phenotype relationship (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> E). Based on these data, we concluded that the action of proteostatic machinery generated additional demand for expression by clearing mutant-DHFR proteins. This additional demand drove the maintenance of <italic>folA</italic> duplications in bacteria evolving at very high drug pressures.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Ohno’s hypothesis, proposed in 1970, provided a conceptual framework to think about the evolution and eventual fate of duplicated genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>]. Several theoretical and experimental studies have built upon the original idea to delineate the evolutionary outcomes of gene duplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. More recently, experimental evolution of microbes has been used to test some of the suggestions made by Ohno and others. This approach has the inherent advantage of greater control over the selection pressure applied and available genetic tools to interrogate molecular mechanisms. In most studies of this kind, an artificial system was constructed which was then evolved under defined selection pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. Our study began with serendipitous isolation of spontaneous trimethoprim-resistant mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> that overproduced DHFR because of a <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication. We exploited this system to understand the relationship between selection pressure and gene duplication in the context of drug-resistance evolution. The selection pressure for higher gene expression, i.e. “expression demand”, can be understood as the amount of a gene product that is required to maintain fitness in a particular environment. Antibiotics directly increase expression demand by inhibiting the activity of their targets. Our study shows that increasing gene dosage is a rapid, but transient evolutionary response to ensure that expression demand is met. On the other hand, point mutations are relatively stable routes to mitigating expression demand. Over short time scales, changes in gene dosage can counter the effects of antibiotic. However, their inherent instability results in almost inevitable replacement with phenotypically equivalent point mutations. Thus, continued antibiotic exposure delayed but could not prevent reversion to low gene copy number in most of our experiments. Further, we discover a novel association between proteostasis and gene dosage evolution. In <italic>E. coli</italic> evolving at high trimethoprim pressure, bacterial protein quality control exacerbated expression demand by clearing mutant DHFR-s. As a result, drug-resistant mutants of DHFR with low proteolytic stability drove the maintenance of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Based on these findings we propose that a combination of factors, which include environmental and physiological, alter the relationship between gene copy number and fitness, and drive gene dosage evolution.</p>

<caption><title>Model of expression demand induced selection of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication, followed by replacement by phenotypically equivalent point mutants.</title>
<p>Expression demand for DHFR is generated by trimethoprim pressure, which results in the selection of <italic>folA</italic> gene duplications. Gene duplication is unstable and reverses to a single copy of wild type <italic>folA</italic> when drug-pressure is withdrawn. Under drug pressure, <italic>folA</italic> gene duplication is maintained until a point mutation that confers resistance arises in one of the copies of <italic>folA</italic> (promoter or coding region). Upon acquisition of a point mutation, reversal of gene duplication ensues unless additional expression demand is generated by the action of proteostatic machinery on unstable drug-resistant DHFR mutants.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>A key finding from our study was the two-fold influence that proteostatic machinery had on gene copy number. Firstly, Lon protease-deficiency promoted GDA mutations, possibly by allowing accumulation of IS-tranposases in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This observation resonates with earlier work by Nicoloff and co-workers who found that large IS-element flanked genomic duplications in tetracycline-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> were commonly preceded by spontaneous mutations that inactivated <italic>lon</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">63</xref>]. Further, the role of Lon protease in regulating IS-element mobility by a similar mechanism as proposed by us has been previously demonstrated for IS1 and IS903, strengthening our argument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">65</xref>]. We note however that other mechanisms by which Lon may modulate the frequency of IS-mediated GDAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> cannot be ruled out. For instance, Lon protease homologs from several organisms directly bind DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>], though the role of this binding in DNA transactions is unclear. Similarly, Lon is a regulator of the recombination protein, RecA, by its action on LexA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>] and in <italic>Salmonella</italic> RecA stimulated the rate of gene duplications mediated by IS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. The second impact of protein quality control on GDA was the action of proteases on trimethoprim-resistant mutants of DHFR, which promoted gene duplication by generating additional demand for expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>). Importantly, which of these two effects dominated was determined by a combination of environment, i.e. drug concentrations, and other mutations acquired at the <italic>folA</italic> locus during evolution. In particular, mutations in the <italic>folA</italic> promoter could alleviate expression demand and hence reduce selection for high gene copy number.</p>
<p>The interplay between GDA and point mutations during evolution agrees in many respects with a recent study by Tomanek and Guet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>]. They use an elegantly designed artificial system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref>] in which expression of the <italic>galK</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> was driven by a very low activity promoter. This strain was then allowed to evolve in different concentrations of galactose. Like the present study, they found that the activity of IS-elements biased evolutionary trajectories in favor of duplications. They also showed that co-occurrence of duplications and point mutations was selected only at high expression demand, in agreement with our findings. Finally, they argued that gene duplication events may constrain evolution by point mutations. Once again, our study corroborates these results at the short term in that the <italic>lon</italic>-knockout which showed a higher propensity for GDA mutations did not evolve point mutations in <italic>folA</italic> at early time points of evolution. However, given the relative low stability of large GDAs, these were inevitably lost over longer duration of evolution and replaced with point mutations. Thus, it is likely that the different mutational profiles of IS-biased populations may be relevant only at short durations of evolution. It is important to note that though we have focused on the effects of mutations at the <italic>folA</italic> locus, which are directly under trimethoprim pressure, many of the isolates from our evolution experiments also harboured additional mutations at other loci. For instance, mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> were seen throughout our evolution lines and at least in drug-free media were significant contributors to bacterial fitness. It is not yet clear what the role of other mutations are likely to be under antibiotic selection, though it may be envisaged that these additional mutations play the role of media adaptations. We did not take their effects into in this study account since we expected them to be minor contributors to fitness especially during evolution under trimethoprim selection. However, their role in modulating the stability and selection of GDA mutations in drug-free/low drug environments may be more significant and remains to be investigated in the future.</p>
<p>In summary, the present study uncovers the complex relationship between gene copy number, point mutations and environment, and identifies proteostasis as a regulator of gene dosage evolution in bacteria. These findings open the door to alternative explanations for why gene duplications may be maintained over long periods of evolution and provides insight into how gene expression demand is mitigated by multiple mechanisms in bacteria.</p>

<title>Short-term evolution of antibiotic resistance</title>
<p>For short term laboratory evolution of antibiotic resistance, wild type and <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic> populations were cultured in 96-well plates in LB medium incorporating sub-inhibitory concentrations of different antibiotics. Following concentrations of antibiotics were used: trimethoprim (300 ng/mL; MIC/3); spectinomycin (5 μg/mL; MIC/10); nalidixic acid (4.25 μg/mL; MIC/3); erythromycin (10 μg/mL; MIC/10); rifampicin (4.25 μg/mL; MIC/3). Control populations were also set up in antibiotic-free LB. Five replicates were included for each strain in each antibiotic. Total volume of culture in each well was 150 μL. 10 % of the population was passaged to fresh growth media every 24 hours, for 7 days, resulting in ∼25 generations of evolution. At the end of 7 days, the evolved populations were frozen as glycerol stocks.</p>
<p>To check for the evolution of resistance and isolation of resistant clones for further analyses, frozen populations were revived in drug-free LB broth and grown overnight (14-16 hours).

Triplicate evolving lineages were then established by sub-culturing 1% of the saturated culture of each ancestor into 2 mL of appropriate medium. For relaxed selection drug-free LB was used. For constant antibiotic pressure, trimethoprim was added at a concentration of 300 ng/mL.

Trimethoprim stocks were added, and the antibiotic was serially diluted. No antibiotic was added to a few wells, which served as controls. Next, 1.5 μL of the appropriate bacterial culture was added to each well. The peripheral wells of the plate were filled with water to prevent dehydration. The 96-well plate was then incubated at 37℃ for 15-18 hrs. Optical density at 600 nm was measured for each well using a plate reader (Ensight, Perkin Elmer). Obtained data were first normalised to growth in drug-free wells (set to 1) and then fitted to a sigmoidal log(inhibitor)-response curve using Graphpad Prism software.

Anti-Hexahis monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was used as the primary antibody for InsL. Anti-Hexahis polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen) was used as the primary antibody for InsB. Band intensities were calculated in ImageJ and normalised to control (set to 1) to calculate fraction of protein remaining after chloramphenicol treatment.</p>

<caption><p>Stability of heterologously expressed InsB and InsL transposases in wild type or <italic>Δlon E. coli</italic> measured using a chloramphenicol (CMP) chase assay. Levels of the plasmid- expressed transposase were measured using immunoblotting with an anti-His monoclonal/polyclonal antibody in lysates prepared from cells at indicated time points following treatment with 50 μg/mL of CMP. A representative image from three independent experiments is shown. Band intensities were quantitated by image analyses and normalized to 0’ (set to 1). The fraction of protein remaining is plotted in blue for wild type and red for <italic>E. coli Δlon</italic>. Values from 3 independent experiments are plotted as mean ± S.D.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Jena et al. addresses important questions on the fundamental mechanisms of genetic adaptation, specifically, does adaptation proceed via changes of copy number (gene duplication and amplification &quot;GDA&quot;) or by point mutation. While this question has been worked on (for example by Tomanek and Guet) the authors add several important aspects relating to resistance against antibiotics and they clarify the ability of Lon protease to reduce duplication formation (previous work was more indirect).</p>
<p>A key finding Jena et al. present is that point mutations after significant competition displace GDA. A second one is that alternative GDA constantly arise and displace each other (see work on GDA-2 in Figure 3). Finally, the authors found epistasis between resistance alleles that was contingent on lon. Together this shows an intricate interplay of lon proteolysis for the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance by gene duplication.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study has several important strengths: (i) the work on GDA stability and competition of GDA with point mutations is a very promising area of research and the authors contribute new aspects to it, (ii) rigorous experimentation, (iii) very clearly written introduction and discussion sections. To me, the best part of the data is that deletion of lon stimulates GDA, which has not been shown with such clarity until now.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The minor weaknesses of the manuscript are a lack of clarity in parts of the results section (Point 1) and the methods (Point 2).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this strong study, the authors provide robust evidence for the role of proteostasis genes in the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, and moreover, for stabilizing the proteome in light of gene duplication events.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This strong study offers an important interaction between findings involving GDA, proteostasis, experimental evolution, protein evolution, and antimicrobial resistance. Overall, I found the study to be relatively well-grounded in each of these literatures, with experiments that spoke to potential concerns from each arena. For example, the literature on proteostasis and evolution is a growing one that includes organisms (even micro-organisms) of various sorts. One of my initial concerns involved whether the authors properly tested the mechanistic bases for the rule of Lon in promoting duplication events. The authors assuaged my concern with a set of assays (Figure 8).</p>
<p>More broadly, the study does a nice job of demonstrating the agility of molecular evolution, with responsible explanations for the findings: gene duplications are a quick-fix, but can be out-competed relative to their mutational counterparts. Without Lon protease to keep the proteome stable, the cell allows for less stable solutions to the problem of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>The study does what any bold and ambitious study should: it contains large claims and uses multiple sorts of evidence to test those claims.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the general argument and conclusion are clear, this paper is written for a bacterial genetics audience that is familiar with the manner of bacterial experimental evolution. From the language to the visuals, the paper is written in a boutique fashion. The figures are even difficult for me - someone very familiar with proteostasis - to understand. I don't know if this is the fault of the authors or the modern culture of publishing (where figures are increasingly packed with information and hard to decipher), but I found the figures hard to follow with the captions. But let me also consider that the problem might be mine, and so I do not want to unfairly criticize the authors.</p>
<p>For a generalist journal, more could be done to make this study clear, and in particular, to connect to the greater community of proteostasis researchers. I think this study needs a schematic diagram that outlines exactly what was accomplished here, at the beginning. Diagrams like this are especially important for studies like this one that offer a clear and direct set of findings, but conduct many different sorts of tests to get there. I recommend developing a visual abstract that would orient the readers to the work that has been done.</p>
<p>Next, I will make some more specific suggestions. In general, this study is well done and rigorous, but doesn't adequately address a growing literature that examines how proteostasis machinery influences molecular evolution in bacteria.</p>
<p>While this paper might properly test the authors' claims about protein quality control and evolution, the paper does not engage a growing literature in this arena and is generally not very strong on the use of evolutionary theory. I recognize that this is not the aim of the paper, however, and I do not question the authors' authority on the topic. My thoughts here are less about the invocation of theory in evolution (which can be verbose and not relevant), and more about engagement with a growing literature in this very area.</p>
<p>The authors mention Rodrigues 2016, but there are many other studies that should be engaged when discussing the interaction between protein quality control and evolution.</p>
<p>A 2015 study demonstrated how proteostasis machinery can act as a barrier to the usage of novel genes: Bershtein, S., Serohijos, A. W., Bhattacharyya, S., Manhart, M., Choi, J. M., Mu, W., ... &amp; Shakhnovich, E. I. (2015). Protein homeostasis imposes a barrier to functional integration of horizontally transferred genes in bacteria. PLoS genetics, 11(10), e1005612</p>
<p>A 2019 study examined how Lon deletion influenced resistance mutations in DHFR specifically: Guerrero RF, Scarpino SV, Rodrigues JV, Hartl DL, Ogbunugafor CB. The proteostasis environment shapes higher-order epistasis operating on antibiotic resistance. Genetics. 2019 Jun 1;212(2):565-75.</p>
<p>A 2020 study did something similar: Thompson, Samuel, et al. &quot;Altered expression of a quality control protease in E. coli reshapes the in vivo mutational landscape of a model enzyme.&quot; Elife 9 (2020): e53476.</p>
<p>And there's a new review (preprint) on this very topic that speaks directly to the various ways proteostasis shapes molecular evolution:</p>
<p>
Arenas, Carolina Diaz, Maristella Alvarez, Robert H. Wilson, Eugene I. Shakhnovich, C. Brandon Ogbunugafor, and C. Brandon Ogbunugafor. &quot;Proteostasis is a master modulator of molecular evolution in bacteria.&quot;</p>
<p>I am not simply attempting to list studies that should be cited, but rather, this study needs to be better situated in the contemporary discussion on how protein quality control is shaping evolution. This study adds to this list and is a unique and important contribution. However, the findings can be better summarized within the context of the current state of the field. This should be relatively easy to implement.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This paper investigates the relationship between the proteolytic stability of an antibiotic target enzyme and the evolution of antibiotic resistance via increased gene copy number. The target of the antibiotic trimethoprim is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). In Escherichia coli, DHFR is encoded by folA and the major proteolysis housekeeping protease is Lon (lon). In this manuscript, the authors report the results of the experimental evolution of a lon mutant strain of E. coli in response to sub-inhibitory concentrations of the antibiotic trimethoprim and then investigate the relationship between proteolytic stability of DHFR mutants and the evolution of folA gene duplication. After 25 generations of serial passaging in a fixed concentration of trimethoprim, the authors found that folA duplication events were more common during the evolution of the lon strain, than the wt strain. However, with continued passaging, some folA duplications were replaced by a single copy of folA containing a trimethoprim resistance-conferring point mutation. Interestingly, the evolution of the lon strain in the setting of increasing concentrations of trimethoprim resulted in evolved strains with different levels of DHFR expression. In particular, some strains maintained two copies of a mutant folA that encoded an unstable DHFR. In a lon+ background, this mutant folA did not express well and did not confer trimethoprim resistance. However, in the lon- background, it displayed higher expression and conferred high-level trimethoprim resistance. The authors concluded that maintenance of the gene duplication event (and the absence of Lon) compensated for the proteolytic instability of this mutant DHFR. In summary, they provide evidence that the proteolytic stability of an antibiotic target protein is an important determinant of the evolution of target gene copy number in the setting of antibiotic selection.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this paper is identifying an example of antibiotic resistance evolution that illustrates the interplay between the proteolytic stability and copy number of an antibiotic target in the setting of antibiotic selection. If the weaknesses are addressed, then this paper will be of interest to microbiologists who study the evolution of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Although the proposed mechanism is highly plausible and consistent with the data presented, the analysis of the experiments supporting the claim is incomplete and requires more rigor and reproducibility. The impact of this finding is somewhat limited given that it is a single example that occurred in a lon strain and compensatory mutations for evolved antibiotic resistance mechanisms are described. In this case, it is not clear that there is a functional difference between the evolution of copy number versus any other mechanism that meets a requirement for increased &quot;expression demand&quot; (e.g. promoter mutations that increase expression and protein stabilizing mutations).</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and suggestions on our manuscript. We also appreciate the succinct summary of key findings that the Reviewer has taken cognisance of in their assessment, in particular the association of the Lon protease with the propensity for GDAs as well as its impact on their eventual fate. Going ahead, we plan to revise the manuscript for greater clarity as suggested by Reviewer #1.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for their encouraging assessment of our manuscript. We appreciate that the manuscript may not be accessible for a general readership in its present form. We plan to revise the manuscript, in part by modifying figures and adding schematics, to afford greater clarity. We also appreciate the concern regarding situating this study in the context of other published work that relates proteostasis and molecular evolution. Indeed, this was a particularly difficult aspect for us given the different kinds of literature that were needed to make sense of our study. We plan on revising the manuscript by incorporating the references that the Reviewer has pointed out.</p>
