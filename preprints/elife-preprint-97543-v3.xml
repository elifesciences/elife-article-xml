<title>Abstract</title>
<p>In contrast to mammalian cells, bacterial cells lack mRNA polyadenylated tails, presenting a hurdle in isolating mRNA amidst the prevalent rRNA during single-cell RNA-seq. This study introduces a novel method, Ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA Depletion (RiboD), seamlessly integrated into the PETRI-seq technique, yielding RiboD-PETRI. This innovative approach offers a cost-effective, equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). By efficiently eliminating rRNA reads and substantially enhancing mRNA detection rates (up to 92%), our method enables precise exploration of bacterial population heterogeneity. Applying RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity, distinctive subpopulations marked by unique genes within biofilms were successfully identified. Notably, PdeI, a marker for the cell-surface attachment subpopulation, was observed to elevate cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) levels, promoting persister cell formation. Thus, we address a persistent challenge in bacterial single-cell RNA-seq regarding rRNA abundance, exemplifying the utility of this method in exploring biofilm heterogeneity. Our method effectively tackles a long-standing issue in bacterial scRNA-seq: the overwhelming abundance of rRNA. This advancement significantly enhances our ability to investigate the intricate heterogeneity within biofilms at unprecedented resolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Biofilms, contributing to approximately 80% of chronic and recurrent microbial infections in the human body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></sup>, are complex microbial ecosystems characterized by a diverse array of bacterial cells existing in various physiological states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></sup>. This heterogeneity within biofilms is influenced by multiple factors, including bacterial interactions (such as competition, symbiosis, and parasitism) that contribute to stable community structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref></sup>, environmental factors (like host environment, aquatic conditions, and nutrient concentrations), and spatial organization. Bacteria occupying different positions within the biofilm perform distinct roles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref></sup>: some mediate material exchange between cells and with the extracellular matrix, others facilitate complex communication systems between bacteria and with the host through signaling molecules, while certain bacteria participate in various energy conversion processes. This intricate division of labor not only contributes to bacterial heterogeneity but also enhances the biofilm’s overall resistance to various stresses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></sup>. The resulting cellular and functional diversity reflects the complex nature of the biofilm ecosystem, allowing it to adapt and persist in challenging environments. However, the study of biofilms faces significant limitations, primarily stemming from challenges in investigating heterogeneity within a bacterial population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref></sup>. Single-cell RNA-seq emerges as a promising avenue for addressing this heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></sup>.Expending on established protocols for cell fixation and permeabilization which facilitate in-cell barcoding while avoiding cell lysis, combinatorial barcoding-based bacterial scRNA-seq techniques, such as Prokaryotic Expression profiling by Tagging RNA in situ and sequencing (PETRI-seq)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> and Microbial Split-Pool Ligation Transcriptomics (microSPLiT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup>, have been developed. Nevertheless, these methods encounter challenges in terms of low transcript recovery rates due to overwhelmingly abundant rRNA, restricting the comprehensive analysis of within-population heterogeneity. In comparison to mammalian cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref></sup>, the absence of mRNA polyadenylated tails in bacteria necessitates an alternative approach for isolating mRNA (~5%) from the significantly more abundant rRNA (~95%). Here, by integrating a Ribosomal RNA derived cDNA Depletion protocol (RiboD) into a PETRI-seq, we developed RiboD-PETRI-seq that efficiently eliminates rRNA reads, thereby significantly improving mRNA detection rates and enabling exploration of within-population heterogeneity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In the RiboD protocol, we designed a set of probe primers that spans all regions of the bacterial rRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data1">Table S1</xref>). The core principle behind our probe design is twofold: the 3′-end of the probes are reverse complementary to the r-cDNA sequences, allowing for specific recognition of r-cDNA, while the 5′-end complements a biotin-labeled universal primer. This design enables the probes to be bound to magnetic beads, facilitating the separation of r-cDNA-probe-bead complexes from the rest of the library. Following template switching and RNaseH treatment on the barcoded cDNA from lysed cells to eliminate hybridized RNA, the library of probe primers and biotin-labeled universal primers is introduced to facilitate adequate hybridization. Pre-treated Streptavidin magnetic beads are then added to the hybridized rRNA-derived cDNA. The mRNA-derived cDNA remains in the supernatant and is collected for subsequent library construction and sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>). To assess the efficiency of single-cell capture in RiboD-PETRI, we calculated the multiplet frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> using a Poisson distribution based on our sequencing results (see details in Methods). The multiplet frequency for RiboD-PETRI ranges from 1.16% to 3.35% (Table S2), indicating the technique’s capability to effectively capture transcriptomes at the single-cell level.</p>

<p>(A) Graphic summary of the RiboD-PETRI method illustrating the incorporation of RiboD after cell pooling and lysis in PETRI-seq. The RiboD protocol is represented by the dashed-line box. In this box, firstly, we perform template-switching oligonucleotides (TSOs) in the mixture of heterozygous chain, then we remove the RNA strand using RNaseH, at this point the system contains r-cDNA and m-cDNA single-stranded mixture. Then we add the r-cDNA probe, which specifically binds to the r-cDNA. The probes are then bound to magnetic beads, allowing the r-cDNA-probe-bead complexes to be separated from the rest of the library. And then we remove the r-cDNA that is attached to the probe by Streptavidin magnetic beads. We then performed amplification of the libraries and sent them for sequencing. We designed separate probe sets for <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>C. crescentus</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Each set was specifically constructed to be reverse complementary to the r-cDNA sequences of its respective bacterial species. This species-specific approach ensures high efficiency and specificity in rRNA depletion for each organism. (B) Comparison of non-rRNA (tRNA, mRNA and other non-rRNA) and rRNA UMI counts ratio among different bacterial scRNA-seq methods. Data from PETRI-seq (<italic>E. coli</italic>), MicroSPLIT-seq (<italic>E. coli</italic>), M3-seq (<italic>E. coli</italic>) cited from previous studies. Error bars represent standard deviations of biological replicates. The “ΔΔ” label represents the RiboD-PETRI protocol; The “Ctrl” label represents the classic PETRI-seq protocol we performed. (C) Comparison of UMI counts per cell between RiboD-PETRI (Table S7) and PETRI (Table S8) at the same unsaturated sequencing depth. (D) Assessment of the effect of rRNA depletion on transcriptional profiles. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of UMI counts per gene (log2 UMIs) between RiboD-PETRI (Table S7) and PETRI (Table S9) was calculated for 3790 out of 4141 total genes, excluding those with zero counts in either library. Each point represents a gene. (E) Evaluation of the correlation between RiboD-PETRI (Table S7) data and bulk RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data6">Table S10</xref>) results. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of UMI counts per gene (log<sub>2</sub> UMIs) among RiboD-PETRI data and the reads per gene (log<sub>2</sub> reads) of bulk RNA-seq data was calculated for 3814 out of 4141 total genes, excluding those with zero counts in either library. Each point represents a gene. All data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig.1C, D, E</xref> were from our own sequencing experiments.</p></caption>

<p>To assess the performance of RiboD-PETRI, we designed a comprehensive assessment of rRNA depletion efficiency under diverse physiological conditions, specifically contrasting exponential and stationary phases. This approach allows us to understand how these different growth states impact rRNA depletion efficacy. Additionally, we included a variety of bacterial species, encompassing both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, to ensure that our findings are broadly applicable across different types of bacteria. By incorporating these variables, we aim to provide insights into the robustness and reliability of the RiboD-PETRI method in various biological contexts. The results highlight a substantial enhancement in rRNA-derived cDNA depletion, with mRNA ratio increases from 8.2% (Ctrl, the PETRI-seq we performed) to 81% (☒☒, RiboD-PETRI) for <italic>E. coli</italic> from exponential phase, from 10% (Ctrl) to 92% (☒☒) for <italic>S. aureus</italic> Trom stationary phase, and from 3.9% (Ctrl) to 54% (☒☒) for C. crescentus from exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data2">Table S3</xref>). Additionally, we compared our findings with other reported methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data3">Table S4</xref>). The original PETRI-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> protocol, which does not include an rRNA depletion step, exhibited an mRNA detection rate of approximately 5%. The MicroSPLiT-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></sup> method, which utilizes Poly A Polymerase for mRNA enrichment, achieved a detection rate of 7%. Similarly, M3-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></sup> and BacDrop-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></sup>, which employ RNase H to digest rRNA post-DNA probe hybridization in cells, reported mRNA detection rates of 65% and 61%, respectively. MATQ-DASH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref></sup>, which utilizes Cas9-mediated targeted rRNA depletion, yielded a detection rate of 30%. smRandom-seq utilizes a CRISPR-based rRNA depletion technique, reduced the rRNA proportion from 83% to 32%, increasing the mRNA proportion from 16% to 63%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref></sup>. BaSSSh-seq’s employs a rational probe design for efficient rRNA depletion, though specific efficiency was not reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></sup>. Among these, RiboD-PETRI demonstrated superior performance in mRNA detection while requiring the least sequencing depth. With equivalent sequencing depth, RiboD-PETRI demonstrates a significantly enhanced Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts detection rate compared to PETRI-seq alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>). This method recovered approximately 20,175 cells (92.6% recovery rate) with ≥ 15 UMIs per cell with a median UMI count of 42 per cell, which was significantly higher than PETRI-seq’s recovery rate of 17.9% with a median UMI count of 20 per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure S1A, B</xref>), indicating the number of detected mRNA per cell increased prominently. Notably, this enhancement was achieved while maintaining mRNA profiles consistent with non depleted samples (r = 0.93; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1D</xref>) and show a significant correlation with profiles from the traditional bulk RNA-seq method (r = 0.84; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>We subsequently investigated the transcriptome coverage of RiboD-PETRI across different physiological states and bacterial species. For exponential phase <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, we sequenced a library with 60,000 cells, recovering approximately 30,004 cells (50% recovery), each with ≥15 UMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">S1C</xref>). This analysis revealed 99.86% transcriptome-wide gene coverage across the cell population. The method achieved an average of 128.8 UMIs per single cell, with a median UMI count of 102 per cell. Further examination of high-quality cells showed varying levels of detection: the top 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 cells exhibited median UMI counts of 462, 259, and 193, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>), and median gene detection of 362, 236, and 188, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>). These high-performing cells demonstrate the upper limits of the method’s capabilities. For stationary phase <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, we sequenced a library with 30,000 cells, recovering approximately 9,982 cells (33.3% recovery), each with ≥15 UMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2A</xref>). Analysis showed 99.96% transcriptome-wide gene coverage across the cell population. At the single-cell level, we observed an average of 153.8 UMIs and a median of 142 UMIs. Top high-quality cells exhibited the following median UMI counts: 378 (top 1,000 cells), 207 (top 5,000 cells), and 167 (top 8,000 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2B</xref>). These cells also demonstrated median gene detection of 308, 194, and 158 genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2C</xref>). For exponential phase <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, we sequenced a library with 30,000 cells, recovering approximately 13,897 cells (46.3% recovery), each with ≥15 UMIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2G</xref>). Analysis showed 99.64% transcriptome-wide gene coverage across the cell population. At the single-cell level, we observed an average of 439.7 UMIs and a median of 182 UMIs. Top high-quality cells demonstrated the following median UMI counts: 2,190 (top 1,000 cells), 662 (top 5,000 cells), and 225 (top 10,000 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2H</xref>). These cells also exhibited median gene detection of 1,262, 529, and 219 genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2I</xref>). These results underscore RiboD-PETRI’s ability to capture a wide range of transcripts across varying cell qualities and species, providing a comprehensive view of gene expression at the single-cell level.</p>

<p>Our results affirm RiboD-PETRI’s reliability in capturing the bacterial single-cell transcriptome, providing ample coverage and sensitivity for various species. To provide a thorough evaluation of our sequencing depth and library quality, we performed sequencing saturation analysis on our sequencing samples. The findings reveal that our sequencing saturation is greater than 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. S1D-F</xref>), indicating that our sequencing depth is sufficient to capture the diversity of most transcripts.</p>
<p>We further investigated its ability to consistently identify within-population heterogeneity across different bacterial species and growth conditions. In the exponential phase of <italic>E. coli,</italic> we recovered 1,464 cells and identified three major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2D</xref>), with 17 cells (1.2%) in a unique subpopulation characterized by pentose and glucuronate interconversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E, F</xref>) and the marker genes of cluster 2 included <italic>yfgM, glpG, scpA, elyC, ptsA, carB, actP and pgpB</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2G</xref>). For the expression levels of marker gene shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2E</xref>, violin plots have been created to offer a more comprehensive view of the distribution across different cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. S4</xref>). In stationary phase <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells, we recovered 9,386 cells and found six major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2D</xref>), with 437 cells (4.7%) in a distinct subpopulation named cluster 4. The marker genes of cluster 4 included KQ76-13335, KQ76-00740 and KQ76-11725 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. S5</xref>). In the stationary phase of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> cells, we recovered 5728 cells and identified four major subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. S2J</xref>), with 603 cells (10.5%) in a unique subpopulation named cluster 3.

While RiboDPETRI consistently detects potential heterogeneity, further experimental validation would be required to confirm the biological significance of the observations.</p>
<p>We next focused on exploring biological heterogeneity of a biofilm at the early stage of development by utilizing the static biofilm system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></sup>. <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were cultured in microtiter dishes overnight, adhered cells were fixed for RiboD-PETRI processing in duplicate experiments. For these two replicates, we sequenced libraries containing 20,000 and 40,000 cells, recovering 5,244 and 11,344 cells, which corresponded to recovery rates of 26% and 28%, respectively. The correlations between detected reads and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) were found to be 0.87 and 0.90 for the two replicates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S3A</xref>). The median UMI counts for the recovered cells were 34 and 52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>). After screening, the final datasets comprised 1,621 and 3,999 cells for the two replicates, respectively. While no significant batch effects were observed, we applied batch correction as a precautionary measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S3B-D</xref>). In replicate 1, each cell was sequenced with an average of 1,563 reads, while in replicate 2, the average was 2,034 reads (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data4">Table S5</xref>), yielding median UMI counts of 283.5 and 239 per cell, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>). For gene detection, the median counts were 219 and 193 genes per cell for the respective replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>). Additionally, UMAP visualization was employed to illustrate the distribution of cellular UMI numbers, revealing heterogeneity among populations that was independent of UMI counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. S3E, F</xref>). Unsupervised clustering analysis identified four major subpopulations in each replicate, with a consistently identified rare subpopulation (2.6%/2.1%) as cluster 2, driven by cell envelope genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D-F</xref>).

<p>PdeI, identified among marker genes, was predicted as a phosphodiesterase enzyme hydrolyzing c-di-GMP, a vital bacterial second messenger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). However, our comprehensive structural analysis revealed a more complex and novel role for PdeI. While PdeI contains an intact EAL domain typically associated with c-di-GMP degradation, it also possesses a divergent GGDEF domain, generally linked to c-di-GMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Fig. S8</xref>). This dual-domain architecture suggested potential complex regulatory roles. To validate PdeI’s function, we created a PdeI-BFP fusion construct under the native pdeI promoter, integrated with a ratiometric c-di-GMP sensing system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref></sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Confocal microscopy revealed PdeI as a membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Single-cell level monitoring showed cell-to-cell variability in c-di-GMP levels and PdeI expression, with a positive correlation observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>), indicating PdeI upregulated c-di-GMP synthesis rather than degradation. This finding was confirmed by HPLC LC-MS/MS, which showed an approximately elevenfold increase in c-di-GMP concentration in the PdeI overexpression strain compared to the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E</xref>). These results align with previous studies showing that a point mutation (G412S) in PdeI’s divergent GGDEF domain in a strain lacking PdeH, the major phosphodiesterase in <italic>E. coli</italic>, resulted in decreased c-di-GMP levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></sup>. Our additional experiments with a PdeI(G412S)-BFP mutation strain showed constant c-di-GMP levels despite increasing BFP fluorescence, serving as a proxy for PdeI(G412S) expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>). These results, combined with the presence of a CHASE (cyclases/histidine kinase-associated sensory) domain in PdeI, strongly suggest that PdeI functions as a membrane-associated sensor that integrates environmental signals with c-di-GMP production under complex regulatory mechanisms. This discovery challenges the initial prediction of PdeI as solely a phosphodiesterase and highlights its novel role as a c-di-GMP synthetase, contributing significantly to our understanding of bacterial signaling pathways. It’s worth noting that while the other marker genes in this cluster are co-expressed, our analysis indicates that they do not have a significant impact on biofilm formation or a direct relationship with c-di-GMP or PdeI.</p>

<p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy provided further insights into the spatial distribution of PdeI-positive cells within the biofilm structure. In the PdeI-BFP fusion strain, PdeI-BFP positive cells, characterized by elevated c-di-GMP levels, were predominantly located at the bottom of the static biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4F</xref>). This localization corresponds to the region of cell-surface attachment, aligning with our hypothesis that PdeI functions as a membrane-associated sensor integrating environmental signals with c-di-GMP production through complex regulatory mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref></sup>. In contrast, in the control strain where BFP was expressed alone under arabinose-induced promoter, BFP-positive cells were observed to be distributed throughout the entire biofilm community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4G</xref>). This distinct spatial distribution pattern between the PdeI-BFP fusion and the BFP-only control strains provides compelling evidence for PdeI’s specific role in biofilm formation, particularly at the biofilm-surface interface. The concentration of PdeI-positive cells at the bottom of the biofilm suggests that PdeI may be especially crucial in the initial stages of biofilm formation, potentially responding to surface-associated cues to modulate c-di-GMP levels and promote attachment. The uniform distribution of BFP in the control strains suggests that the localization of PdeI-BFP is not affected by BFP labelling. These observations further underscore the complex and nuanced role of PdeI in bacterial signaling and biofilm development, highlighting the importance of considering cell-to-cell heterogeneity in understanding the function of regulatory proteins in microbial communities.</p>
<p>To investigate the association of the PdeI-high cluster with bacterial drug tolerance in the early stages of biofilm development, we isolated PdeI-high cells using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4H, I</xref>) and subjected them to an ampicillin antibiotic killing assay to determine their persister frequency. Our results revealed that the PdeI-high population produced a significantly higher ratio of persister cells (~7.3%) compared to the whole biofilm population (~0.6%). Notably, cells expressing high levels of BFP alone or PdeI(G412S)-BFP showed no increase in persister ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4J</xref>). This finding suggests that the increased persistence is specifically linked to PdeI activity. Time-lapse imaging during the antibiotic killing process consistently demonstrated that persisters primarily originated from PdeI-GFP positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">Movie S1</xref>). These PdeI-GFP positive cells, displaying characteristics of dormancy, survived ampicillin treatment for 6 hours without visible growth or division. Upon antibiotic removal and replacement with fresh growth medium, the PdeI-GFP positive persister cells resumed activity, elongating, dividing, and forming new microcolonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data7">Movie S1</xref>). This dynamic behavior provides direct visual evidence of the persister phenotype associated with PdeI-high cells. These findings strongly suggest that c-di-GMP, a molecule whose intracellular levels are upregulated by PdeI, plays a significant role in generating a persister subpopulation during the early stages of biofilm development. The mechanism by which elevated c-di-GMP levels contribute to antibiotic tolerance may involve modulation of cellular metabolism or activation of stress response pathways, leading to a state of dormancy that enables survival under antibiotic stress. This discovery not only enhances our understanding of the link between biofilm formation and antibiotic tolerance but also identifies PdeI as a potential target for strategies aimed at combating persistent bacterial infections.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we introduce RiboD-PETRI, an enhanced bacterial scRNA-seq method that offers a cost-effective (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="data5">Table S6</xref>), equipment-free, and high-throughput solution. By incorporating a probe hybridization-based rRNA-derived cDNA depletion protocol, our approach efficiently removes rRNA reads and significantly improves mRNA detection rates, enabling a more comprehensive exploration of within-population heterogeneity. At $0.0049 per cell, RiboD-PETRI is substantially more economical than the original PETRI-seq ($0.056 per cell), making it an attractive option for budget-conscious researchers. The method demonstrates improved mRNA detection, versatility across various bacterial species and growth conditions, preservation of transcriptome profiles consistent with non-depleted samples (r = 0.93) and traditional bulk RNA-seq methods (r = 0.84), high transcriptome coverage (&gt;99%), and robust single-cell resolution with median UMI counts ranging from 102 to 182 per cell across different species and conditions.</p>
<p>The application of RiboD-PETRI to investigate biofilm heterogeneity exemplifies its potential for exploring complex biological systems. Our analysis of early-stage biofilm development uncovered a rare subpopulation (2.1-2.6%) characterized by cell envelope genes, including the previously uncharacterized gene <italic>pdeI</italic>. Further investigation revealed PdeI’s novel role as a c-di-GMP synthetase rather than a phosphodiesterase, challenging initial predictions and contributing significantly to our understanding of bacterial signaling pathways. Moreover, we demonstrated that PdeI-high cells exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance, with a significantly higher proportion of persister cells compared to the general biofilm population. This finding establishes a link between elevated c-di-GMP levels, regulated by PdeI, and the generation of antibiotic-tolerant subpopulations during early biofilm development. The spatial distribution of PdeI-positive cells at the bottom of the static biofilm, corresponding to the cell-surface attachment region, supports our hypothesis that PdeI functions as a membrane-associated sensor integrating environmental signals with c-di-GMP production. This localization pattern suggests PdeI’s crucial role in the initial stages of biofilm formation, potentially responding to surface-associated cues to modulate c-di-GMP levels and promote attachment. While other marker genes in this cluster are co-expressed, our analysis indicates they do not significantly impact biofilm formation or directly relate to c-di-GMP or PdeI.</p>
<p>In conclusion, RiboD-PETRI represents a significant advancement in bacterial scRNA-seq methodology. Its ability to uncover hidden variations within bacterial populations, as demonstrated in our biofilm analysis, underscores its potential impact on advancing our understanding of microbial behavior and population dynamics. By providing a cost-effective and efficient tool for exploring bacterial heterogeneity, RiboD-PETRI opens new avenues for research in microbiology, potentially leading to novel insights into antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and other critical areas of bacterial biology.</p>

<title>Single-Cell Analysis</title>
<p>The sequencing data underwent processing into matrices using scripts and a pipeline as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></sup> in Python 2.7.15, with some modifications (the detailed original code and all the data were deposited in the GEO repository). After the count tables were made, subsequent analysis of single-cell data was conducted using Seurat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref></sup> package (version 4.3.0; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://satijalab.org/seurat/">http://satijalab.org/seurat/</ext-link>) in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). Since there were two replicates of static <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm, these two datasets were merged into one SeuratObject and batch effects were removed. However, the samples for exponential period <italic>E. coli, S. aureus</italic> and <italic>C. crescentus</italic> only had one sample, so they did not need this process. At the beginning of doing the scRNA-seq analysis, we screened the data of all samples. For preprocessing of static <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm data, cells were filtered with UMI per cell more than 100 and less than 2000 for replicate 1 and replicate 2 to obtain 1621 and 3999 cells, respectively. For data of exponential period <italic>E. coli</italic>, the data was screened for cells with UMIs greater than 200 and less than 5000 to obtain 1464 cells. The screening criteria of <italic>S. aureus</italic> were cells with UMIs greater than 15 and less than 1000 and genes greater than 30 (1000&gt;UMIs&gt;15, gene counts&gt;30). The screening criteria of <italic>C. crescentus</italic> were cells with UMIs greater than 200 and less than 5000 and gene counts greater than 30 (5000&gt;UMIs&gt;200, gene counts&gt;30). After screening, all the data were normalized using a scale factor of 10000 through a global-scaling normalization method called “LogNormalize”. Highly variable features were then identified, returning 500 features per dataset. Then we combine the data of the two replicates of static <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm into a single SeuratObject by FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions. Then all the data underwent scaling using the ScaleData function, followed by dimension reduction through principal component analysis. To avoid subtle batch effects influencing downstream analyses, we removed batch effects using RunHarmony<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></sup> for the two replicates of static <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm data. Then a graph-based clustering approach was employed in all data to identify clusters of gene expression programs using the Louvain algorithm (Seurat 4.3.0). The dims we choosed were 6. And the resolution was 0.3 for <italic>C. crescentus</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> or 0.4 for <italic>E. coli</italic> data. Marker genes for each cluster were computed using the Wilcoxon Rank-sum test. Specifically, marker genes for each cluster were initially obtained using the FindMarkers function of Seurat. Then we performed pathway enrichment analysis of marker gene by clusterProfiler function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref></sup> within R. For transcriptome-wide gene coverage across the cell population, we counted the number of genes expressing at least one UMI. Then we calculated the percentage of these genes out of all the genes in each bacterium.</p>

<title>Sequencing saturation of the libraries</title>
<p>To assess sequencing saturation, we generated five subsamples from the single-cell sequencing data, representing 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of the total data. Each subsample was analyzed independently following the previously described single-cell sequencing data analysis process. We then created gene expression matrices for each subsample based on the analysis results. The number of UMIs or genes was counted for each cell detected in each subsample. Next, we sorted the cells in descending order based on their UMI counts or gene counts and selected different numbers of cells from this sorted list, starting from those with the highest UMI or gene counts. For each selection of cells, we calculated the median number of UMIs or genes. Finally, we created a line graph representing the median UMI counts and genes using GraphPad Prism 9 software, allowing us to visualize the sequencing saturation across the different subsamples. In addition, we used the saturation calculation method of 10× Genomics to further detect the saturation of the data. The formula for calculating this metric is as follows: Sequencing Saturation = 1 - (n_deduped_reads / n_reads). Given the differences between RiboD-PETRI and 10× Genomics datasets, we have adapted the calculation as follows: n_deduped_reads: The number of UMIs as a measure of unique reads. n_reads: The total number of confidently mapped reads.</p>

<p>This work introduces an <bold>important</bold> new method for depleting ribosomal RNA from bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing libraries, demonstrating its applicability for studying heterogeneity in microbial biofilms. The findings provide <bold>convincing</bold> evidence for a distinct subpopulation of cells at the biofilm base that upregulates PdeI expression. Future studies exploring the functional relationship between PdeI and c-di-GMP levels, along with the roles of co-expressed genes within the same cluster, could further enhance the depth and impact of these conclusions.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Yan and colleagues introduce a modification to the previously published PETRI-seq bacterial single cell protocol to include a ribosomal depletion step based on a DNA probe set that selectively hybridizes with ribosome-derived (rRNA) cDNA fragments. They show that their modification of the PETRI-seq protocol increases the fraction of informative non-rRNA reads from ~4-10% to 54-92%. The authors apply their protocol to investigating heterogeneity in a biofilm model of E. coli, and convincingly show how their technology can detect minority subpopulations within a complex community.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The method the authors propose is a straightforward and inexpensive modification of an established split-pool single cell RNA-seq protocol that greatly increases its utility, and should be of interest to a wide community working in the field of bacterial single cell RNA-seq.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The reviewers have responded thoughtfully and comprehensively to all of my comments. I believe the details of the protocol are now much easier to understand, and the text and methods have been significantly clarified. I have no further comments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This work introduces a new method of depleting the ribosomal reads from the single-cell RNA sequencing library prepared with one of the prokaryotic scRNA-seq techniques, PETRI-seq. The advance is very useful since it allows broader access to the technology by lowering the cost of sequencing. It also allows more transcript recovery with fewer sequencing reads. The authors demonstrate the utility and performance of the method for three different model species and find a subpopulation of cells in the E.coli biofilm that express a protein, PdeI, which causes elevated c-di-GMP levels. These cells were shown to be in a state that promotes persister formation in response to ampicillin treatment.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The introduced rRNA depletion method is highly efficient, with the depletion for E.coli resulting in over 90% of reads containing mRNA. The method is ready to use with existing PETRI-seq libraries which is a large advantage, given that no other rRNA depletion methods were published for split-pool bacterial scRNA-seq methods. Therefore, the value of the method for the field is high. There is also evidence that a small number of cells at the bottom of a static biofilm express PdeI which is causing the elevated c-di-GMP levels that are associated with persister formation. This finding highlights the potentially complex role of PdeI in regulation of c-di-GMP levels and persister formation in microbial biofilms.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors edited the manuscript thoroughly in response to the comments, including both performing new experiments and showing more data and information. Most of the major points raised between both reviewers were addressed. The authors explained the seeming contradiction between c-di-GMP levels and PdeI expression.</p>

<p>This work presents an important method for depleting ribosomal RNA from bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing libraries, enabling the study of cellular heterogeneity within microbial biofilms. The approach convincingly identifies a small subpopulation of cells at the biofilm's base with upregulated PdeI expression, offering invaluable insights into the biology of bacterial biofilms and the formation of persister cells. Further integrated analysis of gene interactions within these datasets could deepen our understanding of biofilm dynamics and resilience.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback and for recognizing the importance of our method for depleting ribosomal RNA from bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing libraries. We are pleased that our approach has convincingly identified a small subpopulation of cells at the base of the biofilm with upregulated PdeI expression, providing significant insights into the biology of bacterial biofilms and the formation of persister cells.</p>
<p>We acknowledge your suggestion for a more comprehensive analysis of multiple genes and their interactions. While we conducted a broad analysis across the transcriptome, our decision to focus on the heterogeneously expressed gene PdeI was primarily informed by its critical role in biofilm biology. In addition to PdeI, we investigated other marker genes and noted that <italic>lptE</italic> and <italic>sstT</italic> exhibited potential associations with persister cells. However, our interaction analysis revealed that LptE and SstT did not demonstrate significant relationships with c-di-GMP and PdeI based on current knowledge. This insight led us to concentrate on PdeI, given its direct relevance to biofilm formation and its close connection to the c-di-GMP signaling pathway.</p>
<p>We fully agree that other marker genes may also have important regulatory roles in different aspects of biofilm dynamics. Thus, we plan to explore the expression patterns and potential functions of these genes in our future research. Specifically, we intend to conduct more extensive gene network analyses to uncover the complex regulatory mechanisms involved in biofilm formation and resilience.</p>

<p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for their thoughtful and positive evaluation of our work. We appreciate the recognition of our modification to the PETRI-seq bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing protocol by incorporating a ribosomal depletion step. The significant increase in the fraction of informative non-rRNA reads, as noted in the reviewer’s summary, underscores the effectiveness of our method in enhancing the utility of the PETRI-seq approach. We are also encouraged by the reviewer's acknowledgment of our ability to detect minority subpopulations within complex biofilm communities. Our team is committed to further validating and optimizing this method, and we believe that RiboD-PETRI will contribute meaningfully to the field of bacterial single-cell transcriptomics. We hope this innovative approach will facilitate new discoveries in microbial ecology and biofilm research.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Given many current methods that also introduce different techniques for ribosomal RNA depletion in bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing, it is unclear what is the place and role of RiboD-PETRI. The efficiency of rRNA depletion varies greatly between species for the majority of the available methods, so it is not easy to select the best fitting technique for a specific application.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your insightful comments regarding the place and role of RiboD-PETRI in the landscape of ribosomal RNA depletion techniques for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing. We appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns and clarify the significance of our method.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that the field of rRNA depletion in bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing is diverse, with many methods offering different approaches. We also recognize the challenge of selecting the best technique for a specific application, given the variability in rRNA depletion efficiency across species for many available methods. In light of these considerations, we believe RiboD-PETRI occupies a distinct and valuable niche in this landscape due to following reasons: 1) Low-input compatibility: Our method is specifically tailored for the low-input requirements of single-cell RNA sequencing, maintaining high efficiency even with limited starting material. This makes RiboD-PETRI particularly suitable for single-cell studies where sample quantity is often a limiting factor. 2) Equipment-free protocol: One of the unique advantages of RiboD-PETRI is that it can be conducted in any lab without the need for specialized equipment. This accessibility ensures that a wide range of researchers can implement our method, regardless of their laboratory setup. 3) Broad species coverage: Through comprehensive probe design targeting highly conserved regions of bacterial rRNA, RiboD-PETRI offers a robust solution for samples involving multiple bacterial species or complex microbial communities. This approach aims to provide consistent performance across diverse taxa, addressing the variability issue you mentioned. 4) Versatility and compatibility: RiboD-PETRI is designed to be compatible with various downstream single-cell RNA sequencing protocols, enhancing its utility in different experimental setups and research contexts.</p>
<p>In conclusion, RiboD-PETRI's unique combination of low-input compatibility, equipment-free protocol, broad species coverage, and versatility positions it as a robust and accessible option in the landscape of rRNA depletion methods for bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing. We are committed to further validating and improving our method to ensure its valuable contribution to the field and to provide researchers with a reliable tool for their diverse experimental needs.</p>

<p>Despite transcriptome-wide coverage, the authors focused on the role of a single heterogeneously expressed gene, PdeI. A more integrated analysis of multiple genes and\or interactions between them using these data could reveal more insights into the biofilm biology.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We understand your suggestion for a more comprehensive analysis of multiple genes and their interactions. While we indeed conducted a broad analysis across the transcriptome, our decision to focus on the heterogeneously expressed gene PdeI was primarily based on its crucial role in biofilm biology. Beyond PdeI, we also conducted overexpression experiments on several other marker genes and examined their phenotypes. Notably, the lptE and sstT genes showed potential associations with persister cells. We performed an interaction analysis, which revealed that LptE and SstT did not show significant relationships with c-di-GMP and PdeI based on current knowledge. This finding led us to concentrate our attention on PdeI. Given PdeI's direct relevance to biofilm formation and its close connection to the c-di-GMP signaling pathway, we believed that an in-depth study of PdeI was most likely to reveal key biological mechanisms.</p>
<p>We fully agree with your point that other marker genes may play regulatory roles in different aspects. The expression patterns and potential functions of these genes will be an important direction in our future research. In our future work, we plan to conduct more extensive gene network analyses to uncover the complex regulatory mechanisms of biofilm formation.</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback regarding the presentation of UMI capture metrics for the RiboD-PETRI method. We appreciate your concern about potential biological biases and the importance of comprehensive data representation in single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. We have now included the UMI capture metrics for all cells passing the initial quality filter (≥15 UMIs/cell) for the RiboD-PETRI method. This information has been added to both the main text and the relevant figures, providing a more complete picture of our method's performance across the entire range of captured cells. These revisions strengthen our manuscript and provide readers with a more complete understanding of the RiboD-PETRI method in the context of single-cell RNA sequencing.</p>

<p>- Despite now discussing performance metrics for RiboD-PETRI method for all cells passing initial quality filter (&gt;=15 UMIs/cell) in the text, the authors continued to also include the statistics for top 1000 cells, 5,000 cells and so on. Critically, Figure 2A-B is still showing the UMI and gene distributions per cell only for these select groups of cells. The intent to focus on these metrics is not quite clear, as selection of the top few cells with higher UMI count may introduce biological biases in the analysis (what if the top 5% of cells are unusual because they represent a distinct subpopulation with very high gene expression due to a biological process). I understand the desire to demonstrate the performance of the method by highlighting a few select 'best' cells, however, for single-cell RNA sequencing showing the statistics for a 'top' group of cells is not appropriate and creates confusion, especially when used to compare to other methods (e.g. the parent method PETRI-seq itself).</p>

<p>We appreciate your insightful feedback regarding our presentation of the RiboD-PETRI method's performance metrics. We acknowledge the concerns you've raised and agree that our current approach requires refinement. We have revised our analysis to prominently feature metrics for all cells that pass the initial quality filter (≥15 UMIs/cell) (Fig. 2A, Fig. 3A, Supplementary Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Fig. 2A, G). This approach provides a more representative view of the method's performance across the entire dataset, avoiding potential biases introduced by focusing solely on top-performing cells.​</p>
<p>We recognize that selecting only the top cells based on UMI counts can indeed introduce biological biases, as these cells may represent distinct subpopulations with unique biological processes rather than typical cellular states. To address this, we have clearly stated the potential for bias when highlighting select 'best' cells. We also provided context for why these high-performing cells are shown, explaining that they demonstrate the upper limits of the method's capabilities (lines 139). In addition, when comparing RiboD-PETRI to other methods, including the parent PETRI-seq, we ensured that comparisons are made using consistent criteria across all methods.</p>
<p>By implementing these changes, we aim to provide a more accurate, unbiased, and comprehensive representation of the RiboD-PETRI method's performance while maintaining scientific rigor and transparency. We appreciate your critical feedback, as it helps us improve the quality and reliability of our research presentation.</p>

<p>- Line 151 &quot; The findings reveal that our sequencing saturation is 100% (Fig. S1B, C)&quot; - I suggest the authors revisit this calculation as this parameter is typically very challenging to get above 95-96%. The sequencing saturation should be calculated from the statistics of alignment themselves, i.e. the parameter calculated by Cell Ranger as described here <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003646912-How-is-sequencing-saturation-calculated">https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003646912-How-is-sequencing-saturation-calculated</ext-link> :</p>
<p>&quot;The web_summary.html output from cellranger count includes a metric called &quot;Sequencing Saturation&quot;. This metric quantifies the fraction of reads originating from an already-observed UMI. More specifically, this is the fraction of confidently mapped, valid cell-barcode, valid UMI reads that are non-unique (match an existing cell-barcode, UMI, gene combination).</p>
<p>The formula for calculating this metric is as follows:</p>
<p>Sequencing Saturation = 1 - (n_deduped_reads / n_reads)</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>n_deduped_reads = Number of unique (valid cell-barcode, valid UMI, gene) combinations among confidently mapped reads.</p>
<p>n_reads = Total number of confidently mapped, valid cell-barcode, valid UMI reads.</p>
<p>Note that the numerator of the fraction is n_deduped_reads, not the non-unique reads that are mentioned in the definition. n_deduped_reads is a degree of uniqueness, not a degree of duplication/saturation. Therefore we take the complement of (n_deduped_reads / n_reads) to measure saturation.&quot;</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful comment regarding our sequencing saturation calculation. The sequencing saturation algorithm we initially employed was based on the methodology used in the BacDrop study (PMID: PMC10014032, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10014032/">https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10014032/</ext-link>).</p>
<p>We acknowledge the importance of using standardized and widely accepted methods for calculating sequencing saturation. As per your suggestion, we have recalculated our sequencing saturation using the method described by 10x Genomics. Given the differences between RiboD-PETRI and 10x Genomics datasets, we have adapted the calculation as follows:</p>
<p>· n_deduped_reads: We used the number of UMIs as a measure of unique reads.</p>
<p>· n_reads: We used the total number of confidently mapped reads.</p>
<p>After applying this adapted calculation method, we found that our sequencing saturation ranges from 92.16% to 93.51%. This range aligns more closely with typical expectations for sequencing saturation in single-cell RNA sequencing experiments, suggesting that we have captured a substantial portion of the transcript diversity in our samples. We also updated Figure S1 to reflect these recalculated sequencing saturation values. We will also provide a detailed description of our calculation method in the methods section to ensure transparency and reproducibility. It's important to note that this saturation calculation method was originally designed for 10× Genomics data. While we've adapted it for our study, we acknowledge that its applicability to our specific experimental setup may be limited.</p>
<p>We thank you for bringing this important point to our attention. This recalculation not only improves the accuracy of our reported results but also aligns our methodology more closely with established standards in the field. We believe these revisions strengthen the overall quality and reliability of our study.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>- Further, this calculated saturation should be taken into account when comparing the performance of the method in terms of retrieving diverse transcripts from cells. I.e., if the RiboD-Petri dataset was subsampled to the same saturation as the original PETRI-seq dataset was obtained with, would the median UMIs/cell for all cells above filter be comparable? In other words, does rRNA depletion just decreases the cost to sequence to saturation, or does it provide UMI capture benefits at a comparable saturation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We appreciate your insightful question regarding the comparison of method performance in terms of transcript retrieval diversity and the impact of saturation. To address your concerns, we conducted an additional analysis comparing the RiboD-PETRI and original PETRI-seq datasets at equivalent saturation levels besides our original analysis with equivalent sequencing depth.</p>
<p>With equivalent sequencing depth, RiboD-PETRI demonstrates a significantly enhanced Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts detection rate compared to PETRI-seq alone (Fig. 1C). This method recovered approximately 20175 cells (92.6% recovery rate) with ≥ 15 UMIs per cell with a median UMI count of 42 per cell, which was significantly higher than PETRI-seq's recovery rate of 17.9% with a median UMI count of 20 per cell (Figure S1A, B), indicating the number of detected mRNA per cell increased prominently.</p>
<p>When we subsampled the RiboD-PETRI dataset to match the saturation level of the original PETRI-seq dataset (i.e., equalizing the n_deduped_reads/n_reads ratio), we found that the median UMIs/cell for all cells above the filter threshold was higher in the RiboD-PETRI dataset compared to the original PETRI-seq (as shown in Author response image 2). This observation can be primarily attributed to the introduction of the rRNA depletion step in the RiboD-PETRI method. ​Our analysis suggests that rRNA depletion not only reduces the cost of sequencing to saturation but also provides additional benefits in UMI capture efficiency at comparable saturation levels.​The rRNA depletion step effectively reduces the proportion of rRNA-derived reads in the sequencing output. Consequently, at equivalent saturation levels, this leads to a relative increase in the number of n_deduped_reads corresponding to mRNA transcripts. This shift in read composition enhances the capture of informative UMIs, resulting in improved transcript diversity and detection.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our findings indicate that the rRNA depletion step in RiboD-PETRI offers dual advantages: it decreases the cost to sequence to saturation and provides enhanced UMI capture benefits at comparable saturation levels, ultimately leading to more efficient and informative single-cell transcriptome profiling.</p>

<p>- smRandom-seq and BaSSSh-seq need to also be discussed since these newer methods are also demonstrating rRNA depletion techniques. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40137-9">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40137-9</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.28.601229">https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.28.601229</ext-link>)</p>

<p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our method, RiboD-PETRI, in the context of other recent advances in bacterial RNA sequencing techniques, particularly smRandom-seq and BaSSSh-seq.</p>
<p>RiboD-PETRI employs a Ribosomal RNA-derived cDNA Depletion (RiboD) protocol. This method uses probe primers that span all regions of the bacterial rRNA sequence, with the 3'-end complementary to rRNA-derived cDNA and the 5'-end complementary to a biotin-labeled universal primer. After hybridization, Streptavidin magnetic beads are used to eliminate the hybridized rRNA-derived cDNA, leaving mRNA-derived cDNA in the supernatant. smRandom-seq utilizes a CRISPR-based rRNA depletion technique. This method is designed for high-throughput single-microbe RNA sequencing and has been shown to reduce the rRNA proportion from 83% to 32%, effectively increasing the mRNA proportion four times (from 16% to 63%). While specific details about BaSSSh-seq's rRNA depletion technique are not provided in the available information, it is described as employing a rational probe design for efficient rRNA depletion. This technique aims to minimize the loss of mRNA during the depletion process, ensuring a more accurate representation of the transcriptome.</p>
<p>RiboD-PETRI demonstrates significant enhancement in rRNA-derived cDNA depletion across both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. It increases the mRNA ratio from 8.2% to 81% for E. coli in exponential phase, from 10% to 92% for S. aureus in stationary phase, and from 3.9% to 54% for C. crescentus in exponential phase. smRandom-seq shows high species specificity (99%), a minor doublet rate (1.6%), and a reduced rRNA percentage (32%). These metrics indicate its efficiency in single-microbe RNA sequencing. While specific performance metrics for BaSSSh-seq are not provided in the available information, its rational probe design approach suggests a focus on maintaining mRNA integrity during the depletion process.</p>
<p>RiboD-PETRI is described as a cost-effective ($0.0049 per cell), equipment-free, and high-throughput solution for bacterial scRNA-seq. This makes it an attractive option for researchers with budget constraints. While specific cost information is not provided, the efficiency of smRandom-seq is noted to be affected by the overwhelming quantity of rRNAs (&gt;80% of mapped reads). The CRISPR-based depletion technique likely adds to the complexity and cost of the method. Cost and accessibility information for BaSSSh-seq is not provided in the available data, making a direct comparison difficult.</p>
<p>All three methods represent significant advancements in bacterial RNA sequencing, each offering unique approaches to the challenge of rRNA depletion. RiboD-PETRI stands out for its cost-effectiveness and demonstrated success in complex systems like biofilms. Its ability to significantly increase mRNA ratios across different bacterial species and growth phases is particularly noteworthy. smRandom-seq's CRISPR-based approach offers high specificity and efficiency, which could be advantageous in certain research contexts, particularly where single-microbe resolution is crucial. However, the complexity of the CRISPR system might impact its accessibility and cost-effectiveness. BaSSSh-seq's focus on minimizing mRNA loss during depletion could be beneficial for studies requiring highly accurate transcriptome representations, although more detailed performance data would be needed for a comprehensive comparison. The choice between these methods would depend on specific research needs. RiboD-PETRI's cost-effectiveness and proven application in biofilm studies make it particularly suitable for complex bacterial community analyses. smRandom-seq might be preferred for studies requiring high-throughput single-cell resolution. BaSSSh-seq could be the method of choice when preserving the integrity of the mRNA profile is paramount.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while all three methods offer valuable solutions for rRNA depletion in bacterial RNA sequencing, RiboD-PETRI's combination of efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and demonstrated application in complex biological systems positions it as a highly competitive option in the field of bacterial transcriptomics.</p>

<p>- The utility of Figs 2E and 3E is questionable - the same information can be conveyed in text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful observation regarding Figures 2E and 3E. We appreciate your feedback and would like to address the concerns you've raised.</p>
<p>While we acknowledge that some of the information in these figures could be conveyed textually, we believe that their visual representation offers several advantages. Figures 2E and 3E provide a comprehensive visual overview of the pathway enrichment analysis for marker genes, which may be more easily digestible than a textual description. This analysis was conducted in response to another reviewer's request, demonstrating our commitment to addressing diverse perspectives in our research.</p>
<p>These figures allow for a systematic interpretation of gene expression data, revealing complex interactions between genes and their involvement in biological pathways that might be less apparent in a text-only format. Visual representations can make complex data more accessible to readers with different learning styles or those who prefer graphical summaries. Additionally, including such figures is consistent with standard practices in our field, facilitating comparison with other studies. We believe that the pathway enrichment analysis results presented in these figures provide valuable insights that merit inclusion as visual elements.​ However, we are open to discussing alternative ways to present this information if you have specific suggestions for improvement.</p>
