<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Bestrophin isoform 4 (<italic>BEST4</italic>) is a newly identified subtype of the calcium-activated chloride channel family. Analysis of colonic epithelial cell diversity by single cell RNA-sequencing has revealed the existence of a cluster of <italic>BEST4</italic>+ mature colonocytes in humans. However, if the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> is involved in regulating tumour progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression attenuates cell proliferation, colony formation, and mobility in colorectal cancer (CRC) <italic>in vitro</italic>, and impedes the tumor growth and the liver metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>BEST4</italic> is coexpressed with hairy/enhancer of split 4 (<italic>Hes4</italic>) in the nucleus of cells, and <italic>Hes4</italic> signals <italic>BEST4</italic> by interacting with the upstream region of the <italic>BEST4</italic> promoter. <italic>BEST4</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Hes4</italic> and downregulates Twist1, thereby inhibiting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in CRC. Conversely, knockout of BEST4 using CRISPR/Cas9 in CRC cells revitalises tumor growth and induces EMT. Furthermore, the low level of the <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA is correlated with advanced and the worse prognosis, suggesting that <italic>BEST4</italic> functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common tumour worldwide. A steady increase in the morbidity and mortality of CRC has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Rawla et al., 2019</xref>). When diagnosed in advanced stages, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019</xref>; Sunlin Yong, 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yeung and Yang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). EMT is a reprogramming process in which epithelial E-cadherin and ZO-1 are suppressed, and mesenchymal N-cadherin and vimentin are induced, transcriptionally mediated by Twist and the Snail family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>The inhibition of EMT in breast cancer and prostate cancer has been associated with calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Porretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Walia et al., 2012</xref>), leading to various evaluations of CaCCs as a potential for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Qu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sui et al., 2014</xref>). The bestrophin (<italic>BEST</italic>) chloride channel, which is a member of a recently identified gene family, encodes several integral membrane proteins expressed on the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells; they regulate CaCCs to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Marmorstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>). Although there are four human evolutionarily-related genes (<italic>BEST1âBEST4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tsunenari <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), variant 4 is expressed predominantly in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fagerberg et al., 2014</xref>), where it gates electrolyte transportation in human intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). However, the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> in the development of CRC and the mechanism behind its regulation are currently unknown.</p>
<p>In a recent analysis based on single cell RNA-sequencing analysis, it was discovered that a group of mature colonocytes expresses <italic>BEST4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>), and the subset of this group coexists with hairy/enhancer of split 4 positive (<italic>Hes4</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Hes4</italic> belongs to a family of seven Hes genes (<italic>Hes1â7</italic>) that encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. It is known to play a critical role in determining the fate and differentiation of progenitor cells during the development of various organs. Inhibiting the Twist1 transcriptional factor has been shown to mediate commitment to the differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells, as reported by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">El Yakoubi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Murato and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Nichane et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros et al., 2015</xref>). Given this information, it is tempting to speculate that BEST4 may be associated with Hes4 and Twist1 in regulating EMT during CRC progression.</p>
<p>The aims of the present study are to: (1) establish the role <italic>BEST4</italic> in CRC growth <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>; (2) determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which <italic>BEST4</italic> interacts with Hes4 and Twist1, and regulates EMT; and (3) explore the correlation of <italic>BEST4</italic> gene expression with prognosis of CRC.</p>

<title><italic>BEST4</italic> inhibits CRC proliferation, clonogenesis, migration, and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To evaluate the effect of BEST4 on tumour growth, we constructed <italic>BEST4-</italic>expressing HCT116 and Caco2 CRC cell lines (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1-supplemental figure 1A-1C</xref>)</bold> and showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression halved cell proliferating rates of their respective empty vector (EV) controls when they were monitored in live and analysed using InCucyte (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref></bold>). This was accompanied by decreased cell viability (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1-supplemental figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">1E</xref>)</bold>. To determine the causal role of BEST4 in CRC tumorigenesis, we knocked out the <italic>BEST4</italic> gene in HCT-15 using a CRISPR/Cas9 system (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1- supplemental figure 1F-H</xref></bold>). Consequently, there was a 50% increase in proliferation rates and viability compared with the parental control (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1-supplemental figure 1I</xref></bold>). Rescued expression of BEST4 was able to reverse the observed effects on HCT-15 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1_1">Figure 1- supplemental figure 1I</xref></bold>).</p>

(C) Viability of three individual <italic>BEST4</italic>-deleted clones as determined by a CCK-8 assay.

(E) Expression of <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA in HCT116 and Caco2 cells resulted in more colonies than cells transduced with EV plasmids (left panel); colonies were counted and analysed as shown (right panel). (F) A colony formation assay was performed to evaluate the responses of HCT-15 cells following <italic>BEST4</italic> deletion and reintroduction (left panel); cell colonies were counted and analysed as shown (right panel). (G) Heterologous expression of BEST4 in HCT116 cells suppressed invasion and migration (upper panel, scale bar, 200 Î¼m); cells that passed through the membrane were counted and compared (lower panel).

<p>In contrast to the controls, BEST4 overexpression decreased colony formations of HCT116 and Caco2 by 60% and 70%, respectively (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref></bold>). While BEST4 deletion increased the number of colonies by five-fold in HCT-15 (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>), the rescued expression counteracted its enhancement (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>BEST4</italic> in HCT116 inhibited transwell migration and invasion by 70% and 80%, respectively, compared to EV controls (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>). But <italic>BEST4</italic> ablation in HCT-15 increased cell migration and invasion by two-fold and three-fold, respectively. These pro-tumor effects on HCT-15 were also reversible when BEST4 expression was rescued (<bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings suggest the tumour-suppressive role of <italic>BEST4</italic> in CRC growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>BEST4</italic> deters EMT in CRC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Because EMT initiation is a critical process in tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acloque et al., 2009</xref>), we evaluated the effect of <italic>BEST4</italic> on EMT using qPCR and found that <italic>BEST4</italic> expression upregulated <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>ZO-1</italic> and downregulated <italic>vimentin</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> in HCT116 compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05) (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref></bold>). Conversely, knockout of <italic>BEST4</italic> in HCT15 downregulated <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>ZO-1</italic> and upregulated <italic>vimentin</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic>. Rescued expression of BEST4 in HCT-15 reversed these gene alterations (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref></bold>). Changes of these genes were consistent with their corresponding protein expression as analysed by immunoblotting (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Next, we subcutaneously implanted <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA-expressing HCT116 and EV control cell lines into BALB/c nude mice and monitored tumour growth weekly. When they reached the maximum allowable volumes (day 32), the animals were culled, and tumours were harvested. Essentially, the sizes and weights of tumours in <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression group were only half of the EV control (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref></bold>), in conjunction with the similar magnitude reduction of Ki67+ cells as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref></bold>). Further analysis of the HCT116 tumour tissue lysates showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> deterred EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and, downregulating vimentin and Twist1 <bold>(<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2I</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>).</bold></p>
<p>We also evaluated the inhibitory role of BEST4 in a model of CRC to the liver metastasis by intrasplenically injecting HCT-15 cell lines with BEST4 knockout (BEST4gRNA) or the wild-type control (gRNA) or the knockout with the rescue (BEST4-Rescued) into BALB/c nude mice. We observed that there were 2-fold greater of the liver metastatic nodules in the BEST4 deficient tumors than the control (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref></bold>). Conversely, the reconstituted BEST4 expression had no visible metastatic nodules in the liver, and the pathological analysis of the tissue sections by H&amp;E staining also confirmed no detectable metastatic loci in the tissue sections (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>These findings indicate the role of BEST4 in suppressing CRC tumorigenic activities, through counteracting EMT induction in models of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Hes4 upstream regulation of BEST4</title>
<p>Given the co-expression of <italic>BEST4</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Hes4</italic><sup>+</sup> in a human colonic epithelial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), we sought to investigate their biological interactions during tumour growth. Upon transfecting the Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> plasmid DNA into HCT116, we observed a responsive upregulation of both endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA and protein levels compared to the control transfectant (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3- supplemental figure 1A</xref>)</bold>.

<p>To explore how Hes4 regulates <italic>BEST4</italic> expression at the transcriptional level, we transfected a <italic>BEST4</italic> promoter-driven luciferase DNA construct into <italic>Hes4</italic>-expressing HCT116 and assessed the promoter activity using a dual-luciferase assay. Our results showed a four-fold increase in the promoter activity compared to the EV control (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>), Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analysis using a Flag antibody to IP for Hes4 revealed a twelve-fold enrichment of the P3 region upstream of the <italic>BEST4</italic> transcriptional start site compared to the control (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). Interestingly, <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression in HCT116 cells did not affect <italic>Hes4</italic> mRNA expression as quantified by qPCR (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3_1">Figure 3-supplemental figure 1C</xref></bold>), suggesting that <italic>Hes4</italic> regulates <italic>BEST4</italic> expression upstream. This speculation is supported by immunofluorescence staining, where we observed nuclear co-localization of BEST4 (green) and Hes4 (red) in HCT116 cells co-transfected with <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA and Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> plasmid DNAs, along with additional cytoplasmic expression of <italic>BEST4</italic> (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>To evaluate the association of <italic>BEST4</italic> with Hes4 at the translational level, we co-transfected their HA-tagged <italic>BEST4</italic> and Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> plasmid DNAs into HEK293 cells, along with the respective single transfectant control. By conducting IP with antibodies specific to Flag or HA, we showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> and <italic>Hes4</italic> were reciprocally copurified from the nuclear protein lysates, but not with IgG controls (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings indicate that <italic>BEST4</italic> interacts with <italic>Hes4</italic> at both transcriptional and translational levels.</p>

<title><italic>BEST4</italic> relays <italic>Hes4</italic> signal and directly downregulates Twist1 leading to EMT inhibition independent of the channel function in CRC</title>
<p>Because a step of <italic>Hes4</italic> in committing to human bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage-specific development is mediated by Twist1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), with evidence of direct interaction between BEST4 and Hes4 observed in HCT116, it is plausible that they could exploit Twist1 to regulate EMT. To test this notion, we transfected a Twist1 promoter-driven luciferase DNA construct into HCT116. In comparison with the EV control, Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> or <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA transfectants significantly decreased Twist1 promoter activity by almost half, as evaluated by the dual-luciferase assay (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>)</bold>.

<p>The association of BEST4 with the Twist1 promoter activity was also evidenced by their nuclear colocalization after transfecting BEST4-HA and Myc-Twist1 plasmid DNAs into HCT116 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4- supplemental figure 1A</xref>)</bold>. Co-IP with antibodies to Myc or HA showed that they were copurified from the nuclear protein lysates, but not with the IgG controls from the transfectant cell lysates (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4-supplemental figure 1A</xref></bold>). Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> in Hes4-expressing HCT116 cells substantially decreased Flag-Hes4 coprecipitation from the nuclear protein lysates, while Myc-Twist1 expression remained constant, as determined by co-IP with antibodies to Flag or My <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4-supplemental figure 1B</xref>).</bold></p>
<p>We then investigated the impact of Hes4 expression on EMT induction by overexpressing Hes4 in HCT116 cells. Our results showed there were upregulation of ZO-1 and E-cadherin epithelial molecules, and downregulation of Twist1 protein (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>)</bold> and the <italic>vimentin</italic> mRNA <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4-supplemental figure 1C</xref>)</bold>. The vimentin protein appeared to be undetectable in HCT116, which was consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Roger et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, knocking down endogenous <italic>Hes4</italic> in LS174T cells using shRNAs targeting two <italic>Hes4</italic> domains caused the opposite effect <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>).</bold></p>
<p>To determine if BEST4 is downstream signal that relays Hes4 to regulate Twist1 expression and consequently EMT induction, we knocked down endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> with siRNAs in Hes4-expressing HCT116 and showed the corresponding downregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1, with upregulation of Twist1 protein and the <italic>vimentin</italic> mRNA, as analyzed by immunoblotting and qPCR <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Figure 4-supplemental figure 1D</xref></bold>). The opposite was true when BEST4 was overexpressed in LS174T <bold>(<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref></bold>). Therefore, these findings infer <italic>BEST4</italic>-mediated upstream <italic>Hes4</italic> to directly downregulate Twist1 and subsequently deter EMT in CRC.</p>
<p>Given the physiological role of <italic>BEST4</italic> plays in regulating chloride/calcium flux, we evaluated the channel functional effect on EMT induction. After respectively incubating <italic>BEST4</italic>-expresing HCT116 and the EV control with 300Î¼M DIDS (a broad blocker of chloride channel), or a gradient increase in doses of CaCCinh-A01 (a specific inhibitor of native calcium-activated chloride channels), or 1Î¼M ionomycin (a calcium ionophore to activate the chloride channel) as published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Uwada <italic>et al,</italic> 2019</xref>), we showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> significantly increased chloride/calcium fluxes and activated their exchanges and the expected inhibition by DIDS, CaCCinh-A01 or ionomycin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Fig. 4- supplementary figure 5A-5C</xref></bold>). Through immunoblotting analysis, we recapitulated that <italic>BEST4</italic> simultaneously upregulated both ZO-1 and E-cadherin, and downregulated Twist1. Essentially, the levels of these proteins remained constantly expressed when the cells were treated with DIDS or CaCCinh-A01 or ionomycin, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4_1">Fig. 4-supplementary figure 5D-5F</xref></bold>). Hence, these results suggest <italic>BEST4</italic> protein-mediated EMT suppression is independent of its channel function in HCT116.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In cancer cell cultures and mouse tumour xenografts, the present study shows that <italic>BEST4</italic> inhibits the development of CRC. An axis comprising <italic>Hes4/BEST4/</italic>Twist1 governs the induction of EMT in CRC. <italic>BEST4</italic> interacts with <italic>Hes4</italic> at the transcriptional and translational levels, and directly downregulates Twist1 expression, resulting in EMT inhibition but independent of its channel functions. Our findings support the notion in several ways: (1) <italic>Hes4</italic> binds to the promoter region of <italic>BEST4</italic>; (2) <italic>BEST4</italic> colocalizes with <italic>Hes4</italic> and Twist1 in the nucleus of cells, and protein-protein interactions; (3) the <italic>BEST4</italic> inhibitory role in EMT exhibits upregulation of epithelial ZO-1 and E-cadherin, and downregulation of mesenchymal vimentin and Twist1 in CRC; and finally (4) low <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA levels were significantly correlated with malignant lesions and worse outcomes of CRC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> in suppressing CRC progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>CaCCs are expressed widely in several types of epithelial and endothelial cells and are classified as calcium-dependent chloride channels (e.g., anoctamin-1 [ANO1 or TMEM16]), chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCAs), and members of the BEST family. The latter is a recent addition to the class of molecularly defined chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Calcium-dependent chloride channels and CLCAs are differentially expressed in CRC and normal colon tissues, exerting pro- or anti-growth effects, while little is known of BEST family in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sui <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). There are four subtypes of the <italic>BEST</italic> family in mammals that assemble as pentamers to form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and maintain cellular physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Marmorstein <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Milenkovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Tsunenari <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Subtypes of <italic>BEST1-3</italic> are responsible for vitelliform macular dystrophy, regulating the cilia of olfactory sensory neuronal activity; others regulate cGMP-dependent calcium-activated chloride conductance in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Matchkov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Pifferi et al., 2009</xref>). An intrinsic function of the <italic>BEST4</italic> gene in modulating CRC growth remains poorly illustrated. In the present study, we demonstrated that <italic>BEST4</italic> functionally inhibits the development of CRC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>BEST4</italic> is transcriptionally regulated and physically interacts with upstream <italic>Hes4</italic>, leading to downregulation of Twist1 and EMT suppression. This suppression is independent of physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels since inhibition of BEST4-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Cl<sup>-</sup> fluxes did not alter ZO-1/E-Cadherin and Twist1 protein expression.</p>
<p>The recent identification of a heterogeneous <italic>BEST4</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Hes4</italic><sup>+</sup> subgroup in a human colonic epithelial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) led us to consider their potential role in regulating CRC progression. Among the Hes family, which is associated with intestinal progenitor cells in adenoma transformation, <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes4</italic> are a paralog pair, with other members more distantly related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>). While <italic>Hes1</italic> has been reported to induce EMT and promote metastasis and chemoresistance in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">van Es et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Hes4</italic> is identified by our present study capable of combating EMT induction in a <italic>BEST4</italic>-dependent manner that is regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels.</p>
<p>The Twist1 transcriptional factor plays a crucial role in inducing EMT, which contributes to the malignant lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Its physical interaction with <italic>Hes4</italic> determines human bone marrow stromal/stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, represses the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 and induces several mesenchymal markers including vimentin, which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bulzico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nagai <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Vesuna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Despite Twist1 importance in CRC, little is known about how it is controlled during EMT induction. Our present study reveals that Twist1 colocalized and interacted with <italic>BEST4</italic> in the nucleus of CRC HCT116 cells, leading to downregulation of Twist1 and inhibition of EMT. <italic>Hes4</italic> also caused the same effect, but through intermediation with <italic>BEST4</italic>. Although the mechanistic insights of their interplay remain to be elucidated, the present study identifies the <italic>Hes4-BEST4</italic>-<italic>Twist1</italic> axis that contributes to counter EMT in the development of CRC <bold>(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Lastly, our analysis of correlations reveals the clinical significance of <italic>BEST4</italic> expression in CRC. In particular, the mRNA levels of <italic>BEST4</italic> were lower in tissues of both precancerous adenomatous lesions and CRC than ANTs. These alterations are significantly correlated with large tumour size, positive nodes, and poor overall survival, especially in male patients. Interestingly, a previous study conducted on a Chinese cohort reported an approximately 40% higher incidence of CRC in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). But it remains to be investigated whether sex hormone-related factors plays a role in the gender-specific downregulation of <italic>BEST4</italic> and its impact on CRC in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the functional significance of <italic>BEST4</italic> in CRC development and its interplay with other molecules is completely unknown. The present study demonstrates the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> in inhibiting CRC proliferation, migration, and invasion both in models of in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, <italic>BEST4</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Hes4</italic> for downregulating Twist1 and inhibits EMT in CRC. Therefore, we reveals a previously unknown mechanism of the <italic>Hes4-BEST4-Twist</italic> axis that restrains the progression of CRC.</p>

<title>Tumour and CRC hepatic metastasis mouse xenografts</title>
<p>Four-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were housed under standard conditions. The mice were randomized into two groups, with eight mice per group. HCT116 cells (5Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells in 0.1 mL phosphate-buffered saline) transduced with the lentivirus containing <italic>BEST4</italic> or EV were injected subcutaneously into the right dorsal flank of mice. Tumour growth was measured twice a week using callipers, and tumour volumes were calculated as length x width<sup>2</sup> x 0.5. Mice were sacrificed at 32 days, and tumour weight was measured at the end of the experiment. For further analysis, the excised tumour tissues were divided into two parts and embedded in paraffin or preserved at â80 Â°C for further analysis.</p>
<p>For the liver metastasis of CRC, intrasplenic injections of HCT-15 cells with BEST4-knockout (BEST4-gRNA), BEST4-rescued or control (EV-gRNA) (5Ã10<sup>6</sup> cells in 0.1 mL PBS) were performed into 6-week-old Balb/c nude mice as described previously<sup>2</sup>. There were 3 mice/group. Briefly, at day 28 after the procedure, mouse livers were paraffin embedded and the sections for H&amp;E staining. The numbers of the metastatic nodules on the livers were double-blind visually quantified and confirmed by a pathologist.</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of <italic>BEST4</italic></title>
<p><italic>BEST4</italic>-depleted HCT-15 cells were generated with CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology using a dual sgRNA approach. Two sequences that targeted exon 3 within the <italic>BEST4</italic> active fragment (5â- TGACTCTCGTGGTGAACCGC-3â and 5â-CCGAGATGACGCACATCAGC -3â) were inserted into the pU6-gRNA-Cas9-EGFP vector (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) to generate a CRISPR/Cas9 <italic>BEST4</italic> knockout plasmid. Excision of the targeted 44 bp genomic fragment resulted in splicing errors in exons 2 to 4 and generated a premature STOP codon that abrogated functional gene expression (<bold>Figures S1F and S1G</bold>). Cells were transfected with these plasmids, and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were FACS-sorted as single cells into 96-well plates. After culturing for three weeks, cells were distributed into two 24-well plates, and the appropriate deletion was verified by sequencing. Only cell lines with homozygous deletions were used. Three independent lines generated using this method were used for subsequent experiments and were named âHCT15 <italic>BEST4</italic>-gRNA.â Diminished expression of immunoreactive BEST4 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (<bold>Figure S1H</bold>).

<title>RNA isolation, cDNA library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). RNA samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) â¥7.0 and a 28S:18S ratio â¥ 1.5 were used in subsequent experiments. Sequencing libraries were generated and sequenced by CapitalBio Technology (Beijing, China). A total amount of 3 Î¼g RNA per sample was used. Briefly, the Ribo-Zeroâ¢ Magnetic Kit (Epicentre) was used to remove rRNA from the total RNA, and then the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) was used to construct the libraries for sequencing following the manufacturerâs instructions. The RNA was fragmented into pieces of â¼200 base pairs in length in NEBNext First-Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the RNA fragments using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers, and then the second-strand cDNA was synthesized in Second-Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer with dUTP Mix (10x). The end of the cDNA fragment was subjected to an end-repair process that included the addition of a single âAâ base followed by ligation of the adapters. Products were purified and enriched using PCR to amplify the library DNA. The final libraries were qualified using Agilent 2100 and quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, South Africa). Finally, the libraries were subjected to paired-end sequencing with a paired-end 150-base pair reading length on an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer (Illumina).</p>
<p>The sequencing quality of raw data in <italic>fastq</italic> format was assessed using FastQC, and then low-quality data were filtered using the Next Generation Sequencing Quality Control platform. The high-quality clean reads were then aligned to the reference genome using Tophat2 with default parameters. The genome of the human genome version of hg38 (UCSC) was used as the reference. Cufflinks and Cuffmerge software packages were used to assemble the transcripts. All subsequent comparative analyses of lncRNAs and mRNAs were based on the results of the transcripts. Transcripts corresponding to mRNAs or lncRNAs were collected from databases and treated as known lncRNAs and annotated based on information from public databases. The transcripts were treated as novel lncRNAs when their sequence length was &gt;200 and when they were predicted to be non-coding RNAs. Differential expression analyses were performed using the limma package and edgeR. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were performed using KOBAS 3.0. The target genes of the mRNAs were predicted based on cis- and trans-patterns based on the location on the reference genome and sequence similarity.

<p>The findings of this <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript advance our understanding of the significance of Bestrophin isoform 4 (BEST4) in suppressing colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. The authors used appropriate and validated methodology, such as the knockout of BEST4 using CRISPR/Cas9 in CRC cells, to provide a <bold>solid</bold> foundation for elucidating the potential link between BEST4 and CRC progression.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors describe the participation of the Hes4-BEST4-Twist axis in controlling the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the advancement of colorectal cancers (CRC). They assert that this axis diminishes the EMT capabilities of CRC cells through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Additionally, they propose that reduced BEST4 expression within tumor cells might serve as an indicator of an adverse prognosis for individuals with CRC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>â¢ Exploring the correlation between the Hes4-BEST4-Twist axis, EMT, and the advancement of CRC is a novel perspective and gives readers a fresh standpoint.</p>
<p>
â¢ The whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) showing low expression of BEST4 in CRC samples will be of broad interest to cancer specialists as well as cell biologists although further corroborative data is essential to strengthen these findings (See Weaknesses).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ The authors employed three kinds of CRC cell lines, but not untransformed cells such as intestinal epithelial organoids which are commonly used in recent research.</p>
<p>
â¢ The authors use three different human CRC cell lines with a lack of consistency in the selection of them. Please clarify 1) how these lines are different from each other, 2) why they pick up one or two of them for each experiment. To be more convincing, at least two lines should be employed for each in vitro experiment.</p>
<p>
â¢ The authors demonstrated associations between BEST4 and cell proliferation/viability as well as migration/invasion, utilizing CRC cell lines, but it should be noted that these findings do not indicate a tumor-suppressive role of BEST4 as mentioned in line 120. Furthermore, while the authors propose that &quot;BEST4 functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC&quot; in line 50, there seems no supporting data to suggest BEST4 as a tumor suppressor gene.</p>
<p>
â¢ The HES4-BEST4-Twist1 axis likely plays a significant role in CRC progression via EMT but not CRC initiation. Some sentences could lead to a misunderstanding that the axis is important for CRC initiation.</p>
<p>
â¢ The authors mostly focus on the relationship of the HES4-BEST4-Twist1 axis with EMT, but their claims sometimes appear to deviate from this focus.</p>
<p>
â¢ Some experiments do not appear to have a direct relevance to their claims. For example, the analysis using the xenograft model in Figure 2E-J is not optimal for analyzing EMT. The authors should analyze metastatic or invasive properties of the transplanted tumors if they intend to provide some supporting evidence for their claims.</p>
<p>
â¢ In Figure 4H, ZO-1 and E-cad expression looks unchanged in the BEST4 KD.</p>
<p>
â¢ The in vivo and in vitro data supporting the whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) is mostly insufficient. Including the following experiments will substantiate their claims: 1) BEST4 and HES4 immunostaining of human surgical tissue samples, 2) qPCR data of HES4, Twist1, Vimentin, etc. as shown in Figure 5C, 5D.</p>
<p>
â¢ Some statements are inconsistent probably due to grammatical errors. (For example, some High/low may be reversed in lines 234-244.)</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, the authors first demonstrate that BEST4 inhibits intestinal tumor cell growth and reduces their metastatic potential, possibly via downstream regulation of TWIST1.</p>
<p>They further show that HES4 positively upregulates BEST4 expression, with direct interaction with BEST4 promoter region and protein. The authors further expand on this with results showing that negative regulation of TWIST1 by HES4 requires BEST4 protein, with BEST4 required for TWIST1 association with HES4. Reduction of BEST1 expression was shown in CRC tumor samples, with correlation of BEST4 mRNA levels with different clinicopathological factors such as sex, tumor stage, and lymph node metastasis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role of BEST4 for intestinal cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>â¢ Good quality western blot data.</p>
<p>
â¢ Multiple approaches were used to validate the findings.</p>
<p>
â¢ Logical experimental progression for readability.</p>
<p>
â¢ Human patient data / In vivo murine model / Multiple cell lines were used, which supports translatability / reproducibility of findings.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>â¢ Interpretation of figures and data (unsubstantiated conclusions).</p>
<p>
â¢ Figure quality.</p>
<p>
â¢ Figure legends lack information.</p>
<p>
â¢ Lacking/shallow discussion.</p>
<p>
â¢ Requires more information for reproducibility regarding materials and methods.</p>
