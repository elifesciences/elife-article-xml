<title>Abstract</title><p>In nature, insects face immense predation pressure, where visual cues play a vital role in predators locating them. To counter this threat, insects employ a variety of nano- and microstructures on their cuticular layer to manipulate and interact with light, enhancing anti-reflective properties and providing camouflage or reducing detectability by predators. Leafhoppers have a unique extra-cuticular coating called brochosome, yet its anti-reflective functions and protein composition remain unclear. Our study demonstrates strong anti-reflective properties of brochosomes, effectively reducing reflectance on the cuticle surface, especially in the ultraviolet spectrum, to improve evasion from visual predators. Furthermore, we identify four novel structural proteins of the brochosome (BSM) for the first time. Inhibiting their synthesis by RNAi alters brochosome morphology, impacting the optical properties of the cuticle surface. Evolutionary origin analysis of BSM suggests that brochosomes likely originated from a process involving duplication–divergence. Our study reveals that leafhoppers employ a unique camouflage strategy by secreting brochosomes as anti-reflection nano-coatings, enabling them to evade natural predators and contributing to their evolutionary success.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Predation exerts significant selective pressure on the evolution of various species, driving the development of anti-predator strategies across the animal kingdom(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Stevens &amp; Ruxton, 2018</xref>). Camouflage is a widely employed strategy, allowing animals to blend into their surroundings by adjusting their coloration and patterns to reduce detection by visual predators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hughes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Skelhorn &amp; Rowe, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the presence of predators with multispectral vision, capable of perceiving non-visible light spectra like infrared and ultraviolet, can compromise traditional color and pattern-based camouflage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Galloway et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Jones et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Stevens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Thery &amp; Gomez, 2010</xref>), paralleling the challenges of military camouflage under non-visible light(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Xi et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, achieving alignment between an animal’s surface optical characteristics and its surroundings becomes a crucial requirement in visual camouflage strategies.</p>
<p>Insects, one of the most diverse animal groups on earth, contend with intense predation pressure(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cinel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sheikh et al., 2017</xref>). Many of their predators, including birds, reptiles, and predatory arthropods, rely on visual cues, with some possessing highly developed ultraviolet (UV) vision, where UV light plays a critical role in locating insect prey(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lim &amp; Ben-Yakir, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Stobbe et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the natural backgrounds where insects reside, such as leaves, tree bark, and soil, exhibit minimal light reflection(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Endler, 1997</xref>). Consequently, light reflections originating from an insect’s body significantly elevate its risk of exposure to predators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tovee, 1995</xref>). To counter this challenge, the various nano- and microstructural features of the insect cuticle have excellent antireflective properties that affect insect body coloration, reduce surface light reflection and aid camouflage(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vukusic &amp; Sambles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). The first instances of anti-reflective structures were observed in the compound eyes of moths, characterized their corneas are covered by hexagonally arranged protrusions measuring approximately 200 nanometers apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bernhard, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequent research has revealed that anti-reflective structures are widespread on insect body surfaces, primarily found on compound eyes and wings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chotard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Monteiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stavenga et al., 2005</xref>). These nano- and micro-structures on the cuticular layer are believed to possess anti-reflective properties, effectively minimizing light reflections from their bodies and thus preventing detection by predators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chotard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Monteiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stavenga et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), one of the largest insect families with over 22,000 species, possess unique extra-cuticular coating known as brochosome. Brochosomes, typically hollow, honeycomb-like spheres with a diameter ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 micrometers, are synthesized in the Malpighian tubules, secreted through the hindgut, and applied as a coating on the fresh cuticle following molting(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Rakitov, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). Brochosomes primarily comprise lipids and proteins, with protein content ranging from 45% to 75%, and the exact proteins responsible for brochosome formation remain unknown(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Some have proposed that brochosomes may serve as a protective layer on the leafhopper’s cuticle surface, with a potential role in enhancing the hydrophobicity of their cuticle surface, providing defense against pathogens and predators(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rakitov &amp; Gorb, 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, despite the known function of hydrophobicity and the shedding of brochosomes in helping leafhopper escape spider webs, there is currently no definitive biological evidence supporting other hypothesized functions of brochosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rakitov &amp; Gorb, 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">2013b</xref>). Recent studies have explored bio-inspired materials mimicking the structure of brochosomes have shown outstanding antireflection properties in recent studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). While these artificial materials do not perfectly replicate the intricate structure of brochosomes, they offer valuable insights, indicating that leafhoppers may use a unique strategy, setting them apart from other insects, to achieve anti-reflection properties on their surfaces. Therefore, we hypothesize that brochosomes could potentially serve as a camouflage coating on the leafhopper’s cuticle surface, helping it reduce surface optical reflections and stay hidden to avoid detection by visual predators, ultimately escaping from predation.</p>
<p>In this study, we combined spectrophotometry, electron microscopy, transcriptome analysis, proteome analysis, gene function validation, and leafhopper and jumping spider bioassays to characterize the protein composition and the function of brochosome in leafhopper camouflage. We focused our research on the rice green leafhopper, <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic>, a well-known agricultural pest with an extensive research history(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Hibino, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Wei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yan et al., 2021</xref>). Our results revealed the pronounced effectiveness of brochosome coverage in reducing light reflection on leafhoppers <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, especially within the scope of the ultraviolet spectrum. By conducting RNAi experiments, we successfully identified four structural proteins of brochosome for the first time. The suppression of their synthesis induced changes in brochosome morphology, influencing the optical characteristics of the leafhopper’s cuticle surface. Furthermore, our analysis of the evolutionary origin of brochosomes indicates that they likely originated through a process involving duplication–divergence. Our findings support brochosomes as a unique camouflage coating that enables leafhoppers to evade visual predators.</p>

<p>Brochosomes are a distinctive coating on the cuticle surface of leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.</p>
<p>The cuticle surface of rice green leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> is coated with brochosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">B</xref>), which are approximately 350nm in diameter and featuring a hollow sphere with a honeycomb-like structure (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>). The leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> possesses two pairs of Malpighian tubules, each consisting of proximal segment, distal segment, and terminal segment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). Brochosomes are synthesized in the distal segment of the Malpighian tubule, which exhibits a swollen and rod-shaped appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The epithelial cells in this segment contain large spherical nuclei, an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum, and multiple Golgi regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">F</xref>). Within the Golgi-derived vacuole, the brochosomes undergo progressive development, transforming their initially spherical granules into a honeycomb-like surface with closely spaced invaginations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G-I</xref>). Mature brochosomes are stored in secretory vacuoles at the boundaries of the cells and are subsequently secreted into the lumen of the Malpighian tubules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>The optical properties of the leafhopper’s cuticle surface are intricately connected to the brochosome coating</title>
<p>To investigate the interplay between brochosome coverage and the optical features of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> cuticle surface, we observed the relationship for male and female adults at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days post-eclosion. <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> exhibited a gradual shift in body color with increasing eclosion time, manifesting clear distinctions between males and females (Figure 2A-figure supplement 1A and B). Males transformed from light green to dark green, while females progressively transitioned from light green to translucent, displaying an iridescence (Figure 2A-figure supplement 1A and B). Furthermore, the brightness of the leafhopper cuticle surface under UV light intensified with the extension of post-eclosion time, and the UV reflectance of female cuticle surface was significantly higher than that of males after 15 days post-eclosion (Figure 2B-figure supplement 1A and B).</p>
<p>To validate the correlation between brochosome coverage, body color, and UV light reflectance, we examined the distribution of brochosomes on the cuticle surface of male and female <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at various post-eclosion intervals using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM results unveiled a gradual reduction in brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of both genders as post-eclosion time progressed. Specifically, male coverage decreased from 90% to approximately 40%, whereas female coverage descended from 90% to around 10% (Figure 2C-figure supplement 1A-C). Microscopic analyses of the Malpighian tubule revealed that, with prolonged post-eclosion time, the distal segment of the tubule underwent gradual atrophy, particularly pronounced at 15 days post-eclosion. Notably, females exhibited a more marked atrophy in the distal segment compared to males. By 25 days post-eclosion, the distal segment of the Malpighian tubule in females became indistinguishable from other segments (Figure 2D-figure supplement 1A and B). This denotes a progressive reduction in post-eclosion brochosome synthesis, resulting in a corresponding decrease in brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface. Furthermore, the distribution of brochosomes on the leafhopper cuticle surface may be correlated with its optical characteristics. To substantiate this hypothesis, we analyzed the light reflection characteristics of leafhopper forewings at various post-eclosion time points. The findings revealed a positive correlation between brochosome coverage on the forewings and light reflection values, underscoring the remarkable anti-reflective attributes of the brochosome coating on leafhopper cuticle surface (Figure 2E-figure supplement 1D and E). The brochosome coating efficiently diminishes the reflectance of UV and visible light on the cuticle surface of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.</p>

<title>Preferential capture of leafhoppers with fewer brochosomes by jumping spiders</title>
<p>Given that UV light serves as a crucial visual cue for arthropod predators, especially common visual hunters like jumping spiders(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cronin &amp; Bok, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morehouse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Silberglied, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zou et al., 2011</xref>), the brochosome coating on leafhoppers’ cuticle surface significantly reduces UV light reflectance. This prompted us to investigate the effect of brochosome coatings on reducing predation risk in leafhoppers. Predation experiments were conducted using <italic>Plexippus paykulli</italic> (Figure 2F-figure supplement 2), a common jumping spider in rice fields known to prey on leafhoppers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Predation rates and times were scrutinized as parameters to assess predation efficiency(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Walker &amp; Rypstra, 2002</xref>). In the experimental group comprising females and males at 5 days post-eclosion, <italic>P. paykulli</italic> did not exhibit a clear predation preference (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). However, in the experimental group involving females and males at 25 days post-eclosion, there was a higher probability of predation on female <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> compare to male ones (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>). For male <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> in both the 5-day and 25-day post-eclosion experimental groups, <italic>P. paykulli</italic> showed a stronger inclination towards preying on individuals that were eclosed for 25 days, resulting in significantly shorter predation times compared to those at 5 days post-eclosion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2I</xref>). These patterns were consistently observed for female leafhoppers in both the 5-days and 25-days post-eclosion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2J</xref>). The cumulative findings strongly suggest a distinct preference of the jumping spider <italic>P. paykulli</italic> for individuals with lower brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface. Based on these experiments, we proposed a hypothesis that the brochosome coating on the leafhopper cuticle surface may mitigate predation risk by reducing surface light reflection, particularly in the UV spectrum.</p>

<title>Identifying the major structural proteins of brochosomes</title>

Recent suggested that they are primarily composed of brochosomins (BSM) and brochosome-associated proteins (BSAP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>). BSM, a novel class of secreted proteins with molecular weights ranging from 21 to 40 kDa, is considered as the major structural component of brochosomes(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>). However, there remains uncertainty regarding the specific proteins implicated in brochosome formation.</p>
<p>To further elucidate the essential protein component of brochosome and the relationship between the brochosome coating and optical properties of leafhopper’s cuticle surface, transcriptomic and proteomic data derived from brochosome of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were comprehensively analyzed. Based on our prior integrated analysis of the brochosome transcriptome and proteome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wu et al., 2023</xref>), in conjunction with literature search results, we selected 50 candidate genes for functional analysis using RNAi-mediated gene silencing. Through RNAi experiments, we successfully identified four genes encoding brochosome structural proteins that led to significant morphological changes in brochosomes (Figure 3A-figure supplement 3). According to the coding sequence (CDS) length of these genes, the four proteins were names as BSM-1 to BSM-4 (GenBank accession number PP273097, PP273098, PP273099, PP273100) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Comparative analysis with previous reported brochosome proteins indicated that BSM2 and BSM3 may form a pair of paralogous genes based on their highly conserved protein sequences (figure supplement 4A and C); although BSM2 and BSM3 show lower sequence homology, their structural similarities is notably high (figure supplement 4B). In contrast, BSM-1 and BSM-4 lack homologous genes within the other reported leafhopper brochosome protein repertoire. Results of RT-qPCR showed that microinjection of dsRNA effectively suppressed the expression of these four BSM-coding genes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-F</xref>). SEM observations also indicated that the inhibition of these four BSM-coding genes individually led to a reduction in brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (figure supplement 3). Specifically, knockdown of these genes resulted in significant morphological changes in the brochosome, characterized by an increase in the diameter of certain brochosomes and deformation of the honeycomb-like structures on the surface (Figure 3A-figure supplement 3). In addition, investigation of temporal and spatial expression patterns showed that all the four BSM-coding genes were specifically expressed in the Malpighian tubules (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-J</xref>) and exhibited relatively stable expression during the early post-eclosion period, followed by a gradual decrease after 10 days (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K-N</xref>). By 25 days post-eclosion, the expression of BSM-coding genes declined to around 10% in females and 30-40% in males, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K-N</xref>). This phenomenon is consistent with our initial microscopic observations, suggesting that the gradual reduction in brochosome synthesis contributing primarily to the decrease of brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> after adulthood.</p>

<title>Brochosome coating diminishes light reflection and facilitates predator avoidance</title>
<p>To further investigate the function of brochosomes in leafhopper cuticle surface associated with light reflection and predator avoidance, we implemented RNAi to simultaneously suppress the expression of all four BSM-coding genes with ds<italic>BSM</italic> mixture injection. RT-qPCR results demonstrated a substantial downregulation in the expression of these genes compared to the ds<italic>GFP</italic> control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<title>Brochosomes as a camouflage coating for the leafhoppers in the family Cicadellidae</title>
<p>Based on the forementioned findings, brochosomes of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> can be considered as an anti-reflective stealth coating against visual recognition by the predator <italic>P. paykulli</italic>. However, it remains unknown whether brochosomes also serve as a stealth coating in other leafhopper species. Therefore, we extended our investigation to include additional leafhopper species in the family Cicadellidae, including <italic>Recilia dorsalis</italic>, <italic>Empoasca onukii</italic>, and <italic>Psammotettix alienus</italic>. We carefully removed the brochosomes from the forewings of these leafhopper species using acetone, and found a significant enhancement in UV reflectance on the forewings of the leafhoppers (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">B</xref>). In addition to <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, we observed a considerably higher brightness of acetone-treated forewings compared to the untreated ones under UV light for <italic>R. dorsalis</italic>, <italic>E. onukii</italic>, and <italic>P. alienus</italic> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This result suggests that brochosomes as an anti-reflective stealth coating may be commonly existed in various species of the family Cicadellidae.</p>

<p>Previous research indicated that brochosome as a unique secretion in Cicadellidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rakitov &amp; Gorb, 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate the conservation of genes linked to brochosome synthesis in Cicadellidae, we systematically screened these four BSM coding genes across 116 other hemipteran insect species (Supplementary Table 2). Results of homology alignment reveal that BSM coding genes exhibit marked orphan gene characteristics, with homologous genes exclusively present in Membracoidea. However, there are variations in the species distribution of different BSM coding genes. In Membracoidea species, homologous genes for BSM3 and 4 are observed, while BSM2 is identified in Cicadellidae insects, and BSM1 exclusively in Deltocephalinae insects (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Furthermore, the degree of homology of all BSM genes is positively correlated with taxonomic classification. An intriguing observation is that in the majority of Cicadellidae species with confirmed brochosome distribution, homologous gene distribution for BSM2 is detectable. In Cicadellidae species without brochosome distribution and in the majority of Membracidae, BSM2 genes are largely absent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>). Since Membracidae evolved from Cicadellidae, we hypothesize that BSM homologous gene duplication/loss may be a key factor in brochosome formation/loss. In conclusion, our data suggest that in Cicadellidae, brochosome is synthesized by a conserved group of BSM coding genes, making it a widely distributed anti-reflective camouflage coating in Cicadellidae.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Leafhoppers exhibit a distinctive grooming behavior, resulting in the deposition of a unique extra-cuticular coating known as brochosome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). However, the precise characteristics and exact adaptive significance of this specialized coating remain largely unknown. Although they are widely believed to confer hydrophobicity, protecting leafhoppers from water and their own excreta(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rakitov &amp; Gorb, 2013a</xref>), similar functionalities are attributed to cuticular waxes on the external surfaces of various insects, including leafhoppers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Andersen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bello et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, the functionalities of brochosomes may extend beyond this conventional understanding. In this study, we demonstrated that brochosomes exhibit robust anti-reflective properties, markedly decreasing the reflectance of the leafhopper cuticle surface, particularly in the ultraviolet spectral range. This substantial reduction is visibility to visual predators, contributing to the evasion and predation avoidance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Vukusic &amp; Sambles, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, brochosomes function as a natural camouflage coating on the leafhopper cuticle surface, playing a pivotal role in reducing leafhoppers’ visibility to visual predators and offering a distinct advantage for their survival in predation scenarios as illustrated in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The present work has elucidated the function of brochosome as a natural anti-reflective camouflage coating on leafhoppers’ extra-cuticular, with its coverage directly influencing the anti-reflective properties of the cuticle surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-E</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A-G</xref>). Previous studies suggested that arthropods employ various nanostructures formed by proteins, lipids, wax, or adhesive substances on their cuticle surfaces to achieve anti-reflectivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Silberglied, 1979</xref>). These nanostructures, initially identified in the compound eyes of moths, have been subsequently found to be widely distributed on the cuticle surfaces of insects(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bernhard, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Blagodatski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chotard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Ho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Monteiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Stavenga et al., 2005</xref>). The nano- and microstructures on insect cuticle surfaces generate a gradual change in refractive index near the surface, leading to antireflectivity(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raut et al., 2011</xref>). The degree of reflection reduction depends on the shape of these nanostructures, studies in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have confirmed that modifying the morphology of nanostructures in compound eyes directly impacts their optical performance(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Kryuchkov et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, a thorough examination of the structural protein composition of brochosome, coupled with RNAi-mediated suppression of BSM coding gene expression, yielded brochosomes with regular structure (ds<italic>GFP</italic> treatment) and structurally abnormal brochosomes (ds<italic>BSM</italic> treatment) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-E</xref>). Subsequent in vitro experiments provided further evidence of the correlation between the normal structure of brochosome and its anti-reflective performance (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">K</xref>). This correlation is likely attributed to the fact that the diameter of the hollow pits in brochosome structure (approximately 100nm) is considerably smaller than most spectral wavelengths(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Burks et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Rakitov, 2009</xref>). As light passes through these small pits, it undergoes diffraction, while light passing through the ridges of brochosome induces scattering. The interference of diffracted and scattered light between different pits and ridges contributes to the observed extinction features in brochosome(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raut et al., 2011</xref>). Biomimetic material and mathematical modeling analyses have clarified the relationship between the extinction features of brochosome and the spacing between hollow pits(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Banerjee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the regular morphology of brochosome is a robust guarantee for its excellent anti-reflective performance.</p>
<p>Moreover, we noticed a distinct contrast in the anti-reflective capabilities when applying brochosomes with regular and irregular structures onto different substrates (quartz glass and brown planthopper wings), especially in the UV region (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">K</xref>). This indicates that the reduction in reflected light is not only related to the structure of brochosome but also to other factors. SEM observations revealed that some brochosome is embedded in the grooves of the leafhopper cuticle surface or brown planthopper wings, which is not observed on the smooth surface of quartz glass (Figure 4B-figure supplement 6). When the wavelength of light is higher than the size of the structure and the surface has a gradient refractive index, light interacts entirely with the rough surface, causing the light to gradually bend(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Raut et al., 2011</xref>). Combined with the complex structure formed by brochosomes and nanostructures on the cuticle surface, this result in multiple internal reflections of light within these structures, increasing light absorption and significantly enhancing anti-reflective performance. Furthermore, the aromatic ring structures, conjugated double bonds, and peptide bonds in the proteins of both the cuticle and brochosomes may contribute to the absorption of ultraviolet light, providing another potential reason for their excellent anti-reflective capabilities in the ultraviolet spectral region. Therefore, the outstanding anti-reflective performance of brochosome on the insect cuticle surface might be a result of the combined effect of brochosome and cuticular nanostructures.</p>
<p>UV light serves as a crucial visual cue for various insect predators, enhancing foraging, navigation, mating behavior, and prey identification(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Cronin &amp; Bok, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morehouse et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Silberglied, 1979</xref>), while the reflection of ultraviolet light from the insect cuticle surface increases the risk of predation by disrupting camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tovee, 1995</xref>) . In this study, we utilized the jumping spider <italic>P. paykulli</italic> to explore the impact of the brochosome coating on the leafhopper’s camouflage against predation. Hunting spiders, such as jumping spiders and wolf spiders, are primary predators of leafhoppers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Oraze &amp; Grigarick, 1989</xref>) and the wavelength of UV light plays a crucial role as a visual cue for jumping spiders in identifying and locating their prey compare to the other wavelengths(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Li &amp; Lim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Zou et al., 2011</xref>). Our results revealed that <italic>P. paykulli</italic> displayed a preference for preying on <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> with a lower brochosome coverage on their cuticle surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-J</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H-I</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that the combination of brochosome and leafhopper cuticular microstructures exhibits superior anti-reflective performance in the UV region, effectively reducing UV reflection from leafhopper bodies and consequently diminishing the predator’s ability to identify them. Additionally, spectral measurement data indicated that the wing reflection spectrum of the brown planthopper (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4J</xref>) closely resembled the body spectrum of 25-day-old female <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). It is possible that, in the same living environment, other Hemipteran insects would be more conspicuous to visual predators than leafhoppers. Brochosome coating could provide an advantage for leafhoppers to evade visual predators, thereby enhancing their survival rates in interspecific competition. This adaptation could potentially favor the survival of Cicadellidae in environments with high predation pressure, allowing them to thrive in a wider range of environments. Additionally, within the leafhopper population, the brochosome coverage on the cuticle surface of older individuals was notably lower than that of younger individuals, making elderly leafhoppers more susceptible to be detected and captured by predators (Figure 2F-I-figure supplement 1). This may contribute to eliminating elderly and weaker individuals in the leafhopper population, conserving food resources, and protecting the entire population. Therefore, we consider brochosome, as a form of anti-reflective camouflage coating on the leafhopper’s cuticle surface, represents a more advanced evolutionary strategy against visual predation. It not only provides a significant advantage in terms of camouflage and evasion from visual predators but also plays a crucial role in inter-species competition and stably maintenance of the insect population, highlighting its importance in the survival and evolution of leafhoppers.</p>
<p>In addition, we successfully identified four proteins essential for the structure of brochosomes for the first time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). These BSM-encoded genes exhibit typical orphan gene characteristics, consisting with previous findings(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). Orphan genes originating from processes like de novo evolution, horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and duplication–divergence(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Light et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tautz &amp; Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>). To elucidate the evolutionary origin of the four identified BSM genes, we aligned them with all prokaryotic genomes in NCBI and approximately 1000 arthropod genomes. Interestingly, the homologous genes of these BSM genes were exclusively found in leafhopper genomes in the family Cicadellidae, suggesting that the origin of these BSM genes might not because of the de novo evolution or horizontal gene transfer. Combining the species distribution of the four identified BSM genes (as well as their homology) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>), we hypothesize that the BSMs were potentially originated from a process involving duplication– divergence. In this scenario, a new gene would be created through gene duplication or transposition, undergoing fast adaptive evolution and losing similarity to the original gene(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Light et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Tautz &amp; Domazet-Lošo, 2011</xref>). For Membracoidea insects, the majority insects in the family Cicadellidae (leafhoppers) can secrete brochosomes, while many Membracidae (treehoppers) insects exhibit grooming behavior without observable distinct setae on the cuticle surface(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Rakitov, 1996</xref>). Considering that Membracidae are derived from Cicadellidae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Dietrich et al., 2001</xref>), the formation of the symbiotic relationship between treehoppers and ants might due to the loss of brochosome synthesis capability. Ants create a protective environment around treehoppers, deterring threats and reducing predation pressure, providing a relatively secure living environment, leading to lower predation pressure compared to leafhoppers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Del-Claro &amp; Oliveira, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Nelson &amp; Mooney, 2022</xref>). Consequently, the need for the protective disguise represented by brochosomes is likely diminished. We speculate that environmental changes serve as one of the major driving forces in the evolution of brochosomes. Moreover, the distribution of paralogous genes BSM2 and BSM3 in Membracoidea (Figure 5C-figure supplement 4C) suggests that gene duplication/loss may be a primary factor causing the difference in brochosome synthesis capability between the insects of the families Cicadellidae and Membracidae. In eukaryotes, gene duplication/loss is a common mechanism for generating/losing gene functions, and this process promotes protein diversity and functional redundancy through the production of multiple homologous genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wong &amp; Belov, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we propose that gene duplication may be a significant factor contributing to the formation and morphological/functional diversity of brochosomes in leafhoppers.</p>
<p>In summary, our exploration has underscored the indispensable role of brochosomes as a vital anti-reflective camouflage coating in leafhoppers, granting them a significant edge in eluding visual predators. The identification of the four BSM encoding genes, a groundbreaking revelation in brochosome research, points towards the likely involvement of gene duplication in the formation of these adaptive structures. Our study not only deepens our understanding of leafhoppers’ anti-predator tactics but also illuminates the distinct evolutionary trajectories utilized by these insects within their ecological niche, thus contributing to the development of biomimicry and the advancement of state-of-the-art camouflage technologies.</p>

<p>The leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> and <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> adults were collected from a rice field in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, China in September 2020. <italic>P. alienus</italic> adults were collected from a wheat field in Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China in May 2020. <italic>E. onukii</italic> adult were collected from a tea-garden in Fuzhou, Fijian province, China in May 2020. The identity of the leafhopper species was confirmed using stereomicroscopy and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) sequence analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Collected leafhopper <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> and <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> are maintained in insect-proof greenhouses at 26 ± 1°C under a 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod and 50 ± 5% relative humidity on rice variety TaiChung Native 1(TN1).</p>
<p>The jumping spider <italic>P. paykulli</italic> were collected from a rice field in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China. Species identification was confirmed by assessing its morphological characteristics using stereomicroscopy and CO1 sequence analysis (Supplementary Table 1). Jumping spiders were fed about their own mass of leafhoppers <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> three times each week and examined 14-52 days following collection, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>).</p>

<title>Electron microscopy</title>
<p>The Malpighian tubules of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were dissected using an astereomicroscope, serially fixed overnight at 4°C with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L PBS, and post-fixed for 2 hours at room temperature with 1% OsO4. Following that, samples were dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, and 95%), then permeabilized with 100% ethanol and 100% acetone, followed by a series of epoxies in acetone (50%, 75%, and 100%). The pierced tissue was then immersed in epoxy resin and baked for more than 24 hours at 70°C. Ultrathin slices were cut and stained with uranyl acetate for 15 minutes and lead citrate for 5 minutes, and examined by Hitachi H7800 microscope (Hitachi, Japan).</p>
<p>Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphology of leafhopper brochosomes. Samples were prepared as previously described(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rakitov &amp; Gorb, 2013a</xref>). Leafhopper forewings were obtained by dissection under the stereomicroscope and glued onto SEM metal stubs with a double-sided carbon tape. The dried samples were coated with gold for 1 min in a MC1000 Ion Sputter Coater (Hitachi, Japan) and viewed by a HITACHI Regulus 8100 SEM (Hitachi, Japan).</p>

<title>Spider predation experiment</title>
<p>Jumping spiders were starved for three days prior to the predation experiment to ensure that participating spiders were hungry enough to attack leafhoppers in our predation preference tests, but not so hungry that they would attack the first prey they encountered (without being choosy)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Taylor et al., 2014</xref>). For the jumping spiders to prey on, we placed two leafhoppers in a 9 cm diameter test arena (the bottom of the dish was covered with filter paper). Before starting the test, the spiders were placed in the arena for 15 minutes to adapt, and then they were released and permitted to prey on the leafhoppers. We directly observed the feeding process of the jumping spiders and recorded when the spiders attacked the first leafhopper and which leafhopper they preyed on. The predation finishes when the first leafhopper is attacked or when the jumping spider does not attack any leafhopper within 5 minutes. Each pair of jumping spider predation tests were independently replicated more than 60 times.</p>

<title>The distribution of cuticle surface brochosomes and the optical properties of male and female insects at various periods post-eclosion</title>
<p>To investigate the distribution of brochosomes on the cuticle surface of adult <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at various post-eclosion periods, we first collected female and male adult leafhoppers at 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-days post-eclosion and dissected the forewings under a Nikon SMZ25 microscope (Nikon, Japan). The forewings were gold-sprayed and examined using HITACHI Regulus 8100 SEM (Hitachi, Japan). At each time point, 30 samples were randomly selected for SEM imaging. A 10 μm × 10 μm area within the SEM images was used to assess brochosome coverage, and ImageJ was employed for analysis(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Since brochosomes are synthesized at the distal section of the Malpighian tubule and the morphology of the Malpighian tubule in leafhoppers can also reflect brochosomes synthesis, we used Nikon SMZ25 microscope (Nikon, Japan) to examine the morphology of the Malpighian tubule in female and male adult leafhoppers at 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-days post-eclosion.</p>
<p>To examine the optical properties of male and female insects at various periods post-eclosion, we first collected female and male adult leafhoppers at 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-days post-eclosion, freeze-killed them and placed them under white or UV light for observation through a Nikon SMZ25 microscope (Nikon, Japan). Following that, the forewings of the leafhoppers were meticulously dissected, and the specular reflectance spectra of the forewings (25 × 25 μm) were precisely measured utilizing a 20/30 PV UV-Vis-NIR microspectrophotometer (CRAIC Technologies Inc., USA). UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra (250 to 1000 nm) were obtained using a 10× UV-absorbing glass objective lens, with a minimum of five replicates per sample.</p>

<title>Identification of brochosome structural protein-coding genes</title>
<p>Candidate brochosome structural protein-coding genes were identified through a combined analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. To knock down the expression of these candidates, RNAi was conducted by microinjecting double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) into the abdomens of fifth instar nymphs. The dsRNAs targeting 500-1000 bp regions of Malpighian tubule-specific expression genes or GFP were synthesized in vitro using the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System (Promega, USA). The 50 fifth instar nymphs of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were microinjected with 30 nl dsRNA (0.5 μg μl<sup>-1</sup>) using the Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond, USA). Thereafter, they were transferred to healthy rice seedlings for recovery. Forewings of treated leafhoppers were collected 7 days after microinjection (about 4-5 days post-eclosion), sprayed with gold, and analyzed by HITACHI Regulus 8100 SEM (Hitachi, Japan). Screening identified four brochosome structural protein-coding genes, and inhibiting their expression resulted in significant changes in brochosome morphology. The full-length sequence of these genes was obtained using by 5’-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3’-RACE using SMARTer RACE 5’/3’ Kit (Clontech, USA).</p>
<p>To analyze the temporal expression profiles of four brochosome structural protein-coding genes (GenBank accession number PP273097, PP273098, PP273099, PP273100), the whole body, salivary gland, midgut, ovary, and testis were dissected from 200 adult insects, total RNA in different tissue were extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The relative expression of these genes in different tissues of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> adults was detected by RT-qPCR assay using a QuantStudio<sup>TM</sup> 5 Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The detected transcript levels were normalized to the transcript level of the housekeeping gene elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1α) (GenBank accession number AB836665) and estimated by the 2−△△Ct (cycle threshold) method. Using the same procedure, the expression levels of these brochosome structural protein-coding genes were evaluated in female and male adult leafhoppers at 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, and 25-days post-eclosion.</p>

<title>Knocking down in vivo expression of BSM-coding genes in <italic>N. cincticeps</italic></title>
<p>Following the prior procedure, dsRNA produced from four BSM-coding genes was injected into the abdomen of fifth instar nymphs of <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> by microinjection, and a control group injected with ds<italic>GFP</italic> was established. Seven days after injection, the forewings and Malpighian tubules of the ds<italic>BSM</italic> and ds<italic>GFP</italic> treated leafhoppers were dissected, and the morphology of brochosomes on the cuticle surface of leafhoppers and the synthesis of brochosomes in Malpighian tubules were examined by SEM and TEM, respectively. To examine the optical properties, the ds<italic>BSM</italic> and ds<italic>GFP</italic> treated leafhoppers, freeze-killed them and placed them under white or UV light for observation through a Nikon SMZ25 microscope (Nikon, Japan). Subsequently, the forewings of the leafhoppers were meticulously dissected, and the specular reflectance spectra of the forewings (25 × 25 μm) were precisely measured utilizing a 20/30 PV UV-Vis-NIR microspectrophotometer (CRAIC Technologies Inc., USA). UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra (250 to 1000 nm) were obtained using a 10× UV-absorbing glass objective lens, with a minimum of five replicates per sample. Finally, the predation preference of the jumping spiders on the ds<italic>BSM</italic> and ds<italic>GFP</italic> treated leafhoppers was examined by a predation experiment.</p>

<title>In vitro measurements were conducted to assess the relationship between brochosome morphology and their optical performance</title>
<p>To collect approximately 500 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> treated with ds<italic>GFP</italic> or ds<italic>BSM</italic>, dissect the forewings of the leafhoppers and immerse them in acetone in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Place the centrifuge tubes on a room temperature orbital shaker at 50 rpm for 12 hours to separate the forewings from the leafhoppers due to friction. Following this, centrifuge at 1000g for 10 minutes to separate the brochosomes. Resuspend the particles in fresh acetone, briefly sonicate, then centrifuge at 1000g for 10 minutes. Repeat this process three times. Resuspend the collected brochosomes from ds<italic>GFP</italic> and ds<italic>BSM</italic>-treated leafhopper forewings in acetone and adjust the two suspension solutions to the same OD280 reading. Next, using a pipette, carefully drop the brochosome solution onto quartz slides and brown planthopper wings. Allow the acetone to completely evaporate at room temperature. At the same time, we also set up quartz slides and brown planthopper wings that were treated with acetone alone as negative controls. Prepared quartz slides and brown planthopper wings can be observed under SEM to examine the distribution of brochosomes. Additionally, UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra (250 to 1000 nm) were obtained using a 20/30 PV UV-Vis-NIR microspectrophotometer (CRAIC Technologies Inc., USA), with a minimum of five replicates per sample.</p>

<title>Removal of leafhopper forewing brochosome by acetone</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that acetone may efficiently remove brochosomes from the cuticle surface of leafhoppers(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Rakitov et al., 2018</xref>). We manually removed the brochosomes from the forewings of leafhoppers using acetone and examined the imaging under white or UV light for observation through a Nikon SMZ25 microscope (Nikon, Japan). UV-Vis-NIR reflectance spectra (250 to 1000 nm) were obtained using a 20/30 PV UV-Vis-NIR microspectrophotometer (CRAIC Technologies Inc., USA), with a minimum of five replicates per sample.</p>

<title>Bioinformatics analysis and phylogenetic tree</title>
<p>The brochosome is a unique secretion produced by leafhoppers (Cicadellidae). In order to determine the distribution of brochosome structural protein-coding genes in Hemiptera. The brochosome structural protein-coding genes were used to queries to search for homologous sequences in Hemiptera transcriptomes. We examined 116 Hemiptera species, encompassing major families (Acanaloniidae, Achilidae, Aetalionidae, Aphrophoridae, Caliscelidae, Cercopidae, Cicadellidae, Cicadidae, Cixiidae, Clastopteridae, Delphacidae, Derbidae, Dictyopharidae, Epipygidae, Eurybrachidae, Flatidae, Fulgoridae, Issidae, Machaerotidae, Melizoderidae, Membracidae, Myerslopiidae, Nogodinidae, Peloridiidae, Ricaniidae, Tettigarctidae, Tettigometridae, Theaceae, Tropiduchidae). Transcriptome data of 116 Hemiptera species were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Supplementary Table 2), and assembled using SOAPdenovo-Trans (version 1.01)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). The resulting transcripts were filtered to remove potential contaminants. We compared four identified BSM-encoded genes with these transcriptomes using the tblastn (E-value &lt; 1.0e–5). Heatmaps were generated using TBtools software(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). At least one homologous gene for the four BSM genes was identified in 66 species. A species phylogenetic tree for these 66 Hemiptera species was constructed following the methods outlined in previous studies(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>).</p>
<p>The amino acid sequences of BSM2 and BSM3 were aligned using the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment program(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Larkin et al., 2007</xref>). AlphaFold2 was employed to predict the three-dimensional structures of BSM2 and BSM3, and structural alignments were conducted using PyMOL(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">DeLano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>). In Membracoidea, the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree for BSM2 and BSM3 was constructed using IQtree in PhyloSuite(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Minh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Xiang et al., 2023</xref>).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Evading predation is of utmost importance for most animals and camouflage is one of the predominant mechanisms. Wu et al. set out to test the hypothesis of a unique camouflage system in leafhoppers. These animals coat themselves with brochosomes, which are spherical nanostructures that are produced in the Malpighian tubules and are distributed on the cuticle after eclosion. Based on previous findings on the reflectivity properties of brochosomes, the authors provide very good evidence that these nanostructures indeed reduce the reflectivity of the animals thereby reducing predation by jumping spiders. Further, they identify four proteins, which are essential for the proper development and function of brochosomes. In RNAi experiments, the regular brochosome structure is lost, the reflectivity reduced and the respective animals are prone to increased predation. Finally, the authors provide some phylogenetic sequence analyses and speculate about the evolution of these essential genes.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very comprehensive including careful optical measurements, EM and TM analysis of the nanoparticles and their production line in the malphigian tubules, in vivo predation tests, and knock-down experiments to identify essential proteins. Indeed, the results are very convincingly in line with the starting hypothesis such that the study robustly assigns a new biological function to the brochosome coating system.</p>
<p>A key strength of the study is that the biological relevance of the brochosome coating is convincingly shown by an in vivo predation test using a known predator from the same habitat.</p>
<p>Another major step forward is an RNAi screen, which identified four proteins, which are essential for the brochosome structure (BSMs). After respective RNAi knock-downs, the brochosomes show curious malformations that are interesting in terms of the self-assembly of these nanostructures. The optical and in vivo predation tests provide excellent support for the model that the RNAi knock-down leads to a change of brochosomes structure, which reduces reflectivity, which in turn leads to a decrease of the antipredatory effect.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The reduction of reflectivity by aberrant brochosomes or after ageing is only around 10%. This may seem little to have an effect in real life. On the other hand, the in vivo predation tests confirm an influence. Hence, this is not a real weakness of the study - just a note to reconsider the wording for describing the degree of reflectivity.</p>
<p>
The single gene knockdowns seemed to lead to a very low penetrance of malformed brochosomes (Figure Supplement 3). Judging from the overview slides, less than 1% of brochosomes may have been affected. A quantification of regular versus abnormal particles in both, wildtype and RNAi treatments would have helped to exclude that the shown aberrant brochosomes did not just reflect a putative level of &quot;normal&quot; background defects. Of note, the quadruple knock-down of all BSMs seemed to lead to a high penetrance (Figure 4), which was already reflected in the microtubule production line. While the data shown are convincing, a quantification might strengthen the argument.</p>
<p>While the RNAi effects seemed to be very specific to brochosomes and therefore very likely specific, an off-target control for RNAi was still missing. Finding the same/similar phenotype with a non-overlapping dsRNA fragment in one off-target experiment is usually considered required and sufficient. Further, the details of the targeted sequence will help future workers on the topic.</p>
<p>The main weakness in the current manuscript may be the phylogenetic analysis and the model of how the genes evolved. Several aspects were not clearly or consistently stated such that I felt unsure about what the authors actually think. For instance: Are all the 4 BSMs related to each other or only BSM2 and 3? If so, not only BSM2 and 3 would be called &quot;paralogs&quot; but also the other BSMs. If they were all related, then a phylogenetic tree including all BSMs should be shown to visualize the relatedness (including the putative ancestral gene if that is the model of the authors). Actually, I was not sure about how the authors think about the emergence of the BSMs. Are they real orphan genes (i.e. not present outside the respective clade) or was there an ancestral gene that was duplicated and diverged to form the BSMs? Where in the phylogeny does the first of the BSMs or ancestral proteins emerge (is the gene found in Clastoptera arizonana the most ancestral one?)? Maybe, the evolution of the BSMs would have to be discussed individually for each gene as they show somewhat different patterns of emergence and loss (BSM4 present in all species, the others with different degrees of phylogenetic restriction). Related to these questions I remained unsure about some details in Figure 5. On what kind of analysis is the phylogeny based? Why are some species not colored, although they are located on the same branch as colored ones? What is the measure for homology values - % identity/similarity? The homology labels for Nephotetix cincticeps and N. virescens seem to be flipped: the latter is displayed with 100% identity for all genes with all proteins while the former should actually show this. As a consequence of these uncertainties, I could not fully follow the respective discussion and model for gene evolution.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>The authors successfully tested their hypothesis in a multidisciplinary approach and convincingly assigned a new biological function to the brochosomes system. The results fully support their claims - only the quantification of the penetrance in the RNAi experiments would be helpful to strengthen the point. The author's analysis of the evolution of BSM genes remained a bit vague and I remained unsure about their respective conclusions.</p>
<p>The work is a very interesting study case of the evolutionary emergence of a new system to evade predators. Based on this study, the function of the BSM genes could now be studied in other species to provide insights into putative ancestral functions. Further, studying the self-assembly of such highly regular complex nano-structures will be strongly fostered by the identification of the four key structural genes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the optical properties of brochosomes produced by leafhoppers. They hypothesize that brochosomes reduce light reflection on the leafhopper's body surface, aiding in predator avoidance. Their hypothesis is supported by experiments involving jumping spiders. Additionally, the authors employ a variety of techniques including micro-UV-Vis spectroscopy, electron microscopy, transcriptome and proteome analysis, and bioassays. This study is highly interesting, and the experimental data is well-organized and logically presented.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The use of brochosomes as a camouflage coating has been hypothesized since 1936 (R.B. Swain, Entomol. News 47, 264-266, 1936) with evidence demonstrated by similar synthetic brochosome systems in a number of recent studies (S. Yang, et al. Nat. Commun. 8:1285, 2017; L. Wang, et al., PNAS. 121: e2312700121, 2024). However, direct biological evidence or relevant field studies have been lacking to directly support the hypothesis that brochosomes are used for camouflage. This work provides the first biological evidence demonstrating that natural brochosomes can be used as a camouflage coating to reduce the leafhoppers' observability of their predators. The design of the experiments is novel.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The observation that brochosome coatings become sparse after 25 days in both male and female leafhoppers, resulting in increased predation by jumping spiders, is intriguing. However, since leafhoppers consistently secrete and groom brochosomes, it would be beneficial to explore why brochosomes become significantly less dense after 25 days.</p>
<p>(2) The authors demonstrate that brochosome coatings reduce UV (specular) reflection compared to surfaces without brochosomes, which can be attributed to the rough geometry of brochosomes as discussed in the literature. However, it would be valuable to investigate whether the proteins forming the brochosomes are also UV absorbing.</p>
<p>(3) The experiments with jumping spiders show that brochosomes help leafhoppers avoid predators to some extent. It would be beneficial for the authors to elaborate on the exact mechanism behind this camouflage effect. Specifically, why does reduced UV reflection aid in predator avoidance? If predators are sensitive to UV light, how does the reduced UV reflectance specifically contribute to evasion?</p>
<p>(4) An important reference regarding the moth-eye effect is missing. Please consider including the following paper: Clapham, P. B., and M. C. Hutley. &quot;Reduction of lens reflection by the 'Moth Eye' principle.&quot; Nature 244: 281-282 (1973).</p>
<p>(5) The introduction should be revised to accurately reflect the related contributions in literature. Specifically, the novelty of this work lies in the demonstration of the camouflage effect of brochosomes using jumping spiders, which is verified for the first time in leafhoppers. However, the proposed use of brochosome powder for camouflage was first described by R.B. Swain (R.B. Swain, Notes on the oviposition and life history of the leafhopper Oncometopta undata Fabr. (Homoptera: Cicadellidae), Entomol. News. 47: 264-266 (1936)). Recently, the antireflective and potential camouflage functions of brochosomes were further studied by Yang et al. based on synthetic brochosomes and simulated vision techniques (S. Yang, et al. &quot;Ultra-antireflective synthetic brochosomes.&quot; Nature Communications 8: 1285 (2017)). Later, Lei et al. demonstrated the antireflective properties of natural brochosomes in 2020 (C.-W. Lei, et al., &quot;Leafhopper wing-inspired broadband omnidirectional antireflective embroidered ball-like structure arrays using a nonlithography-based methodology.&quot; Langmuir 36: 5296-5302 (2020)). Very recently, Wang et al. successfully fabricated synthetic brochosomes with precise geometry akin to those natural ones, and further elucidated the antireflective mechanisms based on the brochosome geometry and their role in reducing the observability of leafhoppers to their predators (L. Wang et al. &quot;Geometric design of antireflective leafhopper brochosomes.&quot; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 121: e2312700121 (2024))</p>
