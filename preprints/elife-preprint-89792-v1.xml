<title>Summary</title>
<p>The cell-type specific expression of ligand/receptor and cell-adhesion molecules is a fundamental mechanism through which neurons regulate connectivity. Here we determine a functional relevance of the long-established mutually exclusive expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and the trans-membrane protein Kit Ligand by discrete populations of neurons in the mammalian brain. Kit is enriched in molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex (i.e., stellate and basket cells), while cerebellar Kit Ligand is selectively expressed by a target of their inhibition, Purkinje cells (PCs). By <italic>in vivo</italic> genetic manipulation spanning embryonic development through adulthood, we demonstrate that PC Kit Ligand and MLI Kit are required for, and capable of driving changes in, inhibition of PCs. Collectively, these works in mice demonstrate that the Kit Ligand/Kit receptor dyad sustains mammalian central synapse function and suggest a rationale for the affiliation of Kit mutation with neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase Kit (c-Kit, CD117) is an evolutionarily conserved, loss-of-function intolerant, gene that is enriched in specific neuron populations and tentatively associated with rare cases of neurological dysfunction (pLI= 0.98 and LOEUF of 0.17) (<bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1A,B</xref></bold>)<sup><xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. It is perhaps unsurprising that loss-of-function Kit mutations in humans are rare; Kit is highly pleiotropic, supporting diverse cell populations including melanocytes, hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, germ cells, masts cell, and interstitial cells of Cajal<sup><xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Thus, Kit mutations can result in diverse conditions such as hypo- or hyperpigmentation or melanoma, anemia or leukemia, infertility, mastocytosis, and impaired gut motility or gastro-intestinal tumors (Kit biology reviewed <sup><xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>).</p>
<p>The activation of Kit is stimulated by Kit Ligand (Gene symbol is KITLG, herein KL), a single-pass transmembrane protein having an extracellular active domain that induces Kit dimerization and kinase activity. Across several decades and species, it has been reported that KL and Kit are mutually expressed in discrete neuron populations known to be connected; it has thus been hypothesized that the expression pattern of KL-Kit may reflect a role in connectivity<sup><xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Consistent with such a function, case reports have implicated inactivating Kit mutations with neurological impairment (References<sup><xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and <bold><xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Figure S1C</xref></bold>). Clinical phenotypes include developmental delay, ataxia, hypotonia, intellectual disability, deafness, and autism spectrum disorder. White matter abnormalities have been noted, and limited evidence suggests KL-Kit may indeed regulate axon outgrowth. KL or Kit mutation or pharmacological manipulation alters outgrowth of spinal commissural axons <italic>in vitro</italic><sup><xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, KL stimulates cortical neurite outgrowth <italic>in vitro</italic> <sup><xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, and Kit reduction in cortex of developing rats or mice delays axon extension<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. While these reports provide anatomical/morphological data suggesting that KL-Kit influences connectivity, critically, these studies did not address functional consequences to neuronal physiology or synaptic connectivity. Functional studies of KL-Kit in synaptic physiology have likely been hampered by pleiotropy and organismal or cell death. Severe global KL-Kit hypomorphs exhibit fatal anemia, and developmental Kit depletion or inhibition in the cerebrum has resulted in death of neuronal progenitors or nascent neurons<sup><xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. Therefore, whether KL-Kit is necessary for synaptic function has remained largely unstudied. Here, we address this gap.</p>
<p>In mice, rats, and humans, Kit is abundantly expressed by molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) of the cerebellar cortex<sup><xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, while cerebellar KL is restricted to Purkinje Cells (PCs), which MLIs provide GABAergic synaptic inhibition to. We tested the hypothesis that PC KL and MLI Kit were essential to the GABAergic inhibition of PCs. We created a Kit conditional knockout mouse and accomplished embryonic knockout of Kit from all MLIs; separately, we knocked out KL from postnatal PCs. By either method, disruption of the KL-Kit ligand-receptor pair produced robust and specific impairments to GABAergic inhibition of PCs. Through sparse postnatal viral manipulation of KL in PCs, we provide evidence that KL functions throughout adulthood to regulate synaptic function. These results demonstrate that cell-type specific expression of KL and Kit influences functional connectivity in the mammalian brain, informing the long-observed expression of KL-Kit in the brain and suggesting a rationale for the affiliation of Kit loss with neurological impairment.</p>

<sec id="s2a">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>All procedures performed at Michigan State University were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Michigan State University, which is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). Mice were on a 12-hour dark/light cycle, with ad libitum food and water. Male and female mice were used for all experiments. Mice were genotyped in-house using standard PCR-based methods, or via Transnetyx.</p>

<title>Creation of Kit conditional knockout mouse</title>
<p>We generated a strain of mice having exon 4 of Kit floxed. This was accomplished by utilizing the services of UNC Animal Models Core (Dr. Dale Cowley) to generate chimeras from an ES cell line having a Knockout-first Allele (with conditional potential) for Kit (HEPD0509_8). The ES clones were obtained through the EuMMCR (European Mouse Mutant Cell Repository) of the EUCOMM (European Conditional Mouse Mutagenesis Program)<sup><xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Chimeric mice were screened for germline transmission of the targeted allele and were then crossed to a Flp deleter strain (C57BL/6N-Albino-Rosa26-Flpo) to convert the knockout-first allele to a conditional allele (tm1c) through removal of the FRT-flanked selection cassette. F1 male offspring carrying Kit tm1c and Flp alleles were crossed to C57Bl6/J females; we selected resultant progeny heterozygous for Kit tm1c but negative for Flp and the selection cassette. The Kit tm1c alle was bred to homozygosity while selecting against animals carrying the Tyr c-Brd allele (previously conveyed by C57BL/6N-Albino-Rosa26-Flpo). The strain of mice having the Kit floxed tm1c allele are given the nomenclature C57BL/6N–Kit<sup>tm1c(EUCOMM)Mirow</sup>/J; the Mirow lab code is provisional. Additional strains of mice used were Pax2-Cre transgenic mice (STOCK Tg(Pax2-cre)1Akg/Mmnc, RRID:MMRRC_010569-UNC<sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, Kit eGFP (Tg(Kit-EGFP)IF44Gsat/Mmucd; Gensat) <sup><xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> backcrossed for greater than 5 generations to C57Bl6/J (Stock No: 000664, The Jackson Laboratory), KitL floxed (Kitltm2.1Sjm/J, Stock #017861) <sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and Pcp2-Cre (Stock # 004146) mice <sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, all from The Jackson Laboratory.</p>
<p>To produce mixed litters of “Control” and “Kit KO” animals, mice homozygous for the Kit tm1c allele but negative for Pax2-Cre were crossed to mice homozygous for the floxed allele and Pax2-Cre positive. We used Kit KO females crossed to Control males as our breeding scheme. Experimental animals were derived from at least 5 generations of backcrossing Kit KO animals to Kit tm1c homozygous animals derived from a separate (Kit tm1c homozygous x Kit tm1c homozygous) breeding cohort.</p>

<title>Validation of Kit knockout</title>
<p>We investigated conditional knockout of Kit protein from the cerebellum by Western blot of total protein lysates from acutely harvested cerebellums (∼P52) and by indirect immunofluorescence on free-floating vibratome-generated sections of transcardial-perfused formaldehyde-fixed mouse brains (∼P31). Western blots were probed with Rabbit: α-Kit (clone D13A2, Cell Signaling Technologies product 3074), α-GAPDH (Clone 14C10, product 2118 Cell Signaling Technology), or α-parvalbumin antibody (product PV-27, Swant), each primary was detected via HRP conjugated Goat α-Rabbit secondary antibody (Biorad, product 170-6515) after incubation with Clarity ECL substrate (Bio-Rad, 1705061) via a BioRad ChemiDoc MP.</p>
<p>For indirect immunofluorescence, primary antibodies were rat α-Kit (Rat α-Kit clone ACK4, ThermoFisher, product MA5-17836), mouse α-calbindin (α-calbindin-D28K, CB-955, Sigma Aldrich), and rabbit α-parvalbumin (PV-27, Swant). Primaries were detected by Goat-host highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 488, Cy3, or Alexa 647 (Jackson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were labeled with DAPI, tissues were mounted in an anti-fade reagent, and fluorescent signals captured laser scanning confocal microscopy. Cell densities for MLIs (parvalbumin positive and/or calbindin negative somas of the molecular layer) were performed on Maximum Z-projections of 2.5-2.6 micron thick stacks, using the multi-point feature for counting somas, and the polygon ROI tool for determining the area of the Molecular Layer in which the somas were counted; results from two-technical replicates were averaged for each animal. The polygon tool was also used for determining maximal PSD95+ pinceau area. To determine the width of the molecular layer, seven linear ROIs per field of view of comparable locations of lobules IV/V were averaged to generate per animal layer thickness measurements. For analysis of synapses, we quantified puncta in the molecular layer that were triple positive for rabbit α-VGAT(131 003), mouse α-Gephyrin (147 011), and Chicken α-Calbindin (214 006), all from Synaptic Systems. For analysis of pinceau markers we utilized mouse α-Kv1.1 (K36/15), Kv1.2 (K14/16), and PSD-95 (K28/43), all from NeuroMab/AntibodiesInc.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic Procedures</title>
<p>Injections of replication-defective viral particles used protocols substantially similar to those previously published <sup><xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. In brief, mice were brought to an anesthetic plane using inhaled isoflurane by a low-flow system (SomnoSuite, Kent); thermal regulation was assisted by heating pad, and pain managed through topical lidocaine and ketoprofen. A digital stereotaxic device (Kopf) and reference atlas were used to localize a small hole in the skull; cerebellar coordinates were: neonates; A/P, -2.55; M/L, - 1.1 (reference Lambda), D/V, 1.5 to 0.5 from dura; juvenile; A/P, -6.25; M/L, - 1.35; D/V, 1.5 to 0.75 (reference Bregma); adults; A/P, -6.35; M/L, - 1.8; D/V, 1.5 to 0.75 (reference Bregma). Viral particles were delivered via a ∼30-gauge Hamilton Syringe controlled by digital syringe pump (WPI). Virus volume was 1-2 ul and there was a 5-minute period after infusion prior to needle withdrawal. Animals were monitored during and after surgical operations. Ages for injection were, nominally, postnatal day (P) 7, 19, and 56; for P7 and P19, variability of up to two days was utilized to accommodate differences in animal size, and for P56 the eighth week of life was utilized.</p>

<title>Viruses</title>
<p>Lentiviral particles were derived from vectors previously described to express transgenes under the hUbiC promoter and pseudotyped with VSV-G <sup><xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. Silent mutations disrupted the internal EcoRI sites of mouse KitL (MC204279, Origene), the KitL coding sequence was then flanked by EcoRI sites, and the subsequent KitL coding sequence was introduced into a FUC-T2A-(EcoRI) plasmid, to create a FUC-T2A-KL-1 plasmid, wherein C designates mCherry. Subsequent deletion of KitL Exon 6 generated a KL-2 vector <sup><xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>-<xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>. Sequences were verified by sequencing. Adeno-Associated Viral (AAV) particles were created by Vigene to drive Cre expression by the Purkinje Cell-Specific L7.6 promoter <sup><xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>, or to drive mCherry or mCherry-T2A-KL-2 in a Cre-On fashion under the EF1α promoter, with the AAV1 serotype.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>For patch clamp electrophysiology of Control vs Kit KO, cells were recorded in slices generated from animals at 36.9 ± 0.6 and 37.4 ± 0.9 days for MLIs and PCs respectively. Avertin-anesthetized mice were perfused with a carbogen-equilibrated ice-cold slicing solution containing (in mM): 110 C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>14</sub>ClNO, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 Glucose, and 1.3 Na-Ascorbate. In the same solution, we generated 250-micron thick parasagittal sections of the cerebellum (Leica VT1200). Slices recovered at 34°C for 30 minutes in a carbogenated ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O and 25 Glucose; slices were then held at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before recording. Recordings were performed in carbogenated external recording ACSF (32.7 ± 0.1°C) containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O and 25 Glucose. MLIs and PCs of folia IV/V were targeted for recording by IR-DIC, or epifluorescence stimulated by a CoolLED pE-4000, detected via a SciCam Pro on a SliceScope Pro 6000-based rig (Scientifica). Recording electrodes were pulled (Narishige, PC-100) from standard-wall borosilicate glass capillary tubing (G150F-4, Warner Instruments) and had 5.1 ± 0.08 and 2.8 ± 0.02 MΩ tip resistance for MLIs and PCs respectively. Spontaneous Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents (sIPSCs) and Miniature Inhibitory Postsynaptic Currents (mIPSC) were recorded with an intracellular solution containing (in mM):140 CsCl, 4 NaCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>-2H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, and 0.4 Na-GTP, 2 QX-314. For action potential recordings and for Miniature Excitatory Postsynaptic Currents (mEPSCs), the intracellular solution contained (in mM): 140 K-gluconate, 10 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.02 EGTA, 3 Mg-ATP, and 0.5 Na-GTP as described previously <sup><xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>. The internal pipette solution pH was adjusted to 7.35 with CsOH for IPSCs and mIPSCS, and with KOH for mEPSCs and action potentials, while for all the osmolarity was adjusted to 300 mOsmolL-1 with sucrose. In whole-cell voltage clamp mode PCs were held at -70 mV; to isolate sIPSCs, NBQX (10 μM) and D-AP5 (50 μM) were added to the recording solution and mIPSCs recordings additionally included 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX). To record mEPSCs, 1 μM TTX and 50 μM picrotoxin was added to extracellular solution. Action potentials were recorded in MLIs within the middle third of the molecular layer; spontaneous action potentials were recorded in I=0 mode, or action potentials were evoked by depolarizing current injection in 600 ms steps of 10 pA, from 0 to 150 pA, with a 7 second inter-sweep interval. For paired pulse, current ranging from 150 uA to 250uA was delivered by concentric bipolar stimulating electrode in the molecular layer. Stimulus duration was 50 microseconds, and ISI was 50 mS. For each cell, 10 sweeps were recorded with 10 S inter sweep interval. Purkinje Cells with an access resistance of 10-20 (15.9 ± 0.5), or MLIs with an access resistance &lt;30 (23.6 ± 0.6) MΩ were considered for recording. Recordings with &gt;20% change in series resistance were excluded from analysis. Signals were acquired at 10 KHz with a low-noise data acquisition system (Digidata 1550B) and a Multiclamp700-A amplifier and were analyzed using pClamp11.1 (Molecular Devices). Both mIPSCs and mEPSCs with over 8 pA amplitude and longer than 1 ms duration were included while overlapping events were rejected from analysis; also rejected from analysis was any miniature event for which amplitude, rise, and decay metrics were not all available. Analysis of the PCP2 Cre mediated KL KO tissues was conducted similarly at ∼40-44 days old. For viral PC KL KO animals injected as neonates (P7), juvenile (P19), and adults (P56) were recorded at an average of ∼35, 45, and 83 days old, respectively.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We generated mice in which Kit exon 4 is flanked by LoxP sites (Kit tm1c); Kit gene modifications are illustrated in <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A, B</xref></bold>. Kit tm1c homozygous Control animals had normal appearance, sex ratios, and reproductive success. Kit is abundantly expressed in GABAergic interneurons in the molecular layer of the cerebellar cortex (MLIs), whereas Kit Ligand (KL) is expressed by Purkinje cells (PCs). To determine if Kit influences synapse function, we conditionally knocked out Kit from MLIs and assessed the MLI-PC synapse. Pax2 is a transcription factor expressed early in the lineage of GABAergic interneurons of the cerebellum<sup><xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>; a Pax2-Cre transgene enables embryonic recombination<sup><xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. We generated Kit tm1c homozygous litters of which nominally half were hemizygous for Pax2 Cre (Kit KO) and half were not (Control) <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></bold>. We produced Control and Kit KO animals in normal sex and genotype ratios. As expected for the C57Bl6/J background, Control littermates had dark coat and eyes, but littermate Kit KO animals had white whiskers, white fur with variable pigmented patches, and black eyes; example littermates <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref></bold>. Given Pax2 expression in melanocytes<sup><xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> and the role of Kit in melanogenesis (Reviewed in<sup><xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup>), the pigmentation phenotype provided gross confirmation of conditional Kit KO. We thus confirmed that cerebella of Kit KO animals were Kit depleted. By immunohistochemistry in Control animals, we recapitulated the known pattern of Kit immunoreactivity in the parvalbumin positive MLIs of the cerebellar cortex (<bold>1F and Inset</bold>). In contrast, a sex-matched Kit KO littermate demonstrated loss of cerebellar Kit immunoreactivity. By Western blot of cerebellar lysates from Control animals, Kit resolved as a major band at ∼120 kD, but in Kit KO littermates, Kit immunoreactivity was lost; GAPDH as loading control was equivalent, as was parvalbumin (which marks mature MLIs and PCs) <bold><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref></bold>.</p>

<p>We sought to determine if reduced PC inhibition was related to altered MLI physiology (Schema, <bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3A</xref></bold>). Capacitance, input resistance, and spontaneous or stimulated MLI action potential frequency was not different between Control and Kit KO (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3B-E</xref>)</bold>. Since MLIs were present and firing normally in Kit KO, we sought to determine if there were defects in evoked neurotransmitter release. Direct electrode stimulation of the outer or inner molecular layer in a paired-pulse paradigm (Schema, <bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3F</xref></bold>) evoked IPSCs of equivalent amplitude in PCs from Control and Kit KO, and we detected no difference in the paired pulse ratio (<bold><xref rid="figS3" ref-type="fig">Figure S3G,H</xref></bold>). These data suggest that MLI synapses could function normally in Kit KO under direct stimulation. We therefore investigated markers of the MLI:PC synapses to determine if they were altered.</p>
<p>The density of GABAergic synapses upon PCs (triple positive VGAT, Gephyrin, and Calbindin puncta in the molecular layer) was not reduced by Kit KO (example immunofluorescence, <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4A</xref></bold>). However, GABAergic puncta upon PCs were significantly smaller (∼10%) in Kit KO (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4B</xref></bold>). MLI axon terminals contribute not just to individual axo-dendritic synaptic puncta, but also to interdigitated MLI axon collaterals around the soma and initial axon segment of PCs, forming “pinceaux” structures. By parvalbumin immunoreactivity, these structures were preserved but smaller in Kit KO (arrowheads <bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4C</xref>)</bold>, and this was confirmed by decreased Kv1.2 (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref></bold>) and PSD95 (<bold><xref rid="figS4" ref-type="fig">Figure S4D</xref></bold>). As PSD95 immunoreactivity faithfully follows multiple markers of pinceaux size <sup><xref rid="c40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, we quantified PSD95 immunoreactive pinceau area and determined that pinceaux area was decreased by ∼50% in Kit KO (n 26 Control vs 43 Kit KO, p&lt;0.0001, two-tailed t-test). These results suggested that Kit KO MLIs may have defects in physical and/or functional maturation of synapses upon PCs.</p>
<p>To evaluate the number of functional GABAergic synapses, we analyzed miniature synaptic currents in acute cerebellar slices, (schema <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 E,F,G</xref></bold>; example traces <bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2 H,I,J</xref>)</bold>. In PCs of Kit KO, there was a significant ∼50% reduction in the average frequency, but not amplitude, of mIPSCs (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2K</xref></bold>). In contrast, the average frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in PCs from Control and Kit KO did not differ (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2L</xref></bold>). These data suggested that Kit KO impaired the MLI:PC synapse but did not rule out a general defect in MLI synapse function. As MLIs synapse not just upon PCs, but also upon MLIs, we evaluated mIPSCs in MLIs. Mean mIPSC frequency and amplitude was unchanged between Control and Kit KO (<bold><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2M</xref></bold>). Therefore, embryonic MLI Kit KO was associated with a specific defect in the number or proportion of functional GABAergic synapses upon PCs. As MLI Kit and PC KL expression is maintained postnatally, we hypothesized that postnatal postsynaptic PC KL KO would phenocopy embryonic presynaptic MLI Kit KO.</p>
<p>We utilized previously described KL floxed<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and PC-Cre<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> strains to yield mice with Control or KL KO PCs (Schema <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></bold>). We confirmed depletion of cerebellar KL transcripts by rtPCR in data not shown<sup><xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>, and we confirmed that PC KL KO did not disrupt the pattern of Kit immunoreactivity. Patch clamp of PCs in acute slices revealed that PC KL KO produced significant differences in the distribution of sIPSC event amplitudes (Example traces <bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref></bold>). PC KL KO reduced the average sIPSC frequency, amplitude, and duration in PCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref></bold>). The phenotype was specific to GABAergic synapses: there was a substantial reduction in the frequency but not the amplitude of mIPSC events in PCs (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></bold>). In contrast, frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in KL KO PCs was not different (<bold><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref></bold>). In data not shown, a KS test revealed a significant difference in the individual mEPSC event amplitude distribution (p=0.0002, n=1196 Control vs 1244 KL KO), however the mean mEPSC amplitude was within 1% between conditions. Similarly, a KS test of mIPSC event amplitudes revealed a significant difference (p&lt;0.0001, n=5996 Control vs 3958 KL KO), but the mean mIPSC amplitude was ∼10% greater in PC KL KO than in Control. It is therefore unlikely that decreased event amplitude contributed to the specific and robust &gt;50% decrease in mIPSC frequency detected in PC KL KO. Thus, like MLI Kit KO, PC KL KO reduced inhibition of PCs.</p>

<p>Recombination by PCP2 Cre begins at ∼P7<sup><xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>, whereas Pax2 Cre recombination occurs at ∼E15 <sup><xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.

<p>We noted that Control PCs from the PC KL KO paradigm had sIPSC frequency and amplitude similar to PCs from Sham injections (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C,4D</xref></bold>). In contrast, while KL OX PCs received elevated GABAergic input compared to their adjacent Control PCs, this (KL OX) relative increase in inhibitory drive was not beyond the inhibition recorded in PCs from separate Sham animals (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref></bold>). That is, the focal gain in synaptic input to KL OX PCs appears to come at the expense of decreasing input to nearby Control PCs. Thus, KL-Kit levels may not set the number of MLI:PC release sites, but may instead influence the proportion of synapses that are functional for neurotransmission (<bold><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref></bold>). Such a requirement is consistent with the impaired synaptic function observed under both widespread conditional knockout and sparse viral manipulation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>For genes essential to survival or reproduction, germline knockout strategies are not feasible for evaluating postnatal physiology. Among such genes, Kit is an example of a highly pleiotropic gene, and so the interpretation of global hypomorphs is challenging and the recombination of conditional alleles outside of desired tissues can lead to lethal or sterile phenotypes. By generating a conditional knockout mouse, we were able to produce viable animals with Kit depleted from the cerebellum to reveal a role in synapse function.</p>
<p>MLI number, distribution, action potential firing, and the density of GABAergic synaptic puncta upon PCs, are all normal in MLI Kit KO. These data suggest that while MLI axon terminals are present in Kit KO (perhaps related to the smaller size of synaptic puncta and pinceaux), they may be less functionally mature. An increased failure rate between action potential generation and neurotransmitter release would be consistent with the normal firing rate and VGAT puncta density but decreased sIPSC and mIPSC frequency observed. Under the PPR paradigm, the apparent equivalent evoked responses may be due to direct stimulation of axon terminals and/or recruitment of multiple MLIs.</p>
<p>Kit KO most directly impacts the MLI:PC synapse, based upon normal miniature events for PF/CF:PC (mEPSC in PC) and MLI:MLI (mIPSC in MLI) synapses. This is perhaps expected given the cell type specific expression of KL by PCs and Kit by MLIs, however, it is a critical distinction as Cerebellins<sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and Calsystenin<sup><xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> impact multiple forms of synaptic input to PCs. It will be informative to determine if the residual inhibitory drive to PCs observed in MLI Kit KO or PC KL KO comes from PC axon collaterals<sup><xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> whose input we might expect to be preserved if KL-Kit functions primarily to mediate connectivity between different cell types.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the KL-Kit axis, from embryonic development through young adulthood (P56), can alter GABAergic drive to PCs. These results suggest that KL-Kit may be necessary to maintain, and perhaps capable of modulating, connectivity in the adult cerebellum. As each MLI (e.g. basket cell) may have axon collaterals that target multiple PCs, and as each PC may receive input from multiple MLIs, it is interesting to speculate that dynamics in the expression or shedding of KL may act through presynaptic Kit to tune the degree of convergent MLI:PC inhibitory drive. This would complement existing forms of modulation at the MLI:PC synapse, such those dependent upon other PC derived signaling molecules, like endocannabinoids<sup><xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> or peptides like secretin<sup><xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> and CR <sup><xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. The physiology of PCs, and the structure of MLI:PC inhibition, also varies over zones such as those identified by Zebrin-II and PLC β4<sup><xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>-<xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>; whether there is anatomical variation in KL or Kit expression, signaling, or dependency, remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Kit is a receptor tyrosine kinase that can activate multiple downstream effectors including Src family kinases, PLC, PI3K/mTOR, and the MAPK pathway, the latter two notable for their shared affiliation with synapse phenotypes and autism spectrum disorder. Furthermore, trans-cellular interactions between KL and Kit may function in a kinase-independent cell adhesion molecule modality<sup><xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. There is a substantial literature illustrating the importance of adhesion molecules in the organization and maintenance of MLI:PC inhibition, such as neurexins/neuroligins, dystrophin/dystroglycan, semaphorins, and neurofascins<sup><xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>-<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup>. Much of what is understood about the maintenance of PC inhibition is revealed by post-synaptic phenotypes; that is, cis-and trans interacting proteins that, via gephyrin, maintain the organization of PC GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. It is notable therefore that MLI Kit or PC KL KO have a more predominant effect on mIPSC frequency than on amplitude, suggesting a presynaptic phenotype. A compatible model is that PC derived KL may act retrograde/trans-synaptic to modulate MLI axon function via Kit binding/activity.</p>
<p>Despite the reduced PC inhibition resulting from MLI Kit KO or from PC KL KO, we have not observed overt cerebellar signs (i.e., ataxia). We suspect that this is due to compensation. Even the developmental ablation of functional GABA<sub>A</sub> channels in PCs does not produce overt motor signs, while adulthood ablation ca <sup><xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. Thus, we might unmask behavioral phenotypes if KL or Kit KO is delayed. Beyond direct inhibition of PCs, MLI inhibition constrains granule cell mediated PC dendritic excitation and thus gates the conversion of PC LTD to LTP at the PF-PC synapse in motor learning<sup><xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that KL or Kit KO may only reveal phenotypes in motor learning (or other cerebellar-plasticity dependent) behaviors. Not inconsistent with a role in learning, global hypomorphs for KL or Kit have altered hippocampal neurophysiology and Water Maze performance<sup><xref rid="c68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>-<xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup>. Continuous expression of KL and Kit in specific neurons may thus ultimately reflect not only a role in development or maintenance of synaptic function as suggested here, but also in plastic modulation of synaptic strength.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of future works to determine molecular mechanisms and organismal consequences, our study is a discrete advance because it establishes that KL-Kit regulate mammalian central synapse function. Here, we demonstrate impacts at the mouse GABAergic MLI:PC synapse; however, Kit and KL exist in diverse organisms and neuronal populations including glutamatergic neurons of the hippocampus, and neurons in olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, and brainstem. It is therefore feasible that the synaptic phenotypes reported here reflect that KL-Kit is broadly capable of influencing connectivity.</p>

For both Control and Kit KO, Calbindin and Parvalbumin immunoreactivity was determined in conjunction with pinceau markers Kit, Kv1.2, or PSD-95. As evidence by Parvalbumin positive calbindin negative pinceaux structures in Kit KO in C, pinceaux structures still exist in Kit KO, though appear smaller. This was affirmed by reduced area of Kv1.2 immunoreactivity, and by POSD-95 immuno-reactivity. Scale bars are 50 microns.</p>

<caption><p>Sparse Acute Depletion of Kit Ligand Reduces GABAergic Input To Purkinje Cells.</p>
<p><bold>(A, B, C</bold>) Lentivirus encoding mCherry-T2A-Cre under the Purkinje Cells specific promoter L7.6 was injected into postnatal day 7 mice homozygous for a Kit Ligand (KL) floxed allele at P7. Demonstrated here is an area of direct hit and high transduction. (B) Areas with sparse PC transduction were used to record from KL KO or from uninfected adjacent Control PCs, with an example of a IR-DIC identified PC (C).</p>
<p>(<bold>D, E</bold>). Quantification of the average sIPSCs recorded from P7 Control or sparse KL KO PCs revealed that KL KO reduced both the frequency (p=0.0008) and the amplitude (p=0.012) of GABAergic inhibition of PCs by ∼50%.</p>
<p>(<bold>F, G, H</bold>) AAV encoding Cre under the L7.6 promoter was co-injected with an AAV encoding Cre-On mCherry under the Ef1α promoter into the cerebellum of postnatal day 18 or 56 KL floxed homozygous mice. Demonstrated in F is a direct hit with high transduction, areas as in (G) with sparse transduction were selected for recordings of mCherry positive KL KO PCs and their adjacent uninfected Control PCs patched under IR-DIC (H).</p>
<p><bold>(I,J,K, L</bold>). Analysis of the average sIPSC Frequency and Amplitude in Control and KL KO PCs revealed that at either P18 (p=0.005) or P56 (p=0.008), KL KO robustly reduced GABAergic event frequency in PCs by over 50%. The reduction in sIPSC amplitude reached significance in the P56 (p=0.0096), but not the P18 cohort, here (p=0.104).</p>
<p>Statistical significance was evaluated by two-tailed t-test with Welch’s correction as necessary. N in columns reveals the number of different cells recorded. NS reflects a p value &gt;0.05.</p>

<p>This <bold>valuable</bold> study from Zaman et al. demonstrates that the cKit-Kit ligand complex is necessary for the formation and/or maintenance of molecular layer interneuron synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The evidence presented is <bold>solid</bold>; in particular, the use of cell-type specific knockout of cKit in molecular layer interneurons and knockout of Kit ligand in Purkinje cells provides robust evidence. This work will be of particular relevance to those interested in inhibitory synapse formation or the role of inhibition in Purkinje cell behavior.</p>

<p>This manuscript from Zaman et al., investigates the role of cKit and Kit ligand in inhibitory synapse function at molecular layer interneuron (MLI) synapses onto cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC). cKit is a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in multiple tissues, including select populations of neurons in the CNS. cKIt is activated by Kit ligand, a transmembrane protein typically expressed at the membrane of connected cells. A strength of this paper is the use of cell-specific knockouts of cKit and Kit ligand, in MLIs and PCs, respectively. In both cases, the frequency of spontaneous or miniature (in the presence of TTX) IPSCs was reduced. This suggests either a reduction in the number of functional inhibitory release sites or reduced release probability. IPSCs evoked by electrical stimulation in the molecular layer showed no change in paired-pulse ratio, indicating release probability is not changed in the cKit KO, and favoring a reduction in the number of release sites. Changes in IPSC amplitude were more subtle, with some analyses showing a decrease and others not. These data suggest that disruption of the cKit-Kit ligand complex reduces the number of functional synapses with only minor changes in synapse strength. However, immunolabelling of inhibitory synapses in cKit KO mice using VGAT and Gephyrin antibodies revealed no change in the number of puncta, but reduced size of puncta. This result is more consistent with reduced synapse strength (size) without a change in synapse number. The apparent contradiction of these results is not resolved. It would be interesting to know if immunolabeling of inhibitory synapses in Kit ligand KO mice would produce similar results.</p>
<p>In separate experiments, the authors used viral expression of Cre (driven by the PC-specific L7 promotor) to sparsely KO Kit ligand in PCs. In recordings from neighboring Cre+ (Kit ligand KO) and Cre - (kit ligand intact) PCs, the spontaneous IPSC frequency and amplitude were reduced. Using a similar viral approach, they also overexpressed Kit ligand in wild-type PCs. Here the results are more difficult to interpret. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs were significantly greater in Cre+ PCs compared to Cre- cells. However, the effect appears to be primarily due to a drastic reduction in IPSC amplitude and frequency in the control Cre- cells rather than an increase in Cre+ cells. This puzzling result is interpreted as evidence that cKit influences the proportion of synapses that are functional for neurotransmission, but not the number of release sites. Though this interpretation is not described in detail.</p>
<p>Overall, this paper makes great use of genetic and viral approaches to examine the function of cKit and Kit ligand at MLI-PC synapses. Measurements are generally limited to immunolabeling and spontaneous IPSC recordings, a wider variety of approaches, such as EM imaging or recording from connected MLI-PC pairs would likely provide more detail on specific pre- or postsynaptic phenotypes and more clearly determine whether the number or strength of synapses is changing.</p>

<p>In their study, Zaman et al. demonstrate that deletion of either the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit from cerebellar interneurons or the kit ligand (KL) from Purkinje cells reduces the inhibition of Purkinje cells. They delete Kit or KL at different developmental time points, illustrating that Kit-KL interactions are not only required for developmental synapse formation but also for synapse maintenance in adult animals. The study is interesting as it highlights a molecular mechanism for the formation of inhibitory synapses in Purkinje cells.</p>
<p>The tools generated, such as the floxed Kit mouse line and the virus for Kit overexpression, may have broader applications in neuroscience and beyond.</p>
<p>However, to enhance the publication's impact and strengthen its hypotheses, conclusions, and scientific rigor, it would be beneficial to include additional experimental details, data analyses (particularly regarding the quantification of electrophysiology data), as well as methodological and textual clarifications.</p>
<p>One general weakness is that Kit expression is not limited to molecular layer interneurons but also extends to the Purkinje layer and Golgi interneurons. Although this expression may not conflict with the reported results, as Purkinje layer interneurons form few or no synapses onto Purkinje cells, it should be highlighted in the text (introduction and/or discussion).</p>
<p>In summary, the data support the hypothesis that the interaction between Kit and KL between cerebellar Molecular Layer Interneurons and Purkinje Cells plays a crucial role in promoting the formation and maintenance of inhibitory synapses onto PCs. This study provides valuable insights that could inform future investigations on how this mechanism contributes to the dynamic regulation of Purkinje cell inhibition across development and its impact on mouse behavior.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Bidirectional transsynaptic signaling via cell adhesion molecules and cell surface receptors contributes to the remarkable specificity of synaptic connectivity in the brain. Zaman et al., investigate how the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit and its trans-cellular kit ligand regulate molecular layer interneuron (MLI)- Purkinje cell (PC) connectivity in the cerebellum. Presynaptic Kit is specific for MLIs, and forms a trans-synaptic complex with Kit ligand in postsynaptic PC cells. The authors begin by generating Kit cKOs via an EUCOMM allele to enable cell-type specific Kit deletion. They cross this Kit cKO to the MLI-specific driver Pax2-Cre and conduct validation via Kit IHC and immunoblotting. Using this system to examine the functional consequences of presynaptic MLI Kit deletion onto postsynaptic PC cells, they record spontaneous and miniature synaptic currents from PC cells and find a selective reduction in IPSC frequency. Deletion of Kit ligand from postsynaptic PC cells also results in reduced IPSC frequency, together supporting that this trans-synaptic complex regulates GABAergic synaptic formation or maturation. The authors then show that sparse Kit ligand overexpression in PCs decreases neighboring uninfected control sIPSCs in a potentially competitive manner.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, the study addresses an important open question, the data largely support the authors' conclusions, the experiments appear well-performed, and the manuscript is well-written. I just have a few suggestions to help shore up the author's interpretations and improve the study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The strong decrease in sIPSC frequency and amplitude in control uninfected cells in Figure 4 is surprising and puzzling. The competition model proposed is one possibility, and I think the authors need to do additional experiments to help support or refute this model. The authors can conduct similar synaptic staining experiments as in Fig S4 but in their sparse infection paradigm, comparing synapses on infected and uninfected cells. Additional electrophysiological parameters in the sparse injection paradigm, such as mIPSCs or evoked IPSCs, would also help support their conclusions.</p>
<p>The authors should validate KL overexpression and increased cell surface levels using their virus to support their overexpression conclusions.</p>
