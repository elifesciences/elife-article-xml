<title>Abstract</title><p>Elephants have elaborate trunk skills and large, but poorly understood brains. Here we study trunk representations in elephant trigeminal nuclei, which form large protrusions on the ventral brainstem. Dense vascularization and intense cytochrome-oxidase reactivity distinguish several elongated putative trunk modules, which repeat in the anterior-posterior direction; our analysis focuses on the most anterior and largest of the units, the putative nucleus principalis trunk module. Module neuron density is low and glia outnumbers neurons by ∼108:1. Dendritic trees are elongated along the axis of axon bundles (myelin stripes) transversing the trunk module. Furthermore, synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography suggests myelin-stripe-axons transverse the trunk module. We show a remarkable correspondence of trunk module myelin stripes and trunk folds. Myelin stripes show little relation to trigeminal neurons and stripe-axons appear to often go nowhere; these observations suggest to the possibility that myelin-stripes might serve to separate trunk-fold domains rather than to connect neurons. The myelin-stripes-to-folds mapping allowed to determine neural magnification factors, which changed from 1000:1 proximally to 5:1 in the trunk finger. Asian elephants have fewer (∼640,000) trunk-module neurons than Africans (∼740,000) and show enlarged representations of trunk parts involved in object wrapping. We conclude the elephant trigeminal trunk module is exquisitely organized into trunk-fold-related units.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and rely on their trunks to acquire huge amounts of food. The trunk is a fusion organ of the nose and upper lip. Nose lip fusion occurs in the fourth month of elephant fetal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Fischer &amp; Trautmann, 1987</xref>; Schulz et al., in prep). The trunk is an immensely muscular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Cuvier and Dumeril, 1838</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shoshani, 1982</xref>) that contains about 90,000 muscle fascicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Longren et al., 2023</xref>). Not surprisingly, the trunk’s prime motor control structure, the facial nucleus, is very large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Maseko et al., 2013</xref>) and shows an elaborate cellular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaufmann et al., 2022</xref>). Trunks have prominent folds that differ between African (<italic>Loxodonta africana</italic>) and Asian (<italic>Elephas maximus</italic>) elephants (Schulz et al., in prep). Interestingly, the object-grasping behavior of African and Asian elephants differs considerably. Asian elephants have a single trunk finger and tend to wrap their trunk around objects, whereas African elephants prefer pinching objects with their two trunk fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Racine, 1980</xref>). Elephants are skillful with their trunks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Shoshani, 1992</xref>), have a high tactile sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Dehnhardt, Friese, and Sachser, 1997</xref>), and even acquire dexterous manipulative behaviors such as banana peeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Kaufmann et al., 2023</xref>). Tactile feedback is of great significance for trunk behaviors, because elephants have only limited visual abilities. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Deiringer et al. (2023)</xref> investigated trunk whiskers and observed use-dependent whisker lateralization, dense whisker arrays on the trunk tip and the ventral trunk, and marked whisker differences between African and Asian elephants. The sensory periphery of elephant trunks was investigated in a landmark study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Rasmussen &amp; Munger (1996)</xref>, who described dense innervation patterns in the elephant fingertip. The whole elephant trunk is massively innervated by large trigeminal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sprinz, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Purkart et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The turning point in the investigation of the mammalian trigeminal system has been the description of the cortical whisker barrels by Woolsey &amp; Van der Loss (1970 and this work informed our approach to the elephant brainstem. The recognition of the cortical barrel pattern has led to thousands of follow-up studies, which included the discovery of whisker-related thalamic so-called barreloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Van der Loos, 1976</xref>) and whisker-related units in the trigeminal brainstem, so-called barrelettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ma, 1991</xref>). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey (1979)</xref> and Ma (1991) the brainstem contains several topographic trigeminal representations, which repeat in anterior to posterior direction. Specifically, these studies identified the most anterior one as the largest sensory trigeminal representation (the nucleus principalis) and several smaller more posterior trigeminal sensory nuclei. We will adopt the trigeminal terminology established by these authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey, 1979</xref>; Ma, 199).</p>
<p>A variety of excellent studies have investigated the cellular statistics of elephant brains and indicated elephant brains are not simply scaled-up mouse brains. Specifically, investigators found much lower neuronal densities in elephant brains than in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Haug, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2014</xref>). A prominent difference between small and large brains is the increased amounts of white matter in larger brains. Myelin sheaths, which give white matter its whitish shine, and the enwrapped axons are usually thought to form a supply and connectivity system, an idea we will question in our study.</p>
<p>We pursued the following questions: (i) Can candidate regions for the elephant trigeminal trunk representation be identified? (ii) If yes, can multiple sensory trigeminal nuclei be identified as in other mammals? (iii) What is the neuroanatomical structure of the elephant brainstem trunk representations? (iv) Do the elaborate myelin structures in the elephant trigeminal nuclei form an axonal supply system? (v) How does the organization of elephant brainstem trunk representations relate to the differential trunk morphology and grasping behavior of African and Asian elephants? We tentatively identified an elephant brainstem trunk module characterized by intense metabolism and vascularization. The putative trunk module contains a myelin map of trunk folds. The myelin map allows precise mapping of the neural topography of the trunk representation and reveals species differences between African and Asian elephants.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>Determining trigeminal representations in elephants is challenging because invasive recordings or invasive viral tracing methods cannot be applied. We proceeded to build a hypothesis on the elephant trigeminal brainstem trunk in six steps. First, we identified a candidate module for the brainstem trunk representation. Second, we showed that this module architecture repeats in the anterior-posterior direction in the elephant brainstem. Third, we characterized the cellular organization of this putative trunk module. Fourth, we documented a close correspondence between the myeloarchitecture of this module and the folds of the elephant trunk. Fifth, we applied synchrotron X-ray tomography to assess the microscopic architecture of myelin stripes. Sixth, we showed that species-specific differences in trunk structure have correlates in the putative trunk module.</p>

<title>A metabolically highly active, strongly vascularized putative trunk module</title>
<p>The brain of the Asian elephant cow Burma is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>. In rodents the sensory trigeminal nuclei are observed posterior to the pons. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, in a ventral view of the brain stem of Burma, about 1 cm posterior to the (large) pons, a pair of large bumps is obvious on the ventral brainstem surface. By size and pronounced protrusion, these bumps on the ventral brainstem distinguish elephant brains from those of other mammals. Much smaller bumps are seen in a similar position in the human brain, where they contain the inferior olive. Accordingly, the bumps of the elephant brain have been referred to as the elephant inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shoshani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Maseko et al., 2013</xref>), but our investigation did not support this idea. We sectioned the elephant medulla and stained sections for cytochrome oxidase reactivity, a mitochondrial enzyme, the activity of which is closely related to tissue energy consumption. Trigeminal nuclei tend to show intense activity in cytochrome oxidase reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ma, 1991</xref>). A cytochrome oxidase-stained coronal section through the bump of the Asian elephant bull Raj is shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>. We found that the bump contained the most intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity in the elephant brainstem and (to the extent that we performed such staining in other brain regions) the rest of the elephant brain. Three cytochrome-reactive modules (a putative trunk module, a putative nostril module, and a putative lower lip/jaw) are obvious, the largest of which we refer to as a putative trunk module (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). The putative trunk module is elongated and we hypothesize that a particularly intensely cytochrome oxidase reactive region at the ventrolateral pole of the module corresponds to the dorsal finger representation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, D). We provide a detailed justification for our assignments of a putative trunk module, a putative nostril module, and a putative lower lip/jaw trigeminal module in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>. We also studied brain stem sections in the African elephant (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) and identified a similar putative trunk module there. We investigated the vascularization of this module, which was evident from the cytochrome oxidase reactivity of erythrocytes in blood vessels of our non-perfused elephant brains (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) and found that the trunk module stands out from the rest of the brainstem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). Specifically, it contains about twice as many blood vessels per volume as the remainder of the brainstem (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). In parasagittal sections, the putative trunk module had a compact appearance much like the trigeminal nuclei of other mammals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>). In parasagittal sections lateral to the putative trunk module we observed a nucleus with a very distinct banded cellular appearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>), a cellular architecture characteristic of the inferior olive of other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Brodal et al. 1980</xref>). We conclude that the elephant brainstem contains a large, highly vascularized, and highly cytochrome-oxidase reactive elongated putative trunk module.</p>

<title>Trigeminal nuclei in coronal and horizontal sections of African elephant brainstem</title>
<p>We found that putatively trunk-related trigeminal modules repeat at least two and probably four times in the anterior-posterior direction in the elephant brainstem. All these repeating modules had a higher cytochrome oxidase reactivity and a higher cell density than surrounding brainstem structures. Such repeats of trigeminal representations in the anterior-posterior direction are also seen in other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ma, 1991</xref>). We refer to these modules with the same terminology as established in rodents. As in other mammals, we found the most anterior representation to be larger than the others, and we refer to this representation as nucleus principalis (Pr5, which stands for principal trigeminal nucleus). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows a Nissl-stained coronal section through the principalis trigeminal modules. In <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>, C we provide a color-coded putative assignment of principalis modules. We assigned the large (grey) module to the trunk, because of its cytochrome oxidase reactivity, its elongation, and its extraordinary size. We assigned the elongated (red/pink) module to the nostril for the following reasons: 1. its unusually (among brainstem modules) thin tube-like appearance. 2. The widening towards the tip of the putative trunk module. 3. The cellular continuity with the mouth opening of the putative trunk module. 4. The topographic relationship with the lower jaw module, which matched the topography of the elephant head (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). 5. The fact that this module had the same length as the trunk module. 6. The fact that there were no indications of a nostril module inside the putative trunk module, (where we initially expected a nostril representation). Our reasons for assigning the compact (blue) module to the lower jaw were its shape (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-C</xref>) and topographic position. Next, we provide an overview of the arrangement of trigeminal modules in horizontal sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D-F</xref>, proceeding from dorsal to ventral). At the dorsal level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>) only two trunk modules (TM), can be recognized. These are Pr5 and Sp5o, which stands for spinal trigeminal nucleus pars oralis TM, directly posterior to the Pr5. The cell density is low, the modules barely stand out from the surroundings and we think that at the dorsal level proximal trunk parts are represented. At the midlevel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>) four repeating trunk modules (Pr5 TM, Sp5o TM, and Sp5i, which stands for spinal trigeminal nucleus pars interpolaris, and Sp5c, which stands for spinal trigeminal nucleus pars caudalis TM) can be recognized. We did not investigate facial representations other the trunk module. The identification of the Sp5i and Sp5c trunk modules is only tentative at this point. The analysis of horizontal and parasagittal sections pointed to a mirror image-like arrangement of these modules. The cell density is higher at midlevel (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). At the ventral level (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>) only two trunk modules (Pr5 and Sp5o TM, directly posterior to the principalis) can be recognized. In this section, the mirror image-like arrangement of the Pr5 TM and the Sp5o TM is evident. The cell density is very high and we think that the trunk tip is represented here. We conclude that repeating trigeminal trunk modules can be recognized in the elephant brainstem.</p>

<title>The cellular architecture of the putative principalis trunk module</title>
<p>We studied the module’s cellular organization by Golgi stains of the putative principalis trunk module of the Asian elephant Raj (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Golgi stains identified two prominent neuronal elements. First, we observed bundles of large diameter (3-15 µm) axons, which run orthogonal to the module’s main axis in coronal sections (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> arrows). These axon bundles correspond to the myelin stripes described in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>. Somato-dendritically stained neurons were the second neuronal element identified by Golgi stains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>). The density of Golgi-stained neurons was very low. We reconstructed neurons using a Neurolucida system and superimposed 47 neurons (from three adjacent sections) in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>. The most abundant cells in the trigeminal nucleus were putative astrocytes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, green). We distinguished two types of neurons, putative principal neurons with large somata and branched dendrites (n = 41; black in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>) and other neurons, putative interneurons, with small somata and unbranched dendrites (n = 6; red in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Putative astrocytes, principal neurons, and interneurons differed markedly in their morphologies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The dendritic trees of neurons were elongated (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>), an observation confirmed when we prepared raw polar plots of dendritic orientation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, upper). We had the impression that dendritic elongation and axon bundles followed the same axis. We tested the idea that dendritic trees were aligned to myelin stripes was by rotating dendritic trees and aligning all trees according to the local axon bundle orientations. When we aligned dendritic trees this way, we observed an even stronger population polarization of dendritic trees, i.e., dendritic trees were average twofold longer along the axon bundle axis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, lower).</p>

Neuronal density was fairly low, but the density of non-neuronal cells was substantial (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3H</xref>). In counts of individual fluorescence sections, we observed a ratio of neurons to putative glia of 1 to 80 (in one elephant). We then made more systematic counts of neurons vs. visually identified glia across three entire trunk modules from two elephants. We then observed a ratio of 1 neuron to 108 ± 24 glia. We also observed that neuron size was not homogeneous across the putative trunk module. We observed a cell size increase from proximal to distal in all putative modules (n = 12), for which we had cellular stains. To quantify cell size differences, we drew somata from a Nissl-stained section through the center of the trunk module of the African elephant cow Indra (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3I</xref>). We found cell size to increase significantly from the putative proximal to the putative distal finger representation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3J</xref>). We conclude that the putative trunk module contains transversally running axon bundles and neurons, which are vastly outnumbered by glia.</p>

<title>Module myelin stripes match with number, orientation, and patterning of trunk folds</title>
<p>In Nissl or cytochrome-oxidase stains, we observed prominent myelin stripes apparent as white omissions. Remarkably, entirely unstained freshly-cut coronal brainstem sections showed the clearest stripe pattern in brightfield microscopy (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). Fluorescent stains for myelin (fluomyelin) confirmed the presence of myelin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). As already suggested by Golgi staining, the myelin stripes appeared to consist of large-diameter axons. The visibility of myelin stripes varied with the sectioning plane and anterior-posterior position. Myelin stripes were most obvious at the anterior-posterior center of the putative trunk module, as seen for the coronal section in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>. We investigated the myelin-stripe trunk correspondence. To this end, we made drawings of myelin stripes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) and compared the pattern of myelin stripes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> upper) to the pattern of trunk folds of Indra’s trunk (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>, F). Myelin stripe and trunk fold patterns were very similar. In all trunk modules sectioned, we observed an overall match of stripe and trunk fold orientation (to the module and trunk main axis, respectively). We also observed in all modules a lack of fully transversing stripes in the putative finger region of the module, which is consistent with the lack of folds across the trunk ‘mouth’. In favorable cases, where we had brightfield images of the trunk module and had access to the elephant’s trunk, the data hinted at a 1 to 1 matching of stripes and folds. Specifically, we observed 65 myelin stripes ending on the dorsal side of the module, 46 ventrally ending myelin stripes, and 31 full transversal myelin stripes. In terms of folds, we observed 64 dorsal trunk folds (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>), 49 folds on the ventral side of the trunk, and 32 folds that fully transversed the right side of Indra’s trunk. This numeric correspondence is very suggestive and inspired a detailed mapping of trunk sensory topography (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref> lower). Based on stripe-wrinkle matching, we suggest that sensory magnification increases from 1000:1 (trunk: trigeminal nucleus) in the proximal representation of the trunk module to 5:1 in the trunk-finger representation. Sectioning angle was a major factor determining match between myelin stripes and folds., i.e. we observed myelin stripes in trunk fold-like patterns in all coronally sectioned specimens. In horizontally sectioned elephant brainstem, myelin stripes were seen but could not be related to folds. In parasagitally sectioned brainstems few myelin stripes were obvious. In coronal sections, myelin stripes were most obvious in the center of the module and matched best to trunk folds. The staining method was another determinant of the match. Myelin stripes were best visible in unstained freshly cut sections with brightfield microscopy. As expected, myelin stripes were also stained positively for fluorescent myelin dyes, such as fluomyelin-green (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>) or fluomyelin-red (data not shown). Nissl or cytochrome oxidase stains were less sensitive than visualizing myelin stripes in brightfield images, i.e. not all stripes are visible in each section. While in some sections like the one shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>, pretty much all stripes could be mapped to trunk folds, most sections contained a few stripes that had deviating trajectories from the other stripes and these stripes could not be mapped to trunk folds. A good match of myelin stripes to folds depended also on the assessment of trunk folds. Specifically, a good match was only obtained, if we restricted folds counts to major trunk wrinkles/folds, minor trunk wrinkles appear not to be robustly represented by myelin stripes. We conclude myelin stripe patterns behave not unlike rodent cortical barrel patterns, the visibility of which also greatly depends on the staining method and sectioning angle.</p>

<title>Myelin stripe architecture and the lack of a relation of stripes to trigeminal neurons</title>
<p>Their large size makes determining the architecture of myelin stripes is a challenging. To confront this challenge, we applied synchrotron-powered X-ray phase-contrast tomography of an 8 mm unstained and paraffin-embedded trigeminal nucleus tissue punch (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A,B</xref>); based on phase-contrast this methodology allows us to sample large image volumes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>) with submicrometer (0.65 µm isotropic voxel size) resolution. Such imaging allowed us to identify myelin stripes in unstained trigeminal tissue (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>) and even enabled the reconstruction of individual large-diameter axons for several millimeters through the entire volume image (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). As observed before with light microscopy, myelin stripes ran in the coronal plane and were about seven myelinated axons wide (maximum extent in the coronal plane; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F</xref>). Myelin stripes were circular axon bundles (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>) and were also about seven myelinated axons high (maximum extent in the anterior-posterior plane; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). With that, we estimated that stripes are made up of 20-50 myelinated axons, unmyelinated axons could not be resolved in our analysis. The large-diameter axons, which could be followed through the X-ray tomography volume image followed an ‘all the way’ pattern (i.e. fully transversing the module). We also found that myelin stripes have a fairly consistent thickness from their dorsal to their ventral end (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>). This observation argues against the idea that myelin stripes are conventional axonal supply structures, from which axons divert off into the tissue. We also analyzed myelin stripes throughout the trunk module (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>) to understand how their thickness relates to trigeminal neuron numbers (i.e. the number of neurons between myelin stripes; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5J</xref>). We observed little obvious relation between myelin stripe thickness and trigeminal neuron number. We conclude that myelin stripes have a stereotyped architecture, but show little relation to trigeminal neurons.</p>

<title>The putative trunk module mirrors species differences in trunk folds and trunk use</title>
<p>We found that the trigeminal bumps on the ventral brainstem differ significantly between African and Asian elephants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6A</xref>). We counted neurons in the principalis trunk module and found that African elephants (740210 ± 51902, mean ± SD) had more neurons than Asian elephants (636447 ± 69729, mean ± SD) and also had a larger volume principalis trunk module (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Tables 2</xref> and <xref rid="tbls3" ref-type="table">3</xref> provide further information on our counts of the trigeminal nuclei. As noted there, the dorsal finger accounted for a large fraction (∼20%) of the trunk modules. We wondered, why brainstem bumps differed between African and Asian elephants, and therefore closely investigated the shape of trunk modules in these species. A cytochrome-oxidase stained coronal section through the trunk module of the African elephant Indra is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>. Drawings of coronal sections from this trunk module and the trunk module of other African elephants are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>; myelin stripes (violet) were visible as whitish omissions of the cytochrome oxidase or of Nissl stains. We also determined the length, the width, and the longitudinal position of the greatest width of the module (black line; <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). A cytochrome-oxidase-stained coronal section through the trunk module of Asian elephant Raj is shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and drawings from this and other trunk modules of Asian elephants are shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6F</xref>. Basic aspects of the module trunk were similar in African and Asian elephants (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C-F</xref>), but the details differed. First, the African elephant trunk modules had fewer and thicker myelin stripes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>, F); this is a most interesting observation since African elephants have fewer trunk folds than Asian elephants. Second, African elephant trunk modules were significantly longer but not wider (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6G</xref>). Asian elephant trunk modules had a much more belly-shaped appearance than African elephant trunk modules. The greatest width of the Asian elephant trunk module is at positions representing the trunk wrapping zone, which we determined from photographs. African elephant trunk modules were also significantly more ‘top-heavy’, i.e. they had their widest point much closer to the putative trunk tip (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6H</xref>). We suggest that the shape differences between African and Asian elephant trunk modules might be related to the different grasping strategies of these two elephant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Racine, 1980</xref>). African elephants have two fingers and tend to pinch objects (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6I</xref>; upper), a grasping strategy that emphasizes the trunk tip in line with their ‘top-heavy’ trunk module. Asian elephants in contrast have only one finger and tend to wrap objects with their trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Racine, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>; lower). This grasping strategy engages more of the trunk and, in line with this behavior, the width of the Asian elephant trigeminal nucleus i is maximal in the trunk wrapping area.</p>

<title>The ventral brainstem bumps likely correspond to elephant trigeminal nuclei</title>
<p>Establishing elephant brainstem organization is challenging because both tracing methods and <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology cannot be applied to elephants. Our assignments of trigeminal nuclei deviate from earlier suggestions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shoshani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Maseko et al., 2013</xref>), which assigned the putative trigeminal nuclei as inferior olive, and the structure identified as inferior olive, as trigeminal nuclei. For several reasons we think the ventral brainstem bumps correspond to the elephant trigeminal nuclei: 1. Their intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity, which is characteristic of the trigeminal nuclei of tactile specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ma, 1991</xref>; Catania bet al. 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Sawyer et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Sawyer et al. 2015</xref>). 2. The large size of the putative trunk module, which matches with large infraorbital nerve of elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Purkart et al., 2022</xref>). 3. The elongation of the putative trunk module, which aligns with the trunk shape. 4. The arrangement of putative trigeminal modules (trunk module, nostril module, lower jaw module) that matches with elephant head topography. 5. The matching of module myelin stripes to trunk folds. 6. The position of putative trigeminal nuclei behind the pons, matches the position of the trigeminal nucleus in other mammals. 7. The organization of the trigeminal nuclei in modules repeating in the anterior-posterior direction, which is similar to other mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Belford &amp; Killackey, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Ma, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>The idea that ventral brainstem bumps correspond to inferior olive and that the laterally placed nuclei (referred to as inferior olive by us) correspond to the trigeminal nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Shoshani et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Maseko et al., 2013</xref>) is not viable: 1. The lateral nuclei (referred to as inferior olive by us) have the characteristic laminar cellular arrangement seen in the inferior olive of all mammals. 2. There are no indications of trigeminal-like modules in the lateral nuclei. 3. The lateral nuclei are not organized in modules repeating in the anterior-posterior direction, an arrangement seen in the trigeminal nuclei of other mammals 4. The ventral brainstem bumps (referred to as trigeminal nuclei by us) do not have the characteristic laminar cellular arrangement seen in the inferior olive of all mammals. 5. The very intense staining for cytochrome oxidase reactivity, seen in the ventral brainstem bumps, is not characteristic of the mammalian inferior olive. A synopsis of the above arguments suggests that the elephant trigeminal nuclei very likely correspond to the ventral brainstem bumps.</p>

<title>Detailed neuroanatomic mapping of elephant trigeminal nuclei</title>
<p>Our work provided detailed mapping of the elephant trigeminal brainstem into four repeating nuclei, consisting of several facial modules (most prominently the trunk module, the nostril module, and the lower jaw module). Because of the level of detail of our topography suggestions, however, we think it will be relatively straightforward to test the validity of our topography suggestions. Specifically, we predict that the dorsal trunk finger representation of the principalis trunk module will be connected with the distal part of the dorsal subnucleus of the facial nucleus (which contains the putative motor representation of the dorsal trunk finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaufmann et al., 2022</xref>)). We would also predict that the dorsal trunk finger representation of the principalis trunk module will be connected with the dorsal trunk finger representation of the oralis nucleus. These connectivity suggestions are in the 1-2 cm range and can be tested with postmortem tracers like DiI. We also predict fewer myelin stripes in trunk modules of elephants with particularly few trunk folds (newborn or fetuses of African elephants) compared to adult African elephants.</p>

<title>A myelin map of trunk folds, white matter function, and myeloarchitecture</title>
<p>According to conventional wisdom, neurons (gray matter) are the site of processing, and myelinated axons (white matter) are a subjugated supply system, whose sole function is to bring the correct axonal input to neurons. Our observations on trunk module myelin stripes are at odds with this view of myelin. Specifically, myelin stripes show no tapering (which we would expect if axons divert off into the tissue). More than that, there is no correlation between myelin stripe thickness (which presumably correlates with axon numbers) and trigeminal module neuron numbers. Thus, there are numerous myelinated axons, where we observe few or no trigeminal neurons. These observations are incompatible with the idea that myelin stripes form an axonal ‘supply’ system or that their prime function is to connect neurons. What do myelin stripe axons do, if they do not connect neurons? We suggest that myelin stripes serve to separate rather than connect neurons. Specifically, trunk module myelin stripes look like a map of trunk folds. Myelin stripes match with the number, orientation, and species-specific patterning of trunk folds. We note that if myelin stripes would behave as an axonal ‘supply’ system, they would be very thin/invisible in the proximal trunk, proximal trunk folds would not be visible, and distal stripes should be very thick. If myelinated axons have a life of their own and do not simply go where they find target neurons, we need to analyze them in novel ways. In particular, it seems to be a good idea to ‘look’ at patterns of myelination, rather than to immediately assume that this is a supply/connectivity system. We note early neuroanatomists like Oskar Vogt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Vogt, 1911</xref>; Niewenhuys, Broere &amp; Cerliani, 2015) described incredibly intricate patterns of intracortical myeloarchitecture, patterns that are not easily explained in terms of a connectivity system to this day. In conclusion, we propose a novel white-matter function, which is to separate and functionally demarcate neurons as opposed to the conventionally assumed white-matter function of connecting neurons.</p>

<title>Trigeminal organization in Asian and African elephants</title>
<p>At first sight, Asian and African elephant trigeminal nuclei are very similar. Both elephants have big ventral brainstem bumps, which contain the same modules (a putative trunk, nostril, and lower jaw module) and the nuclei stain intensely for cytochrome oxidase reactivity. A closer look reveals species differences, however, which may relate to the different trunk grasping strategies of Asian and African elephants. The first difference refers to the shape of the ventral brainstem bump, which is more roundish and shorter in Asian elephants and more elongated in African elephants. To our knowledge, this ventral brainstem bump is the only hitherto described difference, which allows us to differentiate Asian and African elephant brains from the outside. The length difference between Asian and African elephant ventral bumps reflects the different shapes of Asian and African elephant trunk modules. The African elephant trunk module is notably longer, more slender, and more top-heavy than the swaged Asian elephant trunk module. As we pointed out in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, such differences imply an enlargement of the trunk wrapping zone in the Asian elephant trunk module, in line with the object-wrapping behavior of Asian elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Racine 1980</xref>). Similarly, the top-heavy shape of the African elephant trunk module could be instrumental in the object-pinching of African elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Racine, 1980</xref>). These trigeminal differences are reminiscent of similar Asian-African species differences in the elephant facial nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaufmann et al., 2022</xref>). We conclude that grasping behavior shapes the species-specific architecture of the trigeminal nuclei.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The elephant brainstem is exquisitely well-ordered and contains very large and detailed trigeminal representations. Trunk module myelin stripes form a map of trunk folds and accordingly serve to functionally separate neurons rather than to connect them. Further work should test the predictions of sensory topographies outlined here and ask, what further insights the elephant brain provides about the organization of gray and white matter.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Our methods were described in detail in our recent publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaufmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Purkart et al., 2022</xref>) and we only repeat key aspects here.</p>
<sec id="s6a">
<title>Elephant specimens</title>
<p>All specimens came from zoo elephants and were collected by the Leibniz-IZW (Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin) over the last three decades in agreement with CITES regulations. All animals included in the study died of natural causes or were euthanized by experienced zoo veterinarians for humanitarian reasons, because of insurmountable health complications. An overview of the elephant specimen used in this study is provided in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.</p>
<sec id="s6a1">
<title>Asian elephants, Elephas maximus</title>
<p>Data from four-year-old elephant bull Raj (Tierpark Hagenbeck, Germany), from the adult Asian elephant cow Burma (52 years old, Zoo Augsburg, Germany), and from the Asian elephant cow Dumba (44 years old, elephant farm Platschow, Germany). Different data were derived from the various Asian elephant specimens.</p>

<sec id="s6a2">
<title>African savanna elephants, Loxodonta africana</title>
<p>Data from four adult African elephant cows: Zimba (39 years old, Opel-Zoo Kronberg, Germany), the 34-year-old elephant cow Indra (Platschow), and Bambi (38 years old, Hungary). Different data were derived from the various African elephant specimens.</p>

<sec id="s6a3">
<title>Specimen condition</title>
<p>Specimen conditions varied widely in our study (for details see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaufmann et al., 2022</xref>). Some heads or other material reached us frozen and none of the elephant heads/brains were perfused. Even though many of the animals included were dissected by professional veterinarians, the preservation of material varied across specimens. A variety of reasons contribute to the suboptimal preservation of elephant material. Specifically, it often takes days to dissect elephants and the animals’ carcasses cool down only very slowly. Furthermore, the freezing leads to freezing artifacts, and even in extracted brains fixative action is slow, because of elephant brain size. Some of these problems are discussed and have been partially solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Shoshani, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Manger et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="s6b1">
<title>Elephant preparation</title>
<p>In adult elephants, heads and trunks were removed at the respective zoos and the remaining skull was trimmed with motorized saws and axes at the Leibniz-IZW Berlin. Some of the brains from trimmed skulls of adult elephants were extracted by Francisca Egelhofer and Aniston Sebastiampillai at the Neuropathology of the Charité, Berlin.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6b2">
<title>Trigeminal nucleus extraction</title>
<p>We proceeded with trigeminal nucleus collection after extraction of the brain and dura removal followed by several weeks of fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. To remove trigeminal nuclei, we positioned entire elephant brains with their ventral side up in a dissection tray. We then dissected away blood vessels and the pia arachnoidea from the elephant brain stem. To dissect out trigeminal nuclei we oriented ourselves at the trigeminal nuclei bump shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>.</p>

<title>Trigeminal nucleus sectioning, preparation, and staining</title>
<p>Trigeminal nuclei were stained for Nissl-substance. Most trigeminal nuclei were sectioned in 60 µm thickness with our cryotome. A series of sections were processed, alternating with Nissl and antibody staining (NeuN antibodies). We also performed Golgi and Cytochrome oxidase reactivity. The antibody staining procedure followed the protocols described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Purkart et al., 2022</xref> and Kaufmann et al., 2022. For Golgi staining, brains were only minimally fixated (1 day 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer). Staining was performed with a commercial kit (Rapid Golgi Kit, Gentaur, Aachen Germany). Sections for Golgi staining were cut at a thickness of 200 µm.</p>

<title>Cellular measurements, somata drawings, and neuronal reconstructions</title>
<p>Thin Nissl-stained sections were viewed with Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, USA) employing an Olympus BX51 microscope (Olympus, Japan) with an MBFCX9000 camera (MBF Bioscience, Williston, USA) mounted on the microscope. The microscope was equipped with a motorized stage (LUDL Electronics, Hawthorne, USA) and a z-encoder (Heidenhain, Schaumburg, USA). Stereo Investigator software was used for stereological procedures, cell size, and axon diameter measurement and for acquiring images. Drawings of neural somata were also generated from Nissl-stained sections on this system. Digitized images were adjusted for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, Calif., USA), but they were not otherwise altered.</p>
<p>Neuronal reconstructions were prepared from Golgi stains on a Neurolucida system (Microbrightfield, USA).</p>

<sec id="s6e">
<title>Stereology based on the optical fractionator</title>
<p>We used an optical-fractionator approach to quantify cell numbers in the trigeminal nuclei. An overview of the results and counting parameters used in our study is provided in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>. Here estimated the total number with Stereo Investigator software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, USA) using a sampling scheme called the optical-fractionator method. Our region of interest was identified and outlined at low (2x objective) magnifications. The neurons were identified by their shape staining intensity and large size at high magnification (20x) and counted individually. Without exception, the trigeminal trunk module was well-defined by a higher neuron density than the surrounding brain structures. The standard stereological sampling scheme is independent of volume, measurements, and shrinkage because the number of neurons is estimated directly without referring to neuron densities. Using the optical-fractionator technique, we counted the nucleoli that came into focus and fell within the acceptance lines of the dissector, which were randomly placed on the series of sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Kaufmann et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>We counted neurons in the Nissl stains of 9 trigeminal nuclei of 6 elephants. We used the following parameters. The dissector laid a grid of squares over our region of interest with a size of 2000 x 1000 μm², where we counted the neurons at each dissector in the counting frame area of 350 x 350 μm<sup>2.</sup> At each counting frame, we counted between 0 and 15 neurons. Around 1000 neurons were counted in each trigeminal nucleus to assess the total number of neurons (see <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The entire elephant trigeminal nucleus spanned ∼400 60-µm-sections in adult animals, every 20<sup>th</sup> section was counted. The guard zone was set to zero. The mean thickness measured at every counting site was measured to be around 18 µm and used to estimate the total number of neurons.</p>

<title>Paraffin embedding for X-ray phase-contrast tomography</title>
<p>A 2 x 2 x 2 cm³ sized trigeminal brainstem piece of an African elephant Bambi was immersed in an ascending ethanol series of 20/50/70% (1 d each) at 4 °C one week before paraffin embedding. Subsequently, the sample was infiltrated by first acetone, then xylol, and finally paraffin in an automatized vacuum paraffin infiltration processor. After cooling and hardening of the paraffin embedded sample overnight we obtained an 8 mm biopsy punch from the putative finger region of the trigeminal brainstem region.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6g">
<title>Synchrotron X-ray tomography</title>
<p>X-ray phase contrast volumes of the unstained and paraffin-embedded trigeminal nucleus were scanned with an unfocused, quasi-parallel synchrotron beam (PB) at the GINIX endstation, at a photon energy E<sub>ph</sub> of 13.8 keV, selected by a Si(111) monochromator. Projections were recorded by a microscope detection system (Optique Peter, France) with a 50-m-thick LuAG: Ce scintillator and a 10× magnifying microscope objective onto a sCMOS sensor (pco. edge 5.5, PCO, Germany) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Frohn et al., 2020</xref>). This configuration enables a field-of-view (FOV) of 1.6 mm × 1.4 mm, sampled at a pixel size of 650 nm. The continuous scan mode of the setup allows the acquisition of a tomographic recording with 3000 projections over 360° in less than 2 min. Afterward, dark field and flat field images were acquired.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s6h">
<title>Phase retrieval and tomographic reconstruction</title>
<p>First, the raw detector images were corrected by dark subtraction and empty beam division. In addition, hot pixel and detector sensitivity variations were removed by local median filtering. A local ring removal was applied around areas where wavefront distortions from upstream window materials did not perfectly cancel out after empty beam division. Phase retrieval was performed for each projection, using the linear CTF approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Cloetens et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), implemented in the HoloTomoToolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lohse et al., 2020</xref>). This implementation allows both for formulation of additional constraints as well as a nonlinear with iterative minimization of a Tikhonov-functional starting from the CTF result as an initial guess. However, for the unstained samples shown here, this was not found to be necessary. Apart from phase retrieval, the HoloTomoToolbox provides auxiliary functions, which help to refine the Fresnel number or to identify the tilt and shift of the axis of rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Lohse et al., 2020</xref>). Tomographic reconstruction of the datasets was performed by the ASTRA toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Aarle et al., 2016</xref>; van Aarle et al., 2015, using the iradon-function and a Ram-Lak filter.</p>

<sec id="s6i">
<title>Volume image segmentation</title>
<p>Tomographic images were segmented in an extended version of the Amira software (AmiraZIBEdition 2022.17, Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany). A combination of the ‘lasso’ and ‘brush’ tools was used to manually label the axons and myelin stripes within the volume image. Labels were placed every 5 – 50 images and interpolated in between.</p>

<p>This potentially <bold>valuable</bold> study uses classic neuroanatomical techniques and synchrotron X-ray tomography to investigate the mapping of the trunk within the brainstem nuclei of the elephant brain. Given its unique specializations, understanding the somatosensory projections from the elephant trunk would be of general interest to evolutionary neurobiologists, comparative neuroscientists, and animal behavior scientists. However, the anatomical analysis is <bold>inadequate</bold> to support the authors' conclusion that they have identified the elephant trigeminal sensory nuclei rather than a different brain region, specifically the inferior olive.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
This fundamental study provides compelling neuroanatomical evidence underscoring the sensory function of the trunk in African and Asian elephants. Whereas myelinated tracts are classically appreciated as mediating neuronal connections, the authors speculate that myelinated bundles provide functional separation of trunk folds and display elaboration related to the &quot;finger&quot; projections. The authors avail themselves of many classical neuroanatomical techniques (including cytochrome oxidase stains, Golgi stains, and myelin stains) along with modern synchrotron X-ray tomography. This work will be of interest to evolutionary neurobiologists, comparative neuroscientists, and the general public, with its fascinating exploration of the brainstem of an icon sensory specialist.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
- The authors made excellent use of the precious sample materials from 9 captive elephants.</p>
<p>
- The authors adopt a battery of neuroanatomical techniques to comprehensively characterize the structure of the trigeminal subnuclei and properly re-examine the &quot;inferior olive&quot;.</p>
<p>
- Based on their exceptional histological preparation, the authors reveal broadly segregated patterns of metabolic activity, similar to the classical &quot;barrel&quot; organization related to rodent whiskers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
- As the authors acknowledge, somewhat limited functional description can be provided using histological analysis (compared to more invasive techniques).</p>
<p>
- The correlation between myelinated stripes and trunk fold patterns is intriguing, and Figure 4 presents this idea beautifully. I wonder - is the number of stripes consistent with the number of trunk folds? Does this hold for both species?</p>

<p>The authors describe what they assert to be a very unusual trigeminal nuclear complex in the brainstem of elephants, and based on this, follow with many speculations about how the trigeminal nuclear complex, as identified by them, might be organized in terms of the sensory capacity of the elephant trunk.</p>
<p>The identification of the trigeminal nuclear complex/inferior olivary nuclear complex in the elephant brainstem is the central pillar of this manuscript from which everything else follows, and if this is incorrect, then the entire manuscript fails, and all the associated speculations become completely unsupported.</p>
<p>The authors note that what they identify as the trigeminal nuclear complex has been identified as the inferior olivary nuclear complex by other authors, citing Shoshani et al. (2006; 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2006.03.016) and Maseko et al (2013; 10.1159/000352004), but fail to cite either Verhaart and Kramer (1958; PMID 13841799) or Verhaart (1962; 10.1515/9783112519882-001). These four studies are in agreement, but the current study differs.</p>
<p>Let's assume for the moment that the four previous studies are all incorrect and the current study is correct. This would mean that the entire architecture and organization of the elephant brainstem is significantly rearranged in comparison to ALL other mammals, including humans, previously studied (e.g. Kappers et al. 1965, The Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System of Vertebrates, Including Man, Volume 1 pp. 668-695) and the closely related manatee (10.1002/ar.20573). This rearrangement necessitates that the trigeminal nuclei would have had to &quot;migrate&quot; and shorten rostrocaudally, specifically and only, from the lateral aspect of the brainstem where these nuclei extend from the pons through to the cervical spinal cord (e.g. the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlases), the to the spatially restricted ventromedial region of specifically and only the rostral medulla oblongata. According to the current paper, the inferior olivary complex of the elephant is very small and located lateral to their trigeminal nuclear complex, and the region from where the trigeminal nuclei are located by others appears to be just &quot;lateral nuclei&quot; with no suggestion of what might be there instead.</p>
<p>Such an extraordinary rearrangement of brainstem nuclei would require a major transformation in the manner in which the mutations, patterning, and expression of genes and associated molecules during development occur. Such a major change is likely to lead to lethal phenotypes, making such a transformation extremely unlikely. Variations in mammalian brainstem anatomy are most commonly associated with quantitative changes rather than qualitative changes (10.1016/B978-0-12-804042-3.00045-2).</p>
<p>The impetus for the identification of the unusual brainstem trigeminal nuclei in the current study rests upon a previous study from the same laboratory (10.1016/j.cub.2021.12.051) that estimated that the number of axons contained in the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the sensory surfaces of the trunk is approximately 400 000. Is this number unusual? In a much smaller mammal with a highly specialized trigeminal system, the platypus, the number of axons innervating the sensory surface of the platypus bill skin comes to 1 344 000 (10.1159/000113185). Yet, there is no complex rearrangement of the brainstem trigeminal nuclei in the brain of the developing or adult platypus (Ashwell, 2013, Neurobiology of Monotremes), despite the brainstem trigeminal nuclei being very large in the platypus (10.1159/000067195). Even in other large-brained mammals, such as large whales that do not have a trunk, the number of axons in the trigeminal nerve ranges between 400,000 and 500,000 (10.1007/978-3-319-47829-6_988-1). The lack of comparative support for the argument forwarded in the previous and current study from this laboratory, and that the comparative data indicates that the brainstem nuclei do not change in the manner suggested in the elephant, argues against the identification of the trigeminal nuclei as outlined in the current study. Moreover, the comparative studies undermine the prior claim of the authors, informing the current study, that &quot;the elephant trigeminal ganglion ... point to a high degree of tactile specialization in elephants&quot; (10.1016/j.cub.2021.12.051). While clearly, the elephant has tactile sensitivity in the trunk, it is questionable as to whether what has been observed in elephants is indeed &quot;truly extraordinary&quot;.</p>
<p>But let's look more specifically at the justification outlined in the current study to support their identification of the unusually located trigeminal sensory nuclei of the brainstem.</p>
<p>(1) Intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity.</p>
<p>
(2) Large size of the putative trunk module.</p>
<p>
(3) Elongation of the putative trunk module.</p>
<p>
(4) The arrangement of these putative modules corresponds to elephant head anatomy.</p>
<p>
(5) Myelin stripes within the putative trunk module that apparently match trunk folds.</p>
<p>
(6) Location apparently matches other mammals.</p>
<p>
(7) Repetitive modular organization apparently similar to other mammals.</p>
<p>
(8) The inferior olive described by other authors lacks the lamellated appearance of this structure in other mammals.</p>
<p>Let's examine these justifications more closely.</p>
<p>(1) Cytochrome oxidase histochemistry is typically used as an indicative marker of neuronal energy metabolism. The authors indicate, based on the &quot;truly extraordinary&quot; somatosensory capacities of the elephant trunk, that any nuclei processing this tactile information should be highly metabolically active, and thus should react intensely when stained for cytochrome oxidase. We are told in the methods section that the protocols used are described by Purkart et al (2022) and Kaufmann et al (2022). In neither of these cited papers is there any description, nor mention, of the cytochrome oxidase histochemistry methodology, thus we have no idea of how this histochemical staining was done. To obtain the best results for cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, the tissue is either processed very rapidly after buffer perfusion to remove blood or in recently perfusion-fixed tissue (e.g., 10.1016/0165-0270(93)90122-8). Given: (1) the presumably long post-mortem interval between death and fixation - &quot;it often takes days to dissect elephants&quot;; (2) subsequent fixation of the brains in 4% paraformaldehyde for &quot;several weeks&quot;; (3) The intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity in the inferior olivary complex of the laboratory rat (Gonzalez-Lima, 1998, Cytochrome oxidase in neuronal metabolism and Alzheimer's diseases); and (4) The lack of any comparative images from other stained portions of the elephant brainstem; it is difficult to support the justification as forwarded by the authors. The histochemical staining observed is likely background reactivity from the use of diaminobenzidine in the staining protocol. Thus, this first justification is unsupported.</p>
<p>Justifications (2), (3), and (4) are sequelae from justification (1). In this sense, they do not count as justifications, but rather unsupported extensions.</p>
<p>(4) and (5) These are interesting justifications, as the paper has clear internal contradictions, and (5) is a sequelae of (4). The reader is led to the concept that the myelin tracts divide the nuclei into sub-modules that match the folding of the skin on the elephant trunk. One would then readily presume that these myelin tracts are in the incoming sensory axons from the trigeminal nerve. However, the authors note that this is not the case: &quot;Our observations on trunk module myelin stripes are at odds with this view of myelin. Specifically, myelin stripes show no tapering (which we would expect if axons divert off into the tissue). More than that, there is no correlation between myelin stripe thickness (which presumably correlates with axon numbers) and trigeminal module neuron numbers. Thus, there are numerous myelinated axons, where we observe few or no trigeminal neurons. These observations are incompatible with the idea that myelin stripes form an axonal 'supply' system or that their prime function is to connect neurons. What do myelin stripe axons do, if they do not connect neurons? We suggest that myelin stripes serve to separate rather than connect neurons.&quot; So, we are left with the observation that the myelin stripes do not pass afferent trigeminal sensory information from the &quot;truly extraordinary&quot; trunk skin somatic sensory system, and rather function as units that separate neurons - but to what end? It appears that the myelin stripes are more likely to be efferent axonal bundles leaving the nuclei (to form the olivocerebellar tract). This justification is unsupported.</p>
<p>(6) The authors indicate that the location of these nuclei matches that of the trigeminal nuclei in other mammals. This is not supported in any way. In ALL other mammals in which the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem have been reported they are found in the lateral aspect of the brainstem, bordered laterally by the spinal trigeminal tract. This is most readily seen and accessible in the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlases. The authors indicate that the trigeminal nuclei are medial to the facial nerve nucleus, but in every other species, the trigeminal sensory nuclei are found lateral to the facial nerve nucleus. This is most salient when examining a close relative, the manatee (10.1002/ar.20573), where the location of the inferior olive and the trigeminal nuclei matches that described by Maseko et al (2013) for the African elephant. This justification is not supported.</p>
<p>(7) The dual to quadruple repetition of rostrocaudal modules within the putative trigeminal nucleus as identified by the authors relies on the fact that in the neurotypical mammal, there are several trigeminal sensory nuclei arranged in a column running from the pons to the cervical spinal cord, these include (nomenclature from Paxinos and Watson in roughly rostral to caudal order) the Pr5VL, Pr5DM, Sp5O, Sp5I, and Sp5C. However, these nuclei are all located far from the midline and lateral to the facial nerve nucleus, unlike what the authors describe in the elephants. These rostrocaudal modules are expanded upon in Figure 2, and it is apparent from what is shown that the authors are attributing other brainstem nuclei to the putative trigeminal nuclei to confirm their conclusion. For example, what they identify as the inferior olive in Figure 2D is likely the lateral reticular nucleus as identified by Maseko et al (2013). This justification is not supported.</p>
<p>(8) In primates and related species, there is a distinct banded appearance of the inferior olive, but what has been termed the inferior olive in the elephant by other authors does not have this appearance, rather, and specifically, the largest nuclear mass in the region (termed the principal nucleus of the inferior olive by Maseko et al, 2013, but Pr5, the principal trigeminal nucleus in the current paper) overshadows the partial banded appearance of the remaining nuclei in the region (but also drawn by the authors of the current paper). Thus, what is at debate here is whether the principal nucleus of the inferior olive can take on a nuclear shape rather than evince a banded appearance. The authors of this paper use this variance as justification that this cluster of nuclei could not possibly be the inferior olive. Such a &quot;semi-nuclear/banded&quot; arrangement of the inferior olive is seen in, for example, giraffe (10.1016/j.jchemneu.2007.05.003), domestic dog, polar bear, and most specifically the manatee (a close relative of the elephant) (brainmuseum.org; 10.1002/ar.20573). This justification is not supported.</p>
<p>Thus, all the justifications forwarded by the authors are unsupported. Based on methodological concerns, prior comparative mammalian neuroanatomy, and prior studies in the elephant and closely related species, the authors fail to support their notion that what was previously termed the inferior olive in the elephant is actually the trigeminal sensory nuclei. Given this failure, the justifications provided above that are sequelae also fail. In this sense, the entire manuscript and all the sequelae are not supported.</p>
<p>What the authors have not done is to trace the pathway of the large trigeminal nerve in the elephant brainstem, as was done by Maseko et al (2013), which clearly shows the internal pathways of this nerve, from the branch that leads to the fifth mesencephalic nucleus adjacent to the periventricular grey matter, through to the spinal trigeminal tract that extends from the pons to the spinal cord in a manner very similar to all other mammals. Nor have they shown how the supposed trigeminal information reaches the putative trigeminal nuclei in the ventromedial rostral medulla oblongata. These are but two examples of many specific lines of evidence that would be required to support their conclusions. Clearly, tract tracing methods, such as cholera toxin tracing of peripheral nerves cannot be done in elephants, thus the neuroanatomy must be done properly and with attention to detail to support the major changes indicated by the authors.</p>
<p>So what are these &quot;bumps&quot; in the elephant brainstem?</p>
<p>Four previous authors indicate that these bumps are the inferior olivary nuclear complex. Can this be supported?</p>
<p>The inferior olivary nuclear complex acts &quot;as a relay station between the spinal cord (n.b. trigeminal input does reach the spinal cord via the spinal trigeminal tract) and the cerebellum, integrating motor and sensory information to provide feedback and training to cerebellar neurons&quot; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542242/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542242/</ext-link>). The inferior olivary nuclear complex is located dorsal and medial to the pyramidal tracts (which were not labelled in the current study by the authors but are clearly present in Fig. 1C and 2A) in the ventromedial aspect of the rostral medulla oblongata. This is precisely where previous authors have identified the inferior olivary nuclear complex and what the current authors assign to their putative trigeminal nuclei. The neurons of the inferior olivary nuclei project, via the olivocerebellar tract to the cerebellum to terminate in the climbing fibres of the cerebellar cortex.</p>
<p>Elephants have the largest (relative and absolute) cerebellum of all mammals (10.1002/ar.22425), this cerebellum contains 257 x109 neurons (10.3389/fnana.2014.00046; three times more than the entire human brain, 10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009). Each of these neurons appears to be more structurally complex than the homologous neurons in other mammals (10.1159/000345565; 10.1007/s00429-010-0288-3). In the African elephant, the neurons of the inferior olivary nuclear complex are described by Maseko et al (2013) as being both calbindin and calretinin immunoreactive. Climbing fibres in the cerebellar cortex of the African elephant are clearly calretinin immunopositive and also are likely to contain calbindin (10.1159/000345565). Given this, would it be surprising that the inferior olivary nuclear complex of the elephant is enlarged enough to create a very distinct bump in exactly the same place where these nuclei are identified in other mammals?</p>
<p>What about the myelin stripes? These are most likely to be the origin of the olivocerebellar tract and probably only have a coincidental relationship with the trunk. Thus, given what we know, the inferior olivary nuclear complex as described in other studies, and the putative trigeminal nuclear complex as described in the current study, is the elephant inferior olivary nuclear complex. It is not what the authors believe it to be, and they do not provide any evidence that discounts the previous studies. The authors are quite simply put, wrong. All the speculations that flow from this major neuroanatomical error are therefore science fiction rather than useful additions to the scientific literature.</p>
<p>What do the authors actually have?</p>
<p>
The authors have interesting data, based on their Golgi staining and analysis, of the inferior olivary nuclear complex in the elephant.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The study claims to investigate trunk representations in elephant trigeminal nuclei located in the brainstem. The researchers identified large protrusions visible from the ventral surface of the brainstem, which they examined using a range of histological methods. However, this ventral location is usually where the inferior olivary complex is found, which challenges the author's assertions about the nucleus under analysis. They find that this brainstem nucleus of elephants contains repeating modules, with a focus on the anterior and largest unit which they define as the putative nucleus principalis trunk module of the trigeminal. The nucleus exhibits low neuron density, with glia outnumbering neurons significantly. The study also utilizes synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography to suggest that myelin-stripe-axons traverse this module. The analysis maps myelin-rich stripes in several specimens and concludes that based on their number and patterning they likely correspond with trunk folds; however, this conclusion is not well supported if the nucleus has been misidentified.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strength of this research lies in its comprehensive use of various anatomical methods, including Nissl staining, myelin staining, Golgi staining, cytochrome oxidase labeling, and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography. The inclusion of quantitative data on cell numbers and sizes, dendritic orientation and morphology, and blood vessel density across the nucleus adds a quantitative dimension. Furthermore, the research is commendable for its high-quality and abundant images and figures, effectively illustrating the anatomy under investigation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While the research provides potentially valuable insights if revised to focus on the structure that appears to be the inferior olivary nucleus, there are certain additional weaknesses that warrant further consideration. First, the suggestion that myelin stripes solely serve to separate sensory or motor modules rather than functioning as an &quot;axonal supply system&quot; lacks substantial support due to the absence of information about the neuronal origins and the termination targets of the axons. Postmortem fixed brain tissue limits the ability to trace full axon projections. While the study acknowledges these limitations, it is important to exercise caution in drawing conclusions about the precise role of myelin stripes without a more comprehensive understanding of their neural connections.</p>
<p>Second, the quantification presented in the study lacks comparison to other species or other relevant variables within the elephant specimens (i.e., whole brain or brainstem volume). The absence of comparative data for different species limits the ability to fully evaluate the significance of the findings. Comparative analyses could provide a broader context for understanding whether the observed features are unique to elephants or more common across species. This limitation in comparative data hinders a more comprehensive assessment of the implications of the research within the broader field of neuroanatomy. Furthermore, the quantitative comparisons between African and Asian elephant specimens should include some measure of overall brain size as a covariate in the analyses. Addressing these weaknesses would enable a richer interpretation of the study's findings.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This potentially valuable study uses classic neuroanatomical techniques and synchrotron X-ray tomography to investigate the mapping of the trunk within the brainstem nuclei of the elephant brain. Given its unique specializations, understanding the somatosensory projections from the elephant trunk would be of general interest to evolutionary neurobiologists, comparative neuroscientists, and animal behavior scientists. However, the anatomical analysis is inadequate to support the authors' conclusion that they have identified the elephant trigeminal sensory nuclei rather than a different brain region, specifically the inferior olive.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: We are happy that our paper is considered to be potentially valuable. Also, the editors highlight the potential interest of our work for evolutionary neurobiologists, comparative neuroscientists, and animal behavior scientists. The editors are more negative when it comes to our evidence on the identification of the trigeminal nucleus vs the inferior olive. We have five comments on this assessment. (i) We think this assessment is heavily biased by the comments of referee 2. We will show that the referee’s comments are more about us than about our paper. Hence, the referee failed to do their job (refereeing our paper) and should not have succeeded in leveling our paper. (ii) We have no ad hoc knock-out experiments to distinguish the trigeminal nucleus vs the inferior olive. Such experiments (extracellular recording &amp; electrolytic lesions, viral tracing would be done in a week in mice, but they cannot and should not be done in elephants. (iii) We have extraordinary evidence. Nobody has ever described a similarly astonishing match of body (trunk folds) and myeloarchitecture in the trigeminal system before. (iv) We will show that our assignment of the trigeminal nucleus vs the inferior olive is more plausible than the current hypothesis about the assignment of the trigeminal nucleus vs the inferior olive as defended by referee 2. We think this is why it is important to publish our paper. (v) We think eLife is the perfect place for our publication because the deviating views of referee 2 are published along.</p>
<p>Change: We performed additional peripherin-antibody staining to differentiate the inferior olive and trigeminal nucleus. Peripherin is a cytoskeletal protein that is found in peripheral nerves and climbing fibers. Specifically, climbing fibers of various species (mouse, rabbit, pig, cow, and human; Errante et al., 1998) are stained intensely with peripherin-antibodies. What is tricky for our purposes is that there is also some peripherin-antibody reactivity in the trigeminal nuclei (Errante et al., 1998). Such peripherin-antibody reactivity is weaker, however, and lacks the distinct axonal bundle signature that stems from the strong climbing fiber peripherin-reactivity as seen in the inferior olive (Errante et al., 1998). As can be seen in Author response image 1, we observe peripherin-reactivity in axonal bundles (i.e. in putative climbing fibers), in what we think is the inferior olive. We also observe weak peripherin-reactivity, in what we think is the trigeminal nucleus, but not the distinct and strong labeling of axonal bundles. These observations are in line with our ideas but are difficult to reconcile with the views of the referee. Specifically, the lack of peripherin-reactive axon bundles suggests that there are no climbing fibres in what the referee thinks is the inferior olive.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This fundamental study provides compelling neuroanatomical evidence underscoring the sensory function of the trunk in African and Asian elephants. Whereas myelinated tracts are classically appreciated as mediating neuronal connections, the authors speculate that myelinated bundles provide functional separation of trunk folds and display elaboration related to the &quot;finger&quot; projections. The authors avail themselves of many classical neuroanatomical techniques (including cytochrome oxidase stains, Golgi stains, and myelin stains) along with modern synchrotron X-ray tomography. This work will be of interest to evolutionary neurobiologists, comparative neuroscientists, and the general public, with its fascinating exploration of the brainstem of an icon sensory specialist.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: We agree with the referee’s assessment. We note that cytochrome-oxidase staining is an at least partially functional stain, as it reveals constitutive metabolic activity. A significant problem of the work in elephants is that our recording possibilities are limited, which in turn limits functional analysis. As indicated in Figure 4 for the African elephant Indra, there was an excellent match of trunk folds and myelin stripes. Asian elephants have more, and less conspicuous trunk folds than African elephants. As illustrated in Figure 6, Asian elephants have more, and less conspicuous myelin stripes. Thus, species differences in myelin stripes correlate with species differences in trunk folds.</p>
<p>Changes: We clarify the relation of myelin stripe and trunk fold patterns in our discussion of Figure 6.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>The authors describe what they assert to be a very unusual trigeminal nuclear complex in the brainstem of elephants, and based on this, follow with many speculations about how the trigeminal nuclear complex, as identified by them, might be organized in terms of the sensory capacity of the elephant trunk.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: We agree with the referee’s assessment that the putative trigeminal nucleus described in our paper is highly unusual in size, position, vascularization, and myeloarchitecture. This is why we wrote this paper. We think these unusual features reflect the unique facial specializations of elephants, i.e. their highly derived trunk. Because we have no access to recordings from the elephant brainstem, we cannot back up all our functional interpretations with electrophysiological evidence; it is therefore fair to call them speculative.</p>

<p>The identification of the trigeminal nuclear complex/inferior olivary nuclear complex in the elephant brainstem is the central pillar of this manuscript from which everything else follows, and if this is incorrect, then the entire manuscript fails, and all the associated speculations become completely unsupported.</p>

<p>The authors note that what they identify as the trigeminal nuclear complex has been identified as the inferior olivary nuclear complex by other authors, citing Shoshani et al. (2006; 10.1016/j.brainresbull.2006.03.016) and Maseko et al (2013; 10.1159/000352004), but fail to cite either Verhaart and Kramer (1958; PMID 13841799) or Verhaart (1962; 10.1515/9783112519882-001). These four studies are in agreement, but the current study differs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment &amp; Change: We were not aware of the papers of Verhaart and included them in the revised ms.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Let's assume for the moment that the four previous studies are all incorrect and the current study is correct. This would mean that the entire architecture and organization of the elephant brainstem is significantly rearranged in comparison to ALL other mammals, including humans, previously studied (e.g. Kappers et al. 1965, The Comparative Anatomy of the Nervous System of Vertebrates, Including Man, Volume 1 pp. 668-695) and the closely related manatee (10.1002/ar.20573). This rearrangement necessitates that the trigeminal nuclei would have had to &quot;migrate&quot; and shorten rostrocaudally, specifically and only, from the lateral aspect of the brainstem where these nuclei extend from the pons through to the cervical spinal cord (e.g. the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlases), the to the spatially restricted ventromedial region of specifically and only the rostral medulla oblongata. According to the current paper, the inferior olivary complex of the elephant is very small and located lateral to their trigeminal nuclear complex, and the region from where the trigeminal nuclei are located by others appears to be just &quot;lateral nuclei&quot; with no suggestion of what might be there instead.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: We have three comments here:</p>
<p>1. The referee correctly notes that we argue the elephant brainstem underwent fairly major rearrangements. In particular, we argue that the elephant inferior olive was displaced laterally, by a very large cell mass, which we argue is an unusually large trigeminal nucleus. To our knowledge, such a large compact cell mass is not seen in the ventral brain stem of any other mammal.</p>
<p>2. The referee makes it sound as if it is our private idea that the elephant brainstem underwent major rearrangements and that the rest of the evidence points to a conventional ‘rodent-like’ architecture. This is far from the truth, however. Already from the outside appearance (see our Figure 1B and Figure 6A) it is clear that the elephant brainstem has huge ventral bumps not seen in any other mammal. An extraordinary architecture also holds at the organizational level of nuclei. Specifically, the facial nucleus – the most carefully investigated nucleus in the elephant brainstem – has an appearance distinct from that of the facial nuclei of all other mammals (Maseko et al., 2013; Kaufmann et al., 2022). If both the overall shape and the constituting nuclei of the brainstem are very different from other mammals, it is very unlikely if not impossible that the elephant brainstem follows in all regards a conventional ‘rodent-like’ architecture.</p>
<p>3. The inferior olive is an impressive nucleus in the partitioning scheme we propose (Author response image 1). In fact – together with the putative trigeminal nucleus we describe – it’s the most distinctive nucleus in the elephant brainstem. We have not done volumetric measurements and cell counts here, but think this is an important direction for future work. What has informed our work is that the inferior olive nucleus we describe has the serrated organization seen in the inferior olive of all mammals. We will discuss these matters in depth below.</p>
<p>Changes: None.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Such an extraordinary rearrangement of brainstem nuclei would require a major transformation in the manner in which the mutations, patterning, and expression of genes and associated molecules during development occur. Such a major change is likely to lead to lethal phenotypes, making such a transformation extremely unlikely. Variations in mammalian brainstem anatomy are most commonly associated with quantitative changes rather than qualitative changes (10.1016/B978-0-12-804042-3.00045-2).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: We have two comments here:</p>
<p>1. The referee claims that it is impossible that the elephant brainstem differs from a conventional brainstem architecture because this would lead to lethal phenotypes etc. Following our previous response, this argument does not hold. It is out of the question that the elephant brainstem looks very different from the brainstem of other mammals. Yet, it is also evident that elephants live. The debate we need to have is not if the elephant brainstem differs from other mammals, but how it differs from other mammals.</p>
<p>2). In principle we agree with the referee’s thinking that the model of the elephant brainstem that is most likely correct is the one that requires the least amount of rearrangements to other mammals. We therefore prepared a comparison of the model the referee is proposing (Maseko et al., 2013; see Author response table 1 below) with our proposition. We scored these models on their similarity to other mammals. We find that the referee’s ideas (Maseko et al., 2013) require more rearrangements relative to other mammals than our suggestion.</p>
<p>Changes: Inclusion of Author response table 1, which we discuss in depth below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The impetus for the identification of the unusual brainstem trigeminal nuclei in the current study rests upon a previous study from the same laboratory (10.1016/j.cub.2021.12.051) that estimated that the number of axons contained in the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve that innervate the sensory surfaces of the trunk is approximately 400 000. Is this number unusual? In a much smaller mammal with a highly specialized trigeminal system, the platypus, the number of axons innervating the sensory surface of the platypus bill skin comes to 1 344 000 (10.1159/000113185). Yet, there is no complex rearrangement of the brainstem trigeminal nuclei in the brain of the developing or adult platypus (Ashwell, 2013, Neurobiology of Monotremes), despite the brainstem trigeminal nuclei being very large in the platypus (10.1159/000067195). Even in other large-brained mammals, such as large whales that do not have a trunk, the number of axons in the trigeminal nerve ranges between 400,000 and 500,000 (10.1007/978-3-319-47829-6_988-1). The lack of comparative support for the argument forwarded in the previous and current study from this laboratory, and that the comparative data indicates that the brainstem nuclei do not change in the manner suggested in the elephant, argues against the identification of the trigeminal nuclei as outlined in the current study. Moreover, the comparative studies undermine the prior claim of the authors, informing the current study, that &quot;the elephant trigeminal ganglion ... point to a high degree of tactile specialization in elephants&quot; (10.1016/j.cub.2021.12.051). While clearly, the elephant has tactile sensitivity in the trunk, it is questionable as to whether what has been observed in elephants is indeed &quot;truly extraordinary&quot;.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: These comments made us think that the referee is not talking about the paper we submitted, but that the referee is talking about us and our work in general. Specifically, the referee refers to the platypus and other animals dismissing our earlier work, which argued for a high degree of tactile specialization in elephants. We think the referee’s intuitions are wrong and our earlier work is valid.</p>
<p>Changes: We prepared a Author response image 2 (below) that puts the platypus brain, a monkey brain, and the elephant trigeminal ganglion (which contains a large part of the trunk innervating cells) in perspective.</p>
<fig id="sa4fig2">
<label>Author response image 2</label>
<caption>
<title>The elephant trigeminal ganglion is comparatively large.</title>
<p>Platypus brain, monkey brain, and elephant ganglion. The elephant has two trigeminal ganglia, which contain the first-order somatosensory neurons. They serve mainly for tactile processing and are large compared to a platypus brain (from the comparative brain collection) and are similar in size to a monkey brain. The idea that elephants might be highly specialized for trunk touch is also supported by the analysis of the sensory nerves of these animals (Purkart et al., 2022). Specifically, we find that the infraorbital nerve (which innervates the trunk) is much thicker than the optic nerve (which mediates vision) and the vestibulocochlear nerve (which mediates hearing). Thus, not everything is large about elephants; instead, the data argue that these animals are heavily specialized for trunk touch.</p>

<p>But let's look more specifically at the justification outlined in the current study to support their identification of the unusually located trigeminal sensory nuclei of the brainstem.</p>
<p>(1) Intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity.</p>

<p>Comment: We agree those are key issues.</p>
<p>Changes: None.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Let's examine these justifications more closely.</p>
<p>(1) Cytochrome oxidase histochemistry is typically used as an indicative marker of neuronal energy metabolism. The authors indicate, based on the &quot;truly extraordinary&quot; somatosensory capacities of the elephant trunk, that any nuclei processing this tactile information should be highly metabolically active, and thus should react intensely when stained for cytochrome oxidase. We are told in the methods section that the protocols used are described by Purkart et al (2022) and Kaufmann et al (2022). In neither of these cited papers is there any description, nor mention, of the cytochrome oxidase histochemistry methodology, thus we have no idea of how this histochemical staining was done. To obtain the best results for cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, the tissue is either processed very rapidly after buffer perfusion to remove blood or in recently perfusion-fixed tissue (e.g., 10.1016/0165-0270(93)90122-8). Given: (1) the presumably long post-mortem interval between death and fixation - &quot;it often takes days to dissect elephants&quot;; (2) subsequent fixation of the brains in 4% paraformaldehyde for &quot;several weeks&quot;; (3) The intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity in the inferior olivary complex of the laboratory rat (Gonzalez-Lima, 1998, Cytochrome oxidase in neuronal metabolism and Alzheimer's diseases); and (4) The lack of any comparative images from other stained portions of the elephant brainstem; it is difficult to support the justification as forwarded by the authors. The histochemical staining observed is likely background reactivity from the use of diaminobenzidine in the staining protocol. Thus, this first justification is unsupported.</p>

<p>Comment: The referee correctly notes the description of our cytochrome-oxidase reactivity staining was lacking. This is a serious mistake of ours for which we apologize very much. The referee then makes it sound as if we messed up our cytochrome-oxidase staining, which is not the case. All successful (n = 3; please see our technical comments in the recommendation section) cytochrome-oxidase stainings were done with elephants with short post-mortem times (≤ 2 days) to brain removal/cooling and only brief immersion fixation (≤ 1 day). Cytochrome-oxidase reactivity in elephant brains appears to be more sensitive to quenching by fixation than is the case for rodent brains. We think it is a good idea to include a cytochrome-oxidase staining overview picture because we understood from the referee’s comments that we need to compare our partitioning scheme of the brainstem with that of other authors. To this end, we add a cytochrome-oxidase staining overview picture (Author response image 3) along with an alternative interpretation from Maseko et al., 2013.</p>
<p>Changes: 1) We added details on our cytochrome-oxidase reactivity staining protocol and the cytochrome-oxidase reactivity in the elephant brain in general recommendation.</p>
<p>1. We provide a detailed discussion of the technicalities of cytochrome-oxidase staining below in the recommendation section, where the referee raised further criticisms.</p>

<p>Cytochrome-oxidase staining overview along with the Maseko et al. (2013) scheme Left, coronal cytochrome-oxidase staining overview from African elephant cow Indra; the section is taken a few millimeters posterior to the facial nucleus. Brown is putatively neural cytochrome-reactivity, and white is the background. Black is myelin diffraction and (seen at higher resolution, when you zoom in) erythrocyte cytochrome-reactivity in blood vessels (see our Figure 1E-G); such blood vessel cytochrome-reactivity is seen, because we could not perfuse the animal. There appears to be a minimal outside-in-fixation artifact (i.e. a more whitish/non-brownish appearance of the section toward the borders of the brain). This artifact is not seen in sections from Indra that we processed earlier or in other elephant brains processed at shorter post-mortem/fixation delays (see our Figure 1C). Right, coronal partitioning scheme of Maseko et al. (2013) for the elephant brainstem at an approximately similar anterior-posterior level.</p>
<p>The same structures can be recognized left and right. The section is taken at an anterior-posterior level, where we encounter the trigeminal nuclei in pretty much all mammals. Note that the neural cytochrome reactivity is very high, in what we refer to as the trigeminal-nuclei-trunk-module and what Maseko et al. refer to as inferior olive. Myelin stripes can be recognized here as white omissions.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cytochrome-oxidase-reactivity is very low in what Maseko et al. refer to as trigeminal nuclei. The indistinct appearance and low cytochrome-oxidase-reactivity of the trigeminal nuclei in the scheme of Maseko et al. (2013) is unexpected because trigeminal nuclei stain intensely for cytochrome-oxidase-reactivity in most mammals and because the trigeminal nuclei represent the elephant’s most important body part, the trunk. Staining patterns of the trigeminal nuclei as identified by Maseko et al. (2013) are very different at more posterior levels; we will discuss this matter below.</p>

<p>(4) and (5) These are interesting justifications, as the paper has clear internal contradictions, and (5) is a sequelae of (4). The reader is led to the concept that the myelin tracts divide the nuclei into sub-modules that match the folding of the skin on the elephant trunk. One would then readily presume that these myelin tracts are in the incoming sensory axons from the trigeminal nerve. However, the authors note that this is not the case: &quot;Our observations on trunk module myelin stripes are at odds with this view of myelin. Specifically, myelin stripes show no tapering (which we would expect if axons divert off into the tissue). More than that, there is no correlation between myelin stripe thickness (which presumably correlates with axon numbers) and trigeminal module neuron numbers. Thus, there are numerous myelinated axons, where we observe few or no trigeminal neurons. These observations are incompatible with the idea that myelin stripes form an axonal 'supply' system or that their prime function is to connect neurons. What do myelin stripe axons do, if they do not connect neurons? We suggest that myelin stripes serve to separate rather than connect neurons.&quot; So, we are left with the observation that the myelin stripes do not pass afferent trigeminal sensory information from the &quot;truly extraordinary&quot; trunk skin somatic sensory system, and rather function as units that separate neurons - but to what end? It appears that the myelin stripes are more likely to be efferent axonal bundles leaving the nuclei (to form the olivocerebellar tract). This justification is unsupported.</p>

<p>(6) The authors indicate that the location of these nuclei matches that of the trigeminal nuclei in other mammals. This is not supported in any way. In ALL other mammals in which the trigeminal nuclei of the brainstem have been reported they are found in the lateral aspect of the brainstem, bordered laterally by the spinal trigeminal tract. This is most readily seen and accessible in the Paxinos and Watson rat brain atlases. The authors indicate that the trigeminal nuclei are medial to the facial nerve nucleus, but in every other species, the trigeminal sensory nuclei are found lateral to the facial nerve nucleus. This is most salient when examining a close relative, the manatee (10.1002/ar.20573), where the location of the inferior olive and the trigeminal nuclei matches that described by Maseko et al (2013) for the African elephant.

<p>(7) The dual to quadruple repetition of rostrocaudal modules within the putative trigeminal nucleus as identified by the authors relies on the fact that in the neurotypical mammal, there are several trigeminal sensory nuclei arranged in a column running from the pons to the cervical spinal cord, these include (nomenclature from Paxinos and Watson in roughly rostral to caudal order) the Pr5VL, Pr5DM, Sp5O, Sp5I, and Sp5C. However, these nuclei are all located far from the midline and lateral to the facial nerve nucleus, unlike what the authors describe in the elephants. These rostrocaudal modules are expanded upon in Figure 2, and it is apparent from what is shown that the authors are attributing other brainstem nuclei to the putative trigeminal nuclei to confirm their conclusion. For example, what they identify as the inferior olive in Figure 2D is likely the lateral reticular nucleus as identified by Maseko et al (2013). This justification is not supported.</p>

<p>(8) In primates and related species, there is a distinct banded appearance of the inferior olive, but what has been termed the inferior olive in the elephant by other authors does not have this appearance, rather, and specifically, the largest nuclear mass in the region (termed the principal nucleus of the inferior olive by Maseko et al, 2013, but Pr5, the principal trigeminal nucleus in the current paper) overshadows the partial banded appearance of the remaining nuclei in the region (but also drawn by the authors of the current paper). Thus, what is at debate here is whether the principal nucleus of the inferior olive can take on a nuclear shape rather than evince a banded appearance. The authors of this paper use this variance as justification that this cluster of nuclei could not possibly be the inferior olive. Such a &quot;semi-nuclear/banded&quot; arrangement of the inferior olive is seen in, for example, giraffe (10.1016/j.jchemneu.2007.05.003), domestic dog, polar bear, and most specifically the manatee (a close relative of the elephant) (brainmuseum.org; 10.1002/ar.20573). This justification is not supported.</p>

<p>Comment: We carefully looked at the brain sections referred to by the referee in the brainmuseum.org collection. We found contrary to the referee’s claims that dogs, polar bears, and manatees have a perfectly serrated (a cellular arrangement in curved bands) appearance of the inferior olive. Accordingly, we think the referee is not reporting the comparative evidence fairly and we wonder why this is the case.</p>

<p>Thus, all the justifications forwarded by the authors are unsupported.

<p>A comparison of the elephant brainstem partitioning schemes put forward by Maseko et al 2013 and by Reveyaz et al.</p>
<p>To start with, we would like to express our admiration for the work of Maseko et al. (2013). These authors did pioneering work on obtaining high-quality histology samples from elephants. Moreover, they made a heroic neuroanatomical effort, in which they assigned 147 brain structures to putative anatomical entities. Most of their data appear to refer to staining in a single elephant and one coronal sectioning plane. The data quality and the illustration of results are excellent.</p>
<p>We studied mainly two large nuclei in six (now 7) elephants in three (coronal, parasagittal, and horizontal) sectioning planes. The two nuclei in question are the two most distinct nuclei in the elephant brainstem, namely an anterior ventromedial nucleus (the trigeminal trunk module in our terminology; the inferior olive in the terminology of Maseko et al., 2013) and a more posterior lateral nucleus (the inferior olive in our terminology; the posterior part of the trigeminal nuclei in the terminology of Maseko et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Author response image 4 gives an overview of the two partitioning schemes for inferior olive/trigeminal nuclei along with the rodent organization (see below).</p>

</fig>
<p>The strength of the Maseko et al. (2013) scheme is the excellent match of the position of elephant nuclei to the position of nuclei in the rodent (Author response image 4). We think this positional match reflects the fact that Maseko et al. (2013) mapped a rodent partitioning scheme on the elephant brainstem. To us, this is a perfectly reasonable mapping approach. As the referee correctly points out, the positional similarity of both elephant inferior olive and trigeminal nuclei to the rodent strongly argues in favor of the Maseko et al. (2013), because brainstem nuclei are positionally very conservative.</p>
<p>Other features of the Maseko et al. (2013) scheme are less favorable. The scheme marries two cyto-architectonically very distinct divisions (an anterior indistinct part) and a super-distinct serrated posterior part to be the trigeminal nuclei. We think merging entirely distinct subdivisions into one nucleus is a byproduct of mapping a rodent partitioning scheme on the elephant brainstem. Neither of the two subdivisions resemble the trigeminal nuclei of other mammals. The cytochrome oxidase staining patterns differ markedly across the anterior indistinct part (see our Author response image 4) and the posterior part of the trigeminal nuclei and do not match with the intense cytochrome oxidase reactivity of other mammalian trigeminal nuclei (Referee Figure 3). Our anti-peripherin staining indicates that there probably no climbing fibers, in what Maseko et al. think. is inferior olive; this is a potentially fatal problem for the hypothesis. The posterior part of Maseko et al. (2013) trigeminal nuclei has a distinct serrated appearance that is characteristic of the inferior olive in other mammals. Moreover, the inferior olive of Maseko et al. (2013) lacks the serrated appearance of the inferior olive seen in pretty much all mammals; this is a serious problem.</p>
<p>The partitioning scheme of Reveyaz et al. comes with poor positional similarity but avoids the other problems of the Maseko et al. (2013) scheme. Our explanation for the positionally deviating location of trigeminal nuclei is that the elephant grew one of the if not the largest trigeminal systems of all mammals. As a result, the trigeminal nuclei grew through the floor of the brainstem. We understand this is a post hoc just-so explanation, but at least it is an explanation.</p>
<p>The scheme of Reveyaz et al. was derived in an entirely different way from the Maseko model. Specifically, we were convinced that the elephant trigeminal nuclei ought to be very special because of the gigantic trigeminal ganglia (Purkart et al., 2022). Cytochrome-oxidase staining revealed a large distinct nucleus with an elongated shape. Initially, we were freaked out by the position of the nucleus and the fact that it was referred to as inferior olive by other authors. When we found an inferior-olive-like nucleus at a nearby (although at an admittedly unusual) location, we were less worried. We then optimized the visualization of myelin stripes (brightfield imaging etc.) and were able to collect an entire elephant trunk along with the brain (African elephant cow Indra). When we made the one-to-one match of Indra’s trunk folds and myelin stripes (Figure 4) we were certain that we had identified the trunk module of the trigeminal nuclei. We already noted at the outset of our rebuttal that we now consider such certainty a fallacy of overconfidence. In light of the comments of Referee 2, we feel that a further discussion of our ideas is warranted.
A strength of the Reveyaz model is that nuclei look like single anatomical entities. The trigeminal nuclei look like trigeminal nuclei of other mammals, the trunk module has a striking resemblance to the trunk and the inferior olive looks like the inferior olive of other mammals.</p>
<p>We evaluated the fit of the two models in the form of a table (Author response table 1; below). Unsurprisingly, Author response table 1 aligns with our views of elephant brainstem partitioning.</p>

<p>Author response table 1 suggests two conclusions to us. (i) The Reveyaz et al. model has mainly favorable properties. The Maseko et al. (2013) model has mainly unfavorable properties. Hence, the Reveyaz et al. model is more likely to be true. (ii) The outcome is not black and white, i.e., both models have favorable and unfavorable properties. Accordingly, we overstated our case in our initial submission and toned down our claims in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>What the authors have not done is to trace the pathway of the large trigeminal nerve in the elephant brainstem, as was done by Maseko et al (2013), which clearly shows the internal pathways of this nerve, from the branch that leads to the fifth mesencephalic nucleus adjacent to the periventricular grey matter, through to the spinal trigeminal tract that extends from the pons to the spinal cord in a manner very similar to all other mammals. Nor have they shown how the supposed trigeminal information reaches the putative trigeminal nuclei in the ventromedial rostral medulla oblongata. These are but two examples of many specific lines of evidence that would be required to support their conclusions. Clearly, tract tracing methods, such as cholera toxin tracing of peripheral nerves cannot be done in elephants, thus the neuroanatomy must be done properly and with attention to detail to support the major changes indicated by the authors.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: The referee claims that Maseko et al. (2013) showed by ‘tract tracing’ that the structures they refer to trigeminal nuclei receive trigeminal input. This statement is at least slightly misleading. There is nothing of what amounts to proper ‘tract tracing’ in the Maseko et al. (2013) paper, i.e. tracing of tracts with post-mortem tracers. We tried proper post-mortem tracing but failed (no tracer transport) probably as a result of the limitations of our elephant material. What Maseko et al. (2013) actually did is look a bit for putative trigeminal fibers and where they might go. We also used this approach. In our hands, such ‘pseudo tract tracing’ works best in unstained material under bright field illumination, because myelin is very well visualized. In such material, we find: (i) massive fiber tracts descending dorsoventrally roughly from where both Maseko et al. 2013 and we think the trigeminal tract runs. (ii) These fiber tracts run dorsoventrally and approach, what we think is the trigeminal nuclei from lateral.</p>

<p>So what are these &quot;bumps&quot; in the elephant brainstem?</p>
<p>Four previous authors indicate that these bumps are the inferior olivary nuclear complex. Can this be supported?</p>
<p>The inferior olivary nuclear complex acts &quot;as a relay station between the spinal cord (n.b. trigeminal input does reach the spinal cord via the spinal trigeminal tract) and the cerebellum, integrating motor and sensory information to provide feedback and training to cerebellar neurons&quot; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542242/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK542242/</ext-link>). The inferior olivary nuclear complex is located dorsal and medial to the pyramidal tracts (which were not labeled in the current study by the authors but are clearly present in Fig. 1C and 2A) in the ventromedial aspect of the rostral medulla oblongata. This is precisely where previous authors have identified the inferior olivary nuclear complex and what the current authors assign to their putative trigeminal nuclei. The neurons of the inferior olivary nuclei project, via the olivocerebellar tract to the cerebellum to terminate in the climbing fibres of the cerebellar cortex.</p>

<p>Comment: We agree with the referee that in the Maseko et al. (2013) scheme the inferior olive is exactly where we expect it from pretty much all other mammals.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Elephants have the largest (relative and absolute) cerebellum of all mammals (10.1002/ar.22425), this cerebellum contains 257 x109 neurons (10.3389/fnana.2014.00046; three times more than the entire human brain, 10.3389/neuro.09.031.2009). Each of these neurons appears to be more structurally complex than the homologous neurons in other mammals (10.1159/000345565; 10.1007/s00429-010-0288-3). In the African elephant, the neurons of the inferior olivary nuclear complex are described by Maseko et al (2013) as being both calbindin and calretinin immunoreactive. Climbing fibres in the cerebellar cortex of the African elephant are clearly calretinin immunopositive and also are likely to contain calbindin (10.1159/000345565). Given this, would it be surprising that the inferior olivary nuclear complex of the elephant is enlarged enough to create a very distinct bump in exactly the same place where these nuclei are identified in other mammals?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: We agree with the referee that it is possible and even expected from other mammals that there is an enlargement of the inferior olive in elephants. Hence, a priori one might expect the ventral brain stem bumps to the inferior olive, this is perfectly reasonable and is what was done by previous authors. The referee also refers to calbindin and calretinin antibody reactivity. Such antibody reactivity is indeed in line with the referee’s ideas and we considered these findings in our Referee Table 1. The problem is, however, that neither calbindin nor calretinin antibody reactivity are highly specific and indeed both nuclei in discussion (trigeminal nuclei and inferior olive) show such reactivity. Unlike the peripherin-antibody staining advanced by us, calbindin nor calretinin antibody reactivity cannot distinguish the two hypotheses debated.</p>

<p>What about the myelin stripes? These are most likely to be the origin of the olivocerebellar tract and probably only have a coincidental relationship with the trunk. Thus, given what we know, the inferior olivary nuclear complex as described in other studies, and the putative trigeminal nuclear complex as described in the current study, is the elephant inferior olivary nuclear complex. It is not what the authors believe it to be, and they do not provide any evidence that discounts the previous studies. The authors are quite simply put, wrong. All the speculations that flow from this major neuroanatomical error are therefore science fiction rather than useful additions to the scientific literature.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: It is unlikely that the myelin stripes are the origin of the olivocerebellar tract as suggested by the referee. Specifically, the lack of peripherin-reactivity indicates that these fibers are not climbing fibers (Referee Figure 1).

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study claims to investigate trunk representations in elephant trigeminal nuclei located in the brainstem. The researchers identified large protrusions visible from the ventral surface of the brainstem, which they examined using a range of histological methods. However, this ventral location is usually where the inferior olivary complex is found, which challenges the author's assertions about the nucleus under analysis. They find that this brainstem nucleus of elephants contains repeating modules, with a focus on the anterior and largest unit which they define as the putative nucleus principalis trunk module of the trigeminal. The nucleus exhibits low neuron density, with glia outnumbering neurons significantly. The study also utilizes synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography to suggest that myelin-stripe-axons traverse this module. The analysis maps myelin-rich stripes in several specimens and concludes that based on their number and patterning they likely correspond with trunk folds; however, this conclusion is not well supported if the nucleus has been misidentified.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: The referee gives a concise summary of our findings. The referee acknowledges the depth of our analysis and also notes our cellular results. The referee – in line with the comments of Referee 2 – also points out that a misidentification of the nucleus under study is potentially fatal for our analysis. We thank the referee for this fair assessment.</p>
<p>Changes: We feel that we need to alert the reader more broadly to the misidentification concern. We think the critical comments of Referee 2, which will be published along with our manuscript, will go a long way in doing so. We think the eLife publishing format is fantastic in this regard. We will also include pointers to these concerns in the revised manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strength of this research lies in its comprehensive use of various anatomical methods, including Nissl staining, myelin staining, Golgi staining, cytochrome oxidase labeling, and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography. The inclusion of quantitative data on cell numbers and sizes, dendritic orientation and morphology, and blood vessel density across the nucleus adds a quantitative dimension. Furthermore, the research is commendable for its high-quality and abundant images and figures, effectively illustrating the anatomy under investigation.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the research provides potentially valuable insights if revised to focus on the structure that appears to be the inferior olivary nucleus, there are certain additional weaknesses that warrant further consideration. First, the suggestion that myelin stripes solely serve to separate sensory or motor modules rather than functioning as an &quot;axonal supply system&quot; lacks substantial support due to the absence of information about the neuronal origins and the termination targets of the axons. Postmortem fixed brain tissue limits the ability to trace full axon projections. While the study acknowledges these limitations, it is important to exercise caution in drawing conclusions about the precise role of myelin stripes without a more comprehensive understanding of their neural connections.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: The referee points out a significant weakness of our study, namely our limited understanding of the origin and targets of the axons constituting the myelin stripes. We are very much aware of this problem and this is also why we directed high-powered methodology like synchrotron X-ray tomograms to elucidate the structure of myelin stripes. Such analysis led to advances, i.e., we now think, what looks like stripes are bundles and we understand the constituting axons tend to transverse the module. Such advances are insufficient, however, to provide a clear picture of myelin stripe connectivity.</p>
<p>Changes: We think solving the problems raised by the referee will require long-term methodological advances and hence we will not be able to solve these problems in the current revision. Our long-term plans for confronting these issues are the following: (i) Improving our understanding of long-range connectivity by post-mortem tracing and MR-based techniques such as Diffusion-Tensor-Imaging. (ii) Improving our understanding of mid and short-range connectivity by applying even larger synchrotron X-ray tomograms and possible serial EM.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Second, the quantification presented in the study lacks comparison to other species or other relevant variables within the elephant specimens (i.e., whole brain or brainstem volume). The absence of comparative data for different species limits the ability to fully evaluate the significance of the findings. Comparative analyses could provide a broader context for understanding whether the observed features are unique to elephants or more common across species. This limitation in comparative data hinders a more comprehensive assessment of the implications of the research within the broader field of neuroanatomy. Furthermore, the quantitative comparisons between African and Asian elephant specimens should include some measure of overall brain size as a covariate in the analyses. Addressing these weaknesses would enable a richer interpretation of the study's findings.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Comment: The referee suggests another series of topics, which include the analysis of brain parts volumes or overall brain size. We agree these are important issues, but we also think such questions are beyond the scope of our study.</p>
<p>Changes: We hope to publish comparative data on elephant brain size and shape later this year.</p>
