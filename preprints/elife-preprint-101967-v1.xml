<title>Abstract</title><p>Protein-protein interactions are the fundamental features for understanding the molecular functions and regulations of proteins. Despite extensive databases, many interactions remain uncharacterized due to the intensive labor required for experimental validation. In this study, we utilized the AlphaFold2 program to predict interactions among proteins localized in the nuage, a germline-specific non-membrane organelle critical for piRNA biogenesis and RNA regulation. We screened 20 types of nuage proteins for 1:1 interactions and predicted dimer structures. Among those, five pairs represented novel interaction candidates. Three pairs, including Spn-E_Squ, were validated through co-immunoprecipitation in cultured cells and confirmed the interactions. Disruption of the salt bridges at the Spn-E_Squ interface verified their functional importance, underscoring the predictive model’s accuracy. Our analysis was extended to include interactions between three representative nuage components, Vas, Squ, and Tej, and approximately 430 oogenesis-related proteins. Following this extended analysis, co-immunoprecipitation in S2 cells verified interactions for three pairs: Mei-W68_Squ, CSN3_Squ, and Pka-C1_Tej. Furthermore, the majority of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins, ∼12,000, were screened for the interaction with Piwi protein, a central player in the piRNA pathway. Approximately 1.5% of the pairs, totaling 164 pairs, with a score above 0.6, were identified as potential binding partners. This in silico approach not only efficiently identifies potential interaction partners but also significantly reduces the gap by facilitating the integration of bioinformatics and experimental biology.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Around 10,000 to 20,000 different types of proteins are encoded in the genome of most organisms, catalyzing the vast majority of physico-chemical reactions in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. Many proteins have specialized functions and they are often regulated through protein-protein interactions, where the formation of protein complexes can activate, inhibit, or stabilize their partners. Furthermore, protein-protein interactions can recruit target proteins to specific locations where they will function or regulate the mobility of the protein complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Within cells, proteins are thought to exist in a crowded environment and frequently interact with other molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Thus, characterizing protein-protein interactions is fundamental for understanding protein function and regulation. Large-scale analyses of protein-protein interactions have been carried out, including Tandem Affinity Purification coupled with Mass Spectrometry (TAP-MS) for the yeast proteome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and the comprehensive 2-hybrid screening for the Human Reference Interactome (HuRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. Despite these extensive studies, the overall protein-protein interactions are still not fully understood in many organisms.</p>
<p>The binding between proteins is significantly influenced by their three-dimensional (3D) structures. The characteristics of their interfaces, including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobicity, determine the interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Therefore, to analyze protein-protein interactions physically and chemically, information on the individual 3D structures of proteins is necessary. The 3D structures of proteins have been determined through experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and cryo-electron microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. However, these techniques demand considerable labor and time. The recently developed AlphaFold2 program can predict the 3D structure from its amino acid sequence with high accuracy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. This tool has not only been utilized in computational studies but has also become a valuable resource in experimental sciences for predicting protein complexes, as demonstrated with yeast protein complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we attempted a rapid screening of the protein interactions using AlphaFold2 prediction, primarily focusing on components of nuage, a germline specific, non-membrane organelle that involves wide variety of proteins containing unique motifs and domains in <italic>Drosophila melanogasater</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Nuage is known to serve as the production and amplification site for small non-coding piRNA, which is bound to PIWI-family proteins. The piRNAs and the PIWI family proteins function to repress mobile genetic elements, or transposons, that disrupt the genomes through their active transpositions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Not only proteins involved in piRNA production, but also translation repressor proteins including Me31B, Cup, and Trailer hitch (Tral), also localize in nuage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Previous studies have shown that the localization of several components in nuage depends on their partners in a hierarchical manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. However, the interaction and organization among nuage components remain unclear.</p>
<p>By using AlphaFold2 predictions, we investigated 20 of the nuage-localizing or piRNA-related proteins for pairwise interactions. We confirmed the novel interactions of candidate pairs including Spindle-E (Spn-E)_Squash (Squ), by co-immunoprecipitation assay using cultured cells. In addition, a Squ mutant, which disrupts the salt bridges predicted at the interface with Spn-E, failed to interact with Spn-E, validating the accuracy of the predicted dimer structure. This screening was expanded for direct interacting pairs between piRNA-related proteins and proteins involved in oogenesis, as well as Piwi and other <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins. This in silico approach not only streamlines the identification of interaction partners but also bridges the gap between bioinformatics predictions and experimental validation in biological research.</p>

<title>The nuage-localizing proteins and piRNA-related proteins used in the AlphaFold2 screening</title>
<p>Several dozen proteins engaged in piRNA production in germline cells exert their function by recruiting piRNA precursors and interacting with their partner proteins, forming non-membrane structure called a nuage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. Previous studies reported that many piRNA-related proteins localized to nuage and some proteins localized in mitochondria (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In addition, protein components of processing bodies and sponge bodies, which are involved in the translation, storage, degradation, and transportation of mRNAs—such as Me31B, Cup, and Tral—also localize to nuage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the details of how these proteins interact and organize themselves within the nuage remain unclear.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>In this study, we used the AlphaFold2 program to screen for interactions among 20 proteins that are localized in the nuage and/or involved in piRNA production in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The monomeric structures of these 20 proteins, ranging in size from 20 kDa to 250 kDa, have already been predicted and are registered in databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. This set includes both well-structured proteins and those that are largely disordered with numerous loops (Supplemental Fig. S1A). Of those, eight proteins feature one or more Tudor domains or extended Tudor (eTud) domains. The Tudor domain contains approximately 60 residues and folds into an antiparallel β-sheet with five strands forming a barrel-like fold, while the eTud domains include an additional Oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-Binding fold domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Both Tudor and eTud domains are known to bind predominantly to methylated lysine or arginine residues. In addition, five RNA helicases, such as Vasa (Vas) and the fly homolog of Tdrd9, Spn-E, which are essential for piRNA processing, are also included (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The Vas’s C-terminal region is known to bind to the Lotus domain shared by two nuage components, Tejas (Tej) and Tapas. Spn-E is also recently shown to interact with Tej<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Among those 20 proteins, the Molecular Interaction Search Tool (MIST), a conventional database of protein-protein interactions, registers eight interacting pairs as direct binding, and 28 interactions which are direct or indirect (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supplemental Fig S1B, C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Screening for the protein-protein interactions by AlphaFold2</title>
<p>We used AlphaFold2 program to predict the direct protein-protein interaction and 3D structure of the complex. Assuming a 1:1 binding of 20 types of proteins, a total of 400 pairs of dimer predictions were calculated by a supercomputer. The prediction flow of AlphaFold2 consisted of two main parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>. Initially, a multiple sequence alignment was performed for each query protein and stored for the future use. Subsequently, the AlphaFold2 program predicted 3D dimer structures based on the co-evolution inferred from the multiple sequence alignments. For each dimer prediction, five different structure models with varying parameters were generated. Among these, the model with the highest prediction confidence score (pcScore) was selected as the final prediction result. The pcScore is constituted by two evaluations, the overall structure (pTM) and an evaluation of the dimeric interface (ipTM), emphasizing the interface evaluation as represented by the following formula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>:</p>
<p>pcScore = 0.8 x ipTM + 0.2 x pTM</p>
<p>These 3 values, pcScore, ipTM and pTM, for each prediction pairs were visualized in the separate heatmaps (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In general, pcScore and ipTM values showed similar trends although a well-structured protein (e.g. Spn-E) tended to have a higher pTM value, which slightly elevated the pcScore. Based on this, in this study, we used the pcScore as an indicator of the protein-protein interaction. Each heterodimeric pair was calculated twice in the pairwise screening (e.g. proteins A_B and B_A), and the pcScores were plotted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). The results showed that there was significant variance in the pairs with lower pcScores, while pairs with pcScores above 0.6 had relatively higher reproducibility. Consequently, we set a threshold of 0.6 and considered protein pairs with pcScores above 0.6 as likely complex-forming candidates. This approach identified 13 pairs; seven of these were already known to form complexes, confirming the effectiveness of AlphaFold2 in predicting complex formations (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The highest pcScore pair was the Zuc homodimer, possibly because AlphaFold2 had learned from Zuc homodimer’s crystal structure registered in the database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. For the remaining 12 pairs, the predicted 3D structures and the Predicted Aligned Error (PAE) plots were shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>. Consistent with a previous report using silkworm <italic>Bombyx mori</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>, both Argonaute 3 (AGO3) and Aub, members of PIWI-family proteins sharing 50%-60% amino acid sequence similarity, were predicted to form dimers with Maelstrom (Mael) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-i</xref>, ii, <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). AGO3 and Aub appeared well-folded protein except for their N-terminal flexible regions. In contrast, Mael protein was divided into three parts: N-terminal HMG domain, middle MAEL domain, and C-terminal disordered region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-i</xref>, ii). AlphaFold2 predicted the MAEL domain interacted with AGO3 and Aub.</p>

<p>Me31B, Tral, and Cup are recognized as RNA regulators localized to the nuage and/or sponge body, though they are not directly involved in the piRNA pathway. Previous studies have indicated that these proteins form complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Me31B is a well-conserved RNA helicase and showed the tightly-folded structure composed of two concatenated RecA helicase domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. On the other hand, Tral and Cup were predicted largely disordered structure with some secondary structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-iii, iv). The predicted dimer structures of Me31B_Tral and Cup_Me31B showed the score of 0.74 and 0.68, respectively (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Consistent with the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>, AlphaFold2 predicted that the FDF motif of Tral, which contains a Phe-Asp-Phe sequence folded into two a-helixes from residue 405 to 537, was associated with Me31B. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-iii). In addition, an α-helix and loop regions of Cup were predicted to make a contact with Me31B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-iv). BoYb and Vret, both are eTud domain containing proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup> and their direct interaction has been suggested by the high retrieval rate for BoYb in the immunoprecipitant of Vret from the ovary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. The predicted structure revealed that both BoYb and Vret proteins consist of two domains, one at the N-terminal and the other at the C-terminal, connected by a flexible region. (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-v</xref>). Interactions were predicted between their N-terminal domains and between C-terminal domains, respectively. It has been reported that Tej, known as Tdrd5 in mammal, binds directly to Vas through its N-terminal Lotus domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-vi) and to Spn-E through its loop region continuing the eTud domain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-vii). The predicted structures of Tej_Vas and Spn-E_Tej were consistent to their binding properties reported previously.</p>
<p>The remaining five pairs, previously unreported as directly interacting, were considered novel binding pairs (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-viii-xii). These interactions were experimentally examined using <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 culture cells derived from embryonic somatic cells that lack germline-specific proteins. Previously, Squ was co-immunoprecipitated with Spn-E along with other nuage components from ovarian lysate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, but whether this interaction was direct had not been examined. Co-immunoprecipitation assay in S2 cells, Myc-Spn-E was strongly detected in the precipitant of Flag-Squ by Western blotting, possibly supporting the direct interaction between Spn-E and Squ in the S2 cells devoid of germline proteins (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D-i</xref>). Similarly, AlphaFold2 predicted a direct interaction between Aub and Vret, which was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>-ii). The binding capabilities of another pair, BoYb-Shutdown (Shu), were also confirmed in S2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>-iv). Three out of five candidate pairs confirmed interactions, validating the effectiveness of AlphaFold2 in identifying the binding partners. However, BoYb-Spn-E and Me31B-Vret did not show interaction in these assays (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>-iii, v), possibly suggesting weak interactions that co-immunoprecipitation may have failed to detect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s1c">
<title>Evaluation of Spn-E and Squ interaction in culture cells and ovaries</title>
<p>Among the binding candidates, we focused on the predicted dimer structure of Spn-E and Squ pair. Spn-E is an evolutionarily conserved RNA helicase which is expressed in germline cells. It plays a crucial role in the piRNA production and transposon suppression in germline cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Similarly, Squ is also expressed in ovary and testis and involved in the piRNA production, although its molecular role is less defined<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. While <italic>squ</italic> is conserved across <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (Supplemental Fig. 2A, B), vertebrate orthologs remain unidentified. Spn-E contains four domains: DEAD/DEAH helicase, Hel-C, HA2, and eTud domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Its predicted 3D structure was well folded and contained few flexible regions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-viii). In contrast, Squ was predicted to be largely disordered, consisting of three α-helices and two β-strands (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The middle parts of Squ were in close contact with Spn-E, showing lower PAE values, suggestive of their interaction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>-viii, 2A). AlphaFold2 predicts the five structure models for each query using different initial model parameters (models 1-5) and pcScore is given to each model. As for Spn-E_Squ pair, the scScores were ranging from 0.74 to 0.77. The 3D structures of Spn-E were very similar across all five models, superimposing almost perfectly (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). The middle region of Squ was consistently positioned relative to Spn-E, although the N- and C-terminal regions of Squ remained flexible (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>The closer examination of the Spn-E_Squ dimer interface revealed a short α-helix of Squ (106<sup>th</sup>-116<sup>th</sup> residues) fitted into a groove on the Spn-E surface, while the anti-parallel β-sheet (140<sup>th</sup>-153<sup>rd</sup>) was also predicted to interact with Spn-E (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A, C</xref>). Physico-chemical structural analysis using PDBePISA server (EMBL-EBI) identified salt bridges between Spn-E and Squ (Supplemental Table S2, S3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. To validate these predicted interactions, we generated Squ mutants substituting each residue involved in the four salt bridges (E107, E109, R115, and K163) with alanine (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S2B) and assessed their interactions by co-immunoprecipitation in S2 cells expressing tagged proteins, Myc-Spn-E and Flag-Squ. The assay revealed that while the E107A single mutation did not affect the interaction, other single mutations mildly reduced the binding affinity of Squ to Spn-E (Supplemental Fig. S3A), Furthermore, the localization of GFP-tagged Squ and mKate2 (mK2)-tagged Spn-E were examined in S2 cells. When only Squ was expressed, it was dispersed in cytosol (Supplemental Fig. S3B). On the other hand, when only Spn-E was expressed, it localized in the nucleus as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. In the co-expression of Squ wildtype or single mutants, Spn-E was moved to the cytoplasm and form granules together with Squ, suggesting the interaction between them. Although the single mutants still could bind to Spn-E, Squ quadruple mutant (Squ<sup>4A</sup>) completely lost the binding (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>) and did not show the co-localization with Spn-E in S2 cells (Supplemental Fig. S3B). These results suggest that the salt bridges are important for the interaction between Spn-E and Squ and support the accuracy of their dimer structure predicted by AlphaFold2.</p>
<p>While the RNA binding site of Spn-E has not been extensively studied, it is presumed to be near the helicase domain, similar to the Vas helicase-RNA complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, Lin <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that Hel-C domain of Spn-E interacted with the Tej’s eSRS region, which recruits Spn-E to nuage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, a site distinct from the predicted Squ binding sites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, a tetramer complex of Spn-E_Squ_Tej_RNA predicted by the recently available AlphaFold3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> placed the single strand RNA (ssRNA) near Spn-E’s helicase domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>), aligning with the ssRNA binding position found in Vas (Supplemental Fig. S3C). The predicted tetramer model suggests that Squ binding to Spn-E does not inhibit but may potentially regulate Spn-E’s interaction with Tej or RNA by stabilizing the domain orientation of Spn-E (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>We investigated whether Spn-E also interacts with Squ within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary. The antibody against Squ detected a specific band at the expected size by Western blotting in the heterozygous control ovarian lysate, which was absent in the transheterozygote mutant, <italic>squ<sup>PP32/HE47</sup></italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Consistent with the previous report conducted with the transgenic line expressing HA-Squ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, immunostaining of ovaries revealed the Squ’s localization in nuage, which overlaps with endogenously-tagged Spn-E with mK2 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Spn-E was co-immunoprecipitated together with Squ from ovarian lysate, indicating the interaction between Squ and Spn-E (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). While the previous mass spectrometry analysis detected PIWI family proteins, Piwi, Aub, and AGO3, in Spn-E immunoprecipitates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>, these three proteins were not present in the immunoprecipitant of Squ (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>), further supporting the direct interaction between Squ and Spn-E.</p>

<title>Screening oogenesis-related proteins for interaction with nuage proteins</title>
<p>Given the role of nuage for piRNA biogenesis and germline development, interactions between nuage-localized proteins and those involved in oogenesis were expected. We employed AlphaFold2 to predict these interactions using Vas, Squ, and Tej, the representative nuage components yet remain elusive, as baits. Of 430 proteins in oogenesis pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, dimeric binding of 1,290 pairs was predicted (Supplemental Table S4), with 18 pairs showing dimer structures scoring above 0.6 (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).

<title>Screening all <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins for Piwi-interacting proteins</title>
<p>Given the crucial role of Piwi in piRNA biogenesis, heterochromatin formation, and germline stem cell (GSC) maintenance, we employed AlfaFold2 to screen all proteins in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> for potential Piwi interactions. Piwi, the founder member of the PIWI family proteins, is not only essential for binding piRNAs and regulating complementary mRNAs but also plays a critical role in GSC self-renewal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>. Studies have shown that Piwi, lacking the N-terminal moiety containing the nuclear localization signal (NLS), still retains GSC self-renewalcapabilities. Its function in GSC self-renewal is realized independently in the cytoplasm of GSC niche cells, separate from its role in transposon repression. The crystal structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Piwi and silkworm Siwi have been solved and revealed the organization of four domains (N, PAZ, MID, and PIWI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Recently, the ternary structure of piRNA, target RNA, and MILI, a mouse ortholog of Piwi, has been reported and the bound piRNA threaded through the channel between N-PAZ and MID–PIWI lobes (Supplemental Fig. S5A)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To identify novel Piwi-binding proteins, we conducted a 1:1 interaction screening involving approximately 12,000 <italic>Drosophila</italic> proteins, excluding any proteins over 2,000 amino acid residues due to the computational limits. The pcScores by AlphaFold2 were primarily low, with over 98% being below 0.6, suggesting a low likelihood of interaction between Piwi and the vast majority of the proteins (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Approximately 1.5% of the pairs, totaling 164 pairs, scored above 0.6, was expected to contain the novel binding partners (Supplemental Table S5). Top 24 candidates with greater than 0.75 pcScore were listed in <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. This list contained many metabolic enzymes and three piRNA-related proteins, Asterix (Arx), Mael, and Hen1. The interactions between Mael and Piwi-family proteins have been already reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Arx, known as Gtsf1 in mammals and integral to Piwi–piRISC-mediated transcriptional silencing in nucleus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, had high pcScores (0.83, <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Despite its known three-dimensional structure determined by NMR spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>, the Arx_Piwi complex structure remained elusive. AlphaFoldF2 predicted that while Arx lacked a compact domain, the majority of Arx protein associated around the PIWI domain, except for the flexible C-terminal region (130<sup>th</sup>-167<sup>th</sup> residues) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-i</xref>). Three Arx paralogs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (CG34283, CG32625, and CG14036) were also predicted to bind to Piwi with high pcScores, suggesting their interactions within the cells (Supplemental Fig. S5B). Although CG34283 is not expressed, CG32625 and CG14036 are moderately and highly expressed in ovary, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. However, unlike <italic>arx</italic>, knockdown of each paralogous gene did not result in de-repression of a transposon, <italic>mdg1</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, suggesting that they may be pseudogenes or possess redundant roles.</p>

<p>Hen1 is a methyltransferase known to mediate methylation of the terminal 2’ hydroxyl group of small interfering RNAs and piRNAs, thereby enhancing the stability of the small RNAs. Consistent with the previous report showing Hen1 binding to Piwi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref></sup>, the dimer structure of Hen1_Piwi was predicted with high pcScore, 0.77. This prediction further suggests that Hen1 is recruited to Piwi, thereby positioning it closer to the piRNA substrate (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>-ii). Another potential interacting protein for Piwi was CG33703, a protein whose functions remains uncharacterized despite having 75 paralogs listed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Together with three of these paralogs (CG33783, CG33647, and CG33644), CG33703 was predicted to form dimer with Piwi (pcScores 0.82) (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, Supplemental Fig. S5C). The domain of unknown function, DUF1091<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, shared by these paralogs was predicted to associate with the PIWI-domain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>-iii). Although these proteins are generally not expressed under the normal conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, their potential to bind Piwi suggests a regulatory role in the abnormal or stress conditions where CG33703 or its paralogs are expressed. In addition, we investigated two oogenesis-related proteins, Twinfilin (Twf, pcScore 0.64, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>-iv) and Brainiac (Brn, pcScore 0.63, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B-v</xref>), for their binding with Piwi through co-immunoprecipitation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>, Supplemental Table S5). While no binding was observed with Twf, significant binding was detected with Brn, which is involved in dorsal-ventral polarity determination in follicle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In this study, we have identified several potential partners for novel protein interactions, though the physiological relevance of these pairs remains to be elucidated. The expression patterns of these candidate proteins within the organism are crucial for further validation of our findings. It is likely that these proteins interact when co-expressed in the same cellular context. Under typical growth conditions, these interactions might not occur; however, in stress or disease states where these proteins are upregulated, the likelihood of interaction increases, potentially implicating these interactions in the disruption of normal cellular functions and contributing to disease or tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in silico screening proves extremely valuable, especially when dealing with toxic bait proteins, as it allows us to narrow down the list of potential candidates and reduce the need for hazardous experimental procedures. Ultimately, establishing these potential interactions in vivo could significantly advance our understanding of protein functions under both normal and pathological conditions.</p>

AlphaFold v2.2 program was installed in the Supercomputer for Quest to Unsolved Interdisciplinary Datascience (SQUID) at Cyber Media Center in Osaka University. All necessary protein sequence databases for AlphaFold2 were stored on an SSD device connected to the SQUID system.</p>
<p>The AlphaFold2 prediction process was divided into two steps: generation of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and the prediction of the 3D structure. The MSAs were computed on SQUID’s CPU node and stored for reuse. For dimer structure prediction, two MSAs corresponding to the dimer pair were placed in the directory of msas/A and msas/B. The calculations were performed on the GPU node with the options of -t 2022-05-14 -m multimer -l 1 -p true. AlphaFold2 generates five structural models for each prediction. To speed up the prediction, five computations were assigned to five GPU units, even though the original AlphaFold2 program computes 5 models one at a time. The prediction confidence score (pcScore) was provided for each model and among 5 models, the highest pcScore was used as the prediction score for the corresponding dimer structure.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study investigates protein-protein interactions (PPIs) within the nuage, a germline-specific organelle essential for piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, using AlphaFold2 to predict interactions among 20 nuage-localizing proteins. The authors identify five novel interaction candidates and experimentally validate three of them, including Spindle-E and Squash, through co-immunoprecipitation assays. They confirm the functional significance of these interactions by disrupting salt bridges at the Spn-E_Squ interface. The study further expands its scope to analyze approximately 430 oogenesis-related proteins, validating three additional interaction pairs. A comprehensive screen of around 12,000 Drosophila proteins for interactions with the key piRNA pathway player, Piwi, identifies 164 potential binding partners. Overall, the research demonstrates that in silico approaches using AlphaFold2 can link bioinformatics predictions with experimental validation, streamlining the identification of novel protein interactions and reducing the reliance on extensive experimental efforts. The manuscript is commendably clear and easy to follow; however, areas for improvement should be addressed to enhance its clarity and rigor.</p>
<p>Major Concerns:</p>
<p>(1) While AlphaFold2 was developed and trained primarily for predicting protein structures and their interactions, applying it to predict protein-protein interactions is an extrapolation of its intended use. This introduces several important considerations and risks. First, it assumes that AlphaFold's accuracy in structure prediction extends to interactions, despite not being explicitly trained for this task. Additionally, the assumption that high-scoring models with structural complementarity imply biologically relevant interactions is not always valid. Experimental validation is essential to address these uncertainties, as over-reliance on computational predictions without such validation can lead to false positives and inaccurate conclusions. The authors should expand on the assumptions, limitations, and risks associated with using AlphaFold2 for predicting protein-protein interactions.</p>
<p>(2) The authors experimentally validated three interactions, out of five predicted interactions, using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). They attributed the lack of validation for the other two predictions to the limitations of the co-IP method. However, further clarification on the potential limitations of the co-immunoprecipitation behind the negative results would strengthen the conclusions. While co-IP is a widely used technique, it may not detect weak or transient interactions, which could explain the failure to validate some predictions. Suggesting alternative validation methods such as FRET or mass spectrometry could further substantiate the results. On the other hand, AlphaFold2 predictions are not infallible and may generate false positives, particularly when dealing with structurally plausible but biologically irrelevant interactions. By acknowledging both the potential limitations of co-IP and the possibility of false positives from AlphaFold2, the authors can provide a more balanced interpretation of their findings.</p>
<p>(3) In line 143, the authors state that &quot;This approach identified 13 pairs; seven of these were already known to form complexes, confirming the effectiveness of AlphaFold2 in predicting complex formations (Table 2). The highest pcScore pair was the Zuc homodimer, possibly because AlphaFold2 had learned from Zuc homodimer's crystal structure registered in the database.&quot; While the authors mentioned the presence of the Zuc homodimer's crystal structure, they do not provide a systematic bioinformatics analysis to evaluate pairwise sequence identity or check for the presence of existing structures for all the proteins or protein pairs (or their homologs) in databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or Swiss-Model. Conducting such an analysis is critical, as it significantly impacts the novelty and reliability of AlphaFold2 predictions. For instance, high sequence identity between the query proteins could lead to high-scoring models for biologically irrelevant interactions. Including this information would strengthen the conclusions regarding the accuracy and utility of the predictions.</p>
<p>(4) While the manuscript successfully identifies novel protein interactions, the broader biological significance of these interactions remains underexplored. The manuscript could benefit from elaborating on how these findings may contribute to understanding the piRNA pathway and its implications on germline development, transposon repression, and oogenesis.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors use AlphaFold2 to identify potential binding partners of nuage localizing proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the paper is that the authors experimentally verify a subset of the predicted interactions.</p>
<p>Many studies have been performed to predict protein-protein interactions in various subsets of proteins. The interesting story here is that the authors (i) focus on an organelle that contains quite some intrinsically disordered proteins and (ii) experimentally verify some (but not all) predictions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Identification of pairwise interactions is only a first step towards understanding complex interactions. It is pretty clear from the predictions that some (but certainly not all) of the pairs could be used to build larger complexes. AlphaFold easily handles proteins up to 4-5000 residues, so this should be possible. I suggest that the authors do this to provide more biological insights.</p>
<p>Another weakness is the use of a non-standard name for &quot;ranking confidence&quot; - the author calls it the pcScore - while the name used in AlphaFold (and many other publications) is ranking confidence.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's point. The prediction of protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold2 relies on the number of conserved homologous sequences and previous conformational data. We shall add limitations and risks to the AlphaFold2 prediction method in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(2) The authors experimentally validated three interactions, out of five predicted interactions, using co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP). They attributed the lack of validation for the other two predictions to the limitations of the co-IP method. However, further clarification on the potential limitations of the co-immunoprecipitation behind the negative results would strengthen the conclusions. While co-IP is a widely used technique, it may not detect weak or transient interactions, which could explain the failure to validate some predictions. Suggesting alternative validation methods such as FRET or mass spectrometry could further substantiate the results. On the other hand, AlphaFold2 predictions are not infallible and may generate false positives, particularly when dealing with structurally plausible but biologically irrelevant interactions. By acknowledging both the potential limitations of co-IP and the possibility of false positives from AlphaFold2, the authors can provide a more balanced interpretation of their findings.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's point of view. We have used the co-IP method to detect interactions in this study. However, as the reviewer pointed out, it is likely that weak and transient interactions may not be detected. We plan to add a note on the detection limits of the co-IP method and the possibility that AlphaFold2 method produces false positives in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(3) In line 143, the authors state that &quot;This approach identified 13 pairs; seven of these were already known to form complexes, confirming the effectiveness of AlphaFold2 in predicting complex formations (Table 2). The highest pcScore pair was the Zuc homodimer, possibly because AlphaFold2 had learned from Zuc homodimer's crystal structure registered in the database.&quot; While the authors mentioned the presence of the Zuc homodimer's crystal structure, they do not provide a systematic bioinformatics analysis to evaluate pairwise sequence identity or check for the presence of existing structures for all the proteins or protein pairs (or their homologs) in databases such as the Protein Data Bank (PDB) or Swiss-Model. Conducting such an analysis is critical, as it significantly impacts the novelty and reliability of AlphaFold2 predictions. For instance, high sequence identity between the query proteins could lead to high-scoring models for biologically irrelevant interactions. Including this information would strengthen the conclusions regarding the accuracy and utility of the predictions.</p>

<p>We appreciate the reviewer's critical point. The AlphaFold2 method generates a high confidence score when the 3D structure of the protein of interest, or of proteins with very similar sequences, is solved. We will investigate whether the proteins used in this study are included in the 3D structure database and add the information to the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>(4) While the manuscript successfully identifies novel protein interactions, the broader biological significance of these interactions remains underexplored. The manuscript could benefit from elaborating on how these findings may contribute to understanding the piRNA pathway and its implications on germline development, transposon repression, and oogenesis.</p>

<p>We plan to add to the revise manuscript the potential biological significance of the novel protein-protein interactions presented in this manuscript.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this paper, the authors use AlphaFold2 to identify potential binding partners of nuage localizing proteins.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The main strength of the paper is that the authors experimentally verify a subset of the predicted interactions.</p>
<p>Many studies have been performed to predict protein-protein interactions in various subsets of proteins. The interesting story here is that the authors (i) focus on an organelle that contains quite some intrinsically disordered proteins and (ii) experimentally verify some (but not all) predictions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Identification of pairwise interactions is only a first step towards understanding complex interactions. It is pretty clear from the predictions that some (but certainly not all) of the pairs could be used to build larger complexes. AlphaFold easily handles proteins up to 4-5000 residues, so this should be possible. I suggest that the authors do this to provide more biological insights.</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for his kind suggestions. Although dimer structure predictions were made in this manuscript, if a protein is predicted to interact with two other proteins, it is possible that three proteins could interact. We plan to add such trimer predictions to the revise manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Another weakness is the use of a non-standard name for &quot;ranking confidence&quot; - the author calls it the pcScore - while the name used in AlphaFold (and many other publications) is ranking confidence.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We take the reviewer’s point and will revise the text accordingly.</p>
