<title>Abstract</title><p>Core body temperature (Tb) is defended within narrow limits through thermoregulatory behaviors like huddling, nesting, and physical activity as well as autonomic responses like brown fat thermogenesis and peripheral vasodilation. While Tb displays regulated fluctuations across different behavioral states and rest/arousal cycles, the neural control of these transitions is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the relationship between oxytocin neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVN<sup>OT</sup>) and behavioral and autonomic thermoeffector pathways across physiological states in mice. First, we show that PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons are activated during social thermoregulation. We then demonstrate that—in both social and nonsocial contexts—in vivo PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium dynamics align with transitions from rest to thermogenesis and behavioral arousal. Using a computer vision model to track thermoeffector pathways, we demonstrate that precisely timed stimulation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons during low-Tb resting states increases thermogenesis followed by behavioral arousal. We therefore suggest a model in which PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons facilitate state-dependent transitions in thermo-behavioral states.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Maintaining a relatively constant core body temperature (Tb) is a vital homeostatic need. While excessive deviations (e.g. &gt;2°C) from the typical mammalian Tb of approximately 37°C can be harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Nixdorf-Miller et al., 2006</xref>), Tb normally fluctuates within a narrow range (typically 0.5 -1°C) across sleep-wake cycles and behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blessing and Ootsuka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Refinetti, 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">1999</xref>). These fluctuations often exhibit bimodal or multimodal distributions, indicating distinct thermal states. Additionally, Tb variations are increasingly understood not as passive outcomes of animal physiology, but as regulated, brain-initiated transitions between defended Tb “balance-points” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Romanovsky, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blessing and Ootsuka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morrison and Nakamura, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>). For example, the transition from the rest to the active balance-point involves modulation of both autonomic and behavioral thermoeffector pathways (i.e., regulated heat loss and production) to meet the energetic demands of movement and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blessing and Ootsuka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>). However, the neural mechanisms that govern these physiological transitions remain incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harding et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Thermoregulation is orchestrated by the integration of autonomic and behavioral effectors. Autonomic outputs, such as brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis and vasomotor tone, are well-characterized at the circuit level. This pathway integrates sensory signals from peripheral thermosensors in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA), then relays this information to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), and then to sympathetic efferent neurons of the rostral medullary raphe (rMR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Morrison, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morrison and Nakamura, 2019</xref>). By contrast, the neuronal substrates of behavioral thermoregulation—such as huddling, nesting, or physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gordon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>, 2021)—and how they integrate with autonomic outputs are less well defined. Although recent studies have made progress in identifying brain regions underlying some of the associated neural pathways, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Almeida et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Sotelo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Tan and Knight, 2018</xref>), much remains unknown about how animals behaviorally thermoregulate.</p>
<p>Behavioral thermoregulation strategies are naturally organized into alternating sequences across bouts of arousal and quiescence and are modulated by environmental conditions (including social context) and internal state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Endo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harding et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sotelo et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2022</xref>). Huddling is a cooperative behavior that provides thermal and energetic benefits through shared body heat and reduction of heat loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alberts, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Fransson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gilbert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Haig, 2008</xref>). When mice experience mild cold stress, huddling facilitates both entry into, and exit from, an energy-saving, low-Tb quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>). This pattern suggests active neural regulation of behavior and sympathetic arousal in tandem; however, the brain circuits that support this coordination remain unidentified.</p>
<p>Oxytocin (OT)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (i.e., PVN<sup>OT</sup>) are a compelling candidate for such coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Rogers et al., 2024</xref>). PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons have been implicated in autonomic arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Noble et al., 2014</xref>), and thermoregulation— including activation of BAT thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fukushima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kasahara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sutton et al., 2014</xref>). The oxytocin system is also classically associated with social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Froemke and Young, 2021</xref>) including physical touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tang et al., 2020</xref>)—a key element of huddling. Indeed, OT-mutant rat pups display deficits in both warm-seeking and huddling behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Harshaw et al., 2018</xref>), and OT neurons display bursts of pulsatile activity during bouts of lactation and direct physical contact with pups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yaguchi et al., 2024</xref>). Yet, whether PVN<sup>OT</sup> neural activity is functionally associated with the organization of thermoregulatory states is not known.</p>
<p>Here, we set out to identify the relationship between PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity and daily patterns of behavioral thermoregulation in mice. We initially observed that PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity is linked to huddling states. Then, we discovered that PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium dynamics during huddling are predictive of transitions to body warming and arousal. Intriguingly, in a parallel fashion, PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity also tracks transitions from rest to arousal in solo animals. Last, using automated thermal feature tracking and optogenetics, we demonstrate that PVN<sup>OT</sup> stimulation initiates state-dependent transitions that coordinate physiological warming with behavioral arousal. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons in regulating dynamic, context-dependent thermo-behavioral strategies.</p>

<title>PVN<sup>OT</sup> neural activity is associated with huddling substates</title>
<p>Mice use huddling to facilitate thermoregulatory state transitions. We sought to identify huddling-associated brain regions in groups of adult females, which show stronger huddling-associated Tb changes than male groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>). Using a home-cage surveillance system that eliminates direct human-animal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>) in conjunction with FOS immunohistochemistry (IHC), we examined patterns of neural FOS activity in 18 brain regions. We focused on regions associated with thermoregulation, social behavior, and identified to be FOS-activated during huddling substates in preliminary studies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A-B</xref>). We examined animals engaged in active huddling (close physical contact while displaying some physical activity), quiescent huddling (close physical contact with no physical activity) and—as a control for physical touch in the absence of social contact—solo-housed animals engaged in self-grooming. For IHC, we scored cellular FOS activity after the animals had been engaged in state-specific behavior (i.e., active huddle, quiescent huddle, solo-groom) for at least 15 minutes.</p>

<p>We initially focused on active huddling-associated FOS expression because this state requires that an animal actively maintain close physical contact with another individual. We identified three regions that were activated 90 minutes after the onset of active-huddling: the dorsal medial hypothalamus (DMH), the rostral lateral septum (LS), and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C-F</xref> and <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">S1A-C</xref>; all statistical results are reported in Table S1). The DMH and the PVN are areas associated with energy regulation and thermoregulation, with inputs to the rMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Morrison et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morrison and Nakamura, 2019</xref>; Seoyoung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Son et al., 2022</xref>). The LS is associated with a variety of functions, from motivation to fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Besnard and Leroy, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Rizzi-Wise and Wang, 2021</xref>) and is strongly associated with the control of social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Menon et al., 2022</xref>). These results suggest active huddling recruits brain regions with known roles in thermoeffector and social interaction pathways.</p>
<p>The PVN is one of two primary locations of OT-producing neurons (Seoyoung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Son et al., 2022</xref>). Given the established associations of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons with thermoregulation and social behavior, we asked whether they were activated during active and quiescent huddling. To increase the temporal resolution of our assay from the timescale of protein translation to that of mRNA transcription, we used single-molecule fluorescence <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH) to identify PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons that became <italic>Fos</italic>-positive 30 minutes after the onset of a behavioral state. We quantified neurons in the dorsal and ventral PVN, which have unique cyto-architectures and projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Biag et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G-I</xref>). PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons were <italic>Fos</italic>-positive during both active huddling and quiescent huddling. During active huddling, the dorsal population was more <italic>Fos</italic>-positive than the ventral population, and this dorsal population displayed greater <italic>Fos</italic> activity during active compared to quiescent huddling (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1I</xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest the PVN is a huddling-associated brain region and that PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons are activated during huddling substates. Given the coarse timescale of <italic>Fos</italic> dynamics (≥30 minutes) compared to the faster timescale of rest-arousal cycles in mice (minutes; (Li et al., 2022; McShane et al., 2010)), we next employed in vivo calcium recordings to capture finescale population-level dynamics of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons.</p>

<p>Behaviorally, mice modulate body temperature through physical activity, nesting, and huddling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gordon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>, 2021). In a longitudinal study accounting for individual variance in physiology and behavior, we next asked how calcium activity in PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons was associated with real-time behavior during social thermoregulation in different thermal conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-C</xref>). As a control for social context, we also examined solo-housed animals. Experiments were conducted at three floor temperatures: cold (15°C), cool (23°C; room temperature), and a temperature near the “lower critical temperature” (29°C; the transition point between energy-requiring and energy-neutral thermoregulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gordon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Maloney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Škop et al., 2020</xref>)). We tracked six behaviors in the solo condition and 10 behaviors in the paired condition (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p>

GCaMP AAVs have been validated to transfect OT neurons in OT-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Resendez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yukinaga et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhan et al., 2024</xref>) and, in this study, showed co-labelling with OT-immunoreactive neurons (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2A-B</xref>). Neural-photometric recordings were conducted during the light/rest phase, when the distinction between different thermoregulatory states is more discernable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>). We observed large calcium transients (hereafter “peaks”) that appeared to be similar to those previously reported in lactating female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yaguchi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yukinaga et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Further analyses focused on peaks that were at least six standard deviations above baseline.</p>
<p>We first examined the effect of social context (i.e., paired-vs. solo-housed) on calcium peak amplitude and frequency across the three floor temperatures. While there was no effect of social context on peak amplitude (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C</xref>), there was an increase in peak frequency in paired animals (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2C-D</xref>). To our surprise, in both social and nonsocial contexts, PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks were strongly linked to specific behaviors. In the solo context, peak amplitude and frequency were associated with nesting and quiescence (i.e., motionless rest) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E-G</xref>). In the paired context, peaks were associated with active and quiescent huddling (Video S1) and, to a lesser extent, nesting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2H-J</xref>). We next examined the behavioral associations of PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks within each floor temperature. The behavior-state associations with calcium peaks were largely preserved across all three floor temperatures (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2G-J</xref>). Linear mixed model analysis of calcium peak amplitude and frequency revealed main effects of quiescence and nesting in the solo context (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3G,I</xref>), and main effects of active huddling, quiescent huddling, and nesting in the paired context (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3H,J</xref>). Thus, PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks are associated with distinct resting and waking behavioral states in social and non-social contexts.</p>
<p>Next, we analyzed the relationship between floor temperature and peak frequency across the two social contexts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K-P</xref>). Peaks were more frequent 29°C for both solo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>) and paired (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2N</xref>) animals. In mice, sleep is more common at warmer ambient temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harding et al., 2020</xref>). To disambiguate whether PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks display warm sensitivity vs. arousal-state dependency, we performed a multiple regression analysis relating the number of peaks to floor temperature and the duration of rest bouts (i.e., quiescence quiescent huddling) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F-G</xref> and I-J). In both the solo and paired conditions, calcium peak counts were strongly related to rest bout duration (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L,O</xref>). Moreover, quiescence and quiescent huddling bouts appeared longer at 29°C (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2L,O</xref>, red dots). We therefore examined the contribution of bout length and floor temperature to peak counts. In the solo and paired contexts, increased peak counts at 29°C could be explained by longer rest bout lengths (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2M</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2P</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these results suggest PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks track distinct resting and active behaviors in social and non-social settings, and are slightly enhanced in the social context. In addition, PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks are largely unaffected by the ambient temperature conditions tested; we therefore pooled data from the three floor temperatures in subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>PVN<bold><sup>OT</sup></bold> neurons predict transitions towards thermogenesis and behavioral arousal in social and non-social contexts</title>
<p>PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks track two rest states (quiescence and quiescent huddling), and two active states (i.e., nesting and active huddling) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, each of these states are in part thermoregulatory and are naturally organized into alternating sequences of bouts across rest/active cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Endo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Harding et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sotelo et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2022</xref>).

<p>We first examined physical activity (as measured by frame-to-frame pixel changes) before and after PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks in the home-cage. In both solo and paired conditions, physical activity increased following PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks. This increase began at the approximate time of the peak and persisted through the subsequent 400 seconds (6.6 min) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-E</xref>). We next examined the density (i.e., frequency of peaks per time bin) of calcium peaks with respect to the onset and offset of the two resting states: quiescence and quiescent huddling. For both behaviors, there was a higher density of peaks in the minutes prior to bout offset compared to onset (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3A-C</xref>). Moreover, there was a positive relationship between bout length and the number of peaks per bout, indicating that longer rest bouts are more likely to have peaks (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3B,D</xref>). To better understand the relationship between PVN<sup>OT</sup> dynamics and bouts of quiescence and quiescence huddling, we examined (1) the per-second probability of observing a peak relative to bout onset/offset using logistic regression, and (2) changes in calcium baseline (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F-M</xref>).</p>
<p>For bouts of quiescence, peak probability was approximately 2.7% near the time of onset and 14.0% near the time of offset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>). For bouts of quiescent huddling, peak probability was approximately 2.1% near the onset and around 25.6% near the time of offset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3H</xref>). In accordance with the peak density and probability data, baseline calcium in PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons was higher in the minutes leading to quiescence offset compared to onset in all animals (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G,I</xref> and S3I-J). Thus, PVN<sup>OT</sup> neural activity strongly predicts quiescence/quiescent huddling offset compared to onset by at least five-fold, and signals an increase in physical activity—a correlate of behavioral arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">De Lecea et al., 2012</xref>) and a means of increasing metabolic rate and Tb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gordon, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined PVN<sup>OT</sup> peak density and probability during the onset and offset of the two active states: nesting and active huddling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J-M</xref>, and S3E-H). In contrast to the two resting states, peak density in both states was higher near bout onset compared to offset (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3E,G</xref>). Moreover, there was only a weak relationship between peak count and bout length for both states, indicating that longer bouts are not more likely to have peaks (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3F,H</xref>). Logistic regression analysis of nesting bouts showed that PVN<sup>OT</sup> peak probability was approximately 7.7% near the time of onset and 3.3% near the time of offset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3J</xref>). For active huddling bouts, peak probability was approximately 15.3% near the time of onset and 5.2% near the time of offset (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3L</xref>). Thus, for nesting and active huddling, PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks are two-to three-fold more likely to predict bout onset than offset. Notably, within the paired condition, there was a higher peak probability for active huddling compared to nesting (Poisson regression, nesting vs. active huddling peaks counts, P &lt; 0.001), suggesting that social interaction enhances the probability of PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity.</p>
<p>Nesting and active huddling often occur immediately before or after (or in between) bouts of quiescence (i.e., the peri-quiescent phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gordon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sotelo et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2022</xref>). We next examined the quiescence phase for PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks associated with nesting and active huddling. PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks were more likely to occur during the post-quiescence phase for both nesting (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3K</xref>) and active huddling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3M</xref>). Notably, although nesting and active huddling are commonly expressed during the pre-quiescent phase, these two behaviors are rare during the post-quiescent phase (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3K-L</xref>). Thus, even though nesting and active huddling are relatively rare during the post-quiescent phase, those are precisely the active states during which PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity increases. These results suggest PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons distinguish nesting/active huddling in the post-quiescent phase from these same behaviors in the pre-quiescent phase.</p>
<p>Together these results suggest that PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity dynamics predict within approximately 100 seconds the offset of two rest states (quiescence and quiescent huddling) and within around 20 seconds the onset of two post-quiescence active states (nesting and active huddling) in solo and paired mice, respectively.</p>

<title>PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks occur during low Tb (∼36.2°C) and prior to body warming</title>
<p>In rodents, transitions from rest to arousal are thought to result, in part, from an ultradian (i.e., occurring on cycles &lt; 24 hr), brain-driven switch of the defended body temperature from a rest balance-point (i.e., lower bound) to an awake balance-point (i.e., upper bound) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blessing and Ootsuka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>). Because PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks aligned with transitions from resting to active states, we next examined individual core Tb dynamics before, during, and after PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N-Q</xref>). In both solo and paired conditions, PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks occurred when Tb was around 0.5<bold>°</bold>C lower than baseline (baseline-Tb: 36.7<bold>°</bold>C; peri-peak-Tb: 36.2<bold>°</bold>C) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N,P</xref>). Moreover, PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks aligned with the low point of a U-shaped body temperature profile: on average, Tb decreased before, and increased after, the time of the calcium peak in both solo and paired conditions (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3O,Q</xref>). Together, these results suggest that PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks occur during a low Tb and predict a forthcoming increase in Tb.</p>

<title>Validation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neural calcium peaks</title>
<p>PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons display pulsatile activity bursts during lactation and direct contact with pups, with heightened intensity and broadening waveforms during late-stage lactation (PPD 8 to 14) compared to early-stage lactation (PPD 2-7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yaguchi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yukinaga et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yukinaga and Miyamichi, 2025</xref>). However, the extent to which this type of activity in PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons is exclusive to lactation and nursing events remains a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Perkinson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Resendez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yaguchi et al., 2024</xref>). To address whether peaks occurring during transitions from quiescence to active states resemble those during lactation, we recorded from virgin females as described above and then allowed them to reproduce and nurse their young (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>). As documented in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yaguchi et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yukinaga et al., 2022</xref>), PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons displayed peaks that increased in frequency and amplitude from early-stage to late-stage lactation—an observation that provides physiological verification of the oxytocinergic identity of the recorded neurons in our system (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D-E</xref> and Video S2). PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks in virgin females appeared similar in amplitude in early-stage compared to late-stage lactation and appeared narrower overall (Fig. F-H). Systematic comparisons of peak kinetics revealed that virgin female calcium peaks displayed narrower full-width half maximum (FWHM) values than either early-stage or late-stage lactation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4H-I</xref>). Next, while virgin and early-stage lactation peak amplitudes were equivalent, both were less than that of late-stage lactation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4J</xref>). Finally, while virgin interpeak intervals (IPIs) were equivalent to early-stage lactation, they were longer than those of late-stage lactation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4K</xref>). Together, these results suggest that PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks observed in the virgin females of this study during naturalistic home-cage behaviors share similar calcium kinetics to those during early-stage, but not late-stage lactation. As such, this data uncovers a behavioral and physiological context in which PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons display calcium burst-like peaks.</p>

<title>PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks signal increases in BAT thermogenesis and vasomotor tone</title>
<p>Our data suggest PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks signal transitions towards thermogenesis and arousal as measured by core Tb and physical activity. However, core Tb represents the integration of several different thermoeffector pathways like BAT thermogenesis and vasomotor responses. We therefore sought to automate a computational strategy that uses video thermography recordings of awake, behaving animals to approximate BAT thermogenesis and vasomotor processes at sub-second resolution—a timescale relevant to sympathetic activity.</p>
<p>We developed a computer vision system called Skeleton-Guided Bodypart Segmentation (SGBS) that uses deep learning to record the surface temperature of three thermal features of an animal: the surfaces over (1) interscapular brown fat (BAT), (2) the rump, and (3) the entire dorsal surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Our pipeline integrates DeepLabCut-based animal tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) and Mask R-CNN technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">He et al., 2017</xref>) in a Python framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">TorchVision maintainers and contributors, 2016</xref>) to process high-resolution thermography (FLIR) videos. An attention layer integrates 10 anatomical skeleton keypoints (e.g., head, nose, shoulders and tail) with a model trained on manual annotations of the three thermal features. Leveraging these keypoints, SGBS can precisely localize and delineate thermal features for mask prediction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). SGBS detects above-average temperatures in the BAT region and below-average temperatures rump region without the need for shaving the back—a manipulation alters heat loss and can alter behavioral and autonomic thermoregulation (Meyer et al., 2017)(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, SGBS demonstrates 100-fold lower loss compared to an unmodified Mask R-CNN using identical training data (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We used SGBS to segment BAT, rump, and dorsal surface features on a frame-by-frame basis, extracting the mean temperature for each feature (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref> and Video S3). SGBS data were synchronized with timestamps and integrated with other data streams, including calcium traces and behavior tracking. For these analyses, solo-housed females were used to eliminate the confounding effects of heat exchange with social partners.</p>

<p>To test the performance of SGBS, we examined the temporal dynamics of pairwise combinations of the three thermal features with respect to core Tb and identified the lag time that gives the best correlation (i.e., cross-correlation analysis) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>). Core and dorsal surface temperatures were very similar with no lag. Next, changes in core Tb lagged changes in BAT by approximately 90 seconds, a result consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ootsuka et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, rump temperature lagged core Tb by 20 seconds. Thus, SGBS captures the dynamics of thermoregulatory features at the resolution of seconds. These results support the notions that (1) core and dorsal surface temperatures are highly correlated because they both integrate multiple thermoeffector pathways, (2) BAT thermogenesis can drive temperature increases in the mouse body on the order of minutes, and (3) vasomotor processes in the rump regulate Tb on a relatively faster timescale (i.e., seconds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Blessing et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>We next used SGBS to align thermal feature data with PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks from fiber photometry recordings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F-M</xref>). Consistent with our previous core Tb measurements (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N-Q</xref>), BAT and dorsal surface temperatures trended downward before the calcium peak but increased afterward, a shift confirmed by a significant difference in slope before <italic>vs</italic>. after the peak (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H,J</xref>). Moreover, BAT and dorsal surface temperatures were significantly greater after the peak compared to before (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5I,K</xref>). By contrast, although rump temperature showed no difference in slope before <italic>vs</italic>. after peak, the mean temperature was lower after the peak compared to before (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5L-M</xref>). Together, these results suggest that PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity is associated with a thermogenic state characterized by the onset of BAT thermogenesis and, to a lesser degree, increased rump vasoconstriction, following PVN<sup>OT</sup> activation.</p>

<title>Optogenetic activation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons initiates thermogenic responses</title>
<p>To elucidate the functional link between PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity during quiescence and thermoeffector outputs, channelrhodopsin (AAVDJ-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP-WPRE-pA) was expressed in the PVN of Oxytocin-Cre mice (ChR2+) to allow for optogenetic stimulation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). To control for potential warm-sensitive physiological responses due to heat from light stimulation, a “light-only” cohort of Oxytocin-Cre mice received optic fiber implants over the PVN. These experiments were conducted at room temperature (23°C) in solo-housed females to focus on the precise physiology of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons and to eliminate confounding effects of social-partners. Blue light stimulation (10 Hz; 20 ms pulse width (20% duty cycle); 10 mW power; 10 or 20 sec pulse train) occurred after solo animals had been quiescent for at least two minutes (a condition similar to when PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks occur).</p>

<p>We first examined the effect of blue light stimulation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons on core Tb. Approximately 400 sec (6.6 min) after a 20 sec, but not a 10 sec, pulse train, Tb increased in ChR2+ but not light-only controls (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4A</xref>). Further examination of Tb data revealed that some blue light stimulations occurred during a relatively high Tb— in contrast to the low Tb context in which PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks naturally occur (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N-Q</xref>). To address a possible mismatch in internal physiology during optogenetic stimulations vs. endogenous calcium peaks, we stratified the data according to whether Tb was above or below average (per-mouse) at the time of stimulation (i.e., Tb-T0). The low Tb-T0 distribution was similar to the Tb distribution observed during PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks in solo animals (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> blue line, cf. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3N</xref>). We then examined the effect of 20 sec optogenetic stimulation in the stratified data and found ChR2+ stimulation caused increased Tb in the low Tb-T0 context but not the high Tb-T0 context; this increased Tb was observable 420 sec after stimulation and persisted for several minutes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Thus, precisely timed, context-dependent stimulation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons is sufficient to increase core Tb.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the effect of PVN<sup>OT</sup> stimulation on physical activity and behavior (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>, <xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">S4B-C</xref>). While no significant differences were detected between ChR2+ and controls, ChR2+ mice showed a trend toward increased physical activity over time in the low Tb-T0 context (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). A separate slope-based analysis of post-stimulation activity revealed that ChR2+ animals exhibited a steeper increase in physical activity compared to light-only controls in the low (but not high) Tb-T0 context. (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4C</xref>). Analysis of manually-annotated behaviors suggested that PVN<sup>OT</sup> stimulation did not activate a specific motor pattern output but instead resulted in combined increases in the time spent in nesting (linear mixed model estimate coefficient of ChR2+ stimulation: +38.0 sec), locomotion (+54.0 sec), and grooming (+14.5 sec), but not in eating/drinking (- 0.4 sec) (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4B</xref>).</p>
<p>We next examined the effect of light stimulation on thermal features using SGBS. Compared to light-only controls, 20 sec pulse trains triggered increased BAT and rump surface temperatures in the low (but not high) Tb-T0 context approximately 360 sec post stimulus (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E-F</xref>). Moreover, in the low Tb-T0 context, blue light stimulation in ChR2+ animals increased the slopes of the surface temperatures of BAT and rump surface temperatures compared to light-only control animals (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D-F</xref>). In contrast, in the high Tb-T0 context, blue light stimulation did not affect the BAT or rump surface temperatures and caused a slight decrease in the dorsal surface temperature (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4D-F</xref>).</p>
<p>These data suggest that 20 seconds of PVN<sup>OT</sup> stimulation during the low Tb-T0 resting states is sufficient to trigger a sustained increase in Tb, and to a lesser extent, an increase in physical activity. Thus, PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons signal state dependent transitions in thermogenesis and behavioral arousal.</p>

<title>PVN<sup>OT</sup> cellular projections to the rMR</title>
<p>We next asked what pathways could PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons promote transitions towards thermogenesis and physical activity. rMR efferent neurons regulate non-shivering thermogenesis, cutaneous vasoconstriction, and heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Morrison and Nakamura, 2019</xref>), and the surrounding gigantocellular reticular nucleus (GiA) regulates locomotion and movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Brownstone and Chopek, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Engmann et al., 2020</xref>). In rats, PVN<sup>OT</sup> to rMR projections (PVN<sup>OT</sup>→rMR) stimulate thermogenesis and cardiovascular responses in an oxytocin receptor (OXTR)-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fukushima et al., 2022</xref>). To investigate possible PVN<sup>OT</sup>→rMR cell types in mice, we used tracing tools to disambiguate magno-vs. parvocellular PVN<sup>OT</sup> projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Althammer and Grinevich, 2018</xref>) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5A-C</xref>). The majority of PVN<sup>OT</sup>→rMR projections were non-magnocellular cells located in the caudal and lateral PVN, suggesting they are parvocellular (i.e., PVN<sup>OT(parvo)</sup>) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5C</xref>), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Althammer and Grinevich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fukushima et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, we observed OXTR-positive neurons in the rMR and GiA (i.e., rMR<sup>OXTR</sup>) using smFISH (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5D</xref>). Thus, PVN<sup>OT(Parvo)</sup> →rMR<sup>OXTR</sup> neurons are a candidate pathway underlying transitions towards thermogenesis and behavioral arousal in mice.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study uncovers a distinct functional pattern of state-dependent PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity during natural patterns of thermoregulatory and arousal behaviors. We initially set out to examine the role of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons in social thermoregulation. Leveraging long-duration in vivo recordings, we identified large PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks that emerged approximately one hour into the home-cage recording. To our surprise, these peaks were observed in both social and non-social contexts. PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks were temporally aligned with transitions from resting states (quiescence and quiescent huddling) to active states (nesting, active huddling, and physical activity) and increased thermogenesis. Notably, the PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity patterns and kinetics we observed in virgin female mice resemble the well-characterized bursts observed during the early stages of lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yaguchi et al., 2024</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yukinaga et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting a broader physiological role for oxytocin neurons in coordinating transitions between thermoregulatory and behavioral states.</p>
<p>PVN<sup>OT</sup> dynamics were temporally aligned to the offset of a low-Tb resting state. In the minutes prior to the end of a rest bout, baseline calcium increased and large peaks occurred in a probabilistic fashion: there was an approximately 20% chance of peaks occurring within around 100 seconds prior to quiescence offset, as opposed to ∼2.5% during the first 100 seconds of rest onset. In addition, PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium peaks occurred more consistently when core Tb was relatively low—approximately 36.2°C, which is about 0.5°C below the average rest-phase Tb for C57B/6 animals in our colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Landen et al., 2024</xref>). In mice, Tb displays an ultradian rhythm characterized by limit-cycle-like oscillations between biologically constrained upper and lower bounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Blessing and Ootsuka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>). A Tb threshold of 36.2°C may represent an approximate lower-bound of the resting state and a point at which a transition to the active-state upper-bound is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>). PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons might therefore signal the transition toward thermogenesis and arousal during ultradian cycles of rest-to-arousal during the light phase. Supporting this interpretation, PVN<sup>OT</sup> calcium activity and optogenetic stimulation during a low Tb—but not a high Tb—rest state signaled increases in Tb and locomotor activity within a few minutes. This state-dependency indicates that these neurons integrate information to modulate sympathetic activation (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Graphical summary.</title>
<p>Increased calcium activity in PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons signals the end of rest and the onset of thermogenesis and behavioral arousal. Both the frequency of large amplitude peaks and baseline calcium levels increase approximately two minutes before the end of rest (i.e., quiescence and quiescent huddle). Calcium peaks briefly continue into post-quiescent active states, like nesting and active huddling. Optogenetic stimulation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons during rest triggers increased BAT thermogenesis, core body temperature (Tb) and physical activity. Arrows indicate transitions between the low-Tb rest balance point (downward vertical arrows) and the high-Tb active balance point (upward vertical arrows).</p></caption>

<p>Our deep-learning pipeline (SGBS) further allowed us to track thermal features (dorsal surface, brown fat, and rump) at milli-second resolution. We detected increases in BAT temperature following calcium peaks and optogenetic stimulation, supporting a role of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons in driving state-dependent transitions towards thermogenesis. Several neural populations that promote the transition from sleep to wake have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sulaman et al., 2023</xref>), some of which are directly involved in thermoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Harding et al., 2019</xref>). In conjunction with another report showing that chemogenetic activation of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons increases wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), our data now place PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons as a key node in the initiation of thermogenic and behavioral arousal from rest. Here, we suggest a model, congruent with two other reports, whereby the transition from rest to arousal begins with a change in neural activity leading to increased thermogenesis that is either coincident with, or followed by, increased physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Ootsuka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Škop et al., 2024</xref>) (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Notably, we found no evidence that decreases in PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity signal transitions towards quiescence and heat loss, indicating that distinct systems drive entry to, and exit from, resting states.</p>
<p>Some caveats of this study should be considered. First, we did not link PVN<sup>OT</sup> in vivo calcium activity or optogenetic stimulation with endocrinological release of OT. Future studies should address how the neuropeptide oxytocin (e.g., in addition to glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hrabovszky and Liposits, 2008</xref>)) drives transitions in behavioral arousal and thermogenesis. Second, although some of our experiments were conducted with only a handful of animals, we nevertheless detected robust associations between PVN<sup>OT</sup> activity and thermo-behavioral changes within individuals. Future work, incorporating more animals, could better capture variation across individuals and internal physiological states. Additionally, here we only studied females based on their discernable thermo-behavioral states; future work could focus on determining the role of PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons in males.</p>
<p>Overall, these findings extend the role of in vivo PVN<sup>OT</sup> neural activity dynamics beyond social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hegoburu et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Resendez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Sun et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Tang et al., 2020</xref>), parturition/lactation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Perkinson et al., 2021</xref>), maternal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Carcea et al., 2021</xref>), sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Qian et al., 2023</xref>), and stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhan et al., 2024</xref>), and highlight their contribution to daily patterns of rest/wake transitions, thermoregulation, and energy balance. In our model PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons respond to internal physiological conditions, such as core body temperature, to coordinate autonomic and behavioral outputs necessary for adaptive thermoregulation. These insights open new directions for understanding the neural circuits that integrate social context, internal state, and metabolic demands to regulate mammalian behavior.</p>

Mice were head-fixed on a digital mouse stereotax (Stoelting, 51730D). For added analgesia, a local anesthetic (5% lidocaine) was delivered subcutaneously along the incision site before cutting. A midline incision was made along the top of the skull, the periosteum was cleared with 3% hydrogen peroxide, and the skull was dried off with canned air. Vertical measurements of bregma and lambda were taken and aligned to the same plane (DV of ± 0.05 mm). The AAV was delivered using a programmable nanoliter injector, (Nanoject III, Drummond Scientific) (300nL per side: 6 cycles of 50nL delivered at 2nL/s with 10 second delays). To allow for proper diffusion of solution into brain tissue, the needle was left in for 10 minutes before retracting.

The cannula was anchored in place with dental cement (C&amp;B Metabond) such that a dome-shaped cap was halfway up the black ceramic ferrule and covered the entire incision. Post-operative care and recovery took place as described above. Two weeks post recovery, animals were tested for GCaMP signal using the Neurophotometrics photometry system (as described in “<underline>Fiber photometry</underline> <underline>recordings”)</underline>.

Using the same surgical procedure and PVN coordinates as mentioned above, 300 nL of AAV was delivered per side (6 cycles of 50nL delivered at 2nL/s with 10 second delays). The incision was closed using absorbable PGA suture threads and antibiotic ointment was applied topically along the incision. Animals recovered for two weeks to maximize viral expression.

RMR coordinates relative to bregma and DV measured from the top of the brain: AP = -5.80mm, ML= 0.00mm, DV= -4.95mm. Mice received post-operative care as described above and recovered for 3-4 days. For intravenous labeling of magnocellular and parvocellular OT neurons, mice received 15 uL of 4% Fluoro-Gold (Fluorochrome) diluted in 100 uL of sterile saline. Prior to injection, mice were given an analgesic dose of carprofen (20 mg/kg, s.c.). Mice were briefly restrained using a modified 50 mL conical tube, in which holes were drilled to allow for proper air flow and respiration. Mouse tails were interposed between two heating pads to enhance visibility of the tail vein.

                <p>Fluorophores were added to each channel and diluted at 1:1500. Each fluorophore was added by first opening the channel using 2-3 drops of HRP on each slice and incubating at 40°C for 15 minutes. The fluorophore was added at a volume of 40 µL to each slice and slides were incubated at 40°C for 30 minutes. To close the channel, 2-3 drops of blocker were added to each slice and incubated for 15 minutes. Lastly, a drop of DAPI (ACD Bio, #320858) was added to each slice for 30-45 seconds. DAPI was allowed to dry for approximately 3 minutes before immediately coverslipping with 1-2 drops of ProLong Gold (Invitrogen, P36930). Slides were protected from any surrounding light, left to dry overnight and imaged with a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1.</p>

                <title>Recording setup</title>
                <p>The Neurophotometrics fiber photometry system (FP3001), operating with Bonsai (Version 2.72) software, was used to acquire photometric data with concurrent video recordings (Arducam, OV9281). Patchcords (MBF Bioscience, NPM-BPC-4) were attached to the fiber ferrules, and held in place by either ceramic sleeves or by a quick-release interconnecter (ThorLabs, ADAL3). Calcium dependent GCaMP fluorescence signals were recorded with light from a 470-nm LED that was band-pass filtered, narrowed with a collimator, reflected by a dichroic mirror, and focused on the sensor of a CCD camera by a 20x objective. To account for auto-fluorescence and possible motion artifacts, a 415-nm LED for calcium-independent isosbestic fluorescence signal was used. The recorded signals were acquired with a sampling rate of 30 Hz for each channel at 100% duty cycle. LED light power was calibrated prior to every recording using a power meter (ThorLabs, PM100USB and S120C). LED light was delivered at a power that resulted in 60µW of 415-nm light, and 85 µW of 470-nm light at the tip of the patchcord.</p>

                <p>Photometric recordings occurred in the home cage, with the cage-lid replaced by a custom-fit metal sleeve that extended the cage wall height to 16”. Optic fiber-implanted mice and their pair-housed sister were habituated to the connector and patchcord prior to commencement of experimental schedule. Habituation periods ranged from several days to a week depending on individual animal reaction to the patchcord and to sufficiently aversion train the cagemate. Aversion training was performed during habituation periods by lightly coating the patchcord with diluted capsaicin (EMD Millipore, 211275). The cagemate and implant mouse were observed, and training was repeated until the cagemate associated the unpleasant sensation of capsaicin with chewing of the patchcord. Recordings were approximately 2-hours and were conducted at three different floor temperatures (15C°, 23C° and 29°C), with and without the sister cage-mate. Floor temperature was controlled by placing the home-cage onto a custom aluminum chassis that attached to the Hot/Cold Plate (Ugo Basile, 35300), temperature was then validated by a temperature logging iButton (DS1922L-F5, Embedded Data Systems) placed inside the home-cage. A portion of the nesting material was removed before experiments to prevent occlusion of the animals during the recording (see Supplementary Video 1 for typical amount of bedding left in cage).</p>

                <title>Calcium data preprocessing</title>
                <p>Fluorescent signal data preprocessing was done with a custom R script as follows: 415 and 470 channels de-interleaved; 470 channel filtered to remove high-frequency noise using a 4th-order Butterworth filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc6">Van Boxtel et al., 2021</xref>) modified to remove end-effect transients; trimmed to remove approximately the first six minutes of data (to mitigate the effect of photobleaching); if necessary, further trimmed to remove effects of disruptions to the patchcord (chewing or twisting); smoothed with a sliding window function (rollapply; width = 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc8">Zeileis et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
                <p>To correct the calcium-dependent signal from effects of photobleaching and heat-mediated LED decay, we first extracted the “fitted values” from the linear relationship between the 470 (calcium-dependent) and 415 (calcium independent) fluorescent signals. Next, to calculate dF/F we divided the 470 signal by these fitted values. Because we observed occasional artifactual shifts in baseline dF/F values, we baseline corrected dF/F using the iterative least squares method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc3">Liland and Mevik, 2011</xref>). The Z-scored dF/F was calculated as Z = (χ-μ)/ σ, where μ is the mean dF/F and σ is the standard deviation of dF/F. To define peaks, we used the findpeaks function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="sc1">Borchers, 2011</xref>), with the minimum peak distance set at two seconds and the minimum peak height set at six standard deviations above the mean dF/F. Photometric data were aligned to behavioral data (exported from Noldus Ethovision) and Tb data (exported from Mercury) using common centisecond-resolution timestamps and reduced to a sampling frequency of 10 frames per second.</p>
                <p>Peri-event data oriented on specific events (i.e., calcium peaks or start/stop frames of behavioral bouts) were extracted using a custom function that (1) extracts the indices of the events and (2) generates a list of vectors for a specified number of rows before and after the event.</p>
                <p>To compare longitudinal physiological patterns of activity in PVN<sup>OT</sup> neurons in virgin females (primary subjects of this study) compared to nursing and lactation, we made the following modifications to the protocol as described above. First, to quantify PVN<sup>OT</sup> peak characteristics (amplitude, full width half maximum, interpeak interval) before linear normalization and baseline correction, (i.e., to better describe the dynamics of their native characteristics), we corrected the calcium-dependent signal from effects of photobleaching and heat-mediated LED decay using an exponential decay model. Specifically, we used a self-starting nls (nonlinear least squares) function in R to fit the isosbestic data with the following model: y(t) ∼ SSasymp(timeS, yf, y0, log_alpha), where the measured isosbestic value y starts at y0 and decays towards yf at a rate α. SSasymp is a shortcut that guesses its own parameters; instead of fitting the rate constant α directly, it searches for the logarithm of α: y(t)∼yf+(y0−yf)e^−exp(logα)t. We then linearly scale this fitted decay to the calcium-dependent data using robust regression (MASS::rlm with the psi function set to bisquare); finally, we divided the calcium-dependent data by this scaled fit to get a corrected signal.</p>
                <p>In accordance with previous work, we examined three epochs in the same animals: virgin females; early-stage lactation (PPD 2-7); and late-stage lactation (PPD 8-14). To calculate the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of PVN<sup>OT</sup> peaks, we used a custom function that performs the following steps: finds each peak; determines the half-max value; interpolates where the signal crosses the half-max value; computes the FWHM as the difference between these crossing points. To calculate the interpeak interval (IPI), we used the lead function in R to compute the time (in seconds) from one peak to the next on a per-recording basis.</p>

A DeepLabCut deep learning model was first trained on manually labeled data from 1800 images to detect ten keypoints along the dorsal surface of the mice (nose, implant, head tip, neck base, center back, tail base, mid tail, patchcord, and right &amp; left shoulder). These keypoints were then incorporated into an attention layer alongside the thermal images to enhance texture representation and improve segmentation accuracy. The custom Mask R-CNN was trained using 457 images on <italic>Darwin</italic> (V7 Labs) to segment the BAT region, the rump region, and the entire dorsal surface of the mouse. Finally, segmented regions were mapped to their corresponding pixel-wise temperature data, providing per-frame temperature measurements (mean, min, max, SD) for each target region.

Both models ran over 200 epochs, and loss was measured after each epoch. Loss is calculated as the sum of three components: (1) a classification loss (cross-entropy) that assesses how accurately each body part is identified, (2) a bounding box regression loss that measures how close the predicted box is to the ground truth, and (3) a mask loss (binary cross-entropy) that evaluates pixel-by-pixel agreement between the predicted mask and the ground truth mask <sup>7,8</sup>.</p>

                <title>Recording setup</title>
                <p>Blue light (450 nm) stimulation was delivered using the Neurophotometrics fiber photometry system (FP3001), with simultaneous video and thermal recording. Mono-filament patchcords (Doric Lenses, MFP_200/220/900-0.37_3m_FC-MF1.25) were attached to the fiber ferrules and held in place by a quick-release interconnecter (ThorLabs, ADAL3). Optogenetic laser power was measured prior to every recording using a power meter (ThorLabs, PM100USB and S120C). Optogenetic activation used a frequency of 10 Hz, with a 20 ms pulse width (20% duty cycle) and 10 mW of power measured at the tip for either 10- or 20-second trains.</p>
                <p>Optogenetic recordings occurred in the home cage, with the same setup as fiber photometry recordings, described above. Mice were pair-housed until recording. One animal was tested at a time, while the other animal was placed in a holding cage for the duration of the experiment. During experiments, animals were observed remotely from a different room. The human observer turned on blue light stimulation after the animal had been inactive for a minimum of two minutes. Stimulations were a minimum of ten minutes apart from one another. Experiments were two hours long, averaging four to seven stimulations. Every animal was tested at least twice using each stimulation time (10s and 20s), until a minimum of 10 total stimulations occurred per animal, per stimulation time.</p>

                <p>For each stimulation, data spanning 5 min (–300 s) before to 10 min (+600 s) after light onset were extracted, with the onset designated as time 0. Core body temperature (Tb) data was recorded once every five seconds for the duration of the experiment. We therefore subset all other data to the same rate for core Tb analyses.</p>
                <p>Activity levels were measured at a rate of 10 Hz, so all data were subset to the same rate for activity analyses. As activity is measured using percent pixel movement over the entire image, activity was first set to a logarithmic scale, to measure small differences in change, then normalized using a Z score across mouse IDs to account for differences in baseline activity levels.</p>
                <p>Feature-specific surface temperatures using SGBS were measured at a rate of around 20-30 Hz, depending on the Flir A50’s output. As previously described, all surface temperature data was subset to 10 Hz and aligned to surface temperature data based on the nearest timestamps when the laser was turned on (&lt; 0.1s deviation). To eliminate the effect of outliers originating from an incorrect segmentation output, all surface temperature data were smoothed with a rolling average over one half of a second. To eliminate differences in baselines per animal, every value was baseline-normalized using ΔT/T, where each temperature value was expressed as a change from the pre-stimulation mean (3-minutes prior to light on) relative to that baseline.</p>
                <p>To assess whether optogenetic effects varied with initial thermal state, core body temperature at the onset of each blue-light pulse (Tb-T0) was recorded. Because Tb-T0 values were generally higher than those observed during spontaneous PVNOT calcium peaks, stimulations were stratified for each mouse into “low Tb-T0” and “high Tb-T0” trials using that animal’s mean Tb-T0 as the cutoff. The two strata were then analyzed separately.</p>

Next, we calculated normalized activity data across the 600 sec interval, including the mean normalized activity before and after each peak (i.e., “before-after”). Last, we fit a LMM with normalized activity as the dependent variable, “before-after” as the independent variable, and mouse-ID as a random effect.</p>
                    <p>To determine peak probability during defined behaviors we used logistic regression.

Next, we fit a binomial generalized linear model with PeakMinute as the dependent variable; the independent variable was the time span before, during, and after the behavioral epoch of interest (e.g., quiescence offset).

                    <p>To determine the effect of light stimulation on surface temperatures (BAT, rump, or dorsal surface) in ChR2+ vs. light-only controls separately, each surface temperature was analyzed separately, first by binning temps per minute, and then using the same LMM as above, with surface temps as the dependent variable.</p>
                    <p>To further determine the effect of light stimulation on direction of temperature change, slopes before and after light onset were analyzed with a second LMM that included fixed effects of time, proximity to stimulation (pre vs. post), and their interaction, plus a random intercept for mouse ID; frame-level weights were set to the inverse of each frame’s temperature SD. A significant interaction term indicated that temperature trajectories differed between ChR2+ and control groups across the stimulation boundary.</p>

First, linear regression models were applied to individual arousal behaviors to evaluate their contribution to group differences. As no single behavior showed a significant effect, all arousal behaviors were grouped, and a second linear regression model was used to assess whether total arousal time differed between groups.</p>

<p>This study presents a <bold>valuable</bold> finding regarding the role of oxytocin neurons in thermogenesis and behavioral thermoregulation. The use of numerous converging methods, including behavior, fiber photometry, optogenetics, thermal recordings, metabolic analyses, and more, produces a multi-dimensional dataset delivering findings that provide <bold>solid</bold> support for the conclusions. Conclusions would be strengthened with validation of the approaches, inclusion of a loss of function experiment, and further investigation of the social nature of the behavior. The maternal findings are, at present, somewhat disconnected from the conclusions. The findings are novel and open new doors for understanding the role of the PVT and oxytocin in thermoregulation work; the work will be of strong interest to the thermoregulation, social behavior, and oxytocin signaling communities.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors identify and investigate a specific population of PVNOT neurons (oxytocin neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamus) that seem to be involved in both behavioral and autonomic thermoregulation. These cells are activated by social thermoregulatory behaviors, but can influence thermoregulation in both social and nonsocial contexts, specifically during transitions and when mice are at low core body temperature (Tb).</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript has many strengths.</p>
<p>This is a novel study, with a clear question that is addressed using an array of well-designed experiments employing integrative methods. Most of the figures are well-developed, and the analysis is generally rigorous and well-detailed. The authors are clearly very experienced in this field, and indeed, their scholarly introduction and discussion sections are to their credit.</p>
<p>The link between thermoregulation and the oxytocin system is well established, as is the link between social behavior and the same broad system. However, the link between these three things is novel, if it can be well substantiated. I am not persuaded that was achieved here, but I do think this manuscript has many novel and useful offerings.</p>
<p>The authors use a cooling floor, and only go down to 10 degrees Celsius. This is fine, but I would like to see the effects using ambient temperature also. This is not a crucial issue, as it is not necessary for the authors' interpretations, but it could improve measurement sensitivity.</p>
<p>Through an elegant behavioral experiment in Figure 1, the authors identify c-Fos patterns in the PVN that are activated by active social huddling, and they show that at the RNA level these cells overlap with oxytocin, indicating that they are oxytocin-producing cells. But this is not well discussed or indeed quantified.</p>
<p>The authors engage in a deep analysis of fiber photometry experiments, first by observing PVNOT neuron overall activity during a variety of different behaviors in the context of three different temperatures. Activity was associated with nesting, quiescence, and both types of huddling (when social opportunities exist). Social situations did not strongly affect this, nor did temperature conditions. These analyses indicate that the PVNOT neurons are involved in mediating specific behavioral outputs.</p>
<p>With more detailed analysis, the authors investigated how PVNOT neuronal activity relates to behavioral state transition. They found that the probability of peak PVNOT neural activity strongly predicts the offset of quiescence or quiescent huddling, and therefore can be argued to signal an increase in physical activity, and as such, increased metabolism. However, the opposite pattern was observed for huddling and nesting (onset being associated with PVNOT activity), again arguing for increased thermogenesis as a function.</p>
<p>What is particularly compelling is that these peaks of activity tend to occur during low Tb, again arguing for the function in increasing body warmth.</p>
<p>The authors then employ an impressive setup where they image brown adipose tissue (BAT) in tandem with DeepLabCut (DLC) based animal tracking. Crucially, BAT activity and surface temperature correlated with the calcium peak of PVNOT neurons.</p>
<p>Lastly, optogenetic activation of PVNOT neurons increased Tb when it was in the lower range, but not when in the higher range. It also affected BAT and rump temperature, again at low Tb. However, there is no real effect on behavior, except a trend in activity.</p>
<p>The authors do some interesting tracing work at the end, though this is not functionally explored. That is not a criticism, as it does seem like this would be a whole follow-up study.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While novel and valuable, the manuscript feels incomplete in its current form.</p>
<p>The main evidence lacking is a loss of function of the experiment. Ideally, the authors would chronically and/or acutely inhibit PVNOT neurons to establish their necessity. I know this seems obvious, but I think it is important.</p>
<p>The relative lack of behavioral analysis following optogenetic activation of PVNOT neurons is puzzling. The authors must surely want to study what this intervention does to behavioral state transitions. I feel that the current level of analysis limits the overall conclusions of this study to a large extent.</p>
<p>A broader criticism is that the social dimension of this manuscript seems overplayed. Naturally, oxytocin signalling can be implicated in social behavior based on a large literature. However, the focus on social thermogenesis seems like a crude integration of social behavior and thermogenesis. Given that the authors see their effects in both social and nonsocial cases of thermoregulation, I am not sure the attempts at integrating social functions and thermogenic functions of PVNOT neurons are warranted. That is, unless the authors have further experiments or analysis that can convincingly justify this link.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysis of virgin females and lactating mothers seems out of place in Figure 4.</p>
<p>The c-Fos/oxytocin overlap needs to be quantified.</p>
<p>The methods section could be improved by explaining how the authors exclude animals that exhibit both types of huddling, if they occur within a 90-minute time window. This seems like it could cause significant confounds.</p>
<p>The computer vision model is not well-explained. The authors need to be far more explicit here about how it was validated.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This is a very interesting study from Vandendoren and colleagues examining the role of PVN oxytocin neurons during thermoregulatory behaviors, in particular during thermoregulatory huddling. The findings are important and compelling, and have implications for the thermoregulation field as well as the social/naturalistic behavior field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The study is very creative and tackles a challenging task to examine how natural and social behavior influences neural circuits for a homeostatic system such as thermoregulation. The authors use a combination of state-of-the-art tools (photometry, optogenetics, automated behavior tracking, thermal imaging, and core body temperature measurement), often in combination with each other, to produce a rigorous and high-dimensional dataset. Carrying out tightly temperature-controlled experiments and examining natural behavior, neural activity, and body physiology simultaneously is quite a feat. I applaud the authors for taking this on in a rigorous and detailed manner. This paper will be valuable for both the thermoregulation field as well as for researchers interested in naturalistic social behaviors. The conclusions are supported by the data.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>I have a number of questions and suggestions for clarification that would help improve the interpretation of the findings.</p>
<p>(1) Figure 1D-F: It would be helpful to include representative images of cFos expression in the PVN, LS, and DMH during both quiescent and solo huddling conditions, to better illustrate the reported differences.</p>
<p>(2) Figure 1C: The data suggest a general suppression of neural activity during sleep-associated quiescent huddling, which somewhat complicates the interpretation of what specifically the active huddling cells are responding to. A more informative control might have been a comparison between huddling and a more generic form of social engagement (e.g., dyadic sniffing) to assess whether huddling-responsive neurons are broadly tuned to social stimuli. While it may not be feasible to add this experimentally at this time, a brief discussion of this limitation in the main text would be valuable.</p>
<p>(3) Figure 2H-J vs. Figure 1: The fiber photometry data suggest increased PVN activity during quiescent huddling vs active huddling, which appears to contrast with the cFos results from Figure 1. It would be helpful for the authors to comment on possible reasons for this discrepancy-e.g., methodological differences, temporal resolution, or cell-type specificity.</p>
<p>(4) Figure 2O: A comparable linear regression for active huddling would be informative to assess whether the observed relationships extend across behavioral states.</p>
<p>(5) Temperature manipulation: The use of floor temperature changes presents a distinct physiological and sensory experience from, for example, manipulation of ambient temperature. A discussion of how this choice may affect neural circuit engagement or interpretation of thermoregulatory responses would be beneficial.</p>
<p>(6) Correlations with behavior: Across the manuscript, it would be informative to see correlations between huddle duration and neural activity (e.g., cFos expression, calcium signal magnitude). Similarly, do longer huddles produce greater thermogenic effects?</p>
<p>(7) Lactating vs. virgin mothers: The inclusion of maternal data is intriguing but feels somewhat disconnected from the central huddling-thermoregulation narrative. If these experiments are to remain, additional explanation of their rationale and how they fit into the broader story would help clarify their relevance.</p>
<p>(8) Optogenetic manipulation: Have the authors tested the effect of PVN OT neuron stimulation or inhibition during huddling? Even a negative result would be of interest to the field. If these data exist (main or supplementary), I apologize for missing them. If not, the authors might consider including them or commenting briefly on any attempts or challenges in carrying out these experiments.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors aimed to elucidate the relationship between physiological state (i.e., behavioral status and thermogenic sympathetic activity) and the activity of hypothalamic paraventricular oxytocin (PVNOT) neurons in female mice. They studied this by combining automated classification of mouse behavior via video-based analysis with calcium imaging of PVNOT neuron activity. Sympathetic thermogenesis was inferred from surface temperature changes captured by infrared thermography, and the authors provided their custom analysis scripts in the manuscript. Notably, they found that a strong, pulsatile activation of PVNOT neurons was &quot;occasionally&quot; observed immediately before the animals transitioned from a resting to an active state. This pulsatile activity was observed in both pair-housed and individually housed animals. While PVNOT neurons are often associated with social behaviors, this finding suggests that the oxytocinergic system is also engaged during naturalistic behaviors, even in the absence of social interactions. If experiments were more convincingly performed and presented, the results would point to a broader physiological role of central oxytocin, including in the regulation of fundamental brain states and homeostatic processes, and offer a new perspective on the functional significance of central oxytocin signaling.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The oxytocinergic neural system is believed to subserve a wide range of physiological functions, and elucidating these roles requires monitoring PVNOT neuronal activity under various behavioral contexts, as well as manipulating this activity to establish causal links. In the present study, the authors show a technically sound experimental framework that integrates behavioral tracking in both individually and group-housed mice with the observation and manipulation of PVNOT neuron activity. This experimental setup represents a valuable methodological resource for researchers investigating the physiological functions of oxytocin.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While this study successfully established a new experimental setup for simultaneous analyses of behavior and PVNOT neuronal activity, there are several concerns regarding the interpretation of the results and the robustness of the conclusions, which should be more thoroughly addressed.</p>
<p>(1) The study relies on the assumption that calcium imaging and optogenetic manipulation were restricted only to PVNOT neurons. However, the specificity of AAV-mediated gene expression was not verified quantitatively. A fair number of cell bodies in the PVN expressed GCaMP8s, but not OT, indicating potential off-target expression (see Figure S2A, B). The lack of quantitative validation weakens confidence in the causal interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>(2) The study focuses on the transition from rest to active states following pulsatile activity of PVNOT neurons. However, the physiological significance of this pulsatile activity remains unclear. According to the authors, pulsatile activity occurred with an approximately 20% probability within 100 seconds prior to the end of the resting state. This implies that, in the remaining 80% of rest-to-active transitions, pulsatile PVNOT activity did not occur, suggesting that it is not essential for initiating the transition. A comparative analysis of behavioral and thermogenic changes between transitions with and without pulsatile PVNOT activity would help to further clarify the functional relevance of this phenomenon and strengthen the authors' interpretation of the findings.</p>
<p>(3) The study identifies a correlation between pulsatile activity of PVNOT neurons and rest-to-active transitions, and tests for a causal relationship using optogenetic stimulation. However, since PVNOT neurons are known to co-release other neurotransmitters such as glutamate, it remains unclear whether the observed effects are mediated specifically through oxytocin receptor signaling. To address this question, functional intervention experiments using oxytocin receptor antagonists or receptor knockout mice are necessary.</p>
<p>(4) The authors attempted to detect BAT thermogenesis and skin vasomotion using infrared thermography. This technique measures only skin hair temperatures (since the skin was not shaved), but does not measure &quot;BAT temperature&quot; or &quot;vasomotor tone&quot;. As seen in Figure 5E, the temperatures of the body surface areas (&quot;BAT&quot;, &quot;Rump&quot;, and &quot;Dorsal surface&quot;) mostly changed in parallel, indicating that these temperatures are strongly affected by body core temperature. Therefore, the thermographic measurements in this study did not provide convincing information on BAT thermogenesis or skin vasomotion. To avoid misleading reports, the authors need to use other techniques to directly measure temperatures, such as telemetry.</p>
<p>(5) Photostimulation of PVNOT neurons increased Tb after 400 sec (6.6 min) (Figure 5). This latency is too long to conclude that the neuronal stimulation elicited BAT thermogenesis. A more reasonable explanation is that the increase in Tb was caused by the induction of physical activity (Figure S4C), which slowly generates heat and contributes to the elevation of Tb. However, this view contradicts the authors' claim. To address this concern, the authors should directly measure BAT thermogenesis and compare it with the rate of Tb elevation. If BAT thermogenesis occurs, the rate at which the BAT temperature increases must exceed the rate at which Tb rises.</p>

<p><bold>(1) Maternal lactation assay and PVN oxytocin neuron identity</bold></p>
<p>Reviewers and editors noted that the maternal lactation assay felt out of place (Editors, R1, R2) and asked for clearer validation of AAV specificity in the PVN (R3). These issues are linked: the primary purpose of the lactation assay was to physiologically validate that the recorded neurons are oxytocinergic, as PVNOT neurons exhibit well-established pulsatile activity during lactation.</p>
<p>In response, we will (i) explicitly frame the lactation assay as a validation experiment, (ii) streamline its presentation to sit naturally with our identity-validation rationale, and (iii) clarify our AAV targeting and expression controls; we will also address our oxytocin immunohistochemistry quantification and its limitations (we observed notable intra-individual and technical variability in oxytocin immunoreactivity), which motivated the complementary physiological approach.</p>
<p><bold>(2) Clarifications and analyses.</bold></p>
<p>The reviewers pointed to several analyses, inferences, and conclusions that should be clarified. We will clarify: (i) the oxytocin histology in Figure 1 (marker definitions and quantification), (ii) the roles of floor versus ambient temperature, and (iii) further elucidate some of the quantitative links among behavioral state, neural activity, and body temperature (e.g., behavior bout duration vs. neural responses and Tb), (iv) the computer vision methodology. These additions will address the reviewers’ requests for clearer inferences and presentation.</p>
<p><bold>(3) Optogenetic inhibition.</bold></p>
<p>We appreciate the suggestion to include an inhibition experiment (Editors, R1, R2). While interesting, this is beyond the scope of the current revision. Our stimulation experiments were designed to functionally test a specific observation from calcium imaging, namely, that PVNOT neurons show bursts of heightened activity at transitions from quiescence to arousal/thermogenesis, and to assess causal sufficiency for thermogenic/arousal-related readouts. We will make this rationale explicit, discuss the scope limits of the current dataset, and note inhibition as an important direction for future work.</p>
