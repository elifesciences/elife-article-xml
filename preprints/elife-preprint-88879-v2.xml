<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common tumour worldwide. A steady increase in the morbidity and mortality of CRC has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Rawla et al., 2019</xref>). When diagnosed in advanced stages, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019</xref>; Sunlin Yong, 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yeung and Yang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). EMT is a reprogramming process in which epithelial E-cadherin and ZO-1 are suppressed, and mesenchymal N-cadherin and vimentin are induced, transcriptionally mediated by Twist and the Snail family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). Overexpression of Twist1 significantly enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of colorectal cancer cells; furthermore, it is closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>The inhibition of EMT in breast cancer and prostate cancer has been associated with calcium-activated chloride channels (CaCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Porretti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Walia et al., 2012</xref>), leading to various evaluations of CaCCs as a potential for cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Miotto and Struhl, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Qu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sui et al., 2014</xref>). The bestrophin (<italic>BEST</italic>) chloride channel, which is a member of a recently identified gene family, encodes several integral membrane proteins expressed on the basolateral membranes of epithelial cells; they regulate CaCCs to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Marmorstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tsunenari et al., 2003</xref>). Although there are four human evolutionarily-related genes (<italic>BEST1–BEST4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Miller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tsunenari <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), <italic>BEST4</italic> is expressed predominantly in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Fagerberg et al., 2014</xref>), where it gates electrolyte transportation in human intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Ito et al., 2013</xref>). However, its role and the mechanism in regulating the development of CRC are currently unknown.</p>
<p>In a recent analysis based on single cell RNA-sequencing analysis, it was discovered that a group of mature colonocytes expresses <italic>BEST4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parikh et al., 2019</xref>), and the subset of this group coexists with hairy/enhancer of split 4 positive (<italic>Hes4</italic><sup>+</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). <italic>Hes4</italic> belongs to a family of seven Hes genes (<italic>Hes1–7</italic>) that encodes a transcription factor with a basic helix-loop-helix motif. It is known to play a critical role in determining the fate and differentiation of progenitor cells during the development of various organs. The previous study has demonstrated the antagonistic role of Hes4 in regulating Twist1 through protein-protein interaction, which governs the differentiation of bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibiting the Twist1 transcriptional factor has been shown to mediate commitment to the differentiation of human bone marrow stem cells, as reported by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>; El <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Yakoubi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Murato and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Nichane et al., 2008</xref>). Given this information, it is tempting to speculate that BEST4 may be associated with Hes4 and Twist1 in regulating EMT during CRC progression.</p>
<p>The objectives of the present study are as follows: (1) to establish the role of BEST4 in CRC growth both in vitro and in vivo; (2) to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which BEST4 interacts with Hes4 and Twist1, thereby inducing EMT; and (3) to investigate the correlation between BEST4 expression and prognosis of CRC.</p>

<title><italic>BEST4</italic> inhibits CRC proliferation, clonogenesis, migration, and invasion <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>To evaluate the effect of BEST4 on tumour growth, we constructed <italic>BEST4-</italic>expressing HCT116 and Caco2 CRC cell lines (<xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1A-1C</xref>) and showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression halved cell proliferating rates of their respective empty vector (EV) controls when they were monitored in live and analysed using InCucyte (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). This was accompanied by decreased cell viability (<xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>). To determine the causal role of BEST4 in CRC tumorigenesis, we knocked out the <italic>BEST4</italic> in HCT-15 using a CRISPR/Cas9 system (<xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1F-H</xref>). Consequently, there was a 50% increase in proliferation rates and viability compared with the parental control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>). Rescued expression of BEST4 was able to reverse the observed effects on HCT-15 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1-figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>In contrast to the controls, BEST4 overexpression decreased colony formations of HCT116 and Caco2 by 60% and 70%, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). While BEST4 deletion increased the number of colonies by five-fold in HCT-15 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>), the rescued expression counteracted its enhancement (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, overexpression of <italic>BEST4</italic> in HCT116 inhibited transwell migration and invasion by 70% and 80%, respectively, compared to EV controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>). But <italic>BEST4</italic> ablation in HCT-15 increased cell migration and invasion by two-fold and three-fold, respectively. These pro-tumor effects on HCT-15 were also reversible when BEST4 expression was rescued (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings suggest the functional inhibitory effects of BEST4 on CRC development <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p>

<title><italic>BEST4</italic> deters EMT in CRC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>Because EMT initiation is a critical process in tumour progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acloque et al., 2009</xref>), we evaluated the effect of <italic>BEST4</italic> on EMT using qPCR and found that <italic>BEST4</italic> expression upregulated <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>ZO-1</italic> and downregulated <italic>vimentin</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic> in HCT116 compared with the control (p &lt; 0.05) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2A</xref>). Conversely, knockout of <italic>BEST4</italic> in HCT15 downregulated <italic>CDH1</italic> and <italic>ZO-1</italic> and upregulated <italic>vimentin</italic> and <italic>Twist1</italic>. Rescued expression of BEST4 in HCT-15 reversed these gene alterations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>). Changes of these genes were consistent with their corresponding protein expression as analysed by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>; <xref rid="figs2f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1A-1C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we subcutaneously implanted <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA-expressing HCT116 and EV control cell lines into BALB/c nude mice and monitored tumour growth weekly. When they reached the maximum allowable volumes (day 32), the animals were culled, and tumours were harvested. Essentially, the sizes and weights of tumours in <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression group were only half of the EV control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2F</xref>), in conjunction with the similar magnitude reduction of Ki67+ cells as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2H</xref>). Further analysis of the HCT116 tumour tissue lysates showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> deterred EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and, downregulating vimentin and Twist1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2I</xref>; <xref rid="figs2f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2-figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>We also evaluated the inhibitory role of BEST4 in a model of CRC to the liver metastasis by intrasplenically injecting HCT-15 cell lines with BEST4 knockout (BEST4gRNA) or the wild-type control (gRNA) or the knockout with the rescue (BEST4-Rescued) into BALB/c nude mice. We observed that there were 2-fold greater of the liver metastatic nodules in the BEST4 deficient tumors than the control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-L</xref>). Conversely, the reconstituted BEST4 expression had no visible metastatic nodules in the liver, and the pathological analysis of the tissue sections by H&amp;E staining also confirmed no detectable metastatic loci in the tissue sections (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-L</xref>).</p>

<title>Hes4 upstream regulation of BEST4</title>
<p>Given the co-expression of <italic>BEST4</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Hes4</italic><sup>+</sup> in a human colonic epithelial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), we sought to investigate their biological interactions during tumour growth. The human CRC cell line, HCT116, was chosen for <italic>Hes4</italic> overexpression due to its relatively lower expression of <italic>Hes4</italic> compared to other CRC cell lines. Similarly, the LS174T cell line derived from human CRC was selected for <italic>Hes4</italic> knockdown because it exhibited comparatively higher expression of <italic>Hes4</italic> in comparison to other CRC cell lines (<xref rid="figs3f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1A</xref>). Upon transfecting the Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> plasmid DNA into HCT116, we observed a responsive upregulation of both endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA and protein levels compared to the control transfectant (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref rid="figs3f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). This intrinsic association was further supported by knocking down the endogenous Hes4 with two pairs of shRNAs in LST174 that resulted in downregulation of endogenous BEST4 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref rid="figs3f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1D</xref> and <xref rid="figs1f1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>).</p>

<p>To explore how Hes4 regulates <italic>BEST4</italic> expression at the transcriptional level, we transfected a <italic>BEST4</italic> promoter-driven luciferase DNA construct into <italic>Hes4</italic>-expressing HCT116 and assessed the promoter activity using a dual-luciferase assay. Our results showed a four-fold increase in the promoter activity compared to the EV control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>), Furthermore, ChIP-qPCR analysis using a Flag antibody to IP for Hes4 revealed a twelve-fold enrichment of the P3 region upstream of the <italic>BEST4</italic> transcriptional start site compared to the control (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>BEST4</italic> overexpression in HCT116 cells did not affect <italic>Hes4</italic> mRNA expression as quantified by qPCR (<xref rid="figs3f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3-figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Hes4</italic> regulates <italic>BEST4</italic> expression upstream. This speculation is supported by immunofluorescence staining, where we observed nuclear co-localization of BEST4 (green) and Hes4 (red) in HCT116 cells co-transfected with <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA and Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> plasmid DNAs, along with additional cytoplasmic expression of <italic>BEST4</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the association of <italic>BEST4</italic> with Hes4 at the translational level, we co-transfected their HA-tagged <italic>BEST4</italic> and Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> plasmid DNAs into HEK293 cells, along with the respective single transfectant control.

<title><italic>BEST4</italic> relays <italic>Hes4</italic> signal and downregulates Twist1 leading to EMT inhibition independent of the channel function in CRC</title>
<p>Because a step of <italic>Hes4</italic> in committing to human bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage-specific development is mediated by Twist1 downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>), with evidence of direct interaction between BEST4 and Hes4 observed in HCT116, it is plausible that they could exploit Twist1 to regulate EMT. To test this notion, we transfected a Twist1 promoter-driven luciferase DNA construct into HCT116. In comparison with the EV control, Flag-<italic>Hes4</italic> or <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA transfectants significantly decreased Twist1 promoter activity by almost half, as evaluated by the dual-luciferase assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

<p>The association of BEST4 with the Twist1 promoter activity was also evidenced by their nuclear colocalization after transfecting BEST4-HA and Myc-Twist1 plasmid DNAs into HCT116 (<xref rid="figs4f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Co-IP with antibodies to Myc or HA showed that they were copurified from the nuclear protein lysates, but not with the IgG controls from the transfectant cell lysates (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> in Hes4-expressing HCT116 cells substantially decreased Flag-Hes4 coprecipitation from the nuclear protein lysates, while Myc-Twist1 expression remained constant, as determined by co-IP with antibodies to Flag or My (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We then investigated the impact of Hes4 expression on EMT induction by overexpressing Hes4 in HCT116 cells. Our results showed there were upregulation of ZO-1 and E-cadherin epithelial molecules, and downregulation of Twist1 protein (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2A</xref>) and the <italic>vimentin</italic> mRNA (<xref rid="figs4f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1D</xref>). The vimentin protein appeared to be undetectable in HCT116, which was consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Roger et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, knocking down endogenous <italic>Hes4</italic> in LS174T cells using shRNAs targeting two <italic>Hes4</italic> domains caused the opposite effect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine if BEST4 is downstream signal that relays Hes4 to regulate Twist1 expression and consequently EMT induction, we knocked down endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> with siRNAs in Hes4-expressing HCT116 and showed the corresponding downregulation of E-cadherin and ZO-1, with upregulation of Twist1 protein and the <italic>vimentin</italic> mRNA, as analyzed by immunoblotting and qPCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2C</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 1ED</xref>). The opposite was true when BEST4 was overexpressed in LS174T (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I</xref>; <xref rid="figs4f2" ref-type="fig">Figure 4-figure supplement 2D</xref>). <italic>Hes4</italic>Hence, inhibition of EMT induction by Hes4 is BEST4-mediated by downregulation of Twist1 expression in CRC</p>
<p>Given the physiological role of <italic>BEST4</italic> plays in regulating chloride/calcium flux, we evaluated the channel functional effect on EMT induction. After respectively incubating <italic>BEST4</italic>-expresing HCT116 and the EV control with 300μM DIDS (a broad blocker of chloride channel), or a gradient increase in doses of CaCCinh-A01 (a specific inhibitor of native calcium-activated chloride channels), or 1μM ionomycin (a calcium ionophore to activate the chloride channel) as published previously (Liu <italic>et al</italic>, 2015; Uwada <italic>et al,</italic> 2019), we showed that <italic>BEST4</italic> significantly increased chloride/calcium fluxes and activated their exchanges and the expected inhibition by DIDS, CaCCinh-A01 or ionomycin (<xref rid="figs5f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1A-1C</xref>). Through immunoblotting analysis, we recapitulated that <italic>BEST4</italic> simultaneously upregulated both ZO-1 and E-cadherin, and downregulated Twist1. Essentially, the levels of these proteins remained constantly expressed when the cells were treated with DIDS or CaCCinh-A01 or ionomycin, respectively (<xref rid="figs5f1" ref-type="fig">Figure 5-figure supplement 1D-1F</xref>). Hence, these results suggest <italic>BEST4</italic> protein-mediated EMT suppression is independent of its channel function in HCT116.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In cancer cell cultures and mouse tumour xenografts, the present study shows that <italic>BEST4</italic> inhibits the development of CRC. An axis comprising <italic>Hes4/BEST4/</italic>Twist1 governs the induction of EMT in CRC. <italic>BEST4</italic> interacts with <italic>Hes4</italic> at the transcriptional and translational levels, and downregulates Twist1 expression, resulting in EMT inhibition but independent of its channel functions. Our findings support the notion in several ways: (1) <italic>Hes4</italic> binds to the promoter region of <italic>BEST4</italic>; (2) <italic>BEST4</italic> colocalizes with <italic>Hes4</italic> and Twist1 in the nucleus of cells, and protein-protein interactions; (3) the <italic>BEST4</italic> inhibitory role in EMT exhibits upregulation of epithelial ZO-1 and E-cadherin, and downregulation of mesenchymal vimentin and Twist1 in CRC; and finally (4) low <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA levels were significantly correlated with malignant lesions and worse outcomes of CRC patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> in suppressing CRC progression and the underlying molecular mechanisms.</p>
<p>CaCCs are expressed widely in several types of epithelial and endothelial cells and are classified as calcium-dependent chloride channels (e.g., anoctamin-1 [ANO1 or TMEM16]), chloride channel accessory proteins (CLCAs), and members of the BEST family. The latter is a recent addition to the class of molecularly defined chloride channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Huang et al., 2012</xref>). Calcium-dependent chloride channels and CLCAs are differentially expressed in CRC and normal colon tissues, exerting pro- or anti-growth effects, while little is known of BEST family in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Sanders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Sui <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). There are four subtypes of the <italic>BEST</italic> family in mammals that assemble as pentamers to form Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels and maintain cellular physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Marmorstein <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Milenkovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Tsunenari <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). Subtypes of <italic>BEST1-3</italic> are responsible for vitelliform macular dystrophy, regulating the cilia of olfactory sensory neuronal activity; others regulate cGMP-dependent calcium-activated chloride conductance in vascular smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Matchkov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Pifferi et al., 2009</xref>). An intrinsic function of the <italic>BEST4</italic> gene in modulating CRC growth remains poorly illustrated. In the present study, we demonstrated that <italic>BEST4</italic> functionally inhibits the development of CRC <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>BEST4</italic> is transcriptionally regulated and physically interacts with upstream <italic>Hes4</italic>, leading to downregulation of Twist1 and EMT suppression. This suppression is independent of physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channels since inhibition of BEST4-associated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-and Cl<sup>-</sup> fluxes did not alter ZO-1/E-Cadherin and Twist1 protein expression.</p>
<p>The recent identification of a heterogeneous <italic>BEST4</italic><sup>+</sup> and <italic>Hes4</italic><sup>+</sup> subgroup in a human colonic epithelial lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Parikh <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>) led us to consider their potential role in regulating CRC progression. Among the Hes family, which is associated with intestinal progenitor cells in adenoma transformation, <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes4</italic> are a paralog pair, with other members more distantly related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Katoh and Katoh, 2004</xref>). While <italic>Hes1</italic> has been reported to induce EMT and promote metastasis and chemoresistance in CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Sun et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">van Es et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Hes4</italic> is identified by our present study capable of combating EMT induction in a <italic>BEST4</italic>-dependent manner that is regulated at both transcriptional and translational levels.</p>
<p>The process of EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, with expression switching epithelial E-cadherin and Zo-1 to mesenchymal vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). When diagnosed in advanced stages, EMT may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019</xref>; Sunlin Yong, 2021; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Yeung and Yang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).The whole process is regulated by transcriptional factors of the Snail family and Twist1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). Twist1 (a <bold>basic helix-loop-helix</bold> transcription factor) reprograms EMT by repressing the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 2004</xref>) and simultaneously inducing several mesenchymal markers, typically vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bulzico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nagai <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Vesuna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yusup et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). The Twist1 transcriptional factor plays a crucial role in inducing EMT, which contributes to the malignant lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Its physical interaction with <italic>Hes4</italic> determines human bone marrow stromal/stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Cakouros <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Twist1, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, represses the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 and induces several mesenchymal markers including vimentin, which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nagai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Bulzico et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Meng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Nagai <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Vesuna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Yang <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yusup <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Overexpression of Twist1 significantly enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of colorectal cancer cells; furthermore, it is closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Yusup <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). Despite Twist1 importance in CRC, little is known about how it is controlled during EMT induction. Our present study reveals that Twist1 colocalized and interacted with <italic>BEST4</italic> in the nucleus of CRC HCT116 cells, leading to downregulation of Twist1 and inhibition of EMT. <italic>Hes4</italic> also caused the same effect, but through intermediation with <italic>BEST4</italic>. Although the mechanistic insights of their interplay remain to be elucidated, the present study identifies the <italic>Hes4-BEST4</italic>-<italic>Twist1</italic> axis that contributes to counter EMT in the development of CRC (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>Lastly, our analysis of correlations reveals the clinical significance of <italic>BEST4</italic> expression in CRC. In particular, the mRNA levels of <italic>BEST4</italic> were lower in tissues of both precancerous adenomatous lesions and CRC than ANTs. These alterations are significantly correlated with large tumour size, positive nodes, and poor overall survival, especially in male patients. Interestingly, a previous study conducted on a Chinese cohort reported an approximately 40% higher incidence of CRC in males than in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). But it remains to be investigated whether sex hormone-related factors plays a role in the gender-specific downregulation of <italic>BEST4</italic> and its impact on CRC in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Yu et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the functional significance of <italic>BEST4</italic> in CRC development and its interplay with other molecules is completely unknown. The present study demonstrates the role of <italic>BEST4</italic> in inhibiting CRC proliferation, migration, and invasion both in models of in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, <italic>BEST4</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Hes4</italic> for downregulating Twist1 and inhibits EMT in CRC. Therefore, we reveals a previously unknown mechanism of the <italic>Hes4-BEST4-Twist</italic> axis that restrains the progression of CRC.</p>

<title>Tumour and CRC hepatic metastasis mouse xenografts</title>
<p>Four-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were housed under standard conditions. The mice were randomized into two groups, with eight mice per group. HCT116 cells (5×10<sup>6</sup> cells in 0.1 mL phosphate-buffered saline) transduced with the lentivirus containing <italic>BEST4</italic> or EV were injected subcutaneously into the right dorsal flank of mice. Tumour growth was measured twice a week using callipers, and tumour volumes were calculated as length x width<sup>2</sup> x 0.5. Mice were sacrificed at 32 days, and tumour weight was measured at the end of the experiment. For further analysis, the excised tumour tissues were divided into two parts and embedded in paraffin or preserved at −80 °C for further analysis.</p>

<title>CRC cell lines with overexpression of <italic>BEST4</italic></title>
<p>Forced overexpression of <italic>BEST4</italic> was examined in HCT116 and Caco2 CRC cells in which the C-terminal HA epitope-tagged human <italic>BEST4</italic> gene with GFP (<italic>BEST4</italic>-HA-GFP) or GFP alone was introduced by lentivirus-mediated gene transfer. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed to obtain single cells distributed into 96-well plates. Three independent lines with the highest levels of BEST4 expression were used for subsequent experiments (Figures S1A and S1B). <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA and HA-tagged protein levels were significantly higher in HCT116 and Caco2 cells transfected with <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA plasmids than those transfected with the empty vector (EV) alone (Figure S1C). The <italic>BEST4</italic>-overexpressing cell lines were named “HCT116 <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA” and “Caco2 <italic>BEST4</italic>-HA.” Cells transfected with the EV alone were referred to as “HCT116 EV” and “Caco2 EV.”</p>

<title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of <italic>BEST4</italic></title>
<p><italic>BEST4</italic>-depleted HCT-15 cells were generated with CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology using a dual sgRNA approach. Two sequences that targeted exon 3 within the <italic>BEST4</italic> active fragment (5’-TGACTCTCGTGGTGAACCGC-3’ and 5’-CCGAGATGACGCACATCAGC -3’) were inserted into the pU6-gRNA-Cas9-EGFP vector (GenePharma, Shanghai, China) to generate a CRISPR/Cas9 <italic>BEST4</italic> knockout plasmid. Excision of the targeted 44 bp genomic fragment resulted in splicing errors in exons 2 to 4 and generated a premature STOP codon that abrogated functional gene expression (Figures S1F and S1G). Cells were transfected with these plasmids, and GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were FACS-sorted as single cells into 96-well plates. After culturing for three weeks, cells were distributed into two 24-well plates, and the appropriate deletion was verified by sequencing. Only cell lines with homozygous deletions were used. Three independent lines generated using this method were used for subsequent experiments and were named “HCT15 <italic>BEST4</italic>-gRNA.” Diminished expression of immunoreactive BEST4 protein was confirmed by immunoblotting (Figure S1H).

<p>Expression plasmids encoding <italic>BEST4</italic> (GeneID: 266675, NM_153274; vector: pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-Puro) containing a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag, <italic>HES4</italic> (GeneID: 57801, NM_001142467.2; vector: pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-Puro) containing a N-terminal Flag epitope tag,were synthesized by Public Protein/Plasmid Library (Nanjing, China). According to the manufacturer’s instructions, Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used in cell transfection experiments.</p>
<p>To generate a model of CRC with forced overexpression of <italic>Hes4</italic>, cells were transfected with lentiviral pCDH-CMV-MCS-EF1-CopGFP-T2A-Puro vectors containing human Hes4 cDNA and selected with puromycin (Invivogen, San Diego, CA, USA) at 10 µg/mL introduced 48 h after transfection.</p>
<p>For short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and RNA silencing (siRNA) experiments, HEK293 cells were co-transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying shRNA targeting <italic>HES4</italic> (Public Protein/Plasmid Library, Nanjing, China; target sequences are listed in Table S1). Supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 h for analysis. Scrambled shRNAs were used to control for non-specific effects. Transduction was performed by mixing aliquots of lentivirus with a standard medium containing 10 μg/mL puromycin (Invivogen) to remove untransduced cells. GeneSolution siRNAs targeting <italic>BEST4</italic> (<italic>BEST4</italic>-siRNA) were used to silence gene expression. Scrambled siRNA (SCR) was used as a control (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The target sequences of the <italic>BEST4</italic> siRNAs are listed in Table S1. For siRNA experiments, cells were seeded one day before transfection in an antibiotic-free medium and grown to 60% confluency in six-well plates.

<title>RNA isolation, cDNA library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis</title>
<p>Total RNA was isolated using a High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). RNA samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) ≥7.0 and a 28S:18S ratio ≥ 1.5 were used in subsequent experiments. Sequencing libraries were generated and sequenced by CapitalBio Technology (Beijing, China). A total amount of 3 μg RNA per sample was used. Briefly, the Ribo-Zero™ Magnetic Kit (Epicentre) was used to remove rRNA from the total RNA, and then the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) was used to construct the libraries for sequencing following the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA was fragmented into pieces of ∼200 base pairs in length in NEBNext First-Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer (5X). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized from the RNA fragments using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers, and then the second-strand cDNA was synthesized in Second-Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer with dUTP Mix (10x). The end of the cDNA fragment was subjected to an end-repair process that included the addition of a single “A” base followed by ligation of the adapters. Products were purified and enriched using PCR to amplify the library DNA. The final libraries were qualified using Agilent 2100 and quantified using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, South Africa). Finally, the libraries were subjected to paired-end sequencing with a paired-end 150-base pair reading length on an Illumina NovaSeq sequencer (Illumina).</p>
<p>The sequencing quality of raw data in <italic>fastq</italic> format was assessed using FastQC, and then low-quality data were filtered using the Next Generation Sequencing Quality Control platform. The high-quality clean reads were then aligned to the reference genome using Tophat2 with default parameters. The genome of the human genome version of hg38 (UCSC) was used as the reference. Cufflinks and Cuffmerge software packages were used to assemble the transcripts. All subsequent comparative analyses of lncRNAs and mRNAs were based on the results of the transcripts. Transcripts corresponding to mRNAs or lncRNAs were collected from databases and treated as known lncRNAs and annotated based on information from public databases. The transcripts were treated as novel lncRNAs when their sequence length was &gt;200 and when they were predicted to be non-coding RNAs. Differential expression analyses were performed using the limma package and edgeR. Functional annotation and enrichment analyses were performed using KOBAS 3.0. The target genes of the mRNAs were predicted based on cis- and trans-patterns based on the location on the reference genome and sequence similarity.

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this study, the authors describe the participation of the Hes4-BEST4-Twist axis in controlling the process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the advancement of colorectal cancers (CRC). They assert that this axis diminishes the EMT capabilities of CRC cells through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Additionally, they propose that reduced BEST4 expression within tumor cells might serve as an indicator of an adverse prognosis for individuals with CRC.</p>
<p>The revised manuscript and figures still need further improvement because some of the authors' claims are difficult to understand from a scientific perspective.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Exploring the correlation between the Hes4-BEST4-Twist1 axis, EMT, and the advancement of CRC is a novel perspective and gives readers a fresh standpoint.</p>
<p>
• The potential role of BEST4 in EMT through the Hes4-BEST4-Twist1 axis, rather than through its channel function, is also a novel perspective.</p>
<p>
• The whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) showing low expression of BEST4 in CRC samples will be of broad interest to cancer specialists as well as cell biologists although further corroborative data is essential to strengthen these findings (See Weaknesses).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• The authors employed three kinds of CRC cell lines, but not untransformed cells such as intestinal epithelial organoids which are commonly used in recent research. Since all the data from in vitro and in vivo experiments are generated from CRC cell lines with forced expression of proteins of interest, the authors' claim may not reflect a common biological process.</p>
<p>
• Most of experiments were performed to show changes in EMT markers, but not EMT itself.</p>
<p>
• The in vivo and in vitro data supporting the whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) is mostly insufficient. Since BEST4 is a marker of a subset of terminally differentiated colonocytes, its lower expression in CRC compared to adjacent normal tissue could be within the range of common expectations.</p>
<p>
• Some experiments do not appear to have a direct relevance to their claims.</p>
<p>Major comments:</p>
<p>• The authors employed three kinds of CRC cell lines, but not untransformed cells such as intestinal epithelial organoids which are commonly used in recent research. Please include this limitation of the study in the discussion section with other possible limitations.</p>
<p>
• Some experiments do not appear to have direct relevance to their claims. Figure 1A-1F and 2E-2H relate to cell proliferation or viability of CRC cell lines, but not to EMT. The focus of this study should be on EMT, but the summary sentence for Figure 1 (Line 118-119) says &quot;inhibitory effects of BEST4 on CRC development&quot;. This sentence, along with some others (such as Line 262-263), seems to be deviating. Cancer development and EMT are distinct biological processes, so please revise the manuscript with this in mind.</p>
<p>
• The context around Line 194-197, &quot;Additionally, the knockdown of endogenous BEST4 in Hes4-expressing HCT116 cells substantially decreased Flag-Hes4 coprecipitation from the nuclear protein lysates, while Myc-Twist1 expression remained constant, as determined by co-IP with antibodies to Flag or My (Figure 4E; Figure 4-figure supplement 1C).&quot; is difficult to follow.</p>
<p>
• The in vivo and in vitro data supporting the whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) are mostly insufficient. Since BEST4 is a marker of a subset of terminally differentiated colonocytes, its lower expression in CRC compared to adjacent normal tissue could be within the range of common expectations.</p>
<p>
• As the reviewer #2 mentioned, the quality of some figures is quite suboptimal. It is not due to their pixel size, but rather due to other factors, such as the inconsistencies of aspect ratios. Improvement of the overall quality is needed. Figure legends also need improvements.</p>
<p>
• The formatting of genes and proteins is inconsistent. Please correct it according to the general formatting guidelines.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, the authors first demonstrate that BEST4 inhibits intestinal tumor cell growth and reduces their metastatic potential, possibly via downstream regulation of TWIST1.</p>
<p>They further show that HES4 positively upregulates BEST4 expression, with direct interaction with BEST4 promoter region and protein. The authors further expand on this with results showing that negative regulation of TWIST1 by HES4 requires BEST4 protein, with BEST4 required for TWIST1 association with HES4. Reduction of BEST1 expression was shown in CRC tumor samples, with correlation of BEST4 mRNA levels with different clinicopathological factors such as sex, tumor stage and lymph node metastasis, suggesting a tumor-suppressive role of BEST4 for intestinal cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>• Good quality western blot data</p>
<p>
• Multiple approaches were used to validate the findings</p>
<p>
• Logical experimental progression for readability</p>
<p>
• Human patient data / In vivo murine model / Multiple cell lines were used, which supports translatability/reproducibility of findings</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>• Figure quality should still be improved</p>
<p>
• The discussion should still be improved</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The authors employed three kinds of CRC cell lines, but not untransformed cells such as intestinal epithelial organoids which are commonly used in recent research.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue. While we acknowledge the potential of intestinal epithelial organoids as a valuable model for this study and will consider establishing this system in future research, which falls outside the scope of our current work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors use three different human CRC cell lines with a lack of consistency in the selection of them. Please clarify 1) how these lines are different from each other, 2) why they pick up one or two of them for each experiment. To be more convincing, at least two lines should be employed for each in vitro experiment.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for any confusion caused to the reviewer. In our study, we employed HCT116 and Caco2 cell lines to investigate the overexpression of BEST4 in the biological functions of CRC and its involvement in EMT. The selection of HCT116, a human CRC cell line, was based on its relatively lower expression level of BEST4 compared to other CRC cell lines. Conversely, Caco2 is a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line that closely resembles differentiated intestinal epithelial cells and exhibits microvilli structures. Given that BEST4 serves as a marker for intestinal epithelial cells, these two cell lines were chosen for investigating the in vitro effects of overexpressing BEST4 on proliferation, clonality, invasion, migration of colon cancer tumor cells and expression of downstream EMT-related markers. Similarly, we selected the HCT-15 cell line derived from human CRC for BEST4 knockout due to its comparatively higher expression level of BEST4 among other CRC cell lines. We employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology to knockout BEST4 instead of utilizing shRNA for downregulating BEST4 expression, thereby limiting our selection to a single cell line.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors demonstrated associations between BEST4 and cell proliferation/ viability as well as migration/invasion, utilizing CRC cell lines, but it should be noted that these findings do not indicate a tumor-suppressive role of BEST4 as mentioned in line 120. Furthermore, while the authors propose that &quot;BEST4 functions as a tumor suppressor in CRC&quot; in line 50, there seems no supporting data to suggest BEST4 as a tumor suppressor gene.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for these inaccurate expressions, and we have made the necessary modifications to the corresponding parts in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The HES4-BEST4-Twist1 axis likely plays a significant role in CRC progression via EMT but not CRC initiation. Some sentences could lead to a misunderstanding that the axis is important for CRC initiation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for these inaccurate expressions, and we have made the necessary modifications to the corresponding parts in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The authors mostly focus on the relationship of the HES4-BEST4-Twist1 axis with EMT, but their claims sometimes appear to deviate from this focus.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for confusing the reviewer. The objectives of our study are as follows: (1) to establish the role of BEST4 in CRC growth both in vitro and in vivo; (2) to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which BEST4 interacts with Hes4 and Twist1, thereby regulating EMT; and (3) to investigate the correlation between BEST4 expression and prognosis of CRC. We have made the necessary modifications to the corresponding parts in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Some experiments do not appear to have a direct relevance to their claims. For example, the analysis using the xenograft model in Figure 2E-J is not optimal for analyzing EMT. The authors should analyze metastatic or invasive properties of the transplanted tumors if they intend to provide some supporting evidence for their claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue. The process of EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, with expression switching epithelial E-cadherin and Zo-1 to mesenchymal vimentin (Dongre and Weinberg, 2019)..The whole process is regulated by transcriptional factors of the Snail family and Twist1(Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). We utilized the xenograft model with overexpressed BEST4 to analyze the lysates of tumor tissue, revealing that BEST4 upregulated E-cadherin and downregulated vimentin and Twist1 (Figures 2I). These findings indicate that BEST4 inhibits EMT in vivo. Deletion of BEST4 may enable these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, leading to metastasis in vivo. Therefore, we subsequently evaluated the metastatic potential of BEST4 in a CRC liver metastasis model by intrasplenically injecting HCT-15 cell lines with knockout of BEST4 (BEST4gRNA), wild-type control (gRNA), or knockout with rescue (BEST4-Rescued) into BALB/c nude mice. Our observations revealed a twofold increase in liver metastatic nodules in the absence of BEST4 compared to the control group (Fig. 2J-L). Although further in vivo experiments are required for confirmation, our research suggests a potential role for BEST4 in counteracting EMT induction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) In Figure 4H, ZO-1 and E-cad expression looks unchanged in the BEST4 KD.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue. We have implemented the necessary modifications to the corresponding sections in the manuscript and performed a comprehensive quantification of all Western Blot data to ensure statistically significant differences, including those presented in the supplementary file.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(8) The in vivo and in vitro data supporting the whole transcriptome sequence analysis (Figure 5) is mostly insufficient. Including the following experiments will substantiate their claims: 1) BEST4 and HES4 immunostaining of human surgical tissue samples, 2) qPCR data of HES4, Twist1, Vimentin, etc. as shown in Figure 5C, 5D.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Sincerely thanks for catching this issue.</p>
<p>(1) Due to the substandard quality of the BEST4 antibody, we opted to evaluate the clinical significance of BEST4 in CRC by assessing mRNA results instead of protein levels using immunohistochemistry (IHC). After testing multiple antibodies for western blotting, only one (1:800; LsBio, LS-C31133) accurately indicated BEST4 protein expression while still exhibiting some non-specific bands. Consequently, we decided to transfect a HA-tagged BEST4 plasmid into the CRC cell line and used HA as a marker for BEST4 expression. Unfortunately, none of the antibodies employed for IHC were suitable as they failed to accurately distinguish between positive or negative staining for BEST4 and showed significant non-specific staining (data not shown). The challenge in detecting BEST4 protein in colorectal cancer tissues may be attributed to its low expression levels. Our findings are consistent with previous reports from the Human Protein Atlas database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology</ext-link>), which also did not detect any BEST4 protein expression in colorectal cancer tissues through IHC analysis.</p>
<p>(2) The qPCR data of E-cadherin, Twist1, and Vimentin mRNA expression in CRC tissue has already been published in other studies(Christou et al., 2017; Lazarova and Bordonaro, 2016; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). It was found that E-cadherin is downregulated, while Twist1 and Vimentin are upregulated in CRC tissue compared to the adjacent normal tissues.

It was found that E-cadherin is downregulated, while Twist1 and Vimentin are upregulated in CRC tissue compared to the adjacent normal tissues. The analysis of mRNA expression data obtained from colorectal cancer samples and normal samples in the publicly available databases TCGA and GTEx also revealed a significant downregulation of _Hes_4 expression in colorectal cancer tissues, which will be our next research objective.</p>

<p>According to the previous study that published in Nature (Parikh et al., 2019), BEST4+ cells originate from the absorptive lineage and express the transcription factors Hes4. Additionally, we also observed the nuclear co-localization of BEST4 and Hes4 in HCT116 cells through immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3E)</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in our previous statement. In a recent analysis utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing, it was discovered that a subset of mature colonocytes expresses BEST4 (Parikh et al., 2019). Additionally, this subset coexists with hairy/enhancer of split 4 positive (Hes4+) cells (Parikh et al., 2019). Previous research has demonstrated the antagonistic role of Hes4 in regulating Twist1 through protein-protein interaction, which governs the differentiation of bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage (Cakouros et al., 2015). Based on these findings, we speculate that there may be an interactive regulation between BEST4/Hes4/Twist1, potentially influencing the process of cell polarity during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer.

<p>(7) Figure 3 shows 1) HES4 regulates BEST4 promotor activity, and 2) HES4 and BEST4 colocalized in nuclei, but these are very different biological processes. Please clarify how these two relate to each other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Trajectory analysis identifies the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors Hairy/enhancer of split 4 (Hes4)-expressing colonocytes (Hes4+) in BEST4-expressing colonic epithelial lineage (BEST4+). Although they are very different biological processes, the recent identification of a heterogeneous <italic>BEST4</italic>+ and <italic>Hes4</italic>+ subgroup in a human colonic epithelial lineage (Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019) led us to consider their potential role in regulating CRC progression. We firstly observed a responsive upregulation of both endogenous <italic>BEST4</italic> mRNA and protein levels in Hes4 overexpression cells compared to the control transfectant, indicating that Hes4 is a potential upstream activator regulating BEST4 functional. We then confirmed that Hes4 interacted with BEST4, binding directly to its upstream promoter at the region of 1470-1569 bp enhancing its promoter activity as analysed by Co-IP, dual-luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR, respectively. Essentially, they were co-localized in the nucleus, as shown in immunofluorescence staining after the transient co-transfection of Hes4 and BEST4 into HCT116, therefore indicating that <italic>BEST4</italic> interacts with <italic>Hes4</italic> at both transcriptional and translational levels (Figure 3; Figure 3-supplemental figure 1)</p>

<p>Because a step of <italic>Hes4</italic> in committing to human bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage-specific development is mediated by Twist1 downregulation (Cakouros et al., 2015), with evidence of direct interaction between BEST4 and Hes4 observed in HCT116, it is plausible that they could exploit Twist1 to regulate EMT.

<p>(2) While the authors show that the HES4/BEST4 complex interacts with the TWIST1 protein, they do not expand on the mechanisms underpinning the post-translational or transcriptional regulation of TWIST1. We would like the authors to prove or further speculate on the mechanisms behind this regulation in the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our present study showed that BEST4 inhibited EMT in conjunction with downregulation of Twist1 in both HCT116 and Caco2 CRC cell lines. A previous study has shown an antagonist role of Hes4 in regulating Twist1 via protein-protein interaction that controls the bone marrow stromal/stem cell lineage differentiation (Cakouros <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). We speculate a possible interactive regulation between Hes4/BEST4/Twist1 by which they deter the process of cell polarity during EMT in CRC. In the present study, we found that <italic>BEST4</italic> mediates the inhibition of the Twist1 both in transcription and translation level by <italic>Hes4.</italic> Twist1 colocalized with BEST4 in the nucleus, and their interaction destabilized Twist1 and significantly inhibited EMT induction. <italic>Hes4</italic> caused the same effect; however, it required intermediation through <italic>BEST4</italic>. The present study identified the axis of Hes4-BEST4-Twist1 governing the development of CRC, at least partially by counteracting EMT induction.

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors need to show or argue that why TWIST1 is necessary for the phenotypes observed, e.g. metastasis/proliferation.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in articulating this question. The process of EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities, with expression switching epithelial E-cadherin and Zo-1 to mesenchymal vimentin (Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). When diagnosed in advanced stages, EMT may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019; Sunlin Yong, 2021; Yeung and Yang, 2017; Zhang et al., 2021).The whole process is regulated by transcriptional factors of the Snail family and Twist1(Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). Twist1 (a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor) reprograms EMT by repressing the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1 (Nagai et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2004) and simultaneously inducing several mesenchymal markers, typically vimentin (Bulzico et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2018; Nagai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016; Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004), which is a pivotal predictor of CRC progression (Vesuna et al., 2008; Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004; Yusup et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2015).Overexpression of Twist1 significantly enhances the migration and invasion capabilities of colorectal cancer cells; furthermore, it is closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer(Yusup <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017; Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015). We have supplemented and improved these parts of the introduction and discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) The authors sufficiently prove that HES4/BEST4 regulates TWIST1 downregulation, however, we believe the findings are not enough to show *direct* regulation (refer also to line 273). At least rephrasing the conclusions would be adequate, also while referring to the working model depicted in Fig. 5G.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for this inaccurate presentation. Although the interaction may not be direct, our co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) results demonstrated nuclear colocalization of Twist1 and BEST4 (Figure 4D; Figure 4-supplemental figure 1A). Furthermore, their interaction destabilized Twist1 and significantly inhibited the induction of EMT. We have made corrections to this section in the manuscript.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) The discussion is very short and not satisfactory; is BEST4 an evolutionary conserved protein (besides the channel region)? Any speculation on which domain(s) is(are) important for the interaction with HES4 and TWIST1? How do the findings in the current study compare with recent, potentially contradicting data indicating a pro-tumorigenic function of BEST4 for CRC, including its upregulation (and not downregulation) in malignant intestinal tissues, and activation of PI3K/AKT signaling (PMID: 35058597)?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We apologize for our shallow discussion. We have supplemented and improved some parts of the discussion. The bestrophins are a highly conserved family of integral membrane proteins initially discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans(Sonnhammer and Durbin, 1997). Homologous sequences can be found across animals, fungi, and prokaryotes, while they are absent in protozoans or plants(Hagen et al., 2005). Conservation is primarily observed within the N-terminal 350–400 amino acids, featuring an invariant motif arginine-phenylalanine-proline (RFP) with unknown functional properties (Milenkovic et al., 2008). Mutations in this region can lead to the development of vitelliform macular dystrophy. However, the C-terminus is a potential site for protein modification and function(Marmorstein et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2019). There is currently no further literature research on the functional roles of different domains of BEST4. Although the crucial domain for the interaction with HES4 and TWIST1 is yet to be determined, requiring further investigation for clarification, our findings demonstrate that Hes4 directly binds to the upstream promoter region of BEST4 at 1470-1569 bp, thereby enhancing its promoter activity. These results provide valuable insights for future research.</p>
<p>Sincere thanks for catching this publication to us. We carefully read this study and would like to point out a few things.</p>
<p>a) Firstly, the study demonstrated that BEST4 expression is upregulated in clinical CRC samples, which contradicts the results of other published studies except for our own research. RNA-seq of tissue samples from 95 human individuals representing 27 different tissues was performed to determine the tissue specificity of all protein-coding genes, and the results indicated that the BEST4 gene is predominantly expressed in the colon (Fagerberg et al., 2014). In addition, BEST4 was reported to be exclusively expressed by human absorptive cells and could be induced during the process of human absorptive cell differentiation(Ito et al., 2013). Recently, the research from Simmons’s group that published in Nature further proved that human absorptive colonocytes distinctly express BEST4 by single-cell profiling of healthy human colonic epithelial cells, and is dysregulated in colorectal cancer patients(Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). Furthermore, the analysis of RNA-seq expression data obtained from colorectal cancer samples and normal samples in the publicly available databases TCGA and GTEx also revealed a significant downregulation of BEST4 expression in colorectal cancer tissues, which is consistent with our research findings. The literature above demonstrates a close relationship between BEST4 and the normal function of the human colon, and provide evidence for their loss in colorectal cancer patients.</p>
<p>b) Their study showed an increased expression of BEST4 protein levels in colorectal cancer patients through Western Blot. However, the antibody they used was only suitable for IHC-P and not for Western Blot (Abcam , ab188823); . In our study, we also utilized WB technology to detect the expression of BEST4 in colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. The results revealed a decreased expression of BEST4 protein levels in colorectal cancer patients. The antibody we used was specifically designed for WB detection (1:800; LsBio, LS-C31133 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.lsbio.com/antibodies/best4-antibody-n-terminus-wb-western-ls-c31133/29602">https://www.lsbio.com/antibodies/best4-antibody-n-terminus-wb-western-ls-c31133/29602</ext-link>).</p>
<p>c) The study demonstrated an upregulation of BEST4 protein levels in colorectal cancer patients using immunohistochemistry (IHC). However, the expression of BEST4 was assessed in colorectal cancer tissues through IHC utilizing publicly available protein expression databases such as the Human Protein Atlas. Interestingly, this analysis revealed a minimal presence of BEST4 protein in colorectal cancer tissues (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology">https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000142959-BEST4/pathology</ext-link>), contradicting their research findings but aligning with our own observations.</p>
<p>d) Literature based on single-cell genomics analysis reports that only OTOP2 and BEST4 genes are expressed in a subset of the normal colorectal epithelial cells but not the rest(Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). An inhibitory effect of OTOP2 on CRC has been recently shown BEST4, and the Otopetrin 2 (OTOP2), which encodes proton‐selective ion channel protein were reported to distinct expressed in normal absorptive colonocytes and colocalized with each other (Drummond et al., 2017; Ito <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; Parikh <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). OTOP2 has been recently demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect on the development of CRC via being regulated by wide-type p53(Qu et al., 2019), while the role of BEST4 in CRC is less well studied, that indicate the potential of BEST4 to inhibit colorectal cancer. The Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) conducted by them revealed a significant enrichment of gene signatures associated with oncogenic signaling and metastasis, such as the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, in patients exhibiting higher BEST4 expression compared to those with lower BEST4 expression. However, our GSEA did not show any significant enrichment of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in patients with higher BEST4 expression compared to those with lower BEST4 expression. In contrast to their findings, our BEST4 overexpression cell line did not exhibit a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt levels. The present study concludes that our findings align with previous literature and public database analyses, providing evidence for the downregulation of BEST4 in colorectal cancer tissues and its potential as an anticancer agent. Discrepancies observed in other studies may be attributed to difference in experimental model, protocols, preparations or experimental conditions.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment demonstrated that the ablation of BEST4 in HCT-15 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation, clonogenesis, migration and invasion (Figures 1 and Figure 1-supplemental figure 1). These findings suggest that BEST4 knockout may potentially contribute to tumor proliferation in vivo; however, further research is required for confirmation. EMT transforms epithelial cells exhibiting a spindle fibroblast-like morphology, leading to the acquisition of mesenchymal characteristics and morphology, enabling these cells to acquire invasive and migratory abilities (Dongre and Weinberg, 2019). When diagnosed in advanced stages, EMT may occur as CRC metastasize to distal organs (Pastushenko and Blanpain, 2019; Sunlin Yong, 2021; Yeung and Yang, 2017; Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021).  Our study demonstrated that BEST4 inhibits EMT in colorectal cancer (CRC) both in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, ablation of BEST4 promotes EMT by upregulating the expression of EMT-related genes, thereby facilitating the metastasis of colorectal cancer cells to the liver.</p>
