<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Here we introduce a new endpoint “census population size” to evaluate the epidemiology and control of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infections, where the parasite, rather than the infected human host, is the unit of measurement. To calculate census population size, we rely on a definition of parasite variation known as multiplicity of infection (MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>), based on the hyper-diversity of the <italic>var</italic> multigene family. We present a Bayesian approach to estimate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> from sequencing and counting the number of unique DBLα tags (or DBLα types) of <italic>var</italic> genes, and derive from it census population size by summation of MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> in the human population. We track changes in this parasite population size and structure through sequential malaria interventions by indoor residual spraying (IRS) and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) from 2012 to 2017 in an area of high-seasonal malaria transmission in northern Ghana. Following IRS, which reduced transmission intensity by &gt; 90% and decreased parasite prevalence by ∼40-50%, significant reductions in <italic>var</italic> diversity, MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>, and population size were observed in ∼2,000 humans across all ages. These changes, consistent with the loss of diverse parasite genomes, were short lived and 32-months after IRS was discontinued and SMC was introduced, <italic>var</italic> diversity and population size rebounded in all age groups except for the younger children (1-5 years) targeted by SMC. Despite major perturbations from IRS and SMC interventions, the parasite population remained very large and retained the <italic>var</italic> population genetic characteristics of a high-transmission system (high <italic>var</italic> diversity; low <italic>var</italic> repertoire similarity) demonstrating the resilience of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to short-term interventions in high-burden countries of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Malaria in high-transmission endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is characterised by vast diversity of the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> parasites from the perspective of antigenic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Otto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2017</xref>). As with other hosts of hyper-variable pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Futse et al., 2008</xref>), children experiencing clinical episodes of malaria, eventually become immune to disease but not to infection. This results in a large reservoir of chronic asymptomatic infections, in hosts of all ages, sustaining transmission to mosquitos. Given the goal of malaria eradication by 2050, it is therefore of interest to examine how the parasite population changes following perturbation by major intervention efforts, both in terms of its size and underlying population genetics.</p>
<p>So, what do we mean by the parasite population size in the case of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and how do we measure it? Parasite prevalence, detected by microscopy or more sensitive molecular diagnostics (e.g., PCR), describes the proportion of infected human hosts. Studies of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genetic diversity have shown that the majority of people in high-transmission endemic areas harbour diverse multiclonal infections measured as the complexity or multiplicity of infection (MOI) (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Anderson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Paul et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Smith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sumner et al., 2021</xref>)) with complex population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bruce et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Farnert et al., 1997</xref>). These genetic data indicate much larger parasite population sizes than observed by prevalence of infection alone. Thus, from an ecological perspective, we can consider a human host as a patch carrying a number of “antigenically-distinct infections” of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The sum of these antigenically-distinct infections over all hosts provides us with a census of the parasite count of relevance to monitoring and evaluating malaria interventions. We refer to this census population size hereafter simply as population size but make clear that this measure is distinct from effective population size (<italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>) as measured by neutral variation.</p>
<p>Diversity of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> single copy surface antigen genes such as circumsporozoite protein (<italic>csp</italic>), merozoite surface protein 1 (<italic>msp1</italic>) or 2 (<italic>msp2</italic>), and apical membrane antigen 1 (<italic>ama1</italic>) have each been widely used to measure MOI (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Falk et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lerch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Nelson et al., 2019</xref>)). They have become part of newer genetic panels (e.g., Paragon v1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tessema et al., 2020</xref>) and AMPLseq v1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">LaVerriere et al., 2022</xref>)) specifically for MOI determination. Typically, MOI is reported as the maximum number of alleles or single locus haplotypes present at the most diverse of these antigen-encoding loci rather than the number of unique multilocus haplotypes of these genes combined, as it is challenging to accurately reconstruct or phase these haplotypes in hosts with an MOI &gt; 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lerch et al., 2019</xref>). Each of these genes is under balancing selection with a few geographically-common haplotypes and many very rare haplotypes in moderate-to high-transmission settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Markwalter et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sumner et al., 2021</xref>). Where there is a high probability of co-occurrence of two or more common single locus haplotypes in a host, genotyping each of these single copy antigen genes alone will underestimate MOI. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panels have been used to define the presence of multiclonal infections with limited reliability to estimate MOI for highly complex infections, typical in high transmission, even with the use of computational methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Labbé et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>As an alternative to genotyping single copy antigen genes and biallelic SNP panels to estimate MOI, we have proposed the use of a fingerprinting methodology known as <italic>var</italic>coding to genotype the hyper-diverse <italic>var</italic> multigene family (∼50-60 <italic>var</italic> genes per haploid genome). This method employs a ∼450bp region of a <italic>var</italic> gene, known as a DBLα tag encoding the immunogenic Duffy-binding-like alpha (DBLα) domain of PfEMP1 (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> erythrocyte membrane protein 1), the major surface antigen of the blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang and Deitsch, 2022</xref>). Bioinformatic analyses of a large database of exon 1 sequences of <italic>var</italic> genes showed a predominantly 1-to-1 DBLα-<italic>var</italic> relationship, such that each DBLα tag typically represents a unique <italic>var</italic> gene, especially in high transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tan et al., 2023</xref>). The extensive diversity of DBLα tags together with the very low percentage of <italic>var</italic> genes shared between parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">2017</xref>) facilitate measuring MOI by amplifying, pooling, sequencing, and counting the number of unique DBLα tags (or DBLα types) in a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). From a single PCR with degenerate primers and amplicon sequencing, the method specifically counts the most diverse DBLα types, designated non-upsA, per infection to arrive at a metric we call MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>. It is not based on assigning haplotypes but exploits the fact that <italic>var</italic> repertoires are non-overlapping, especially in high transmission. Instead, it assumes a set number of non-upsA types per genome based on repeated sampling of 3D7 control isolates accounting for PCR sampling errors to calculate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ghansah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, rather than looking at the diversity of a single copy antigen-encoding gene like <italic>csp, msp2,</italic> or <italic>ama1</italic> to calculate MOI, by <italic>var</italic>coding we are looking at sets of 45 non-upsA DBLα types per genome. Prior work has shown that <italic>var</italic>coding is more sensitive to measure MOI in high transmission where there is an extremely high prevalence of multiclonal infections that cannot be accurately phased with either biallelic SNP panels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ghansah et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Labbé et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Tessema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Watson et al., 2021</xref>) or combinations of single copy antigen genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sumner et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we report an investigation of changes in parasite population size and structure through two sequential malaria control interventions between 2012 and 2017 in Bongo District located in the Upper East Region of Ghana, one of the 12 highest burden countries in Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">World Health Organization, 2022</xref>). We present a novel Bayesian modification to the published <italic>var</italic>coding approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>) that takes into account under-sampling of non-upsA DBLα types in an isolate to estimate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>) and therefore population size. We document <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence as well as <italic>var</italic> diversity and population structure from baseline in 2012 through a major perturbation by a short-term indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaign managed under operational conditions, which reduced transmission intensity by &gt; 90% as measured by the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) and decreased parasite prevalence by ∼40-50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). Next, we followed what happened to parasite population size more than two years after the IRS intervention was discontinued and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) was introduced for children between the ages of 3-59 months (i.e., &lt; 5 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Wagman et al., 2018</xref>). Detectable changes in parasite population size were seen as a consequence of the IRS intervention but this quantity rapidly rebounded 32-months after the intervention ceased. Overall, throughout the IRS, SMC, and subsequent rebound, the parasite population in humans remained large in size and retained the <italic>var</italic> population genetic characteristics of high transmission (i.e., high <italic>var</italic> diversity, low <italic>var</italic> repertoire overlap), demonstrating the overall resilience of the species to survive significant short-term perturbations.</p>

<title>Study design and sample collection</title>
<p>Using an interrupted time-series study design, four age-stratified cross-sectional surveys of ∼2,000 participants per survey were undertaken to investigate the impacts of IRS and SMC in combination with long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) impregnated with pyrethroids under operational conditions on the asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reservoir from two proximal catchment areas (i.e., Vea/Gowrie and Soe, with a sampling area of ∼60 km<sup>2</sup>) in Bongo District, Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2017</xref>) (Table supplement 1). Bongo District, located in the Upper East Region, is categorized as high-seasonal malaria transmission based on the World Health Organization’s (WHO) “A Framework for Malaria Elimination” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">WHO/GMP, 2017</xref>) where <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence was ≥ 35% at baseline in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">2017</xref>).

The four cross-sectional surveys were completed at the end of the wet season (i.e., high-transmission season) and the study can be separated into four distinct study time points: (1) October 2012 (Survey 1) prior to the IRS and SMC (i.e., baseline), (2) October 2014 (Survey 2) two months after the second round of IRS (Actellic 50EC), (3) October 2015 (Survey 3) seven months after the third round of IRS using a long-acting non-pyrethroid insecticide (Actellic 300CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gogue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">US President’s Malaria Initiative Africa IRS (AIRS) Project, 2016</xref>), and finally (4) October 2017 (Survey 4) 32-months after the discontinuation of IRS, but during the deployment of SMC to all children 3-59 months (i.e., &lt; 5 years) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

<title>Details of the IRS and SMC interventions</title>
<p>Starting in 2013, the AngloGold Ashanti Malaria Control Programme (AGAMal) in a public-private partnership with the Global Fund, scaled up IRS across all of the Upper East Region of northern Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gogue et al., 2020</xref>). As part of this initiative, three rounds of IRS with organophosphate formulations (i.e., non-pyrethroid) were rolled out prior to the start of the wet season between 2013 and 2015 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) in Bongo District (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). Based on AGAMal’s operational reports, IRS coverage in Bongo District was 91.8% in Round 1, 95.6% in Round 2, and finally 96.6% in Round 3 (AGAMal, personal communication). To monitor the impact of the IRS on the local vector population, monthly entomological collections were undertaken between February 2013 and September 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). Using these surveys we observed that the monthly entomological inoculation rate (EIR) (infective bites/person/month (ib/p/m)), a measure of local transmission intensity, declined by &gt; 90% at the peak of the wet season between August 2013 (pre-IRS) (EIR = 5.3 ib/p/m) and August 2015 (post-IRS) (EIR = 0.4 ib/p/m) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). Following the IRS, SMC was rolled out in the Upper East Region by the National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP)/ Ghana Health Service (GHS) starting in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gogue et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). SMC is the intermittent administration of full treatment courses of an antimalarial to children between the ages of 3-59 months (i.e., &lt; 5 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">WHO, 2012</xref>). Like other countries, the SMC drug combination of choice in Ghana is amodiaquine plus sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, which is administered at monthly intervals during the high-transmission season (i.e., wet season) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">WHO, 2012</xref>). The goal of this age-targeted intervention is to both clear current malaria infections and prevent malarial illness by maintaining a therapeutic concentration of an antimalarial in blood over the period of greatest risk (i.e., high-transmission season). Reported SMC coverage in Bongo District was 92.6% in 2016 (two rounds between August – September 2016) and 94.6% in 2017 (four rounds between September – December 2017) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gogue et al., 2020</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>Var</italic> genotyping and sequence analysis</title>
<p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the dried blood spots for all participants with a confirmed microscopic asymptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (i.e., isolate) (2,572 isolates, Table supplement 2) using the QIAamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN, USA) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Tiedje et al., 2017</xref>). For <italic>var</italic> genotyping or <italic>var</italic>coding, the sequences encoding the DBLα domains of the antigen-encoding <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> genes were amplified by PCR, pooled, and sequenced on a MiSeq 2×300 paired-end cycle protocol as previously published (New York University Genome Technology Center, New York, NY, USA; Australian Genome Research Facility, Melbourne, Australia) (Figure supplement 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2017</xref>). The raw sequence data was then cleaned and processed using our previously published customized bioinformatic pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UniMelb-Day-Lab/DBLaCleaner">https://github.com/UniMelb-Day-Lab/DBLaCleaner</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al., 2018</xref>). This pipeline was used to de-multiplex and merge the paired-end reads as well as remove low-quality sequences and chimeras using several filtering parameters (see Figure supplement 2 for additional details). These steps resulted in a total of 291,498 cleaned DBLα sequences for all surveys (Figure supplement 2). To identify the unique DBLα types, we then clustered these cleaned DBLα sequences with 237,910 DBLα sequences previously published from Bongo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Pilosof et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Rorick et al., 2018</xref>) at the standard 96% sequence identity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UniMelb-Day-Lab/clusterDBLalpha">https://github.com/UniMelb-Day-Lab/clusterDBLalpha</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Day et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2017</xref>). Our dataset was then further curated by translating the DBLα types (N = 68,507) into amino acid sequences and removing any DBLα types that could not be translated (i.e., contained a stop codon) (N = 137; 0.2%). The remaining DBLα types were then assigned to their most likely DBLα domain class (i.e., DBLα0, DBLα1, or DBLα2) using a hidden Markov model, and further classified based on the association of specific domain classes with semi-conserved upstream promoter sequences (ups) as either upsA or non-upsA DBLα types (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UniMelb-Day-Lab/classifyDBLalpha">https://github.com/UniMelb-Day-Lab/classifyDBLalpha</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2017</xref>).

Using a cut off of ≥ 20 DBLα types, DBLα sequencing data was obtained from 2,099 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> isolates (81.6%) with a total of 289,064 DBLα sequences and 53,241 unique DBLα types being identified in the study population (Table supplement 2). This genotyping success was acceptable given that we were working with low-density asymptomatic infections (Table supplement 1). The median <italic>P. falciparum</italic> density was ∼4 times higher for isolates with ≥ 20 DBLα types compared to those that gave no or &lt; 20 DBLα types (520 [IQR: 200-1880] parasites/μL vs. 120 [IQR: 40-200] parasites/μL, respectively).</p>

<title>DBLα type diversity</title>
<p>We monitored the impacts of the sequential interventions (i.e., IRS and SMC) on diversity by measuring changes in the population genetics of DBLα types at the population level (i.e., <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reservoir). Diversity was monitored using two measures, DBLα type richness and DBLα type frequency. Richness was defined as the number of unique DBLα types observed (i.e., DBLα type pool size) in each survey or study time point (i.e., 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017). DBLα type richness, however, does not provide any information about the relative frequencies of the different DBLα types in the population, as they are all weighted equally whether they are observed once or more frequently (e.g., observed in &gt; 20 isolates per survey). To further examine the impacts of the interventions on DBLα type diversity we also assessed the frequency of each unique DBLα type in 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017. Here we defined DBLα type frequency as the number of times (i.e., number of isolates) a DBLα type was observed in each survey. Both upsA and non-upsA DBLα type diversities were measured due to their different biological features, chromosomal positions (i.e., subtelomeric regions vs. internal or central regions), as well as population genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Falk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Gardner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Kaestli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Kalmbach et al., 2010</xref>; Kraemer et al., 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kraemer and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kyriacou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Lavstsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Normark et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Rottmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Warimwe et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Zhang and Deitsch, 2022</xref>).

The upsA and non-upsA DBLα type proportions were partitioned as expected in our analyses, with the median proportions at the repertoire level being comparable in 2012 (19% upsA and 81% non-upsA), 2014 (22% upsA and 78% non-upsA), 2015 (21% upsA and 79% non-upsA), and 2017 (20% upsA and 80% non-upsA).</p>

<title>Repertoire similarity as defined by pairwise type sharing</title>
<p>To estimate genetic similarity between the DBLα repertoires (i.e., unique DBLα types identified in each isolate) identified from two isolates, pairwise type sharing (PTS) was calculated between all pairs of isolates in each survey as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Barry et al., 2007</xref>). PTS, analogous to the Sørensen Index, is a similarity statistic to evaluate the proportion of DBLα types shared between two isolate repertoires (i.e., DBLα repertoire overlap) and ranges from 0 (i.e., no DBLα repertoire overlap) to 1 (i.e., identical DBLα isolate repertoires), where &lt; 0.50 = unrelated, 0.5 = recent recombinants/siblings, &gt; 0.5 = related, and 1 = clones. PTS is a measure of identity-by-state (IBS) used to assess repertoire similarity (or relatedness) between isolates and is not used to infer inheritance from a recent common ancestor (i.e., identity-by-decent (IBD)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Speed and Balding, 2015</xref>).</p>

<title>DBLα isolate repertoire size and number of <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> repertories</title>
<p>For this study we have exploited the unique population structure of non-overlapping DBLα isolate repertoires to estimate isolate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>. To calculate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>, the non-upsA DBLα types were chosen since not only are they more diverse and less conserved between isolate repertoires (i.e., low median PTS<sub>non-</sub> <sub>upsA</sub> ≤ 0.020) compared to the upsA DBLα types, but they have also been shown to have a more specific 1-to-1 relationship with a single <italic>var</italic> gene than upsA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tan et al., 2023</xref>). The low to non-existent overlap of repertoires enables an estimation of MOI that relies on the number of non-upsA DBLα types sequenced from an individual’s isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). A constant repertoire size or number of DBLα types in a parasite genome can be used to convert the number of types sequenced in an isolate to its estimated MOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>). As such, the approach neglects the measurement error in this size introduced by targeted PCR and amplicon sequencing of <italic>var</italic> genes in an infection.</p>

<title>Bayesian estimation of MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> and associated population size</title>
<p>Here, we extend the method to a Bayesian formulation and estimate the posterior distribution for each sampled individual for the probability of different MOI values. From individual posterior distributions, we can then obtain the estimated MOI frequency distribution for the population as a whole. The two pieces of information required for our approach are the measurement error and the prior distribution of MOI. The measurement error is simply the repertoire size distribution, that is, the distribution of the number of non-upsA DBLα types sequenced given MOI = 1, which is empirically available (Figure supplement 3). We refer to it as P(s | MOI=1) where <italic>s</italic> denotes repertoire size. In the following, <italic>s</italic> denotes the number of non-upsA DBLα types sequenced when MOI &gt; 1. The prior distribution of MOI refers to the belief we have for what the actual MOI distribution might look like at the population level before empirical evidence is taken into consideration. For example, the prior distribution of MOI is likely to centre around a higher value in high-transmission endemic areas than in low-transmission ones.</p>
<p>We can obtain P(s | MOI = m) from the serial convolution of the repertoire size distribution P(s | MOI = 1) and P(s | MOI = m - 1). Starting with the repertoire size distribution given a single infection, we can derive P(s | MOI = m) for <italic>m</italic> equal to 2,3,…, up until a maximum value of 20 (empirically determined), as follows:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="23290210v2_eqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>L</italic> and <italic>U</italic> are the lower and upper limit for the repertoire size, 10 and 45 respectively from the empirical repertoire size distribution.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we begin with a uniform prior. We use Bayes’ rule to derive a posterior distribution of MOI given a certain number of non-upsA DBLα types sequenced from an individual:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="23290210v2_eqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>k</italic> is the maximum value of MOI, here 20, as empirically determined.</p>
<p>To obtain the MOI distribution at the population level, we could either simply pool the maximum <italic>a posteriori</italic> MOI estimate for each sampled individual, or use a technique called mixture distribution. For the latter, we weighed each posterior MOI distribution for each sampled individual equally and sum over all posterior distributions at the individual level to derive the MOI distribution at the population level:
<disp-formula>
<alternatives><graphic xlink:href="23290210v2_eqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/></alternatives>
</disp-formula></p>
<p>where <italic>n</italic> is the number of sampled individuals. These two approaches gave similar results for our empirical survey data as determined by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. The obtained distance statistic is close to 0 and the corresponding <italic>p-value</italic> is non-significant across all surveys, indicating that the two estimates were drawn from the same distribution (Table supplement 3). Given this similarity, we present hereafter only the result of pooling the maximum a posteriori MOI estimates. Note that we focused on individuals who had a confirmed microscopic asymptomatic P. <italic>falciparum</italic> infection for our MOI estimation.</p>
<p>To examine alternative priors, we considered empirical MOI distributions described in the literature including the Poisson, hyper-Poisson, and negative binomial distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Dietz, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Henry, 2020</xref>). The hyper-Poisson and negative binomial distributions can capture the overdispersion seen in the empirical distribution of MOI for certain areas and caused by factors such as heterogeneous biting. We investigated changing the parameters of a negative binomial distribution to generate priors with different means spanning a wide range of MOI values (mean MOI within [∼3, ∼9]), including those seen in high-transmission endemic areas. We found that the final MOI distribution at the population level is fairly robust against the specification of those parameters. In other words, the estimated MOI distributions at the population level for different parameters do not significantly diverge from each other. The pairwise distance between these distributions measured by KL-divergence centres around 0, and the difference between their mean MOI values across different priors is close to 0 (Figure supplement 3 and 4). Additionally, we performed Pearson correlation tests. We found that the correlation coefficients between the estimated MOI distributions at the population level across different parameters were close to 1 with a highly significant <italic>p-value</italic> (Figure supplement 5 and 6). Thus, we provide in our analyses the estimated population MOI distribution using a uniform prior.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Between 2013 and 2015, three-rounds of IRS with non-pyrethroid insecticides were implemented across all of Bongo District. Coincident with the &gt; 90% decrease in transmission following IRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Tiedje et al., 2022</xref>), the prevalence of microscopic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections compared to the 2012 baseline survey (pre-IRS) declined by 45.2% and 35.7% following the second (2012 to 2014) and the third (2012 to 2015) round of IRS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Table supplement 1). These declines in parasite prevalence were observed across all ages, with the greatest impacts being observed on the younger children (i.e., 1-5 years) who were ∼3 times less likely to have an infection in 2015 (post-IRS) compared to 2012 (pre-IRS) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table supplement 1). These reductions were however short-lived and in 2017, 32-months after the discontinuation of IRS, but during SMC, overall <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence rebounded to 41.2%, or near pre-IRS levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Table supplement 1). Importantly, this increase in the prevalence of infection in 2017 was only observed among the older age groups (i.e., ≥ 6 years) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table supplement 1). This difference by age group in 2017 can be attributed to SMC, which only targets children between 3-59 months (i.e., &lt; 5 years). A notable increase in parasite prevalence for adolescents (11-20 years) and adults (&gt;20 years) was found in 2017 relative to 2012 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>, Table supplement 1).</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to explore changes in population size measured by MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>. As this metric is based on non-overlap of <italic>var</italic> repertoire diversity of individual isolates, specifically non-upsA DBLα types, we investigated whether DBLα isolate repertoire similarity (or overlap), as measured by PTS, increased following the sequential interventions (i.e., IRS and SMC). <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows that median PTS values for both upsA and non-upsA DBLα types remained low in all surveys although the PTS distributions for both groups changed significantly at each of the study time points relative to the 2012 baseline survey (pre-IRS) (<italic>p-values</italic> &lt; 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). However, the change was in the direction of reduced similarity with lower median PTS scores and a larger number of isolates sharing no DBLα types (i.e., PTS = 0) in 2014, 2015, and 2017 compared to 2012. Relevant to measurement of MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>, the median PTS scores for non-upsA DBLα types were lower following the IRS intervention (PTS<sub>non-upsA</sub>: 2014 = 0.013 and 2015 = 0.013 vs. PTS<sub>non-upsA</sub>: 2012 = 0.020). In 2017, the non-upsA PTS distributions shifted back towards higher median PTS scores (PTS<sub>non-upsA</sub> = 0.016) and fewer isolates shared no DBLα types relative to 2014 and 2015 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). To verify this pattern was not influenced by multiclonal infections (MOI<sub>var</sub> &gt; 1) we also examined isolates with monoclonal infections (MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> = 1) and found that this non-overlapping structure persisted regardless of infection complexity, particularly for the non-upsA DBLα types (Figure supplement 7). These PTS data make clear that we were dealing with a large, highly diverse parasite population where 99.9% of the isolate comparisons in all surveys had PTS<sub>non-upsA</sub> scores ≤ 0.1 (i.e., shared ≤ 10% of their non-upsA DBLα types), indicating that DBLα isolate repertoires were highly unrelated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In fact, throughout the IRS, SMC, and subsequent rebound, very few DBLα isolate repertoires were observed to be related, with &lt; 0.003% isolate comparisons in each survey having a PTS<sub>non-upsA</sub> ≥ 0.5 (i.e., siblings or recent recombinants) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>)</p>

The PTS scales in the density plots have been zoomed-in to provide better visualization of the upsA and non-upsA DBLα types PTS distributions. The colored dashed lines in the density plots indicate the median PTS scores in each survey for the upsA (2012 (red) = 0.078, 2014 (orange) = 0.063, 2015 (green) = 0.054, and 2017 (purple) = 0.064) and non-upsA (2012 (red) = 0.020, 2014 (orange) = 0.013, 2015 (green) = 0.013, and 2017 (purple) = 0.016) DBLα types. <italic>Note:</italic> The non-upsA median PTS values in 2014 (orange) and 2015 (green) were both 0.013, and overlap in the figure.

<p>The raw data of non-upsA DBLα isolate repertoire sizes (Figure supplement 8) were used to estimate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> as adjusted using the Bayesian approach (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We observed that at baseline in 2012, the majority (89.2%) of the population across all ages carried multiclonal infections (median MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>= 4 [IQR: 2 – 6]) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). Following the IRS intervention, the estimated MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>distributions became more positively skewed, indicating that a lower proportion of participants harboured multiclonal infections with a lower median MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> in 2014 (64.5%; median MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> = 2 [IQR: 1 – 3]) and 2015 (71.4%; median MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> = 2 [IQR: 1 – 3]) compared to 2012 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). These reductions in median MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>and the proportion of multiclonal infections, which were observed across all age groups (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>), are consistent with the &gt; 90% decrease in transmission intensity following the IRS in turn reducing exposure to new parasite genomes. However, in 2017, both median MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> (3 [IQR: 2 – 4]) and the proportion of multiclonal infections (78.9%) rebounded in all age groups, even among the younger children (1-5 years) targeted by SMC (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). While the prevalence of infection in 2017 remained low for the younger children (1-5 years) targeted by SMC, those infected still carried multiclonal infections (84.1% of those infected) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Although the MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> distributions across all age groups started to rebound in 2017 (i.e., less positively skewed compared to 2014 and 2015) they had not fully recovered to the 2012 baseline patterns (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). This was most apparent among the younger children (1-5 years), as a larger proportion of isolates in 2017, compared to 2012, had MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> values equal to one or two, while a smaller proportion had MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> values ≥ 5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>Population size measured as the number of <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> repertoires circulating in the population during each survey was estimated by summation of isolate MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>. In 2014 during IRS, this number decreased by 72.4% relative to the 2012 baseline survey (pre-IRS) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas prevalence decreased by 54.5% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Although population size increased slightly in 2015 relative to 2014, there were still 64.5% fewer <italic>var</italic> repertoires in the population compared to 2012 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>) in comparison to a 42.6% decrease in prevalence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly this loss of <italic>var</italic> repertoires in 2014 and 2015 following the IRS intervention was seen for all age groups, with the greatest overall reductions (&gt; 85%) being observed for the younger children (1-5 years) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4CD</xref>). However, in 2017, the number of diverse <italic>var</italic> repertoires in the population rebounded, more than doubling between 2015 and 2017 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4AB</xref>). This increase in the number of <italic>var</italic> repertoires was seen for all age groups in 2017, except for the younger children (1-5 years) who were directly targeted by SMC (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4CD</xref>). In fact, the greatest overall increase was observed for the adolescents (11-20 years), where the number of <italic>var</italic> repertoires in 2017 was ∼1.4 times higher compared to 2012 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4CD</xref>). Similar trends in the number <italic>var</italic> repertoires were also observed for the older children (6-10 years) and adults (&gt;20 years) in 2017, although the rebound was not as striking as that detected for the adolescents.</p>

<p>As parasite population size changed considerably during the sequential interventions, we investigated how the removal or loss of <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> repertoires and subsequent rebound altered DBLα type richness, measured as the number of unique upsA and non-upsA DBLα types in the parasite population in each survey. Richness at baseline in 2012 (pre-IRS) was high with a large number of unique DBLα types (upsA = 2,215; non-upsA = 33,151) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Table supplement 2) and limited overlap of <italic>var</italic> repertoires (i.e., median PTS<sub>non-upsA</sub> ≤ 0.020) seen in a relatively small study population of 685 microscopically positive individuals (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). In 2014, as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence and population size declined (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) so too did the number of DBLα types, resulting in a 32.1% and 55.3% reduction in richness for the upsA and non-upsA DBLα types, respectively compared to 2012 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Table supplement 2). Again in 2015, as <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence and population size remained low (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) DBLα type richness was still less than that observed in 2012 (24.6% and 45.9% reduction for upsA and non-upsA DBLα types, respectively) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, Table supplement 2). Finally, in 2017, we found that upsA and non-upsA DBLα type richness rebounded relative to 2014 and 2015, coincident with the increase in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> prevalence and parasite population size (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Given this reduction in DBLα type richness following the IRS intervention and subsequent rebound in 2017, we wanted to explore whether the loss of richness was influenced by the frequency of individual DBLα types in the parasite population within and among surveys. To answer this, we defined the relative frequency of individual DBLα types in all isolates in each survey (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>, Figure supplement 9). We discovered that individual upsA and non-upsA DBLα types were not all at equal frequencies within a survey and among surveys. They could be classified as frequent (i.e., observed in 11-20 or &gt; 20 isolates), less frequent (i.e., observed in 2-10 isolates) or only seen once, at baseline in 2012 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6AB</xref>). In 2014 and 2015, following the IRS, there was a significant increase in the proportion of upsA and non-upsA DBLα types in the lower frequency categories (<italic>p-value</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test), with all DBLα types becoming rarer in the population (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6CD</xref>). This change can be attributed to the removal of <italic>P. falciparum var</italic> repertoires (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) with associated loss of upsA and non-upsA DBLα type richness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), which disproportionally affected those DBLα types seen once. This shift to all DBLα types becoming rarer following IRS changed in 2017, where the proportion of DBLα types in the more frequent categories (i.e., 2-10, 11-20, or &gt; 20 isolates) significantly increased while the proportion seen once decreased (<italic>p-values</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney U tests) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6CD</xref>). Data in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> (A-D) pointed to a differential effect of the IRS intervention and subsequent rebound on the less frequent upsA and non-upsA DBLα types vs. those that were classified as frequent, where those DBLα types that were most frequent persisted longitudinally.</p>

</fig>
<p>To explore this observation further we restricted the longitudinal analysis to those DBLα types from the baseline survey in 2012 (pre-IRS). We compared the probability of survival for the DBLα types identified at baseline and found that the upsA DBLα types persisted significantly longer in the population relative to the non-upsA DBLα types (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, log-rank test), despite the IRS intervention. The simple explanation being that although the upsA DBLα types had lower richness (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>), a larger proportion was classified as frequent indicating that multiple copies existed in the population compared to the non-upsA DBLα types (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6CD</xref>). Furthermore, when we examined survival using the frequency categories, the upsA and non-upsA DBLα types that persisted and were observed at multiple study time points (i.e., 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017) were those that were most frequent (i.e., observed in 11-20 and &gt;20 isolates) in the population at baseline in 2012 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6EF</xref>). As expected, the DBLα types that were only observed once in 2012, were significantly less likely to be seen longitudinally (<italic>p-value</italic> &lt; 0.001, log-rank test) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6EF</xref>). These differential changes in DBLα type richness with respect to rare vs frequent DBLα types are a consequence of changes in census population size with interventions where each isolate repertoire is composed of many rare DBLα types as defined by PTS (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> populations in high-transmission endemic areas in SSA, are characterised by extensive diversity, high rates of recombination, as well as frequent multiclonal infections. Here we defined census population size of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to understand total parasite diversity in a human population and explore the age-specific efficacy of malaria interventions to reduce this metric in such areas as typified by Bongo, Ghana. Census population size proved more informative than parasite prevalence alone because it captures “within” host parasite population size as MOI, rather than using the infected host per se as a unit of population size. Whilst the concept of census population size is agnostic of how you measure MOI, the extensive DBLα isolate repertoire diversity presented makes a strong case for fingerprinting parasite isolates by <italic>var</italic>coding in high transmission. This is opposed to looking at allelic diversity of a single copy antigen gene such as <italic>csp</italic> that is under balancing selection.</p>
<p>By <italic>var</italic>coding we identified a very large census parasite population size in a relatively small human population of ∼2,000 individuals at baseline and captured age-specific changes in this metric in response to sequential malaria control interventions. IRS reduced the MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> parasite population size substantially with the greatest reductions (85%) seen in the younger children (i.e., 1-5 years). More than two years after cessation of IRS, rebound in 2017 was rapid in all age groups with the exception of younger children targeted by SMC. Population sizes in adolescents and adults showed they carried more infections in 2017 than at baseline in 2012. This is indicative of a loss of immunity during IRS which may relate to the observed loss of <italic>var</italic> richness, especially the many rare types. This warrants further investigation of changes in variant-specific immunity. During and following the IRS and SMC interventions, <italic>var</italic> diversity remained high and <italic>var</italic> repertoire overlap remained low, reflecting characteristic properties of high transmission and demonstrating the overall resilience of the species to survive significant short-term perturbations. Combining interventions and targeting older age groups or the whole community with chemoprevention would no doubt have a much greater impact on reducing the diversity of the reservoir of infection.</p>
<p>What was striking about the Bongo study was the speed with which rebound in MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> per person and census population size occurred, once the short-term IRS was discontinued. We looked for a potential explanation in our genetic data. PTS and population frequency data showed that many of the DBLα types occurred in multiple repertoires or genomes. This enabled the survival of these more frequent DBLα types through the interventions, facilitating rebound by maintenance of this diversity. The other notable population genetic result of our study was the failure to increase similarity (or relatedness by state) of <italic>var</italic> repertoires by reducing transmission by &gt; 90% via IRS. From a baseline of a very large population size with very low overlap in repertoires you need outcrossing to create relatedness. However, this was less likely to happen due to reduced transmission as a result of IRS. Rebound, with associated increases in transmission, led to a small increase in <italic>var</italic> repertoire similarity. This is the opposite to what has been observed in areas of lower transmission under intense malaria control where the intensity of interventions led to increased genome similarity, as assessed by IBD, from a starting point of much lower genome diversity and greater relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>).</p>
<p>Our molecular approach to measure population size has been to sum MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> in individual hosts with microscopically-detectable infections. Like any diagnostic method there are limits to sensitivity and specificity, which can be more or less tolerated dependent upon the purpose of the study. Here we have looked at relative changes in population size with sequential interventions using an interrupted time series study design and observed changes by measuring MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic>. We have accounted for missing DBLα type data where complete <italic>var</italic> repertoires may not have been sequenced using a Bayesian method based on empirical knowledge of the measurement error. This approach has conceptual relation to the Bayesian approach by Johnson and Larremore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Johnson and Larremore, 2022</xref>) to estimate complete repertoire size of, and overlap between, monoclonal infections from incomplete sampling of DBLα types. Our measurement of population size based on MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> will be subject to other sampling errors which may in the end be more significant (discussed in detail in Labbé et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Labbé et al., 2023</xref>)). For example, low parasitemia typical of asymptomatic infections, small blood volumes, clinical status, and/or within host dynamics, including synchronicity, will all create sampling problems but these are common to all measures of MOI.</p>
<p>Previously, we have drawn attention to underestimation of the number of DBLα types of related parasites from a cross by <italic>var</italic> genotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Labbé et al., 2023</xref>). Such related parasites must be created frequently in high transmission due to extensive outcrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babiker et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Paul et al., 1995</xref>). Single clone genomics experiments using biallelic SNPs from whole genome sequencing data have also detected related parasites using IBD in clinical infections from humans in a high-transmission area of Malawi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Nkhoma et al., 2020</xref>). Here we have analysed only low density, chronic asymptomatic infections under strong immune selection in semi-immune hosts whom we have shown select against related parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Ruybal-Pesántez et al., 2022</xref>). When considering the importance of possible exclusion of parasites related by descent, the only sure way to detect such parasites in high transmission is by single cell genomics, a methodology of limited application to malaria surveillance due to practicality and cost of scale up. Again, the error from failure to sample related infections must be weighed up against the issues of under-sampling as described above.</p>
<p>In summary, our findings provide parasite population insights into why rebound is the inevitable consequence of such short-term IRS interventions unless you simultaneously target the highly diverse, long-lived parasite population in humans, not just children &lt; 5 years by SMC. Of potential translational significance for malaria molecular surveillance, we identify new metrics, especially MOI<italic><sub>var</sub></italic> and census population size as well as <italic>var</italic> frequency category, informative to monitor and evaluate interventions in high-transmission areas with multiclonal infections and high rates of outcrossing. Such metrics could be used longitudinally to detect incremental gains of transmission-reducing interventions, including IRS, LLINs, and vaccines to perturb the high-transmission characteristics of the parasite population in humans in high-burden countries in SSA.</p>

<p>Tiedje et al. investigated the transient impact of indoor residual spraying (IRS) followed by seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) on the plasmodium falciparum parasite population in a high transmission setting. The parasite population was characterized by sequencing the highly variable DBL$\alpha$ tag as a proxy for var genes, a method known as varcoding. Varcoding presents a unique opportunity due to the extraordinary diversity observed as well as the extremely low overlap of repertoires between parasite strains. The authors also present a new Bayesian approach to estimating individual multiplicity of infection (MOI) from the measured DBL$\alpha$ repertoire, addressing some of the potential shortcomings of the approach that have been previously discussed. The authors also present a new epidemiological endpoint, the so-called &quot;census population size&quot;, to evaluate the impact of interventions.</p>
<p>This study provides a nice example of how varcoding technology can be leveraged, as well as the importance of using diverse genetic markers for characterizing populations, especially in the context of high transmission. The data are robust and clearly show the transient impact of IRS in a high transmission setting, however, some aspects of the analysis are confusing.</p>
<p>1. Approaching MOI estimation with a Bayesian framework is a well-received addition to the varcoding methodology that helps to address the uncertainty associated with not knowing the true repertoire size. It's unfortunate that while the authors clearly explored the ability to estimate the population MOI distribution, they opted to use only MAP estimates. Embracing the Bayesian methodology fully would have been interesting, as the posterior distribution of population MOI could have been better explored.</p>
<p>2. The &quot;census population size&quot; endpoint has unclear utility. It is defined as the sum of MOI across measured samples, making it sensitive to the total number of samples collected and genotyped. This means that the values are not comparable outside of this study, and are only roughly comparable between strata in the context of prevalence where we understand that approximately the same number of samples were collected. In contrast, mean MOI would be insensitive to differences in sample size, why was this not explored? It's also unclear in what way this is a &quot;census&quot;. While the sample size is certainly large, it is nowhere near a complete enumeration of the parasite population in question, as evidenced by the extremely low level of pairwise type sharing in the observed data.</p>
<p>3. The extraordinary diversity of DBL$\alpha$ presents challenges to analyzing the data. The authors explore the variability in repertoire richness and frequency over the course of the study, noting that richness rapidly declined following IRS and later rebounded, while the frequency of rare types increased, and then later declined back to baseline levels. The authors attribute this to fundamental changes in population structure. While there may have been some changes to the population, the observed differences in richness as well as frequency before and after IRS may also be compatible with simply sampling fewer cases, and thus fewer DBL$\alpha$ sequences. The shift back to frequency and richness that is similar to pre-IRS also coincides with a similar total number of samples collected. The authors explore this to some degree with their survival analysis, demonstrating that a substantial number of rare sequences did not persist between timepoints and that rarer sequences had a higher probability of dropping out. This might also be explained by the extreme stochasticity of the highly diverse DBL$\alpha$, especially for rare sequences that are observed only once, rather than any fundamental shifts in the population structure.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Tiedje and colleagues longitudinally track changes in parasite numbers across four time points as a way of assessing the effect of malaria control interventions in Ghana. Some of the study results have been reported previously, and in this publication, the authors focus on age-stratification of the results. Malaria prevalence was lower in all age groups after IRS. Follow-up with SMC, however, maintained lower parasite prevalence in the targeted age group but not the population as a whole. Additionally, they observe that diversity measures rebounds more slowly than prevalence measures. Overall, I found these results clear, convincing, and well-presented. They add to a growing literature that demonstrates the relevance of asymptomatic reservoirs.</p>
<p>There is growing interest in developing an expanded toolkit for genomic epidemiology in malaria, and detecting changes in transmission intensity is one major application. As the authors summarize, there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and the Bayesian MOIvar estimate developed here has the potential to complement currently used methods. I find its extension to a calculation of absolute parasite numbers appealing as this could serve as both a conceptually straightforward and biologically meaningful metric. However, I am not fully convinced the current implementation will be applied meaningfully across additional studies.</p>
<p>1. I find the term &quot;census population size&quot; problematic as the groups being analyzed (hosts grouped by age at a single time point) do not delineate distinct parasite populations. Separate parasite lineages are not moving through time within these host bins. Rather, there is a single parasite population that is stochastically divided across hosts at each time point. I find this distinction important for interpreting the results and remaining mindful that the 2,000 samples at each time point comprise a subsample of the true population. Instead of &quot;census population size&quot;, I suggest simplifying it to &quot;census count&quot; or &quot;parasite lineage count&quot;.</p>
<p>It would be fascinating to use the obtained results to model absolute parasite numbers at the whole population level (taking into account, for instance, the age structure of the population), and I do hope this group takes that on at some point even if it remains outside the scope of this paper. Such work could enable calculations of absolute---rather than relative---fitness and help us further understand parasite distributions across hosts.</p>
<p>2. I'm uncertain how to contextualize the diversity results without taking into account the total number of samples analyzed in each group. Because of this, I would like a further explanation as to why the authors consider absolute parasite count more relevant than the combined MOI distribution itself (which would have sample count as a denominator). It seems to me that the &quot;per host&quot; component is needed to compare across age groups and time points---let alone different studies.</p>
<p>3. Thinking about the applicability of this approach to other studies, I would be interested in a larger treatment of how overlapping DBLa repertoires would impact MOIvar estimates. Is there a definable upper bound above which the method is unreliable? Alternatively, can repertoire overlap be incorporated into the MOI estimator?</p>
<p>Smaller comments:</p>
<p>
- Figure 1 provides confidence intervals for the prevalence estimates, but these aren't carried through on the other plots (and Figure 5 has lost CIs for both metrics). The relationship between prevalence and diversity is one of the interesting points in this paper, and it would be helpful to have CIs for both metrics when they are directly compared.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The manuscript coins a term &quot;the census population size&quot; which they define from the diversity of malaria parasites observed in the human community. They use it to explore changes in parasite diversity in more than 2000 people in Ghana following different control interventions.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
This is a good demonstration of how genetic information can be used to augment routinely recorded epidemiological and entomological data to understand the dynamics of malaria and how it is controlled. The genetic information does add to our understanding, though by how much is currently unclear (in this setting it says the same thing as age-stratified parasite prevalence), and its relevance moving forward will depend on the practicalities and cost of the data collection and analysis. Nevertheless, this is a great dataset with good analysis and a good attempt to understand more about what is going on in the parasite population.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Overall the manuscript is well-written and generally comprehensively explained. Some terms could be clarified to help the reader and I had some issues with a section of the methods and some of the more definitive statements given the evidence supporting them.</p>

<p>We are delighted that eLife has assessed our study as a valuable contribution as well as appreciating the importance of working on asymptomatic reservoirs of P. falciparum in high transmission where not just children, but adolescents and adults harbor multiclonal infections.
The constructive public reviews will serve to improve our manuscript.</p>
<p>Detailed responses to referees’ comments and a revised manuscript are forthcoming. Here we make a provisional response to three key areas addressed by the referees:</p>
<p>(1) census population size</p>
<p>Referee 1 raises important questions although we respectfully disagree on the terminology we have adopted (of “census”) and on the unclear utility of the proposed quantity.</p>
<p>We consider the quantity a census in that it is a total enumeration or count of the infections in a given population sample and over a given time period. In this sense, it gives us a tangible notion of the size of the parasite population, in an ecological sense, distinct from the formal effective population size used in population genetics. Given the low overlap between var repertoires of parasites (as observed in monoclonal infections), the population size we have calculated translates to a diversity of strains or repertoires. But our focus here is in a measure of population size itself. The distinction between population size in terms of infection counts and effective population size from population genetics has been made before for pathogens (see for example Bedford et al. 2011 for the seasonal influenza virus and for the measles virus) and is a clear one in the ecological literature for non-pathogen populations (Palstra et al. 2012).</p>
<p>Both referees 1 and 2 point out that census population size will be sensitive to sample size. We completely agree with the dependence of our quantity on sample size. We used it for comparisons across time of samples of the same depth, to describe the large population size characteristic of high transmission, and persistent across the IRS intervention. Of course, one would like to be able to use this notion across studies that differ in sampling depth.</p>
<p>Here, referee 1 makes an insightful and useful suggestion. It is true that we can use mean MOI, and indeed there is a simple map between our population size and mean MOI (as we just need to divide or multiply by sample size). We can do even more, as with mean MOI we can presumably extrapolate to the full sample size of the host population, or the population size of another sample in another location. What is needed for this purpose is a stable mean MOI relative to sample size. We can show that indeed in our study mean MOI is stable in that way, by subsampling to different depths of our original sample. We will include in the revision discussion of this point and result, which allows an extrapolation of the census population size to the whole population of hosts in the local area. We’ll also clarify the time denominator, as given the typical duration of infections, we expect our population size to be representative of a per-generation measure.</p>
<p>Referee 2 suggests we adopt the term “census count” but as a census in our mind is a count we prefer to use “census”.</p>
<p>Referee 3 considers the genetic data tracking parasite MOI and census changes gives the same result as prevalence which tracks infected hosts. Respectfully, we disagree and will provide an expanded response.</p>
<p>(2) the importance of lineages (in response to referee 2)</p>
<p>We do not think that lineages moving exclusively through a given type of host or “patch” is a requirement for enumerating the size of the total infections in such a subset. It is true that what we have is a single parasite population, but we are enumerating for the season the respective size in host classes (children and adults). This is akin to enumerating subsets of a population in ecological settings.</p>
<p>We are also not clear on the concept of lineage for these highly recombinant parasites as we struggle to find highly related repertoires. In fact, we see the use of the var fingerprinting methodology as a means to capture changes in strain or var repertoires dynamics as a result of changing transmission conditions.</p>
<p>(3) var methodology</p>
<p>Comments and queries were made by all three referees about aspects of var methodology, including the Bayesian approach. These will be addressed in our full response.</p>
<p>Here we respond to a very good point made by referee 2: “Thinking about the applicability of this approach to other studies, I would be interested in a larger treatment of how overlapping DBLa repertoires would impact MOIvar estimates. Is there a definable upper bound above which the method is unreliable? Alternatively, can repertoire overlap be incorporated into the MOI estimator?”</p>
<p>There is no predefined threshold one can present a priori. Intuitively, the approach to estimate MOI would appear to breakdown as overlap moves away from extremely low, and therefore, for locations with lower transmission intensity. Interestingly, we have observed that this is not the case in our paper by Labbé et al. 2023 where we used model simulations in a gradient of three transmission intensities, from high to low. The original varcoding method performed well across the gradient. This may arise from a nonlinear and fast transition from low overlap to high overlap that is accompanied by the MOI transitioning quickly from primarily multiclonal (MOI &gt; 1) to monoclonal (MOI = 1). This issue needs to be investigated further, including ways to extend the estimation to explicitly include the distribution of DBL repertoire overlap.</p>
