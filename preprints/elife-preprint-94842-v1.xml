<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) has emerged as a key player in the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, wherein it binds to different pre-miRNAs and siRNAs, each varying in sequence and/or structure. We hypothesize that TRBP displays dynamic adaptability to accommodate heterogeneity in target RNA structures. Thus, it is crucial to ascertain the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced protein dynamics in RNA recognition and binding. We have previously elucidated the role of intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational exchange in the double-stranded RNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1) of TRBP in shape-dependent RNA recognition. The current study delves into the intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics of the TRBP-dsRBD2 and then compares it with the dsRBD1 study carried out previously. Remarkably, the two domains exhibit differential binding affinity to a 12 bp dsRNA owing to the presence of critical residues and structural plasticity. Further, we report that dsRBD2 depicts constrained conformational plasticity when compared to dsRBD1. Although, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes induced conformational exchange within the designated RNA-binding regions and other residues, the amplitude of the motions remains modest when compared to those observed in dsRBD1. We propose a dynamics-driven model of the two tandem domains of TRBP, substantiating their contributions to the versatility of dsRNA recognition and binding.</p>

<p>Exploring the intricacies of RNA-protein interactions by delving into dynamics-based measurements not only adds valuable insights into the mechanics of RNA-protein interactions but also underscores the significance of conformational dynamics in dictating the functional outcome in such tightly regulated biological processes. In this study, we measure intrinsic and RNA-induced conformational dynamics in the second dsRBD, i.e., TRBP-dsRBD2, and compare the same with that carried out in the first dsRBD (TRBP-dsRBD1) of TRBP protein, a key player of the RNAi pathway. The study unveils the differential conformational space accessible to the two domains of TRBP, even though they both adopt a canonical dsRBD fold, thereby affecting how they interact with target RNAs.</p></abstract>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a crucial role in every aspect of RNA biology, including folding, splicing, processing, transport, and localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dreyfuss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Jiang and Baltimore, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Wilkinson and Shyu, 2001</xref>). RBPs can be broadly classified into single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (ssRBPs) and double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (dsRBPs). While ssRBPs are generally sequence-specific as the interaction points include exposed nucleobases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Auweter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Daubner et al., 2013</xref>); dsRBPs tend to target a particular structural fold, especially the A-form RNA duplex via phosphate backbone and sugar hydroxyl protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Masliah et al., 2012</xref>). dsRBPs interact with highly structured dsRNAs via their double-stranded RNA-binding motifs/domains (dsRBMs/dsRBDs).</p>
<p>dsRBDs are 65-68 amino acid long domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnston et al., 1992</xref>) that contain a highly conserved secondary structure (α<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>2</sub>-β<sub>3</sub>-α<sub>2</sub>), where the two α-helices are packed against an antiparallel β-sheet formed by three β-strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Bycroft et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kharrat et al., 1995</xref>). All the dsRBDs have three common RNA-binding regions: (1) the middle of helix α<sub>1</sub> (E residue), (2) the N-terminal residues of helix α<sub>2</sub> (KKxAK motif), and (3) the loop between β<sub>1</sub> and β<sub>2</sub> strands (GPxH motif) (as depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref> in grey highlighted regions), forming a canonical RNA-binding surface that interacts with the consecutive minor, major, and minor groove of a dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Masliah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Tian et al., 2004</xref>). dsRBDs interact with dsRNAs in a non-sequence-specific manner, targeting the sugar 2’-OH groups (dsRBDs do not target dsDNAs) and phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bevilacqua and Cech, 1996</xref>). They are often arranged in a modular fashion to create highly versatile RNA-binding surfaces and have been classified into type A and B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fierro-Monti and Mathews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Johnston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Masliah et al., 2012</xref>). Type A dsRBDs are highly homologous (&gt; 59%) to the consensus sequence and are involved in RNA-binding, whereas type B has only conserved C-terminal end and helps in stabilizing the protein-RNA/protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Green et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Laraki et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>dsRBDs, both within and across proteins, exhibit significant variations in their binding modes and affinities towards specific RNA targets. For example, <italic>X. laevis</italic> RNA-binding protein A (XlrbpA) has 3 dsRBDs: xl1 (type A), xl2 (type A), and xl3 (type B), where the xl2 is only able to bind the dsRNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>). In Protein Kinase R (PKR), these two types of dsRBDs also demonstrate a differential dynamic behavior, i.e., dsRBD1 (type A) shows plasticity on µs and ps-ns timescale, while dsRBD2 (type B) predominantly depicts dynamics on the ps-ns timescale dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fierro-Monti and Mathews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the average order parameter (S<sup>2</sup>) for the individual α-helices and β-sheets is observed to be lower for dsRBD1 than for dsRBD2, suggesting the latter as a more rigid domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fierro-Monti and Mathews, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>). TRBP harbours two type A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Krovat and Jantsch, 1996</xref>) dsRBDs, i.e., dsRBD1 and dsRBD2, where the latter shows a significantly stronger binding affinity (four times) for pre-miR-155 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benoit et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, studies have reported that dsRBD2 of TRBP displays a higher binding affinity for siRNA and HIV trans-activation response (TAR) RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Daviet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>). It is intriguing to notice that the two type-A dsRBDs originating from the same protein demonstrate a markedly different binding affinity for target RNAs across various cases, as elucidated above. Recent investigations have suggested that the dissimilar behavior of dsRBDs in Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wostenberg et al., 2012</xref>), PKR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>), and double-stranded-RNA-binding protein 4 (DRB4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiliveri et al., 2017</xref>) might be attributed to protein dynamics. Although variations in the binding affinity for the two type-A dsRBDs of TRBP have been documented for several target RNAs, a comprehensive exploration of the differences in the conformational dynamics between these two domains remains to be undertaken.</p>
<p>In this study, we have investigated the role of differential conformational dynamics of the two type A dsRBD domains of TRBP2 (isoform 1 of TRBP) in RNA recognition and binding. First discovered as a TAR RNA-binding protein (39 kDa) involved in HIV-I replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gatignol et al., 1991</xref>), TRBP was later found to be indispensable to the RNAi pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). It is involved in Dicer-mediated pre-miRNA/pre-siRNA cleavage and recruitment of Argonaute protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chendrimada et al., 2005</xref>). Being a part of the RNA-induced silencing (RISC) complex, TRBP helps in the guide strand selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Noland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Noland and Doudna, 2013</xref>). The guide strand of the mature miRNA directly interacts with the target mRNA to regulate its expression, while the passenger strand is cleaved off by the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Leuschner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Matranga et al., 2005</xref>). TRBP and its homologs across different species such as Loquacious (Loqs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), R2D2 (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>), DRB1-3,5 (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>), RNAi defective 4 (RDE-4 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>), Xlrbpa (<italic>X. laevis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eckmann and Jantsch, 1997</xref>), and the PKR activator (PACT) protein (mammals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Peters et al., 2001</xref>) have conserved arrangement of three consecutive dsRBDs; of which, the two N-terminal domains (type A) are known to bind dsRNAs, whereas the third domain is known for protein-protein interactions. We have recently established the role of TRBP2-dsRBD1 dynamics in dsRBD-dsRNA interactions and proposed that dsRBD1 adopts a conformationally dynamic structure to recognize a set of topologically different dsRNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). The µs timescale motions were found to be present all along the dsRBD1 backbone with higher frequency motions (<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50 kHz) in the RNA-binding sites. The data suggested that the presence of conformational exchange in the µs timescale could help the dsRBD1 to dynamically tune itself for targeting conformationally distinct dsRNA substrates.</p>
<p>In this work, we have compared TRBP2-dsRBD1 with TRBP2-dsRBD2 in terms of the structure, dynamics (intrinsic and RNA-induced), and dsRBD-dsRNA interactions in the two type-A domains. We have measured motions in the TRBP2-dsRBD2 at ps-ns and µs-ms timescale dynamics by NMR relaxation dispersion experiments in apo-state and studied its perturbation in the presence of an A-form duplex RNA. We also compared the apo- and RNA-bound conformational dynamics measured in dsRBD2 with that of dsRBD1. Based on our observations, we propose that the differential protein dynamics and its perturbation in the presence of RNA in the two dsRBDs enables them to recognize a variety of RNA substrates and may lead to diffusion along the length of the RNA.</p>

<title>Structural and dynamical comparison of apo TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP2-dsRBD2</title>
<p>Primary sequence comparison of TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP2-dsRBD2 domain constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) revealed 30% identity and 38% similarity. The consensus for dsRNA-binding has been marked in red in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>. The two reported RNA-binding regions 1 (E) and 3 (KKxAK) of both the domains were matched to the consensus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). While RNA-binding region 2 (GPxH) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Region 2) of TRBP2-dsRBD2 was an exact match to the consensus, dsRBD1 harbored a mutation in region 2 (P56Q). Proline is a rigid amino acid with one less dihedral angle; it imparts flexibility to the backbone by causing secondary structure breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Imai and Mitaku, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Krieger et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the presence of conserved Pro186 in the β<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>2</sub> loop of dsRBD2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Region 2) may perturb the β<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>2</sub> loop region plasticity, thereby making it more accessible to the incoming RNA partner. Additionally, dsRBD2 contains a KR-helix motif in the α<sub>2</sub>-helix (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, Region 3) known to increase its binding affinity, as reported earlier by Daviet <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Daviet et al., 2000</xref>). Owing to these tightly conserved RNA-binding regions and the presence of additional KR-helix motif, dsRBD2 could make stronger contact with RNA.</p>
<p>The SEC-MALS study of TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the experimental conditions used showed a single monomeric species in solution (Figure S2). The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum (Figure S3) of TRBP2-dsRBD2 indicated a well-folded protein. It (154–234 aa) was compared to the previously assigned spectrum of the TRBP2-D1D2 construct (19–228 aa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benoit and Plevin, 2012</xref>) to transfer the backbone amide resonance assignments. Resonance assignments were further confirmed using a set of double and triple resonance experiments, and a total of 73 non-proline residues were assigned as shown in the representative <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC (Figure S3). Overall, 89% <sup>1</sup>H (151/169), 74% <sup>13</sup>C (124/168), and 87% <sup>15</sup>N (73/84) resonances from the backbone, and 43% <sup>1</sup>H (174/402) and 25% <sup>13</sup>C (59/238) from the side chains were assigned. Similar to the CS-Rosetta structure calculated previously for dsRBD1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paithankar et al., 2018</xref>), the CS-Rosetta structure calculated for the dsRBD2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>) matched well with the previously reported structures in terms of characteristic dsRBD fold. The core residues of dsRBD2 were found to adapt the characteristic dsRBD αβββα fold with an RMSD of 1.284 Å when compared to the previously reported solution structure of dsRBD2 (2CPN; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>)). An alignment of core structures between dsRDB1 and dsRBD2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>) yielded an RMSD of 0.894 Å, indicating a close match between the two domains. Despite their core length being identical (69 aa), the individual secondary structure spans were found to be different, as listed in Supplementary Table 3. The flexible regions, like loops 1 and 2 depicted in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>, are longer in dsRBD2, whereas the structured regions β<sub>2</sub>, β<sub>3</sub>, and α<sub>2</sub> are longer in dsRBD1. Most importantly, loop 2 (β<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>2</sub> loop) — critical for RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Masliah et al., 2012</xref>)— is equal to the canonical length in dsRBD2, while in dsRBD1, it is shorter by 1 residue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>The MD simulation data of RMSD against the simulation time of TRBP2-dsRBD2 showed that the protein remained stable during the course of triplicate simulations, as seen previously in the case of dsRBD1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Comparing the core residue-specific RMSF plots of these two type A dsRBD domains (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), we observe that the average RMSF of the core domain of dsRBD2 is 0.22 nm, which is almost half as compared to dsRBD1 RMSF average of 0.43. This, in turn, indicates that dsRBD2 is overall more rigid among the two. The most interesting fact is that loop 2 (shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) of dsRBD2 is very flexible compared to the rest of the core, with an average RMSF of 0.49 nm (more than double the core average), as depicted in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>. Hence, we propose that this long, conserved, and dynamic loop 2 might help dsRBD2 to establish strong contacts in the minor grooves of dsRNA partners. An effect of conserved insertions in the β<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>2</sub> loop on RNA binding has been previously discussed in the crystal structure of full-length <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> HEN1 in complex with a small RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Huang et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<p>To gain insights into the picosecond to nanosecond (ps-ns) timescale motions of apo-dsRBD2, NMR spin relaxation data (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, and [<sup>1</sup>H]-<sup>15</sup>N NOE) was recorded on 600 and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers. The set of plots for <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>, and [<sup>1</sup>H]-<sup>15</sup>N NOE at both 600 and 800 MHz magnetic fields showed the expected trend (Figure S4). <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> in the structured residues showed lower values at a higher magnetic field and similar values in the terminal regions at the two magnetic fields (Figure S4A). The increase of core <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> rates (decreasing <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub>) with increasing magnetic field indicates that most of the core residues lie on the right-hand side of the <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> minima in the standard plot of <italic>T</italic><sub>1</sub> vs. ω<italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>, where ω is the frequency of motions, <italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub> and is rotational correlation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bloembergen et al., 1948</xref>). The core residues had average <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> rates of 1.44 ± 0.05 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates (Figure S4B) of a few N-terminal (S156, N159) and core residues (V180, M194, R197, V198, G207, and A217) marginally increased (0.7–3 s<sup>-1</sup>) when measured at 800 MHz than when measured at 600 MHz, suggesting a very insignificant presence of the <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> component in the linewidth of these residues in the experimental conditions. The terminal (N159, T227) and the loop residues (G185, E191, F200, K210) exhibited relative flexibility as indicated by lower <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and nOe values in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>. A few residues lying in different secondary structures have been shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>, for e.g.: Q165, L167, and V168 in α<sub>1</sub>; T193 and T195 in β<sub>2</sub>; L212, A213, N216, and L223 in α<sub>2</sub> exhibited only slightly higher (&gt; 1 s<sup>-1</sup>) than the average <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rate (11.02 ± 0.39 s<sup>-1</sup>), indicating a thin conformational exchange in the secondary structured regions.</p>
<p>The average <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> (dsRBD1 = 1.52 ± 0.03 s<sup>-1</sup>; dsRBD2 = 1.44 ± 0.05 s<sup>-1</sup>) and <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates (dsRBD1 = 9.83 ± 0.17 s<sup>-1</sup>; dsRBD2 = 11.02 ± 0.39 s<sup>-1</sup>) for the two domains were very similar (Figure S15 of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>)). In contrast, dsRBD1 (Figure S15C of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>)) had significantly lower average heteronuclear steady-state nOe values (0.63 ± 0.02) than dsRBD2 (0.75 ± 0.03) shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>, indicating a more rigid core at the picosecond timescale motions in dsRBD2, thereby supporting the earlier observations made in the MD simulation study.</p>
<p>The extended model-free analysis of the relaxation data for the two core domains allowed us to compare the order parameters S<sup>2</sup>, <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> components, and global tumbling time (<italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>). The overall order parameters for dsRBD1 followed the expected trend of higher values in the secondary structured regions and lower values in the terminals and loops (Figure S5 top panel). Interestingly, the secondary structural motifs α<sub>1</sub>, loop 2, and α<sub>2</sub> (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">D</xref>), containing RNA-binding regions of dsRBD2, showed a higher rigidity than dsRBD1. The presence of conserved Pro in loop 2 (L2) of dsRBD2 and a longer length of L2 in dsRBD2 might be responsible for the additional observed flexibility in dsRBD2, as also observed in the MD simulations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and Table S3). Loop 1 (W173, L175) of dsRBD2 containing the stabilizing tryptophan (absent in dsRBD1) also showed higher rigidity than dsRDB1, corroborated by the low RMSF values for residues in this region from the MD simulation study. The global rotational correlation time (<italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>) of dsRBD2 was 6.90 ns, and that of dsRBD1 was 7.64 ns, suggesting a more compact structure of dsRBD2 than dsRBD1. This result corroborates the CD-based determination of the melting point of the two constructs. While TRBP2-dsRDB2 exhibited a higher T<sub>m</sub> (55°C), TRBP2-dsRBD1 melted at 45°C (data not shown), thus suggesting a stronger network of interactions in TRBP2-dsRDB2 (Yamashita <sup>e</sup>t al., 201<sup>1</sup>). Indeed, it has been shown previously that the tryptophan (W173) present in the α<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>1</sub> of dsRBD2 (W is absent in dsRBD1 at this position) induced local hydrophobic and cation-π interactions with K171, E199, R200, F201, and V225, thereby enhancing the overall thermal stability of dsRBD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Only 4 residues of dsRBD2 could fit into a model-free model containing the exchange term (<italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub>) as opposed to 11 residues in dsRBD1, suggesting that there is significantly lower conformational flexibility at the μs-ms timescale in dsRBD2 shown in Figure S5 bottom panel. While dsRBD2 depicted a low frequency (&lt; 2 s<sup>-1</sup>) contribution to the line width of resonances in the RNA-binding regions (E166, N216, A219, and L223), dsRBD1 had a larger contribution (2–8 s<sup>-1</sup>) to the line width of resonances present all along the backbone (Figure S5 bottom panel). In summation, the plasticity at the ps-ns timescale is present in both the dsRBDs of TRBP, while the amplitude of motions is found to be largely restricted for the dsRBD2.</p>
<p>Similar to dsRBD1, dsRBD2 does not exhibit motions at a slower ms timescale as probed by the CPMG relaxation dispersion experiments shown in Figure S6. No dispersion was observed in the <italic>R</italic><sub>2eff</sub> rates with increasing ν<sub>CPMG</sub>, suggesting the absence of motions sensitive to this experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The heteronuclear adiabatic relaxation dispersion (HARD) NMR experiment was used to study NMR spin relaxation in a rotating frame. The dispersion in relaxation rates is created by changing the shape of a hyperbolic secant (HSn, where n = stretching factor) adiabatic pulse that is used to create the spin-lock. HARD experiments are sensitive to the conformational exchange processes occurring on the 10 μs–10 ms timescales. The <italic>R<sub>1ρ</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>2ρ</sub></italic> relaxation rates showed that with the increase in applied spin-lock field strength from HS1 to HS8, the <italic>R<sub>1ρ</sub></italic> rates increased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> &amp; C) and the <italic>R<sub>2ρ</sub></italic> rates decreased (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">D</xref>) for both dsRBD1 and dsRBD2. The extent of dispersion was much less in the core residues of dsRBD2, indicating the absence of higher conformational dynamics in the dsRBD2. The <italic>R<sub>1ρ</sub></italic> and <italic>R<sub>2ρ</sub></italic> rates were then fit to Bloch-McConnell equations by using the geometric approximation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chao and Byrd, 2016</xref>) to extract the rate of exchange (<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>) and the excited state population (<italic>p</italic><sub>B</sub>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4A</xref>). The number of residues with <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 5,000 Hz and &gt; 10% <italic>p</italic><sub>B</sub> (red and green, medium and big spheres) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>) differed vastly between the two domains. Only 3 residues with such conformational exchange in dsRBD2 were identified: R200 (loop 3), L212 and R224 (α<sub>2</sub>); whereas in dsRBD1, the number is 15, distributed along the entire backbone of the protein (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>)), similar to PKR-dsRBD1, where 75% of the residues from dsRBM1 showed <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 1 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Nanduri et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, all three conserved RNA-binding regions in dsRBD1: α<sub>1</sub> (L35, Q36), β<sub>1</sub>-β<sub>2</sub> loop (E54), and α<sub>2</sub> (N61) were brimming with a <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50,000 Hz. To sum it up, most of the dsRBD2 core showed slow conformational exchange (<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &lt; 5000 Hz), depicted in blue small spheres, while the dsRBD1 domain was undergoing significantly faster conformational exchange (<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 5000 Hz). Taken together, the intrinsic <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> profile of TRBP2-dsRBD1 and TRBP-dsRBD2 revealed the presence of 10 μs–10 ms timescale conformational dynamics distributed throughout the core dsRBD rather than being localized in the RNA binding regions; however, the amplitude of motions was found significantly smaller in dsRBD2.</p>

<title>dsRBD2 has a higher affinity for a short double-stranded A-form RNA duplex</title>
<p>Target RNA sequences were designed based on the fact that TRBP interacts with miR-16-1 duplex (miRbase accession no. MI0000070) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). Three mutants of miR-16-1 were created to perturb the RNA shapes as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, wt miR-16 (22–23 bp) has a bulge (unpaired uridine) and an internal loop (A:A mismatch), miR-16-1-M has only A:A mismatch, (ii) miR-16-1-B has only U-bulge, and (iii) miR-16-1-D has neither the bulge nor internal loop forming a perfect duplex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>)). It has been established that the TRBP2-dsRBD1 is able to recognize a set of topologically different dsRNA structures owing to its high conformational plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). In the current study, we have characterized the interaction of TRBP2-dsRBD2 with the same set of topologically different dsRNAs (wt miR-16-1 and mutants) used for TRBP2-dsRBD1 through <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-based NMR titrations shown in Figure S7. The NMR investigation regarding the interaction of TRBP-dsRBD2 with the wt miR-16-1 and the three mutant dsRNAs revealed only chemical shift perturbations (&lt; 0.1 ppm) in the presence of four topologically different RNAs as shown in Figure S7. This indicated that the tertiary structure/fold of the protein remained unperturbed upon RNA binding. The fact that the structure remains unperturbed is consistent with the previous findings reported by Yamashita et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>), where the authors compared the solution structure of TRBP-dsRBD2 structure with the crystal structure of GC10RNA-bound TRBP-dsRBD2 (PDB ID: 3ADL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) and concluded that the structure of the dsRBD remains unperturbed upon RNA-binding. However, TRBP-dsRBD2, in some cases, has shown the presence of chemical shift perturbation &lt;1.0 ppm at the three RNA-binding regions upon binding with RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Benoit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Masliah et al., 2018</xref>), indicating subtle conformational changes at the RNA-binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Yamashita et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, there were two intriguing observations in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC-based titrations. First, the amide signals were getting broadened at as low as 0.1 RNA equivalents, suggesting the slow-to-intermediate timescale of binding as has also been observed previously by our and other research groups in TRBP2 dsRBD1, Staufen dsRBD3, hDus2 dsRBD, MLE dsRBD2, DBR4 dsRBD1, PKR dsRBD, and Dicer dsRBD (Ankush Jagtap et al., 2019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bou-Nader et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiliveri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Ramos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Ucci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Wostenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yadav et al., 2019</xref>). Second, not only the reported RNA-binding residues but the entire backbone was undergoing line broadening, suggesting the presence of RNA-induced motions in the entire backbone. Since the protein is not saturated with the RNAs at 0.1 RNA equivalents (considering a reported K<sub>d</sub> = 1.7 μM for a 22 bp dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Acevedo et al., 2015</xref>), [protein] = 50 μM, [RNA] = 5 μM, fraction bound of protein &lt; 10%) we can rule out an increase in the size due to the formation of a stable protein-RNA complex causing line-broadening. Upon excess addition of RNA (to 1 equivalents of miR-16-1-M), the backbone amide signals were not recovered (Figure S7 top left panel), indicating the RNA-protein interaction does not seem to come out of the local minima of slow-to-intermediate exchange regime.</p>
<p>The amide NMR signals were, however, partially recovered by shortening the length of the RNA duplex to 12 bp D12 RNA. The line broadening was delayed till 0.35 equivalents of D12 RNA as compared to 0.1 equivalents for the longer RNAs (Figure S8). The excessive line broadening all along the backbone and recovery of the same by reducing the length of the RNA hints towards the presence of the phenomenon of protein diffusing over the length of the RNA, as has been reported by Koh <italic>et. al.</italic> earlier using smFRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koh et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, the phenomenon of diffusion along the length of RNA has been hinted at in other dsRBPs like Loqs-PD dsRBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Tants et al., 2017</xref>), MLE dsRBD (Ankush Jagtap et al., 2019), DRB4 dsRBD1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chiliveri et al., 2017</xref>), and RDE4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chiliveri and Deshmukh, 2014</xref>). To extract the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) for the D12-TRBP-dsRBD2 interaction, residue-wise peak intensities were plotted against the RNA concentration and tried to fit to the binding isotherm for one-site binding (Figure S9). Due to extensive line broadening, there was a lack of data at the inflection point, affecting the data fitting. Hence, the fitted parameters had large errors and remained inconclusive and thus are not reported here.</p>
<p>The ITC-based study was performed with D12 duplex RNA to get the equilibrium dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>) of the two N-terminal dsRBDs, change in enthalpy upon RNA binding (ΔH), and stoichiometry (n) (Table S2). Our studies showed that TRBP2-dsRBD2 binds to D12 RNA with an average K<sub>d</sub> of 1.18 ± 0.32 μM (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>), while TRBP2-dsRBD1 did not show any significant heat exchange (weak binding) during the titration and the TRBP2-dsRBD1 data could not be fit to any binding model (K<sub>d</sub> has large errors in this data) as depicted in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C</xref>. The differential potential against the time plot indicates that RNA got saturated with TRBP2-dsRBD2 as early as the eighth injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). The integrated change in injection enthalpy (ΔH) versus the molar ratio of the reactants yielded an average ΔH of –10.12 ± 0.43 kcal/mol, suggesting an enthalpy-driven binding event. ITC study was repeated for TRBP2-dsRBD1 with as high as 22 folds excess of protein, but RNA remained unsaturated. These results strongly suggest that TRBP2-dsRBD2 binds more efficiently to a small perfect A-form duplex, D12 RNA, than TRBP2-dsRBD1.</p>

<title>Dynamics perturbations of TRBP2-dsRBD2 at various timescales in the presence of RNA ligand</title>
<p>Minute structural changes in TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the presence of RNA necessitated a deeper insight into the perturbations of conformational dynamics at multiple timescales. Backbone <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N dynamics measurements on TRBP2-dsRBD2 were carried out in the limiting concentration of short duplex D12RNA as an increase in the RNA length and an increase in the RNA concentration, both caused line-broadening impacting dynamics measurements. In the presence of D12 RNA, the average <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> rates (apo = 1.44 ± 0.05 s<sup>-1</sup>; bound = 1.37 ± 0.07 s<sup>-1</sup>) and nOe values (apo = 0.75 ± 0.029; bound = 0.72 ± 0.076) remained unperturbed, while there was a significant increase in the average <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates (apo = 11.02 ± 0.39 s<sup>-1</sup>; bound = 20.04 ± 0.11 s<sup>-1</sup>) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The apparent increase in the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates (= <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>* + <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub>) hinted towards a perturbation in the μs-ms timescale dynamics, to which only <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates are sensitive. This phenomenon could be attributed to either an increase in intrinsic <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>* resulting from an increase in the residence time of the RNA on the protein, or an increase in the <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> component caused by a chemical exchange between apo- and D12-bound state, or RNA-induced conformational exchange in the protein. Interestingly, such a perturbation in <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates was not found for the dsRBD1 upon RNA-binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). The terminals (N159, Q154, Q155, S156, E157, V225, V228, L230, A232), a few residues in the vicinity of loop regions (E177, E183, G185, E191, S209) harbored a lower than average bound-state <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates than the rest of the core indicating a faster motion induced in these residues. On adding RNA, the <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates and nOe values of the N- and C-terminal residues (S156, E157, T227, V228, L230, A232), β1 (E177), the loop 2 region (E183, G185, 189, E191), and the loop 4 region (S209) decreased, indicating further enhanced flexibility.</p>
<p>The extended model-free analysis of apo and RNA-bound TRBP2-dsRBD2 suggested that the anisotropic (ellipsoid) diffusion model was the best fit for the global motion of them both. The global rotational correlation time (<italic>τ</italic><sub>c</sub>) of core TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the presence of RNA was 10.9 ns as against 6.90 for the apo-dsRBD2 core, indicating an apparent increase in molecular weight. The overall higher S<sup>2</sup> values for TRBP2-dsRBD2 indicated a rigidification of the backbone amide vectors in the presence of D12 RNA (Figure S10). A few residues in the α<sub>1</sub> (E166) and α<sub>2</sub> (N216, A219, L223) regions exhibited a <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> component &gt; 1 s<sup>-1</sup>, lying in the vicinity of the reported RNA-binding regions 1 and 3. The number of residues with a significant (&gt; 2 s<sup>-1</sup>) <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> — implying the presence of μs-ms timescale motions — increased in the case of bound-state. <italic>R<sub>ex</sub></italic> was found to be induced in the α<sub>1</sub> (V168), β<sub>1</sub> (Y178), β<sub>2</sub> (T195), β<sub>3</sub> (I204), and α<sub>2</sub> (N216, L223) region, thereby indicating that not only the RNA-binding residues but the rest of the core might play a role while interacting with dsRNA substrates. The presence of <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> at multiple sites (in addition to RNA-binding regions) rules out the chemical exchange between apo- and D12-bound state contributing to <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub>, thereby implying a presence of RNA-induced conformational exchange is the predominant contributor to <italic>R</italic><sub>ex</sub> and to increased line broadening (or apparent <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> rates, discussed in the NMR-based titration paragraph).</p>
<p>The effective transverse relaxation rates, <italic>R</italic><sub>2eff</sub>, for TRBP2-dsRBD2, were plotted against the CPMG frequencies (ν<sub>CPMG</sub>) in the presence of D12 RNA (Figure S11). None of the residues in either condition showed effective dispersion in the <italic>R</italic><sub>2eff</sub> rates with the increase in ν<sub>CPMG</sub>, suggesting motions in the timescale sensitive to this experiment remain absent in D12RNA-bound TRBP2-dsRBD2.</p>
<p>Most importantly, HARD NMR experiments recorded for TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the presence of D12-RNA showed fascinating results (Figure S12 and 4). In the presence of RNA, there was massive induction of 10 μs–10 ms timescale conformational dynamics as reflected by the increase in the number of residues having significant <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>. The extent of enhancement in <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> varied along the backbone of the core protein. For instance, a <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> of 5000–50,000 kHz with 10–20% <italic>p</italic><sub>B</sub> (green spheres) was observed in α<sub>1</sub> (G162, L167), loop3 (R200), and α<sub>2</sub> (A213, A219) and 20–40% <italic>p</italic><sub>B</sub> in α<sub>1</sub> (V168), and β<sub>3</sub> (E203), depicted by the medium and big green spheres respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). The residues V198 in loop 3 and M221 in the α<sub>2</sub> region exhibited the presence of the highest frequency of motion with a <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50,000 Hz. Intriguingly, among these residues, L167, V168 (α<sub>1</sub>), and A213 (α<sub>2</sub>) lie in the reported RNA-binding regions 1 and 3, respectively. L167 and V168 are adjacent to the key RNA binding residue E165 (region 1), which interacts directly with the RNA minor groove. A213 precedes the important KR-helix motif in the α<sub>2</sub> region of dsRBD2. The K214 and R215 residues make ionic interactions with the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the RNA major groove. The interaction between the RNA and the RNA-binding residues of the protein might induce conformational exchange within the nearby residues like in the case of G162 (region 1), A219 and M221 (region 2). Additionally, residues like R197 (β<sub>2</sub>); V198 and R200 (L3); E203 and G207 (β<sub>3</sub>) are further from RNA binding regions with <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 5000 Hz. Thus, the ligand affected not only the RNA-binding residues but the entire protein.</p>
<p>Notable perturbations in terms of Δ<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> (<italic>k</italic><sub>bound</sub> – <italic>k</italic><sub>apo</sub>) &gt; 10,000 Hz were mapped on the structure of the protein (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>). There was an enhancement of <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> in the residues lying in α<sub>1</sub> (G162, L167), loop 3 (V198), β<sub>3</sub> (E203 and G207), and α<sub>2</sub> (A213, A219) region. Concomitantly, suppression of exchange was observed in β<sub>1</sub> (V180), loop 3 (R200), and α<sub>2</sub> (L212, R224) regions. A tantalizing relay of exchange was seen between two residue pairs in close spatial proximity. For instance, exchange was induced in V198 and quenched in R200 in the loop 3 region. Similarly, in the case of A213 and L212 falling in the N-terminal RNA-binding region 3, and A219 and R224 lying in the C-terminal of α<sub>2</sub>, the former of the pairs underwent an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> while the latter observed a decrease. Thus, the enhancement of RNA-induced conformational exchange was accommodated by allosteric quenching of the same. Altogether, there was a significant induction of 10 μs–10 ms timescale motions over the entire backbone of TRBP2-dsRBD2 in the presence of RNA. This induction of motions could be ascribed to either an exchange between the apo- and RNA-bound state of the protein, conformational dynamics in the RNA-bound state of the protein, or the previously reported diffusion motion of the protein on the dsRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Koh et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in TRBP2-dsRBD2, the extent of dynamics perturbation, in terms of Δ<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>, was significantly lower (10–50 kHz) than TRBP-dsRBD1 where at least 10 residues underwent a Δ<italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub> &gt; 50 kHz in the presence of small dsRNA. Moreover, a relay of exchange was evident only in loop 3 and α<sub>2</sub> regions of dsRBD2 and not in α<sub>1</sub> region, which was observed earlier in dsRBD1. Summing up, in the presence of RNA, dsRBD2 undergoes enhanced conformational exchange in the 10 μs– 10 ms timescale. When compared to dsRBD1, dsRBD2 samples limited conformational space both in the absence and presence of D12-RNA.</p>

<p>Thus, our study has led us to propose a model involving two tandem type A dsRBDs in TRBP2. According to our model, these dsRBDs work synergistically to recognize, bind, and assist associated proteins (like Dicer) in processing the incoming dsRNA ligand (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref>). The first dsRBD, TRBP2-dsRBD1, has remarkable flexibility, which allows it to recognize a wide range of structurally and sequentially diverse dsRNAs. On the other hand, TRBP2-dsRBD2 firmly adheres to the RNA ligand due to its conserved RNA-binding stretches and relatively high rigidity. During their interaction with the RNA, both dsRBDs experience enhanced conformational changes on a fast timescale (picoseconds to nanoseconds) and a moderate timescale (microseconds to milliseconds), as observed through nuclear spin relaxation and rotating frame relaxation dispersion measurements. These dynamic changes likely enable the dsRBDs to diffuse along the length of the RNA, which explains the broadening of the signals observed during titration with longer RNAs. This diffusion movement is likely crucial for other associated proteins, such as Dicer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fareh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lee and Doudna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>), to carry out precise microRNA biogenesis. By understanding these processes, we can gain insights into the intricate mechanisms involved in RNA processing, which has implications for different biological processes.</p>

<caption><p>The model proposed for the two type-A dsRBDs in TRBP2 protein. dsRBD2 with rigid and conserved RNA binding regions is able to bind the RNA tightly, whereas dsRBD1 with high conformational exchange is able to recognize different RNA structures (often with bulges and internal loops). Following this, the two dsRBDs upon contacting the RNA undergoes enhanced conformational exchange at different extent. This enhanced conformational exchange coupled with differential binding affinity towards dsRNA might enable the tandem dsRBDs to move along the backbone of the RNA molecule, leading to ATP-independent diffusion.</p></caption>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It has been long established that despite engaging with a wide array of dsRNA molecules exhibiting diverse structures and sequences, dsRBDs remain unaffected in their own structural conformation. However, the more significant question that has persisted is whether protein dynamics itself plays a crucial role in these intriguing interactions. Though variability in the binding affinity for the two type-A dsRBDs of TRBP has been reported, the specific contribution of conformational dynamics has remained unexplored until now. In the present investigation, we have exclusively delved into the role of conformational dynamics of the two type-A dsRBDs of TRBP2 in RNA recognition and binding. Our findings have unveiled that TRBP2-dsRBD2 samples a limiting conformational space in solution, and it is dsRBD1 that recognizes sequentially and structurally diverse RNA substrates through its high conformational plasticity. While dsRBD1 explores and engages dsRNA via its dynamically interactive RNA-binding surface, dsRBD2 holds the RNA in position via stronger canonical contacts. Once bound to the RNA, the ensuing conformational exchange in both dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 might facilitate the domains to diffuse over the length of the RNA freely, thus playing a pivotal role in assisting Dicer-mediated differential cleavage of RNA. Thus, this study not only adds valuable insights into the mechanics of RNA-protein interactions but also underscores the significance of conformational dynamics in dictating the functional outcome in such intricate biological processes.</p>
<p>Exploring the intricacies of RNA-protein interactions by delving into dynamics-based measurements across diverse RNA shapes within small RNA duplexes could offer invaluable insights into the differential recognition and binding by dsRBD1 and dsRBD2. The experimental challenge lies in the meticulous design of RNA sequences that maintain duplex stability amid the presence of bulges and internal loops of varying lengths and sequences. The task is further complicated by managing RNA length judiciously, as longer sequences can introduce line-broadening in NMR spectroscopy. Navigating these complexities in the future promises to unravel the subtleties of the RNA-protein interactions at a molecule level.</p>

<title>Protein overexpression and purification</title>
<p>The TRBP2-dsRBD1 (1–105 aa) and TRBP2-dsRBD2 (154–234 aa) cDNA clones were obtained as a kind gift from N. L. Prof. Jennifer Doudna (University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA). The residue numbers in the two constructs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) have been mentioned in reference to the full-length TRBP2 sequence (1–366 aa, Uniprot ID: Q15633-1). The cDNA for TRBP2-dsRBD2 was cloned in pHMGWA vector (Amp<sup>R</sup>), and was expressed as a fusion protein having N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-Maltose binding protein (MBP) tag-TEV protease cleavage site followed by the protein of interest. Treatment with TEV protease during purification resulted in non-native Ser-Asn-Ala residues at the N-terminal to TRBP2-dsRBD2 (154–234), which were excluded from all the NMR-based dynamics studies. For the NMR experiments, <sup>15</sup>N-labeled and <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C labeled (as required) TRBP2-dsRBD2 protein was prepared using <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) as a sole source of nitrogen and carbon, respectively, in M9 minimal medium.</p>
<p>TRBP2-dsRBD1 was overexpressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Paithankar et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the pHMGWA plasmid containing the cDNA for the TRBP2-dsRBD2 was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells, and plated on an LB agar plate (containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin) and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. A single isolated colony was inoculated into 20 mL LB broth (containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin) and incubated for 12 h at 37 °C, 225 rpm to initiate a starter culture that was eventually used to inoculate 2 L LB broth (containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin) and incubated at 37 °C, 225 rpm till the OD<sub>600</sub> reached to 0.8–1.0. For induction, IPTG was added at the final concentration of 1 mM, and the culture was further incubated at 37 °C, 225 rpm for another 8 h. The cells were harvested by centrifuging the culture at 4500 <italic>g</italic>, 4 °C for 20 min and resuspended in 25 mL of buffer A (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM imidazole). To the resuspended cells, lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/mL and incubated in ice for 30 min. Post-incubation, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μl of 1 mM PMSF, and 10 X Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PIC, Roche) (2 mL per 4 g of cell pellet) were added to the cell suspension. The partially lysed cells were sonicated using an ultrasonic sonicator microprobe at 60% amplitude, with 5 s ON and 10 s OFF pulse, for a period of 60 min in an ice bath for complete lysis. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 2 h, at 4°C, to obtain the total soluble protein (TSP). The TSP was then circulated through a pre-equilibrated (buffer A) Ni-NTA column (HisTrap, 5 ml, GE HealthCare) for 4 h at 4 °C. After equilibrating with the TSP, the column was washed with 40 CVs of buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole to remove the impurities. The fusion protein was eluted with the elution buffer B (buffer A containing 300 mM imidazole). Nucleic acids were removed from the eluted protein using polyethyleneimine (PEI) precipitation. To remove imidazole, the protein solution was dialyzed against cleavage buffer C (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 25 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mM DTT). His<sub>6</sub>-MBP-tag was cleaved using TEV protease at a final concentration of 1:100 (protease: protein) at 4 °C for 18 h with intermittent mixing. The completion of the cleavage reaction was tested and confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. The cleavage mix was then passed through a sulphopropyl sepharose column (HiPrep SP FF 16/10 20ml, GE HealthCare) and washed with buffer C. TRBP2-dsRBD2 protein was eluted from the cation-exchange column using a salt gradient ranging from 25 mM to 1 M NaCl in the buffer C. To further purify, the protein was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using sephacryl S-100 HR 16/60 column (GE HealthCare). The final purified protein was concentrated to 1 mM using Amicon (3 kDa cutoff, Merck) and exchanged with NMR buffer D (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) before recording any experiment.</p>

<p>All the ensemble cluster analysis was done using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) on the CS-Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Lange et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Shen et al., 2010</xref>) structure of TRBP2-dsRBD2 to select the lowest energy structures. CS-Rosetta structure was used since the previously reported structure (PDB ID: 2CPN) did not have the extended C-terminal sequence used in this study (2CPN has an amino acid length of 150-225, while the construct used in this study is from 154-234). Moreover, the buffer conditions of previously reported structures differed from what is used in this study. The lowest energy structures in the ensemble were used as the seed structure for apo TRBP2-dsRBD2 molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Briefly, GROMACS V.2019.6 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gromacs.org">https://www.gromacs.org</ext-link>) was used for all the atomistic MD simulations. All-atom additive CHARMM36 protein force field was used to build the topologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Huang et al., 2017</xref>), and initial structure solvation was done TIP3P water molecules in a cubic simulation box with a minimum distance of 1.2 nm from protein in all directions. Microsecond timescale simulations (1 μs) were set up in triplicates in a similar way as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Paithankar et al., 2022</xref>). All analysis was performed using GROMACS and VMD.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the manuscript entitled &quot;Differential conformational dynamics in two type-A RNA-binding domains drive the double-stranded RNA recognition and binding,&quot; Chugh and co-workers utilize a suite of NMR relaxation methods to probe the dynamic landscape of the TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) double-stranded RNA-binding domain 2 (dsRBD2) and compare these to their previously published results on TRBP dsRBD1. The authors show that, unlike dsRBD1, dsRBD2 is a rigid protein with minimal ps-ns or us-ms time scale dynamics in the absence of RNA. They then show that dsRBD2 binds to canonical A-form dsRNA with a higher affinity compared to dsRBD1 and does so without much alteration in protein dynamics. Using their previously published data, the authors propose a model whereby dsRBD2 recognizes dsRNA first and brings dsRBD1 into proximity to search for RNA bulge and internal loop structures.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors expertly use a variety of NMR techniques to probe protein motions over six orders of magnitude in time. Other NMR titration experiments and ITC data support the RNA-binding model.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The data collection and analysis are sound. The only weakness in the manuscript is the lack of context with the much broader field of RNA-binding proteins. For example, many studies have shown that RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains have similar dynamic characteristics when binding diverse RNA substrates. Furthermore, there was no discussion about the entropy of binding derived from ITC. It might be interesting to compare with dynamics from NMR.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA regulate various cellular processes, including gene expression and viral recognition. Such proteins often contain multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) that play an important role in target search and recognition. In this work, Chug and colleagues have characterized the backbone dynamics of one of the dsRBDs of a protein called TRBP2, which carries two tandem dsRBDs. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, the authors characterize the backbone motions of dsRBD2 in the absence and presence of dsRNA and compare these with their previously published results on dsRBD1. The authors show that dsRBD2 is comparatively more rigid than dsRBD1 and claim that these differences in backbone motions are important for target recognition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strengths of this study are multiple solution NMR measurements to characterize the backbone motions of dsRBD2. These include 15N-R1, R2, and HetNOE experiments in the absence and presence of RNA and the analysis of these data using an extended-model-free approach; HARD-15N-experiments and their analysis to characterize the kex. The authors also report differences in binding affinities of dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 using ITC and have performed MD simulations to probe the differential flexibility of these two domains.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
While it may be true that dsRBD2 is more rigid than dsRBD1, the manuscript lacks conclusive and decisive proof that such changes in backbone dynamics are responsible for target search and recognition and the diffusion of TRBP2 along the RNA molecule. To conclusively prove the central claim of this manuscript, the authors could have considered a larger construct that carries both RBDs. With such a construct, authors can probe the characteristics of these two tandem domains (e.g., semi-independent tumbling) and their interactions with the RNA. Additionally, mutational experiments may be carried out where specific residues are altered to change the conformational dynamics of these two domains. The corresponding changes in interactions with RNA will provide additional evidence for the model presented in Figure 8 of the manuscript. Finally, there are inconsistencies in the reported data between different figures and tables.</p>

<p>This study presents a useful comparison of the dynamic properties of two RNA-binding domains. The data collection and analysis are solid, making excellent use of a suite of NMR methods. However, evidence to support the proposed model linking dynamic behavior to RNA recognition and binding by the tandem domains remains incomplete. The work will be of interest to biophysicists working on RNA-binding proteins.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank eLife for taking the time and effort to review our manuscript. Evidence from the literature and our study shows a great deal of parity between the dynamic behavior of dsRBDs and its dsRNA-recognition and -binding, which helped us culminate in proposing a fair model. As mentioned in the manuscript, we have been working on the suggested experiments to further support our proposed model.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Differential conformational dynamics in two type-A RNA-binding domains drive the double-stranded RNA recognition and binding,&quot; Chugh and co-workers utilize a suite of NMR relaxation methods to probe the dynamic landscape of the TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) double-stranded RNA-binding domain 2 (dsRBD2) and compare these to their previously published results on TRBP dsRBD1. The authors show that, unlike dsRBD1, dsRBD2 is a rigid protein with minimal ps-ns or us-ms time scale dynamics in the absence of RNA. They then show that dsRBD2 binds to canonical A-form dsRNA with a higher affinity compared to dsRBD1 and does so without much alteration in protein dynamics. Using their previously published data, the authors propose a model whereby dsRBD2 recognizes dsRNA first and brings dsRBD1 into proximity to search for RNA bulge and internal loop structures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the Reviewer for sending us an encouraging review. We have combined the findings reported in the literature with new ones, that led us to propose the dsRNA-binding model by tandem A-form dsRBDs.</p>
<p>We propose that dsRBD1 can first recognize a variety of sequential and structurally different dsRNAs. dsRBD2 assists the interaction with a higher affinity, thus fortifying the interaction between TRBP and a possible substrate. This may enable the other associated proteins like Dicer and Ago2 to perform critical biological functions.</p>
<p>However, the following statements made in the comment above are factually incorrect.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) They then show that dsRBD2 binds to canonical A-form dsRNA with a higher affinity compared to dsRBD1 and does so without much alteration in protein dynamics.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, we have explicitly shown the perturbation in dsRBD2 dynamics upon RNA binding.</p>

<p>(2) Using their previously published data, the authors propose a model whereby dsRBD2 recognizes dsRNA first and brings dsRBD1 into proximity to search for RNA bulge and internal loop structures.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our previously published data suggests that dsRBD1, owing to its high conformational dynamics in solution, is able to recognize a variety of structurally and sequentially different dsRNA (PMID: 35134335). dsRBDs preferably bind to the double-stranded region (minor-major-minor-groove) of an A-form RNA (PMID: 24801449; PMID: 27332119) and do not search for bulge and internal loop structures as a part of the binding event. Even though dsRBDs preferably bind to the double-stranded region, they can still accommodate perturbation in the A-form helix due to mismatch and bulges with decreased binding affinity (PMID 25608000). However, it is a matter of future research to identify how much of a deviation from the A-form structure can be accommodated by the dsRBDs. The diffusion event observed in the literature (PMID: 23251028) also does not show any direct implication to search for bulge and internal loop structures.</p>

<p>Response: We understand the reviewer’s point that this study is focused on a dsRNA-binding mechanism rather than addressing the much broader field of RNA-binding. There are multiple challenges in finding a single mechanism that works for all RNA-binding proteins. For instance, RRM is a single-stranded RNA binding domain that is able to read out the substrate base sequence. RRM behaves entirely differently than the dsRBD in terms of sequence specificity. Besides, several other RNA-binding domains like the KH-domain, Puf domains, Zinc finger domains, etc., showcase a unique RNA-binding behavior. Thus, it would be really difficult to draw a single rule of thumb for RNA-recognition behavior for all these diverse domains.</p>
<p>Thank you for pointing out the entropy of binding from ITC. We shall include the discussion about the entropy of binding in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Proteins that bind to double-stranded RNA regulate various cellular processes, including gene expression and viral recognition. Such proteins often contain multiple double-stranded RNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) that play an important role in target search and recognition. In this work, Chug and colleagues have characterized the backbone dynamics of one of the dsRBDs of a protein called TRBP2, which carries two tandem dsRBDs. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, the authors characterize the backbone motions of dsRBD2 in the absence and presence of dsRNA and compare these with their previously published results on dsRBD1. The authors show that dsRBD2 is comparatively more rigid than dsRBD1 and claim that these differences in backbone motions are important for target recognition.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The strengths of this study are multiple solution NMR measurements to characterize the backbone motions of dsRBD2. These include 15N-R1, R2, and HetNOE experiments in the absence and presence of RNA and the analysis of these data using an extended-model-free approach; HARD-15N-experiments and their analysis to characterize the kex. The authors also report differences in binding affinities of dsRBD1 and dsRBD2 using ITC and have performed MD simulations to probe the differential flexibility of these two domains.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While it may be true that dsRBD2 is more rigid than dsRBD1, the manuscript lacks conclusive and decisive proof that such changes in backbone dynamics are responsible for target search and recognition and the diffusion of TRBP2 along the RNA molecule. To conclusively prove the central claim of this manuscript, the authors could have considered a larger construct that carries both RBDs. With such a construct, authors can probe the characteristics of these two tandem domains (e.g., semi-independent tumbling) and their interactions with the RNA. Additionally, mutational experiments may be carried out where specific residues are altered to change the conformational dynamics of these two domains. The corresponding changes in interactions with RNA will provide additional evidence for the model presented in Figure 8 of the manuscript. Finally, there are inconsistencies in the reported data between different figures and tables.</p>

<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the comprehensive and insightful review. A larger construct carrying both RBDs was not used because of the multiple challenges pertaining to dynamics study by NMR spectroscopy (intrinsic R2 rates of the dsRBD1-dsRBD2 construct would be high, resulting in broadened peaks) as per our previous experience (PMID: 35134335). There would be additional dynamics in that construct coming from domain-domain relative motions, difficult to deconvolute the dynamics information. Further, the dsRNA needed to bind to this construct will be longer, thereby causing further line broadening in NMR.</p>
<p>Coming to mutational studies, careful designing of domain mutants remains as a challenge because the conformational dynamics in both the domains are distributed all through the backbone rather than only in the RNA-binding residues. The mutational studies would need an exhaustive number of mutations in protein as well as RNA to draw a parallel between the binding and dynamics. Having said that, we are working on making such mutations in the protein (at several locations to freeze the dynamics site-specifically) and the RNA (to change the shape of the dsRNA) to systematically study this mechanism, which will be out of scope of this manuscript.</p>
<p>The reviewer has rightly pointed out some subtle superficial differences. These superficial differences are present because of the context in which we are describing the data. For example, in Figure S4 we are talking about the average relaxation rates and nOe values for only the common residues we were able to analyze between two magnetic field strengths 600 and 800 MHz. Whereas in Figure 6, we are comparing the averages of the core dsRBD residues at 600 MHz, in presence and absence of D12RNA. The differences however are minute falling well within the error range.</p>
