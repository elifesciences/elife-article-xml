<title>Abstract</title><p>Mammalian inner ear sensory hair cells are highly sensitive to environmental stress and do not regenerate, making hearing loss progressive and permanent. The paucity and extreme inaccessibility of these cells hinder the development of regenerative and otoprotective strategies, Direct lineage reprogramming to generate large quantities of hair cell-like cells in vitro offers a promising approach to overcome these experimental bottlenecks. Previously, we identified four transcription factors—<italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> (SAPG)—capable of converting mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail tip fibroblasts, and postnatal mouse supporting cells into induced hair cell-like cells through retroviral or lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Here, we developed a virus-free, inducible system using a stable human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell line carrying doxycycline-inducible SAPG. Our inducible system significantly increases reprogramming efficiency compared to retroviral methods, achieving a ∼19-fold greater conversion to a hair cell fate in half the time. Immunostaining, Western blot, and single-nucleus RNA-seq analyses confirm the expression of hair cell-specific markers and activation of hair cell gene networks in reprogrammed cells. The reprogrammed hair cells closely resemble developing fetal hair cells, as evidenced by comparison with a human fetal inner ear dataset. Electrophysiological analysis reveals that the induced hair cell-like cells exhibit diverse voltage-dependent ion currents, including robust, quick-activating, slowly inactivating currents characteristic of primary hair cells. This virus-free approach improves scalability, reproducibility, and the modeling of hair cell differentiation, offering significant potential for hair cell regenerative strategies and preclinical drug discovery targeting ototoxicity and otoprotection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hearing loss, primarily caused by the death of sensory hair cells in the inner ear, presents a global epidemic affecting hundreds of millions worldwide. Sensorineural hearing loss poses a significant challenge, with profound impacts on quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Géléoc and Holt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>). Unlike non-mammalian vertebrates, humans and other mammals lack the intrinsic ability to spontaneously regenerate lost hair cells in the cochlea, leading to progressive and irreversible deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chardin and Romand, 1995</xref>). Many factors contribute to hearing loss, including genetic mutations, environmental stressors such as noise exposure and ototoxic drugs, as well as age-related degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Matsui, Gale and Warchol, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Wong and Ryan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cheng, Cunningham and Rubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bodmer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Langer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Vaisbuch and Santa Maria, 2018</xref>). Current interventions for hearing loss primarily rely on prosthetic devices like cochlear implants and hearing aids, offering limited benefits for some individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Géléoc and Holt, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Groves, 2010</xref>). Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop innovative strategies aimed at restoring or preserving cochlear structure and function, particularly through the regeneration of sensory hair cells or otoprotective drug screening. However, the complexities of the organ of Corti, composed of highly specialized hair cells and supporting cells, coupled with the paucity and inaccessibility of these cells, present substantial hurdles for regenerative medicine research and ototoxicity management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen and Segil, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Lee, Liu and Segil, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Ruben and Sidman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lowenheim <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Matei <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Efforts to address these challenges have led to the development of in vitro models capable of producing hair cell-like cells. Directed differentiation protocols, involving precise temporal manipulation of growth factors and signaling molecules within three-dimensional cultures, have enabled the generation of inner ear organoids from both embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Koehler <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Oshima <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Koehler <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Moore <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Ronaghi <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Jeong <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). However, the requirement for three-dimensional culture conditions and the variability in these approaches have constrained the feasibility of high-throughput studies with current imaging technologies. Alternatively, reprogramming with hair cell-specific transcription factors has emerged as a promising strategy for rapidly generating hair cell-like cells from readily available mammalian somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Iyer and Groves, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alonso <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Iyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In our previous study using direct lineage reprogramming, we successfully induced the conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts, adult tail tip fibroblasts, and postnatal mouse supporting cells into induced hair cells (iHCs) using <italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> delivered by retroviral or lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). We showed these hair cell-like cells to have similar transcriptional, epigenetic, morphological and electrophysiological properties to primary mouse hair cells. We further demonstrated that reprogrammed hair cells recapitulate the observed sensitivity of primary hair cells to gentamicin-induced ototoxicity. Recently, it was demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> in nonsensory regions of the mature mouse cochlea induces the conversion of these cells into hair cell-like cells containing immature stereocilia bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McGovern <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). This suggests that although transcription factor reprogramming is feasible in the intact adult cochlea, further research is needed to understand the mechanism of reprogramming and address the obstacles in generating fully functional, mature hair cells.</p>
<p>While retroviral- and lentiviral-mediated reprogramming with hair cell-specific transcription factors is suitable for conducting high-throughput studies, its translational potential is constrained by several factors. The process of producing viruses, which constitutes the rate-limiting step, affects the scalability and robustness of robotic, high-throughput screening for drugs/small molecules capable of inducing hair cell regeneration, or protecting sensory hair cells from ototoxic agents. Infecting cells with multiple viruses is likely to strain cellular transcription/translation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Babos <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>), and only a subset of cells is expected to be infected by all the viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Mistry, D’Orsogna and Chou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Phan and Wodarz, 2015</xref>), thereby diminishing reprogramming efficiency. Additionally, certain cell types, such as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, possess the ability to suppress viral expression after integration, significantly impeding the expression levels of the reprogramming factors.</p>
<p>To address these limitations, we have established a stable human iPS cell line carrying doxycycline-inducible <italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>ATOH1</italic>, <italic>POU4F3</italic>, and <italic>GFI1</italic> reprogramming factors. We demonstrate the reliable and efficient reprogramming of this cell line to a hair cell-like state. Compared to retroviral-mediated methods, the virus-free induction system significantly enhances reprogramming efficiency and reproducibility, achieving a 19.1-fold increase in conversion efficiency in half the time. We show that reprogrammed hair cells closely resemble primary hair cells on the basis of their gene expression profiles and electrophysiological properties. The inducible system offers several advantages, including consistent expression of all four reprogramming factors, avoidance of viral silencing thus enabling the direct reprogramming of iPSCs and other stem cell types, and the ability to achieve transient expression of reprogramming factors, thereby better mimicking physiological hair cell differentiation. Leveraging human cells for this purpose also allows for modeling regenerative and otoprotective strategies unique to humans due to molecular differences between species. The increased efficiency and scalability of this approach provide a more robust tool for conducting high-throughput molecular and functional analyses. With access to increasingly larger gene and drug libraries, this advancement has the potential to significantly accelerate the screening process for genes that promote hair cell regeneration, as well as to facilitate pre-clinical discovery of drugs for combating ototoxicity and enhancing otoprotection.</p>

<title>Reprogramming of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells into hair cell-like cells (induced hair cells) using doxycycline-inducible <italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>ATOH1</italic>, <italic>POU4F3</italic>, and <italic>GFI1</italic></title>
<p>To improve upon the relatively low reprogramming efficiency inherent in transduction of multiple viruses in our previous strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>), we developed a stable human iPS cell line carrying doxycycline-inducible hair cell reprogramming factors. This cell line harbors a doxycycline-inducible cassette expressing <italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>ATOH1</italic>, <italic>POU4F3</italic>, and <italic>GFI1</italic> (collectively referred to as SAPG) from a single promoter. To create this cell line, we engineered a Tet-On inducible construct containing the SAPG reprogramming genes separated by 2A self-cleaving peptide sequences (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). The use of 2A self-cleaving peptides allows the generation of multiple proteins from a single primary transcript and ensures comparable expression levels of the reprogramming genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Tang <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Carey <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). We targeted the vector to the CLYBL safe harbor locus using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lo, Greben and Chen, 2017</xref>) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Additionally, the cell line carries a <italic>POU4F3</italic>-tdTomato hair cell reporter integrated independently at a separate locus in the genome, enabling live tracking of reprogrammed hair cells. This reporter is not expressed in the starting iPSC population and becomes activated as hair cell-like cells begin to differentiate, approximately 3 days after doxycycline administration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>; <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

The four TFs were separated by 2A self-cleaving peptides to generate multiple proteins from a single primary transcript. Epitope tags were incorporated at the 3’ end as follows: the HA tag with <italic>SIX1</italic>, the 6xHis tag with <italic>POU4F3</italic>, and the FLAG tag with <italic>ATOH1</italic>. The vector was integrated into the CLYBL safe harbor locus between the two homology arms (HA1 and HA2) using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in. Upon confirmation of correct targeting, the cell line was subsequently treated with TAT-CRE recombinase to excise the mApple screenable marker, FACS-sorted as mApple-negative cells, followed by clonal expansion.

<p>We tested the ability of the stable cell line to express individual reprogramming genes (Inducible SAPG) and their endogenous counterparts (Endogenous SAPG) over time in the presence of continuous doxycycline treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). Using RT-qPCR and primer sets designed to distinguish between SAPG transgenes and endogenous genes, we observed robust induction (log<sub>2</sub>[fold change] of 8.58–10.78) of the reprogramming factors 24 hours after doxycycline administration. Expression of the reprogramming factors remained consistently elevated for up to 21 days, the longest time point tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). In contrast, endogenous SAPG genes were expressed around ∼48 hours after doxycycline administration and reached steady-state levels by 7 days, persisting through to 21 days. We also investigated the responsiveness of the inducible system to either a 3-day (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) or a 7-day (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>) pulse of doxycycline.</p>
<p>Following the 3- or 7-day pulse, we observed significant induction of the reprogramming factors, with their expression returning to near or at baseline levels by day 7 (after 3-day pulse; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) or by day 14 (after 7-day pulse; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, pulsed doxycycline administration activated endogenous <italic>GFI1</italic> and <italic>SIX1</italic> expression to levels comparable to those observed under chronic doxycycline condition. In contrast, endogenous <italic>ATOH1</italic> and <italic>POU4F3</italic> expression showed a decrease but still maintained strong induction by day 21, with log<sub>2</sub>[fold change] values of 7.49 ± 0.15 and 3.83 ± 0.03, respectively (after 3-day pulse; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>) or 8.28 ± 0.14 and 4.44 ± 0.23, respectively (after 7-day pulse; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess the efficacy of the doxycycline-inducible system in reprogramming human iPSCs to a hair cell-like state, we performed immunostaining for established hair cell-specific markers (POU4F3, MYO7A, and MYO6; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>) and the pluripotency marker NANOG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). We observed staining for POU4F3 and MYO7A, and activation of the <italic>POU4F3</italic>-tdTomato reporter (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 1</xref>), three days after initiating doxycycline treatment, coinciding with the loss of iPSC identity, as indicated by the disappearance of NANOG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). After seven days of continuous doxycycline, 58.6% (± 0.3%) of cells were positive for transgene encoded, HA epitope-tagged SIX1, while 34.1–40.1% were reprogrammed to a hair cell-like state, as quantified by the presence of POU4F3+, MYO7A+, or MYO6+ cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>; <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 3</xref>). In contrast, only 2.1% (± 0.2%) of cells tested positive for MYO7A when reprogrammed via retroviral-mediated transduction over 14 days, the standard duration used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). This reflects a 19.1-fold increase in the conversion efficiency to MYO7A+ cells, achieved by the inducible system in half the time required for retroviral-mediated reprogramming (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>).

<p>To gain further insight into the direct reprogramming of human iPSCs into hair cell-like cells, we treated cells with doxycycline continuously for 21 days then performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and “uniform manifold approximation and projection” (UMAP) to compare with uninduced cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Uninduced (6,048 nuclei) and induced (5,028 nuclei) samples segregated into three and five clusters, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). As expected, the major uninduced cluster (labeled Control cluster 1 [C1]) showed typical features of pluripotency such as <italic>POU5F1</italic> expression and cell cycle progression (<italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic>, <italic>CDK1</italic>, <italic>BIRC5)</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic>, <italic>D</italic></xref>-<italic>E</italic>).

<p>We interrogated the reprogrammed populations for other genes associated with inner ear cell identity.

<title>Retroviral-mediated transduction of human fibroblasts with <italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>ATOH1</italic>, <italic>POU4F3</italic>, and <italic>GFI1</italic> demonstrates comparable reprogramming fidelity</title>
<p>Given the significantly higher reprogramming efficiency observed in the stable cell line compared to retroviral-mediated reprogramming with SAPG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>), we wondered whether the doxycycline-inducible system also enhances the fidelity of hair cell reprogramming by activating a greater number of hair cell genes. To investigate this, we performed retroviral-mediated reprogramming of human iPSC-derived fibroblasts with SAPG over a 21-day period. To do this, we utilized the parent line (carrying the <italic>POU4F3</italic>-tdTomato reporter but lacking the reprogramming cassette) of the stable cell line. Before initiating reprogramming, we converted the iPSCs into secondary fibroblasts, a necessary step due to retroviral silencing in iPSCs. We profiled sorted populations of <italic>POU4F3</italic>-tdTomato+ and <italic>POU4F3</italic>-tdTomato-cells (in a single sample) collected after 21 days of reprogramming using single-cell RNA-seq. Of the 6,676 cells analyzed, we found reprogramming hair cell-like cells to be segregated into three distinct clusters, as depicted by UMAP projection (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). These clusters coincided with canonical hair cell markers, including <italic>MYO6</italic> and <italic>MYO15A</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), leading us to label them Retrovirus-Reprogrammed clusters 1 through 3 (RV-R1–3; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, the expression of <italic>CCND1</italic>, which encodes cyclin D1 involved in cell cycle progression, and the mesenchymal marker <italic>COL2A1</italic>, was evident in residual fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Additionally, the reprogrammed clusters exhibited reduced expression of <italic>NOTCH1/2/3</italic>, and upregulation of hair cell-specific NOTCH ligand genes <italic>DLL3</italic>, <italic>JAG2</italic>, and <italic>DLK2</italic>, relative to fibroblast clusters (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 6</xref>). This is consistent with the reported modulation of NOTCH signaling pathway during hair cell differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kelley, 2006</xref>). The observed trajectory in the RNA velocity map (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>), and heat map (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), indicate that clusters 2 and 3 are more hair cell-like compared to cluster 1. Pseudotime analysis of cluster 1–3 using Monocle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Qiu <italic>et al</italic>., 2017</xref>) demonstrates that reprogramming cells in clusters 1 and 2 are still in the process of erasing fibroblast identity, characterized by the downregulation of fibroblast-enriched genes <italic>GYPC</italic>, <italic>CPXM1</italic>, <italic>COL5A2</italic>, and <italic>SDC2</italic> (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 7</xref>).

Given that <italic>INSM1</italic> is known to prevent trans-differentiation into inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Wiwatpanit <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), we assessed whether INSM1+ cells coincide with OHC-specific expression (such as DNM3, which is detected in the stereocilia bundles of only OHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), to the exclusion of IHC-specific expression (such as SLC7A14, detected in the soma of only IHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Li <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>).

The co-expression of established cochlear and vestibular HC markers suggests that the reprogrammed cells have not adopted a distinct cochlear vs. vestibular identity.

<title>Human induced hair cells exhibit heterogenous voltage-dependent ion currents</title>
<p>In our previous work, we demonstrated that SAPG-transduced mouse induced hair cells are similar in both morphological features and electrophysiological properties to primary mouse hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). To analyze the voltage-gated currents and passive membrane properties of human induced hair cells, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings after 7 days of reprogramming in continuous doxycycline (n = 11 cells) and compared them with uninduced control (n = 13). Using voltage-clamp, we measured the magnitude and time dependent activity of the whole-cell currents. Among the induced cells tested, some exhibited both sustained outward currents (positive currents) and transient inward (negative) currents, likely sodium currents based on their activation kinetics (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic>, <italic>H</italic></xref>). The kinetics of the outward currents were heterogeneous: some cells displayed robust quick-activating currents that inactivated slowly over the course of the protocol (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic></xref>), consistent with those observed in primary hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). Others showed mixed kinetics, with currents that activated at relatively negative voltages exhibiting some inactivation, while those activating at more positive voltages were slower to activate and did not inactivate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>G</italic></xref>). Some induced cells displayed rapidly inactivating potassium currents (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>H</italic></xref>), whereas a subset produced very small currents (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>I</italic></xref>). The large cell-to-cell variability in the size and kinetics of the outward currents indicates heterogeneity in the ion channel composition across reprogrammed cells. In contrast, the uninduced cells were relatively homogenous exhibiting few to no currents (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic>-<italic>E, J</italic></xref>). Using current-clamp (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>L</italic></xref>), the human induced cells demonstrated a mean resting potential of -49 mV (± 3.1), comparable to SAPG-transduced mouse induced hair cells in monolayer culture (-50.8 mV ± 2.4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and to previously reported values for primary hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Dallos, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oliver <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>). By contrast, the uninduced cells were more depolarized, with a mean resting potential of -24 mV (± 3.1), and struggled to maintain this potential. Together, these electrophysiological data suggest that the uninduced cells possess very few ion-selective currents, while reprogramming with SAPG yields cells with a heterogenous composition of voltage-dependent ion channels.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our efforts to address the challenges posed by the paucity and extreme inaccessibility of inner ear sensory cells for regenerative medical research and ototoxicity management, we previously identified a combination of four transcription factors, <italic>Six1</italic>, <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> (SAPG), capable of reprogramming mouse somatic cells into hair cell-like cells via direct lineage conversion using viral delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). We demonstrated that SAPG-transduced mouse hair cell-like cells exhibit transcriptional and epigenetic similarities to perinatal primary cochlear hair cells. Additionally, these induced hair cells recapitulate susceptibility to known ototoxins, including gentamicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>) and cisplatin (<xref rid="figs13" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 13</xref>), validating their use for screening purposes. Building on the efficacy of the SAPG transcription factor combination, we have now adapted this approach to human cells using a virus-free induction system. Our results show that a stable iPS cell line carrying doxycycline-inducible SAPG can be reliably and effectively reprogrammed to a hair cell-like state, achieving a 19.1-fold increase in reprogramming efficiency compared to our previous retroviral-mediated strategy. This represents a significant improvement over the inherently low reprogramming efficiency of retroviral-mediated methods. Moreover, the inducible system eliminates the laborious and often unreliable step of converting iPSCs into secondary fibroblasts before reprogramming, which is necessitated by retroviral silencing in iPSCs. These enhancements to the translational value of direct lineage conversion improve the scalability and robustness of robotic, high-throughput screening, enabling the screening of larger drug libraries comprising tens-to-hundreds of thousands of compounds. Consequently, this approach has the potential to rapidly accelerate the screening process for identifying genes capable of inducing hair cell regeneration, as well as facilitating pre-clinical drug discovery efforts focused on ototoxicity and otoprotection.</p>
<p>Current retroviral- and lentivirus-mediated reprogramming strategy relies on constitutive expression of SAPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>); however, continuous expression of the master regulator ATOH1 has been shown to inhibit hair cell maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2014b</xref>). The inducible system offers an advantage as the expression of the reprogramming factors can be controlled by turning them off upon withdrawal of doxycycline. Our inducible system demonstrates rapid return of the inducible SAPG factors to baseline levels after a 3- or 7-day pulse of doxycycline (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>; <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 2</xref>). Furthermore, the stable cell line exhibits sustained expression of endogenous hair cell transcription factors and canonical hair cell markers following the pulsed treatment. Improvements to the current virus-mediated strategy will involve redesigning it to activate the master regulator ATOH1 so that its expression can be turned on to induce reprogramming and then off again, to mimic the regulation of ATOH1 as it occurs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Kelley, Woods and Montcouquiol, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kelley, 2006</xref>), as well as the switch to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) as a superior therapeutic gene transfer platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Zinn and Vandenberghe, 2014</xref>). Transducing supporting cells or non-sensory cells in the deafened organ of Corti for a brief period, to transiently re-enter the cell cycle to restore the correct numbers of hair cells, is a crucial characteristic needed for future gene therapy approaches to hearing loss.</p>
<p>Our observations indicate the SAPG reprogramming factors yield populations exhibiting mixed expression patterns characteristic of different hair cell subtypes. This results in the co-expression of markers associated with outer hair cells, inner hair cells, and vestibular hair cells within our reprogrammed population (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>E</italic></xref>; <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 11</xref>). The concurrent expression of these markers may suggest an immature state of hair cell development. This notion is supported by previous studies showing minimal gene expression differences distinguishing inner and outer hair cells during perinatal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2014a</xref>), as well between cochlear and vestibular hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Burns <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>). However, apart from <italic>INSM1</italic>, our reprogrammed cells fail to activate known hair cell type-specifying transcription factors, including <italic>IKZF2</italic> (<italic>HELIOS</italic>) and <italic>TBX2,</italic> as well as <italic>GATA3</italic> crucial for the functional maturation of inner hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Bardhan <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>). The absence of key transcription factors may explain why the SAPG combination triggers multiple differentiation programs specific to various hair cells. The lack of <italic>IKZF2</italic>, essential for promoting outer hair cell fate and functional maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chessum <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>), likely contributes to the failure of our mouse and human reprogrammed hair cells to express <italic>PRESTIN</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chessum <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez <italic>et al</italic>., 2020</xref>). To address this, we plan to investigate the effects of incorporating these cochlear hair cell subtype-specifying transcription factors to the SAPG combination, which we anticipate will enhance the conversion to a cochlear hair cell fate and more advanced stage(s) of hair cell maturation. Despite not assuming a distinct cochlear vs. vestibular identity, the reprogrammed hair cells nevertheless closely resemble developing vestibular hair cells, as indicated by a Spearman’s correlation of 0.729 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Additionally, they demonstrate heterogenous voltage-gated ion currents (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic>-<italic>I</italic></xref>), consistent with the mixed expression patterns of different hair cell types.</p>
<p>We observed upregulation of specific cochlear markers (<italic>NR2F1/2</italic> and <italic>LRP2</italic>) in a subset of reprogrammed cells, although the underlying reason(s) for this observation remain unclear. These cells form a stable cluster without a discernible trajectory (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic>, <italic>D</italic></xref>). We hypothesize that these cells have activated the SAPG reprogramming factors but failed to fully transition to the hair cell-like state. This resembles the phenomenon of abortive reprogramming observed in previous studies on stem cell or fibroblast direct lineage conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Biddy <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Kamimoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). We explored the role of the CMV enhancer-containing promoter driving rtTA in the inducible system, suspecting it might reduce conversion efficiency to the hair cell fate. However, prolonging incubation with iPSC medium (mTeSR) and doxycycline did not increase reprogramming factor or hair cell marker expression but was detrimental to <italic>NR2F1/2</italic> and <italic>LRP2</italic> activation (<xref rid="figs12" ref-type="fig">Supp. Fig. 12</xref>). The downregulation of <italic>NR2F1/2</italic> and <italic>LRP2</italic> expression in successfully reprogrammed hair cells aligns with the notion that these genes serve as cochlear markers rather than hair cell markers. Additionally, a recent study suggested that <italic>NR2F1/2</italic> could be involved in the temporal control of cochlear differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Moore <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). These findings underscore the complexity of the reprogramming process and highlight the need for more comprehensive studies to elucidate the mechanisms governing inner ear cell fate determination. Nonetheless, the stable cell line shows activation of specific cochlear gene markers with inducible SAPG expression.</p>
<p>In reprogrammed hair cell populations derived from both human iPSCs and fibroblasts, we observed the activation of hair cell networks, including hair cell-specific NOTCH ligand genes. This activation coincided with the downregulation of genes associated with cell cycle progression and <italic>NOTCH1/2/3</italic> receptor genes. These results correspond with the characteristic postmitotic state of primary hair cells and are consistent with the documented modulation of NOTCH signaling during hair cell differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Kelley, 2006</xref>). We did not detect the activation of genes associated with supporting cell identity. However, previous studies have shown that overexpression of <italic>Atoh1</italic>, <italic>Pou4f3</italic>, and <italic>Gfi1</italic> can induce both hair cell and supporting cell networks in the mature mouse cochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Iyer <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">McGovern <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). This suggests that reprogramming from both iPSCs and fibroblasts may lack the additional signaling cues necessary to undergo conversion into supporting cell-like cells in response to SAPG. Indeed, iPSC- and fibroblast-derived reprogrammed hair cells failed to robustly activate some key players in the NOTCH pathway for inducing supporting cell fate, such as <italic>DLL1</italic>, which acts synergistically with <italic>JAG2</italic> to regulate hair cell differentiation and recruit neighboring cells for supporting cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Kiernan <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Our study underscores the potential of the inducible SAPG system in overcoming the limitations associated with retroviral- and lentiviral-mediated reprogramming of inner ear sensory cells. By achieving a more efficient, scalable, and physiologically relevant conversion of readily available somatic cell types to a hair cell-like state, our approach facilitates the high-throughput screening of genes and drugs to identify novel candidates for hair cell regeneration and otoprotection. Additionally, reprogramming from human cells is more likely to accurately reflect the effectiveness of these candidates for human use, given the potential species differences. Although the reprogrammed cells currently display mixed expression patterns characteristic of different hair cell subtypes, our future efforts will focus on refining the transcription factor combination to more precisely guide differentiation towards specific cochlear or vestibular hair cell fates. This optimization will enhance our ability to model hair cell development and maturation in vitro, ultimately advancing the development of gene and cell-based therapies for hearing restoration.</p>

<title>Generation of POU4F3-tdTomato iPSC reporter line</title>
<p>Human iPSCs derived from ND05280 (NINDS/Coriell; as described in Shi et al., 2018) were obtained from Justin Ichida. A pX330 plasmid (Addgene # 42230) expressing Cas9 and a single guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the POU4F3 locus (GTTCGGCTGTCCACTGATTG <italic>CGG</italic>; PAM sequence is shown in italics) was used to introduce site-specific double-strand breaks via electroporation. A homologous recombination (HR) plasmid was co-electroporated, containing left and right homology arms (LHA and RHA), a T2A-tdTomato reporter sequence, and a puromycin resistance cassette for selection. Electroporation was performed using the Lonza nucleofector kit in the presence of 2 μM Nu7441 (STEMCELL Technologies), following the manufacturer’s instructions. After electroporation, colonies were expanded and screened by genotyping to confirm successful integration of the reporter cassette.

<p>A polycistronic SAPG gBlock (GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was designed to include coding sequences for <italic>SIX1</italic>, <italic>ATOH1</italic>, <italic>POU4F3</italic>, and <italic>GFI1</italic>, separated by self-cleaving 2A peptide sequences. The gBlock was subcloned into the CLYBL-TRE-HDR vector (referred to as CLYBL-4F HDR; GeneArt, Thermo Fisher Scientific), which was designed with homology arms flanking the SAPG cassette for targeted integration into the CLYBL safe harbor locus. The CLYBL-TRE-HDR vector also contains a tetracycline response element (TRE) for doxycycline-inducible expression, a puromycin resistance cassette, and an mApple screenable marker.</p>
<p>POU4F3-tdTomato iPSCs were plated at a density of 120,000 cells per well in three wells of a 24-well plate in mTeSR medium (STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 10 µM ROCK Inhibitor (Y-27632, STEMCELL Technologies) and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were prepared using Alt-R® S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (3 µM, IDT) in OptiMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sgRNA (3 µM, Synthego; sequence: ACTTCCTTCTATGTAAGATG <italic>AGG</italic>) in a 1:1 ratio, followed by a 5-minute incubation at room temperature. The RNP complex was combined with 750 ng of the CLYBL-4F HDR donor plasmid, and a mastermix of OptiMEM and Lipofectamine Stem (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to yield a final volume of 50 µL, followed by a 10-minute incubation at room temperature. After the 4-hour iPSC incubation, the medium was replaced with 500 µL of fresh, prewarmed mTeSR medium containing 10 µM ROCK Inhibitor. The CRISPR transfection solution (50 µL) was added dropwise to each well, and the plate was swirled gently to ensure even distribution. Cells were incubated at 32°C for 48 hours to facilitate transfection.</p>
<p>Following expansion, transfected cells were collected for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). mApple-positive cells were isolated and plated into single wells of a 96-well plate in mTeSR medium supplemented with CloneR (STEMCELL Technologies) to promote survival and colony formation. To generate a clonal line, positive cells were sorted again by FACS into 24 individual wells of a 96-well plate, with each well containing a single cell. Sorted cells were cultured in mTeSR medium with CloneR for 5 days, and 22 of the 24 conditions survived. These were subsequently expanded under standard mTeSR culture conditions.</p>
<p>After clonal expansion, the cell line was treated with 0.1 µg/µL TAT-CRE recombinase (Excellgen) in the presence of Lipofectamine Stem to excise the mApple screenable marker. Cells were FACS-sorted as mApple-negative cells and cultured in mTeSR medium with Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-Strep, Corning). The stable cell line was expanded and tested for karyotypic abnormalities at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, showing an apparently normal karyotype.</p>

<title>GO and GSEA analyses</title>
<p>Gene ontology analysis was performed and visualized using Enrichr (Chen et al., 2013). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed using GSEA v4.3.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) with 1000 permutations and classic (non-weighted) statistic. The ranked list metric for GSEA was based the formula log<sub>2</sub>(fold change)*-log<sub>10</sub>(adjusted <italic>p</italic>-value).</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recording was conducted as previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Menendez et al. (2020)</xref>. Briefly, whole cell patch clamping was performed on induced (7-day reprogrammed) and uninduced POU4F3-tdTomato iPSCs carrying doxycycline-inducible SAPG. Preparations were viewed at X630 using a Zeiss Axios Examiner D1 microscope fitted with Zeiss W Plan-Aprochromat optics. Signals were driven, recorded, and amplified with an Multiclamp 700B amplifier, Digidata 1440 board and pClamp 10.7 software (pClamp, RRID:<underline>SCR_011323</underline>). Recording and cleaning pipettes were fabricated using filamented borosilicate glass. Pipettes were fired polished to yield an access resistance between 4–8 MΩ. Each recording pipette was covered in a layer of parafilm to reduce pipette capacitance. Recording pipettes were filled with one of two internal solutions, a standard internal solution and a perforated patch internal solution. The contents of the standard internal solution are (in mM): 135 KCl, 3.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 Li-GTP, and titrated with 1 M KOH to a pH of 7.35 and an osmolarity of 300 mmol/kg. The contents of the perforated-patch solution are (in mM): 75 K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 25 KCl, 5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES, 5 EGTA, 0.1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and titrated with 1 M KOH to a pH of 7.4 and an osmolality of 260-270 mmol/kg. Amphotericin B (240 µg/mL final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO and added to the perforated-patch solution on the day of recording. This allowed passage of small monovalent ions while preventing larger molecules from dialyzing. The voltage clamp protocol was performed by holding the cell at −60 mV followed by a stimulus of voltage steps (−120 to +70 mV, by intervals of 10 mV). Uninduced cells did not often tolerate the −60 mV holding potential; as a result in a subset of recordings we held those cells at a more modest −25 mV with greater success in cell survival. To improve the ability to record from the more fragile uninduced cells, we employed two approaches: the conventional rupture patch technique and a gentler perforated-patch method, in which the antibiotic amphotericin is used to create membrane pores, enabling electrical continuity.</p>
<p>Analysis of the data was performed using a combination of pClamp (pClamp, RRID:<underline>SCR_011323</underline>), and Origin Pro (OriginPro, RRID:<underline>SCR_015636</underline>). pClamp software was used to gather and quantify raw data from electrophysiological recordings.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Rainey et al investigated the effects of transcription factors, ATOH1, POU4F3, GFI1, and SIX1 on the induction of hair cells from human pluripotent stem cells. The authors used a doxycycline-inducible system to control transgene expression and demonstrated significant improvement in the efficiency of MYO7A+ hair cell differentiation compared to the retrovirus-mediated approach. Next, they characterized differentiated cells using single-cell RNA-seq and identified a population of hair cell-like cells with gene expression profiles similar to the fetal human vestibular hair cells. Finally, they revealed the electrophysiological properties of induced cells consistent with those of mechanosensitive hair cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>A key finding in this study is the rapid induction of cells expressing multiple hair cell markers that takes place within 21 days after overexpression of the four transcription factors. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that doxycycline-mediated gene overexpression outperforms retroviral-mediated gene transfer in terms of both the efficiency and reproducibility of hair cell induction. Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that these induced hair cells can be used to study hair cell protection from cisplatin ototoxicity.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors conclude that the induced cells lack distinct hair cell subtypes. However, the characterization of generated hair cells in single-cell RNA-seq data is insufficient. Additional vestibular or cochlear hair cell-enriched marker gene and protein expression should be analyzed. Moreover, the morphological features and mechanotransduction channel activity of the induced hair cells have not been analyzed.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study employs a specific set of transcription factors to promote lineage conversion of pluripotent stem cells into fetal hair cells. In pluripotent stem cells, an inducible expression system containing SIX1, ATOH1, POU4F3, and GFI1 (SAPG) was inserted into a safe harbor site. The stable cell line allows for doxycycline-inducible expression of transcription factors to generate induced hair cells (iHCs). These changes were observed in gene expression and electrophysiological properties. Comparing the transcriptome with iHCs derived from fibroblasts or primary human inner ear tissue suggested that it is similar to human hair cells. Although the iHCs did not have hair bundles - a key morphological feature of hair cells - the cellular system has immense potential for the field. The defined transcription factors allow for the dissection of gene regulatory networks and provide a molecular handle for the lineage conversion process. The results also suggest that the pluripotent stem cells were not directly converted into iHCs. Instead, there are several transitional cell states. These observations indicate that lineage conversion may still be hampered by yet undefined molecular obstacles and may help identify and overcome these in future work. The stable cell line allows for repeatable and large-scale screening studies, which is not feasible using primary human cells.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The cellular system is well-designed, with clearly described expression of the defined factors. Transient expression of the exogenous transcription factors SIX1, ATOH1, POU4F3, and GFI1 (SAPG) upon doxycycline induction is well-documented. Increased expression of endogenous SAPG factors suggests activation of self-regulatory feedback pathways during conversion. The stable iPS cell line provides a tool for the field to study lineage conversion or generate large numbers of iHCs.</p>
<p>Single-nuclear RNA-seq distinguishes distinct cell clusters and cellular transition states, validating the system's utility. A comparison of previously published data from iHCs and human fetal hair cells also suggested that iHCs are similar to developing human hair cells at the transcriptome level. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings show the generation of excitable cells with heterogeneous ion channel properties, which suggests a change in the cell type.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The interpretation of the snRNA-seq results could be strengthened by explaining the three distinct clusters for uninduced cells and how they transition into the iHC trajectory.</p>
<p>Although the analysis focuses on the cell cluster that represents iHCs (R5), a short discussion on what clusters R1-R4 (Figure 3B) represent would be useful. These cells do not express high levels of the SAPG factors even after 21 days of continuous doxycycline induction and may provide insight into hurdles that hamper lineage conversion.</p>
<p>RNA velocity analysis on single-nuclear RNA-seq is impressive but requires clarification on inferring the pseudotime trajectory. Some rationale and explanation on how the ratio of unspliced to spliced mRNA in the nucleus can be used to infer the differentiation trajectory would strengthen the discussion.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Robert N. Rainey et. al. reported a new approach to induce hair cell-like cells from a human induced pluripotent stem cell line. Based on the previously identified key transcription factors SIX1, ATOH1, POU4F3, and GFI1 (SAPG), which are essential for the conversion into induced hair cell-like cells in mice. The manuscript represents an advance over the authors' previous published work, which used the same transcription factors but viral gene delivery.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is clear and well-written. The background is easy to follow for people outside of the field. The data are well-organized and well-described. The evidence is strong.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>General comments:</p>
<p>(1) The manuscript generated multiple valuable datasets for the field. However, the data are not deposited in the hearing field central resource for gene expression (umgear.org), and links are not provided in the figure legends to datasets or dataset collections in the gEAR. This is a major comment as it significantly decreases the utility of the datasets generated in the manuscript and decreases the ease of reuse of the data. This is a flaw that could be easily addressed by uploading the data and generating links to datasets in the body of the manuscript.</p>
<p>(2) If a pulse of Dox induces the SAPG and starts the conversion process, it is not clear why the analyzed cells were treated for 21 days - a duration that can negatively affect the fate of converting hair cells.</p>
<p>(3) Foxj1 is listed as a supporting cell-specific gene; however, it is expressed in the cochlear hair cells until the end of the first postnatal week.</p>
<p>(4) It is not clear why cells were sorted for analysis of the retrovirally induced cells but not in the stable cell line, which also expressed tdTomato.</p>
<p>(5) Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 2: the authors state that the endogenous ATOH1 and POU4F3 expressions decrease after 7d. Should the authors have stats on the graphs?</p>
<p>(6) Supplementary Figure 4: OCT4 should be replaced by POU5F1 (or vice versa) for consistency.</p>
<p>(7) The authors show the induction or decrease of the exogenous transcription factor expressions by RT-qPCR. It would be nice, if possible, to also see either WB or immuno with antibodies directed against the tags.</p>
<p>Bioinformatic comments:</p>
<p>(1) In the previous study (Menendez et al. 2020), ATAC-seq and regulatory elements are employed in the analysis, while a similar analysis is missing in this study. It will be informative to show the motif enrichment analysis at promoter regions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the most hair cell-like cluster 3 (RV-R3).</p>
<p>(2) In the previous study (Menendez et al. 2020), it was stated that SAPG can convert supporting cells to hair cells, while in this study, the authors stated that &quot;reprogramming with SAPG does not activate supporting cell networks in the stable cell line&quot;. Can the authors provide more analysis/comments on this difference?</p>
<p>(3) The approach in this study tends to generate a very similar level of expression for the SAPG factors, while the real levels of expression might be different for actual transcriptional regulation, eg, Figure 1C. How will this very close expression level of SAPG affect the features of the induced hair cell?</p>
<p>(4) Figure 5B, missing color bar to show the DEG strength in the heatmap. Why are Six1 and Gfi1 not shown in this heatmap?</p>
