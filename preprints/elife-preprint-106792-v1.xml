<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cost-benefit decisions are ubiquitous in animal behavior, driven by universal evolutionary pressures to maximize survival and reproductive success. Foraging, mate selection, parental investment, and territoriality each demand a balance between costs, such as energy expenditure and risk, and benefits such as resources, mates, and offspring. A better understanding of cost-benefit decision-making, including its biological basis, would advance a variety of fields, including economics, psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral ecology.</p>
<p>Economic theorists have developed a variety of formal models of cost-benefit decision-making by focusing on <italic>discounting</italic> behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Samuelson, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Mazur and Coe, 1987</xref>). In this context, discounting refers to the tendency of individuals to <italic>devalue</italic> a reward based on the costs associated with it. Costs commonly investigated include delay, risk, and effort. In general, as cost increases, perceived or subjective value decreases. For example, in the case of delay discounting, receiving a guaranteed payment of $35 after 30 days is worth less than receiving $25 today if a person accepts the smaller immediate reward. In risk discounting, participants might choose to receive $50 for certain rather than a 50% chance of receiving $100. In effort discounting, participants might choose to receive $1 with no effort rather than $5 after repeatedly squeezing a stiff handgrip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Stanek and Richter, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies of discounting are not limited to humans. The literature on discounting in rodents is particularly rich, with multiple paradigms for all three forms of discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bailey, Simpson and Balsam, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gray <italic>et al</italic>., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Castrellon <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>). In models of delay discounting, for example, mice choose between low-reward and high-reward nose pokes, where the higher reward comes with a delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Isles <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). Risk discounting can be modeled by giving subjects a choice between a low-probability lever yielding a large reward (4 food pellets) and a high-probability lever yielding a small reward (1 food pellet) 100% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">St. Onge, Chiu and Floresco, 2010</xref>). Effort discounting can be modeled by giving rodents a choice between low-reward (2 food pellets) and high-reward (4 food pellets) arms of a T-maze where a physical barrier must be climbed to obtain the higher reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Salamone, Cousins and Bucher, 1994</xref>). However, behaviorists have also observed discounting in several species of nonhuman apes, monkeys, lemurs, jays, chickens, pigeons, honeybees, and other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Isles <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Green, Myerson and Calvert, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hayden, 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>The phylogenetic limits of discounting behavior are unknown. We therefore asked whether foraging decisions in the nematode worm <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibit discounting-like behavior. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an omnivorous bacterivore. Worms swallow bacteria through rhythmic contractions of the pharynx, a tube-shaped muscular organ that delivers bacterial particles to the gut; each pharyngeal contraction is called a pump. <italic>C. elegans</italic> primarily inhabits rotting plant material such as decaying fruits and stems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">FrÃ©zal and FÃ©lix, 2015</xref>). Its natural habitat contains thousands of different bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Samuel <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). Each species has a characteristic nutritional quality, defined in terms of the growth rate of individual worms cultured on that species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Samuel <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> food preferences are sensitive not only to nutritional quality but also to food density in a manner that satisfies quantitative economic criteria for choices based on subjective value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Katzen <italic>et al</italic>., 2023</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> foraging behavior has been used to investigate the neuronal and genetic basis of exploration-exploitation trade-offs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bendesky <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Milward <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), a classical example of cost-benefit decision-making. In the laboratory, worms feed on patches of bacteria grown on agarose plates. They leave and re-enter a patch many times. Leaving rates are low on high-quality lawns but increase if the bacterial food is depleted or is difficult to ingest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bendesky <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Milward <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Olofsson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheer and Bargmann, 2023</xref>). This response pattern suggests that leaving promotes exploration to find a better food source.</p>
<p>The fact that <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits subjective-value based choice and cost-benefit feeding decisions suggested to us that it might also exhibit discounting behavior. Of the various forms of discounting, we focused on effort discounting as it uniquely does not require learned instrumental responses, like lever pressing for rewards, which are not feasible in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We modeled our experimental procedure on rodent T-maze studies, where one arm requires more effort to reach the food reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). We baited the arms of a miniature T-maze with selected densities of a single species of bacteria. One arm contained normal bacteria, while the other arm contained a bacterial preparation in which the cells had been elongated, which we predicted would make them more effortful to ingest.</p>
<p>We found that worms exhibit choice behavior that closely resembles effort discounting. Given a choice between equal densities of normal and elongated bacteria, worms prefer normal bacteria. This preference can be reversed by presenting elongated bacteria at a higher density than normal bacteria, indicating that high food density compensates for greater effort, as in rodent models. Furthermore, worms can be made indifferent to the two food options by adjusting relative food densities. It is therefore possible to measure the extent of devaluation and accurately predict novel indifference points. Preference for normal bacteria can be attributed to an increased patch-leaving rate on elongated food. Additionally, typical levels of discounting require intact dopamine signaling. Our results expand the repertoire of cost-benefit behaviors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and demonstrate that lower invertebrates are capable of effort discounting-like behavior.</p>

<title>Elongated bacteria require more effort to eat</title>
<p>We conceptualized feeding effort in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as the amount of pharyngeal muscle activity required to ingest a given quantity of food. The starting point of our experiments was to make bacteria more effortful to consume. Computer simulations of pharyngeal mechanics predict that large bacterial cells are swallowed less efficiently than small cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avery and Shtonda, 2003</xref>). Consistent with this result, worms develop more slowly when cultured on large bacteria, possibly because they are acquiring nutrients less efficiently. These findings led to the hypothesis that larger bacteria require more effort to eat, necessitating more pharyngeal pumps per unit of food consumed. To test this hypothesis, we artificially increased the size of an easily ingested bacterium, <italic>Comamonas</italic> spp., using the antibiotic cephalexin. In Gram-negative bacteria such as <italic>Comamonas</italic>, cephalexin interferes with bacterial cell septation during mitosis, resulting in elongated, spaghetti-like bacterial filaments that nevertheless remain edible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Millet <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>Pharyngeal pumping rates in normal and elongated bacteria were measured in the reference strain N2 by placing individual worms in a microfluidic channel filled with a bacterial suspension and fitted with electrodes that record the electrical signals associated with each pharyngeal contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lockery <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). Bacteria were washed with cephalexin-free buffer before being fed to worms. Pumping frequencies in normal and elongated bacteria were equivalent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 1) indicating that worms expend approximately the same amount of effort per unit time feeding on normal and elongated food. To test the hypothesis that elongation interferes with food absorption, we measured nutrient uptake in worms cultured on normal or elongated bacteria, using fat stores as a proxy for carbohydrate and lipid consumption. This was done by staining fat stores with the specific label Oil-Red-O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Soukas <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>) and quantifying the density of staining after a two-day culture period extending from the L1 to the L4 stage. We found that fat levels were significantly lower in worms cultured on elongated food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B2</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 2). Given that pumping rate was unchanged in the presence of normal versus elongated bacteria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>), the lower fat stores observed in worms fed elongated bacteria suggest that the amount of nutrition incorporated per pump is lower in worms feeding on elongated versus normal bacteria. This supports our hypothesis that elongation impairs food transport, requiring longer feeding bouts and thus increased muscular activity to consume an equivalent amount of food.</p>

<p>Our effort-discounting paradigm assumes that the normal and elongated bacteria are equivalent except for the amount of effort required to consume them. For example, elongation could affect nutrient content or olfactory attractiveness of bacteria. <italic>C. elegans</italic> food preferences are sensitive to the nutrient content of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Feng <italic>et al</italic>., 2025</xref>). We therefore asked whether cephalexin treatment affects nutrient content. We focused on key macronutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. For protein and carbohydrates, we used colorimetric assays (Materials and Methods; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C,D</xref>). For lipids, we used phase separation to harvest and measure lipid content (Materials and Methods; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). In all three tests, we detected no differences between control and cephalexin-treated bacteria (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, rows 3-5). We conclude that cephalexin treatment does not alter bacterial nutritional composition.</p>
<p>Worms are attracted to particular species of bacteria by the characteristic mixture of volatile organic compounds each species emits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Worthy <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Thus, another concern is that cephalexin treatment might alter the odors produced by bacteria thereby changing their attractiveness. To control for this possibility, we performed a T-maze assay (Materials and Methods) in which patches of normal and elongated bacteria were placed at the ends of each respective arm. The patches contained equal volumes of bacteria at an optical density (OD) of 1.0. Patches were spiked with sodium azide, a paralytic agent, to trap worms once they reached a patch. Worms were placed at the base of the T-maze and allowed to explore it for 60 minutes after which the number of worms in each patch was counted. A food preference index (â1 â¤ ð¼ â¤ 1) was calculated, where positive and negative values indicate preference for normal and elongated bacteria respectively, and ð¼ â 0 denotes indifference between the two options (Materials and Methods). We found that worms under these conditions were indifferent (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F2</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 6). This result indicates that cephalexin treatment does not alter the relative attractiveness of normal or elongated bacteria.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<title>Worms devalue food that requires more effort to eat</title>
<p>Having demonstrated that elongated bacteria require more effort to eat are but equivalent to normal bacteria in terms of nutrition and attractiveness, we next asked whether <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a preference for the normal, easier-to-eat bacteria â evidence of effort discounting-like behavior. We tested this by measuring food preference in the T-maze assay using the same methodology as in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref> but without the paralytic agent, allowing individual worms to sample both patches. One arm of the T-maze was baited with normal bacteria at an OD of 1.0, while the other arm contained elongated bacteria at ODs of 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0. Worms explored the maze for 60 minutes and the food preference index was computed based on worm counts at the end of this period. There was a significant overall effect of optical density of elongated bacteria on preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 7). When normal and elongated bacteria were at the same concentration (OD 1), worms preferred normal bacteria (ð¼ = 0.10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 8). This demonstrates that worms do, in fact, devalue elongated food. When normal and elongated bacteria were at OD 1.0 and 2.0, respectively, worms preferred elongated bacteria (ð¼ = -0.17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 9). This suggests that, in the wormâs valuation system, higher food density compensates for greater effort. This outcome was not a foregone conclusion. For instance, it was possible that no amount of elongated food would be sufficient to make worms prefer it.</p>

<p>Our results are consistent with findings in rodents, where high-effort options are chosen when the food reward density is sufficiently high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Floresco, Tse and Ghods-Sharifi, 2008</xref>). When the optical densities of normal and elongated food were 1.0 and 1.5, respectively, worms were indifferent between the two options (ð¼ = 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 10). Indifference points are also observed in rodent studies of effort discounting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Salamone, Cousins and Bucher, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9a">van den Bos <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ostrander <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). Overall, we conclude that in feeding decisions, worms take into account both relative effort and relative food density.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>An economic model predicts novel indifference points</title>
<p>Indifference points are significant because, by definition, the presented options have equal perceived value, allowing for the quantification of devaluation. This quantification is only possible at an indifference point. For example, consider a hypothetical human scenario in which a participant is asked to choose between receiving $20 immediately or $20 with the added cost of climbing 20 flights of stairs. Most participants would choose the immediate $20. Given a choice between $20 immediately and $100 at the cost of climbing 20 flights of stairs, some participants might choose the $100 option. However, suppose that when given a choice between $20 immediately and $80 at the cost of climbing 20 flights of stairs, a particular participant is indifferent between the two options. For this person, under these circumstances, we can conclude that the $20 option is perceived as equal in value to the $80 option. In other words, the $80 option has been discounted (devalued) to $20.</p>
<p>Formally, at an indifference point,
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="641934v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
where ð¸ represents effort, ð<sub>0</sub>represents the original value of the reward before devaluation and ð(ð¸) is the discounted value of ð<sub>0</sub>. The quantity ð(ð¸) is the discount factor, which, in economic models of discounting, is a function of ð¸. From the above equation,
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="641934v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
with 0 â¤ ð(ð¸) â¤ 1; in the above example ð(ð¸) = 20/80 or 1/4. In economic models, ð(ð¸) is inversely related to ð¸ but the precise form of ð(ð¸) varies between models (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2ââfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p>
<p>In our experiments, ð¸ is determined by the degree of bacterial elongation. Although this quantity is unknown, it remained unchanged because we used the same cephalexin exposure protocol across experiments (see Materials and Methods). It is analogous to the fixed effort of climbing 20 flights of stairs in the hypothetical example. Assuming a linear relationship between optical density and perceived value, we can determine ð(ð¸) from the indifference point shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>, where ð<sub>0</sub> = OD 1.5 and ð(ð¸) = OD 1.0, yielding ð(ð¸) = 2/3. In the most basic models of discounting, ð(ð¸) is independent of ð<sub>0</sub>. Assuming independence, other values of ð<sub>0</sub> can be inserted into equation 1 to predict novel indifference points. For instance, setting ð<sub>0</sub> = OD 3 predicts indifference at ð(ð¸) = OD 2, and setting ð<sub>0</sub>= OD 0.75 predicts indifference at ð(ð¸) = OD 0.5. That is, any pair of optical densities (normal versus elongated) in a 2:3 ratio should be an indifference point. We tested these predictions by measuring preference in T-mazes baited with normal and elongated food at OD ratios (normal:elongated) of 2:3 and 0.5:0.75, finding indifference as predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, rows 11-14). The fact that standard discounting models correctly predict indifference points reinforces the conclusion that <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits discounting-like behavior.</p>

<title>Effort discounting-like behavior is based on assessment of the local food environment</title>
<p>We next investigated the behavioral mechanism through which effort influences food preference, examining how worms interact with patches of normal versus elongated food. We studied these interactions at the microscopic level of individual worms to explain behavior at the macroscopic level of T-maze assays. This was done by performing food-patch leaving assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheer and Bargmann, 2023</xref>) using either normal or elongated bacteria. Individual worms were transferred to a 1 cm diameter, nematode growth medium-filled arena containing a small patch (3â4 mm diameter) of normal or elongated bacteria (OD 1.0) at its center. The patch size was comparable to those in the T-maze assay. Each worm was video recorded for 15 minutes while it entered and left the patch multiple times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>For analysis, we took a kinetic approach to investigate the rates at which worms stochastically changed their position relative to the food patch. This approach is both simple, as it does not require assigning specific locomotory states at particular times to individual worms, and powerful, as it forms a bridge between the microscopic and macroscopic behavior of a stochastic system, thereby elucidating underlying dynamics. Accordingly, we defined three kinetic states based on occupancy of specific zones in the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref>):
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>State F, <italic>On Food</italic>: both head and tail of the worm were in contact with the food patch.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>State B, <italic>At Border</italic>: either the head or tail was in contact with the food patch, but not both.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>State O, <italic>Off Food</italic>: neither head nor tail was in contact with the food patch.</p></list-item>
</list>
This system contains four state transitions: F<monospace>â</monospace>B, B<monospace>â</monospace>O, O<monospace>â</monospace>B, and B<monospace>â</monospace>F. Behavior was analyzed in terms of state probabilities (ð<sub>F</sub>, ð<sub>B</sub>, ð<sub>O</sub>) and rate constants (ð<sub>FB</sub>, ð<sub>BO</sub>, ð<sub>OB</sub>, ð<sub>BF</sub>). State probability was defined as the fraction of total observation time the worm was in each state. Rate constants were defined as the number of transitions divided by the total time spent in the state of origin. Rate constants determine the probability per unit time of transitioning from one state to another and thus represent the underlying physical causes of state transitions.</p>
<p>We observed a variety of changes in kinetic parameters on elongated versus normal food. ð<sub>B</sub>and ð<sub>O</sub> increased at the expense of ð<sub>F</sub>, consistent with decreased preference for elongated food in T-maze assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3C</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, rows 15,16). The rate constants exhibited two key features. First, in control animals, between any pair of states, the mean rate constants leading to patch entry (O<monospace>â</monospace>B<monospace>â</monospace>F transitions) were greater than the mean rate constants leading to patch leaving (F<monospace>â</monospace>B<monospace>â</monospace>O transitions). In particular, ð<sub>BF</sub> &gt; ð<sub>FB</sub> and ð<sub>OB</sub> &gt; ð<sub>BO</sub> (Fig. D3 vs. D1 and Fig. D4 vs. D2; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, rows 17-23). This indicates a greater propensity to enter food patches than to leave them, which is consistent with efficient foraging. Second, changes in rate constants brought about by elongated food exhibited a distinctive pattern: the rates for patch leaving (ð<sub>FB</sub>, ð<sub>BO</sub>) were increased whereas the rates for patch entry (ð<sub>OB</sub>, ð<sub>BF</sub>) were unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3D</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, rows 24-28). Thus, worms exhibited a heightened propensity to leave elongated food, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheer and Bargmann, 2023</xref>). The fact that rates for patch entry were unaffected by elongated bacteria rules out a mechanism in which worms, exiting patches of elongated food (which is relatively undesirable), become reluctant to re-enter them. Finally, we found that speed on elongated food increased, whereas speed off food remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, rows 29-33). Applying the kinetic data of individual worms to the population level in T-maze assays suggests that effort discounting-like behavior could result from feeding decisions based on the local food environment rather than a direct comparison of patch contents across the arms of the T-maze.</p>

<title>Intact dopamine signaling is required for effort discounting-like behavior</title>
<p>A salient aspect of effort discounting in rodents is its sensitivity to changes in midbrain dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>). Increased signaling promotes preference for high-value, high-effort rewards, whereas decreased signaling promotes preference for low-value, low-effort rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bailey, Simpson and Balsam, 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hart and Izquierdo, 2019</xref>); in other words, increased dopamine signaling results in greater effort tolerance. Dopamine signaling is a candidate mechanism for the regulation of effort discounting-like behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> because it affects how worms respond to the presence and absence of food as they enter or leave food patches. Worms slow down when they encounter a food patch, a response that requires intact dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sawin, Ranganathan and Horvitz, 2000</xref>). When worms exhaust their food supply or are removed from a food patch, they engage in a bout of frequent, high-angled turns called area-restricted search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hills, Brockie and Maricq, 2004</xref>). This response also requires dopamine signaling.</p>
<p>To test whether dopamine signaling is involved in effort discounting-like behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we examined food preference in a variety of mutants with altered dopamine signaling. The gene <italic>cat-2</italic> encodes a tyrosine hydroxylase essential to the main synthesis pathway for dopamine; <italic>cat-2</italic> mutants are commonly used to reduce dopamine signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The gene <italic>dat-1</italic> encodes a dopamine transporter that mediates the reuptake of dopamine into presynaptic neurons; <italic>dat-1</italic> mutants are used to increase dopamine signaling. The effects of reduced dopamine signaling can also be investigated in dopamine receptor mutants. <italic>C. elegans</italic> has four genes encoding dopamine receptors with homology to dopamine receptors in mammals. Of these, <italic>dop-1</italic>, <italic>dop-2</italic>, and <italic>dop-3</italic> are the most thoroughly characterized to date. <italic>dop-1</italic> is a DRD1 homolog, whereas <italic>dop-2</italic> and <italic>dop-3</italic> are DRD2 homologs. The genes <italic>dop-1</italic> and <italic>dop-3</italic> are required for normal responses to the presence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Chase, Pepper and Koelle, 2004</xref>); <italic>dop-2</italic> is required for increased levels of activity in the absence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bastien <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). We found a significant overall effect of strain on food preference measured in the T-maze assay (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 34). Post hoc testing showed that <italic>cat-2</italic>, <italic>dat-1</italic>, <italic>dop-1</italic>, and <italic>dop-2</italic> were indistinguishable from N2, whereas <italic>dop-3</italic> mutants were significantly different from N2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 35). In particular, they were indifferent between the two food options, indicative of decreased effort discounting-like behavior (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 36). We conclude that fully intact dopamine signaling is required for normal effort discounting-like behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as in rodents. However, the fact that impaired dopamine signaling rendered worms indifferent between the food options suggests that decreased dopamine signaling increases tolerance for high-effort food, in contrast to its effect in rodents. The absence of an effect of the <italic>cat-2</italic> and <italic>dat-1</italic> mutations is puzzling in view of the requirement for <italic>dop-3</italic>. One possibility is that residual dopamine in the <italic>cat-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sanyal <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) is sufficient for normal effort discounting-like behavior and that normal levels of dopamine signaling are saturating, such that <italic>dat-1</italic> mutations have no effect.</p>

<title>Effort discounting-like behavior is not an adaptation to the laboratory environment</title>
<p>Finally, we considered the question whether effort discounting-like behavior may reflect adaptation to the laboratory environment. The reference strain used in this study, N2, has been cultured for over 50 years in the laboratory setting, where it is typically fed small, easily consumed bacteria, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> strain OP50. Consequently, it may have lost the ability to consume larger bacteria efficiently. To address this question, we tested whether any natural isolate strains would prefer normal over elongated bacteria. Accordingly, we performed T-maze assays on five such strains with normal and elongated food at OD 1.0. Natural isolate strains proved to be challenging to work with as they frequently escaped the maze or burrowed in the substrate. These traits reduced the number of countable worms per assay, leading to considerable variance in the data. Nevertheless, there was a significant overall effect of strain on mean preference index (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>; <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 37). Post hoc testing revealed that only the strain JU775 had a preference index that was significantly different from N2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 38) and that JU775âs preference was not distinguishable from zero (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 39). Thus, JU775 was indifferent between normal and elongated food. On the other hand, mean preference of DL238 was both different from zero (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 40) and indistinguishable from N2 (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row 38). That is, DL238 behaved like N2. We conclude that N2âs preference is not an adaptation to the laboratory environment. Between DL238 and JU775, there was a range of different responses, suggesting the possibility of genetic variation in preference for normal versus elongated food.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Effort discounting is a form of cost-benefit decision-making with implications for economics, psychology, neuroscience, behavioral ecology, and other fields. To investigate effort discounting in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, worms were given a choice between two patches of the same species of bacteria. One patch contained normal bacteria, whereas the other patch contained elongated bacteria, which we showed to be more effortful to consume yet similar to normal bacteria in nutrition and attractiveness. When the two types of bacteria were presented at equal density, worms preferred normal bacteria. Three lines of evidence suggest that this preference is analogous to the devaluation of a reward based on increased effort to obtain it: (1) Preference can be reversed by increasing the density of the effortful option. (2) The relative density of normal and effortful food can be titrated to an indifference point. (3) Widely used economic models of discounting correctly predict novel indifference points. Points (1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Floresco, Tse and Ghods-Sharifi, 2008</xref>) and (2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Salamone, Cousins and Bucher, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9a">van den Bos <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Ostrander <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), together with the requirement for intact dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Salamone <italic>et al</italic>., 2018</xref>) signaling, establish similarities to effort discounting in other animal models. The demonstration of effort discounting-like behavior in a lower invertebrate sets a new phylogenetic boundary on discounting behavior.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Relationship to previous work</title>
<p>The decision of whether to stay or leave a patch of food has been well studied in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bendesky <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Milward <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Olofsson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheer and Bargmann, 2023</xref>). Leaving is rare on rich patches of normal food but increases on depleted patches or when the mechanics of feeding have been genetically impaired. Both conditions would be expected to decrease feeding efficiency and thereby increase the amount of muscular effort required to obtain food. It is likely that patch-leaving rate in these studies and ours is linked to an internal signal of feeding efficiency. The nature of this signal remains to be determined, but it likely integrates pharyngeal pumping rate with the rate of food accumulation in the gut.</p>
<p>An increase in patch-leaving frequency in response to elongated bacteria has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheer and Bargmann, 2023</xref>). There are some significant differences between that study and ours: (1) <italic>E. coli</italic> was used instead of <italic>Comamonas</italic>; (2) bacteria were elongated with the antibiotic aztreonam which renders food inedible to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gruninger, Gualberto and Garcia, 2008</xref>; Ben Arous, Laffont and Chatenay, 2009), whereas the cephalexin treatment we used resulted in elongated but edible food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Millet <italic>et al</italic>., 2022</xref>); (3) worms were video-recorded for 40 minutes instead of 15 minutes; (4) food-patch leaving was defined using different behavioral criteria; (5) patch-entry rates were not considered. Nevertheless, our results confirm and extend the previous findings by showing that the effect of elongated food on patch-leaving rate is robust across bacterial species, varied degrees of edibility of elongated food, and differences in details of behavioral analysis.</p>

<sec id="s3b">
<title>Utility of economic modeling</title>
<p>Although <italic>C. elegans</italic> patch-leaving behavior has been described in detail before, placing it in an explicit economic context is new. This context provided a quantitative framework that enriched our study in two respects. First, it gave us a metric â the discount factor â for quantifying the extent to which effortful food was devalued by the worm. We observed that worms were indifferent when normal and elongated bacteria were at ODs 1.0 and 1.5, respectively, yielding a discount factor of 2/3. Second, this framework made testable predictions. At the level of effort determined by our cephalexin exposure protocol, any combination of optical densities of normal and elongated food in a 2:3 ratio should be an indifference point. This prediction was verified by measuring preference under conditions in which the optical density of elongated food was both higher and lower than the original value of 1.5. This result shows that standard models of effort discounting may apply to <italic>C. elegans</italic>. It will now be interesting to test whether the discount factor is sensitive to effort, as assumed in many discounting models (Figure 1ââ figure supplement 1). This could be done by identifying indifference points when effort is manipulated by changing cephalexin exposure conditions to increase or decrease the extent of elongation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s3c">
<title>A model of effort-discounting like behavior</title>
<p>We propose the following simple model of effort discounting-like behavior in T-maze assays based on our kinetic analysis of patch entry and exit. In the T-maze assay, worms preferentially accumulate in the patch containing normal food. In theory, this could be because worms leave patches of elongated food (F <monospace>â</monospace>B<monospace>â</monospace>O transitions) at a higher rate, enter patches of elongated food (O <monospace>â</monospace>B<monospace>â</monospace>F transitions) at a lower rate, or both. Our kinetic analysis favors the former. We found that the rates governing patch entry, ð<sub>OB</sub>and ð<sub>BF</sub>, were unchanged by the presence of elongated food, whereas the rates governing patch leaving, ð<sub>FB</sub>and ð<sub>BO</sub>, were increased. The increase in these two rate constants is likely the result of increased roaming, a state of arousal characterized by increased speed and a greater tendency to leave food patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fujiwara, Sengupta and McIntire, 2002</xref>; Ben Arous, Laffont and Chatenay, 2009; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Flavell <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Scheer and Bargmann, 2023</xref>). Our observation that speed increased on elongated food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3E</xref>) is consistent with increased roaming on these patches in the T-maze.</p>

<title>Role of dopamine signaling in effort discounting-like behavior</title>
<p>Fully intact dopamine signaling is required for normal effort discounting-like behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This finding is broadly consistent with the known requirements of dopamine signaling for foraging behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as our T-maze assay is essentially a foraging assay. <italic>C. elegans</italic> dopamine receptors DOP-1, DOP-2, and DOP-3 are required for normal responses to the presence or absence of food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Suo, Culotti and Van Tol, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bastien <italic>et al</italic>., 2024</xref>). Dopamine itself is required for area-restricted search in which worms, suddenly finding themselves outside a food patch, engage in a period of frequent locomotory reorientations in an attempt to relocate the food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hills, Brockie and Maricq, 2004</xref>). However, the relationship between dopamine signaling and effort discounting-like behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> remains an area for future research. The fact that decreased dopamine signaling in the <italic>dop-3</italic> mutant rendered worms indifferent between the food options suggests that decreased dopamine signaling <italic>increases</italic> tolerance for high-effort food, in contrast to its effects in rodents. This discrepancy may reflect a true difference in the function of dopamine in effort discounting in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and rodents, or methodological differences. Manipulations of dopamine signaling in rodent studies mainly involve acute experiments using pharmacological agents, whereas we studied worms with chronic, lifelong alterations in dopamine signaling.</p>
<p>In summary, our study provides strong evidence that <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits effort discounting-like behavior, reinforcing the idea that decision-making strategies based on effort-cost trade-offs are evolutionarily conserved. By demonstrating that worms devalue effortful food like higher organisms, we extend the phylogenetic boundary of this behavior. The application of an economic framework allowed us to quantify this effect and make testable predictions, confirming its robustness. Furthermore, our findings highlight the role of dopamine signaling in modulating effort sensitivity, suggesting potential parallels with vertebrate systems. Future research can now exploit the utility of <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a genetically tractable system to explore how environmental factors and genetic variations influence effort-based decision-making in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, providing deeper insights into the fundamental principles and molecular basis of cost-benefit decisions.</p>

The well plate was immediately placed on a stage 8 cm above a diffuse white-light source and imaged (2 or 5 frames per second, 23.4 Î¼m/pixel) for 15 minutes using a video camera (AmScope, 1080P, Irvine, CA, USA) fitted with a telephoto lens (Nikon USA, AF Micro Nikkor 60 mm, Melville, NY, USA). The distance between the lens and the stage was 50 cm. Worm tracks and locomotion parameters were extracted using WormLab software (MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT, USA) and analyzed using custom routines in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR, USA). To define the wormâs position with respect to the patch, its margin was traced manually.</p>

<title>Lipid</title>
<p>Lipid was quantified using the method of Aggeler <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aggeler, Then and Ghosh, 1987</xref>). We prepared 100 ÂµL of cell lysate and added: 500 ÂµL methanol, 250 ÂµL dichloromethane, and 100 ÂµL distilled H<sub>2</sub>O. The mixture was vortexed before adding an additional 375 ÂµL of distilled water. The solution was vortexed again to form an emulsion and then centrifugated at 4800 g for 10 minutes. The bottom layer of solution was transferred to a pre-weighed tube and then weighed again after the lipid layer dried. The difference in weight was used to measure the quantity of lipid per 100 ÂµL of cell lysate.</p>

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Stuhr and Curran, 2020</xref>). A 0.5% isopropanol solution of Oil-Red-O (Sigma-Aldrich, Oil-Red-O powder 00625, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was prepared several days before the assay. Bacterial cultures (Control and cephalexin) were prepared as described above and adjusted to OD 3 before being loaded onto fresh NGM plates. Seventeen young adult worms were placed on these plates and allowed to lay eggs for 5 hours before being removed. The plates were incubated at 20Â°C for two days. L4 larvae were harvested and washed in PBS + 0.01% Triton X-100. Worms were fixed with a 60% isopropanol solution and incubated with the Oil-Red-O solution for two hours on a rotating plate. Worms were washed twice with PBS + Triton 0.01% solution, first for 30 minutes, then for one hour, on a rotating plate. Stained worms were imaged on a microscope slide at 32Ã, and staining intensity was quantified using custom routines in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswega, OR, USA).</p>

<title>General</title>
<p>Statistical details for each test (figure panel, statistical test, effect or comparison tested, definition of units of replication, number of replicates, statistic value, degrees of freedom, <italic>p</italic>-value, and effect size) are compiled in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. These details are cited in the text using the notation â<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, row <italic>n</italic>,â where <italic>n</italic> is the row number in the table. For all comparisons, the centers of distributions were their arithmetic mean or median. For dispersion measures, we used 95% confidence intervals. The following statistical tests were employed according to the experimental design: We used <italic>t</italic>-tests to determine whether the mean differed from zero. To assess differences in pairs of means, we used <italic>t</italic>-tests and, when the data were not normally distributed (according to the Shapiro-Wilk test), the Mann-Whitney U test. For comparisons of three or more means we used 1-way or 2-way ANOVA with <italic>post hoc</italic> tests.</p>

<title>State probabilities</title>
<p>State probabilities are an instance of <italic>compositional data</italic>, meaning data that sum to 1 (or 100%), which requires special treatment.

<title>Number of replicates</title>
<p>In the case of <italic>assay plates</italic>, a replicate is unique cohort of worms on an assay plate, such as a T-maze. In the case of <italic>worms</italic>, a replicate is a unique animal tested once. Nutrient replicates (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1CâE</xref>) were biological or technical, as indicated in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The minimum sample size for the T-maze assays was based on pilot experiments that demonstrated the ability to detect moderate to small effects with 10â30 replicates per experimental condition.</p>
<p>Previously published EPG data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Katzen <italic>et al</italic>., 2021</xref>) showed that mutants or treatments could be distinguished with approximately 20 replicates; however, to ensure the detection of small effect sizes across experimental conditions, larger sample sizes were used.</p>

<sec id="s4i5">
<title>Effect size</title>
<p>For <italic>t</italic>-tests we used Cohenâs <italic>d</italic>. For Mann-Whitney U tests, we used the rank-biserial correlation with ð = 2 ðâ(ð<sub>1</sub>ð<sub>2</sub>) â 1, where ð is the Mann-Whitney statistic and ð<sub>1</sub> and ð<sub>2</sub>are group sizes.

<caption><title>Statistical test of the effect of cephalexin on state probabilities in Figure 3C.</title>
<p>State probabilities are an instance of <italic>compositional data</italic>, meaning data that sum to a constant (1 in this case). Such data require special treatment because a decrease in one variable means an increase in at least one other variable. Accordingly, data were first subjected to an isometric log ratio transform (see Materials and Methods). The transformation quantifies the change in <italic>balance</italic> between subsets of the data. Balances are indicated by the numbers in the figure. Here, the control balance between ð<sub>F</sub>and the reciprocal probabilities ð<sub>B</sub>and ð<sub>O</sub>(1.47) is decreased by cephalexin treatment (0.85). A <italic>t</italic>-test on individual worm balances revealed that ð<sub>F</sub>significantly decreased while the joint ð<sub>B</sub>and ð<sub>O</sub>data significantly increased. In contrast, a similar approach showed that the balance between ð<sub>B</sub>and ð<sub>O</sub>was not significantly affected.</p><p>This indicates that ð<sub>B</sub> and ð<sub>O</sub> increased by similar amounts.</p></caption>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Here, Millet et al. consider whether the nematode C. elegans 'discounts' the value of reward due to effort in a manner similar to that shown in other species, including rodents and humans. They designed a T-maze effort choice paradigm inspired by previous literature, but manipulated how effortful the food is to consume. C. elegans worms were sensitive to this novel manipulation, exhibiting effort-discounting-like behaviour that could be shaped by varying the density of food at each alternative in order to calculate an indifference point. This discounting-like behaviour was related to worms' rates of patch leaving, which differed between the low and high effort patches in isolation. The authors also found a potential relationship to dopamine signalling, and also that this discounting behaviour was not specific to lab-based strains of C. elegans.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The question is well-motivated, and the approach taken here is novel. The authors are careful in their approach to altering and testing the properties of the effortful, elongated bacteria. Similarly, they go to some effort to understand what exactly is driving behavioural choices in this context, both through the application of simple standard models of effort discounting and a kinetic analysis of patch leaving. The comparisons to various dopamine mutants further extend the translational potential of their findings. I also appreciate the comparison to natural isolate strains, as the question of whether this behaviour may be driven by some sort of strain-specific adaptation to the environment is not regularly addressed in mammalian counterparts. The manuscript is well-written, and the figures are clear and comprehensible.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Discounting is typically defined as the alteration of a subjective value by effort (or time, risk, etc.), which is then used to guide future decision-making. By adapting the standard t-maze task for C. elegans as a patch-leaving paradigm, the authors observe behaviour strongly consistent with discounting models, but that is likely driven by a different process, in particular by an online estimate of the type of food in the current patch, which then influences patch-leaving dynamics (Figure 3). This is fundamentally different from decision-making strategies relating to effort that have been described in the rodent and human literatures. Similarly, the calculation of indifference points at the group instead of at the individual level also suggests a different underlying process and limits the translational potential of their findings. The authors do not discuss the implications of these differences or why they chose not to attempt a more analogous trial-based experiment.</p>
<p>In the case of both the dopamine and natural isolate experiments, the data are very noisy despite large (relative to other C. elegans experiments) sample sizes. In the dopamine experiment, disruption of dop-1, dop-2, and cat-2 had no statistically significant effect. There do not appear to be any corrections for multiple comparisons, and the single significant comparison, for dop-3, had a small effect size. More detailed behavioural analyses on both these and the wild isolate strains, for example by applying their kinetic analysis, would likely give greater insight as to what is driving these inconsistent effects.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Millet et al. show that C. elegans systematically prefers easy-to-eat bacteria but will switch its choice when harder-to-eat bacteria are offered at higher densities, producing indifference points that fit standard economic discounting models. Detailed kinetic analysis reveals that this bias arises from unchanged patch-entry rates but significantly elevated exit rates on effortful food, and dop-3 mutants lose the preference altogether, implicating dopamine in effort sensitivity. These findings extend effort-discounting behavior to a simple nematode, pushing the phylogenetic boundary of economic cost-benefit decision-making.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>(1) Extends the well-characterized concept of effort discounting into _C. elegans_, setting a new phylogenetic boundary and opening invertebrate genetics to economic-behavior studies.</p>
<p>(2) Elegant use of cephalexin-elongated bacteria to manipulate &quot;effort&quot; without altering nutritional or olfactory cues, yielding clear preference reversals and reproducible indifference points.</p>
<p>(3) Application of standard discounting models to predict novel indifference points is both rigorous and quantitatively satisfying, reinforcing the interpretation of worm behavior in economic terms.</p>
<p>(4) The three-state patch-model cleanly separates entry and exit dynamics, showing that increased leaving rates-rather than altered re-entry-drive choice biases.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The authors establish a behavioral task to explore effort discounting in C. elegans. By using bacterial food that takes longer to consume, the authors show that, for equivalent effort, as measured by pumping rate, they obtain less food, as measured by fat deposition.</p>
<p>The authors formalize the task by applying a formal neuroeconomic decision-making model that includes value, effort, and discounting. They use this to estimate the discounting that C. elegans applies based on ingestion effort by using a population-level 2-choice T-maze.</p>
<p>They then analyze the behavioral dynamics of individual animals transitioning between on-food and off-food states. Harder to ingest bacteria led to increased food patch leaving.</p>
<p>Finally, they examined a set of mutants defective in different aspects of dopamine signaling, as dopamine plays a key role in discounting in vertebrates and regulates certain aspects of C. elegans foraging.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The behavioral experiments and neuroeconomic analysis framework are compelling and interesting, and make a significant contribution to the field. While these foraging behaviors have been extensively studied, few include clearly articulated theoretical models to be tested.</p>
<p>Demonstrating that C. elegans effort discounting fits model predictions and has stable indifference points is important for establishing these tasks as a model for decision making.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The dopamine experiments are harder to interpret. The authors point out the perplexing lack of an effect of dat-1 and cat-2. dop-3 leads to general indifference. I am not sure this is the expected result if the argument is a parallel functional role to discounting in vertebrates. dop-3 causes a range of locomotor phenotypes and may affect feeding (reduced fat storage), and thus, there may be a general defect in the ability to perform the task rather than anything specific to discounting.</p>
<p>That said, some of the other DA mutants also have locomotor defects and do not differ from N2. But there is no clear result here - my concern is that global mutants in such a critical pathway exhibit such pleiotropy that it's difficult to conclude there is a clear and specific role for DA in effort discounting. This would require more targeted or cell-specific approaches.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are other pathways known to affect responses to food and patch leaving decisions: serotonin, pigment-dispersing factor, tyramine, etc. The paper would have benefited from a clarification about why these were not considered as promising candidates to test (in addition to or instead of dopamine).</p>
