<abstract><p>Gaucher disease (GD), the most common lysosomal storage disorder, is caused by bi-allelic mutations in the <italic>GBA1</italic> gene. Variants in <italic>GBA1</italic> also represent the most frequent genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although GD and PD are clinically distinct disorders, they share key pathological features, including lysosomal dysfunction, mitochondrial stress, and redox imbalance. While PD has traditionally been studied in the context of neuronal decline, the contribution of non-neuronal organ systems remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that progressive renal dysfunction is a central, disease-modifying feature in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of GD and PD. We show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacking either the main fly orthologue of <italic>GBA1</italic>, <italic>Gba1b</italic>, or the mitophagy regulator <italic>Parkin</italic>, exhibit age-dependent degeneration of the renal system. This includes disorganisation of the Malpighian tubules, impaired nephrocyte function, redox imbalance, and lipid accumulation. These renal defects contribute to systemic physiological decline, including water retention, ionic hypersensitivity, and exacerbation of neurodegenerative phenotypes. Importantly, we identify redox dyshomeostasis, rather than classical oxidative stress, as a central pathogenic driver, marked by paradoxical sensitivity to both oxidative and reductive interventions. Notably, treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin selectively restores renal structure and function in <italic>Gba1b</italic> mutants, but not in <italic>Parkin</italic> mutants, revealing mechanistic divergence between lysosomal and mitochondrial stress. These findings uncover redox imbalance as a biomarker of renal vulnerability and establish the renal system as a critical, potentially disease-modifying organ in the systemic progression of GD and PD.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bi-allelic mutations in the <italic>GBA1</italic> gene, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the primary cause of the lysosomal storage disorder Gaucher disease (GD). Moreover, heterozygous <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations represent a significant genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Migdalska-Richards &amp; Schapira, 2016</xref>). GCase plays a crucial role in lysosomal homeostasis by facilitating the breakdown of glucosylceramide (GluCer) into ceramide and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Boer et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of normal GCase function in GD leads to the accumulation of lipid-laden Gaucher cells in multiple organs, primarily in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. These cells may also accumulate in other tissues, including the lymphatic system, lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys, heart, and, in rare cases, the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Cox, 2010</xref>). While the neurological and haematological manifestations of GD are well-documented, the impact of <italic>GBA1</italic> mutations on renal function remains an underexplored but emerging area of interest. Furthermore, the potential involvement of the renal system in PD is also becoming increasingly recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meléndez-Flores &amp; Estrada-Bellman, 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Gaucher macrophages have been identified within endothelial and interstitial regions of the kidney, where they may contribute to severe proteinuria. However, renal dysfunction remains a rare symptom in GD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Smith et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chander et al., 1979</xref>; Siegel et al., 1981; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Halevi et al., 1993</xref>). GluCer accumulation has also been observed in the glomeruli of patients with diabetic nephropathy and polycystic kidney disease (PKD), as well as in rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Shayman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Zador et al., 1993</xref>; Deshmukh et al., 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Natoli et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with GluCer synthase inhibitors has been shown to ameliorate glomerular degeneration in PKD, and clinical trials are underway, highlighting the critical role of GluCer regulation in maintaining renal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Natoli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Shayman et al., 2016</xref>).</p>
<p>Loss of function mutations in <italic>LIMP2</italic> (also known as <italic>SCARB2</italic>), a sorting receptor that specifically directs GCase to the lysosome, have been identified in multiple families as the cause of progressive action myoclonus and renal failure (AMRF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Berkovic et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Balreira et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chaves et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Hopfner et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to myoclonus, AMRF is marked by proteinuria, weight gain, and fluid retention leading to oedema. The mechanism underlying <italic>LIMP2</italic>-associated AMRF is likely distinct from GD, as GluCer-filled macrophages are not observed in tissue samples from AMRF patients. Although not directly implicated in renal pathology, AMRF patients and <italic>Limp2</italic> knockout mice show a several fold increase in circulating levels of glucosylsphingosine, a water soluble deacylated form of GluCer that can be excreted in urine. This increase is also seen in GD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Dekker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gaspar et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, renal failure is a major complication in Fabry disease, another lysosomal storage disorder characterised by the accumulation of the complex glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (GB3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Nakao et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>An emerging link between PD and kidney dysfunction is becoming increasingly evident. Large cohort studies involving patients with nephrotic syndrome, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) have consistently reported a significantly higher incidence of PD or parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melendez-Flores, 2021</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether renal and neurological diseases directly influence one another or whether they share a common upstream pathological mechanism. Evidence from large datasets, including South Korean populations and UK Biobank samples, suggests that a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and elevated proteinuria are associated with an increased risk of developing PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Nam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Peng et al., 2024</xref>). In individuals with PD, an inverse correlation has been observed between GFR and serum levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuronal damage, as well as between GFR and cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Qu et al., 2023</xref>). These findings imply that kidney dysfunction is closely linked to the severity of PD. Notably, both PD and various forms of kidney disease are characterised by elevated oxidative stress, suggesting that shared pathophysiological mechanisms may underlie this association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pizzino et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>Fruit flies are increasingly used as models for renal disorders. First, they serve as a kidney stone model, as xanthic/uric acid crystals can form in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Malpighian tubules (MTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dow &amp; Romero, 2010</xref>). Second, they are used to study podocyte biology, as the slit diaphragm structure of mammalian podocytes is conserved in fly nephrocytes, a large class of cells adjacent to the heart tube that filter the haemolymph through fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Weavers et al., 2009</xref>). Water retention can result from the loss of filtration efficiency in the MTs, caused by the breakdown of occluding junctions between epithelial cells or impaired renewal of differentiated renal epithelial cells (Martinez-Corrales et al., 2016; Denholm et al., 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dornan et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Using our previously characterized GD <italic>Drosophila</italic> model lacking <italic>Gba1b</italic>, the primary fly orthologue of <italic>GBA1</italic>, we demonstrate progressive degeneration of the renal system, loss of organismal water homeostasis and ionic hypersensitivity. Specifically, <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies exhibit reduced glomerular filtration capacity in pericardial nephrocytes, along with widespread cellular degeneration in the MTs. Furthermore, renal system dysfunction negatively impacts both organismal and neuronal health in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies, including autophagic-lysosomal status in the brain. Additionally, we show that the loss of Parkin, a familial PD-linked E3 ubiquitin ligase, similarly leads to renal defects. Notably, renal dysfunction in GD flies can be alleviated through rapamycin administration, highlighting a potential therapeutic avenue for lysosomal and neurodegenerative diseases linked to GBA1 dysfunction.</p>

<title>Fly stocks and rearing</title>
<p>Flies were reared at 25°C and 50% relative humidity in a 12:12LD cycle on SYA Food (1.5% agar, 5% sucrose, 10% dried yeast [Leiber Bierhefe], 0.3% nipagin, 0.3% propionic acid). Experimental flies were raised at a defined density, mated for 1 day and females were subsequently maintained at a density of 15 flies per vials and changed to fresh food every 2-3 days. The following fly stocks were acquired from the Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center: <italic>Gba1b</italic><sup>CRIMIC</sup> (BL#78943), <italic>park<sup>1</sup></italic> (BL#34747), C724-Gal4 (BL#99567), c42-Gal4 (BL#30825), tub-Gal4 (BL#5138), UAS-<italic>CD8RFP</italic> (BL#27392), UAS-mcherry.nls (BL#38424), UAS-mitoGFP (BL#8442), UAS-yfpPTS (BL#64247), <italic>klf15</italic> (BL#18979), UAS-<italic>Sod1</italic> (BL#24754), UAS-<italic>Sod2</italic> (BL#24494), UAS-<italic>CatA</italic> (BL#24621), UAS-mitoroGFP2.grx1 (BL#67664), UAS-<italic>cytoroGFP2</italic>.grx1 (BL#67662), UAS-<italic>Park</italic> (BL#51651). <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies were previously constructed by homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kinghorn et al., 2016</xref>). UAS-<italic>Nrf2</italic> and UAS-<italic>Keap1</italic> were gifts from Dirk Bohmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Sykiotis &amp; Bohmann, 2008</xref>) and UAS-mitoQC was a gift from Alex Whitworth (University of Cambridge; Lee et al., 2016).</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Water weight assays</title>
<p>Flies were frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately weighed on an AT-201 Mettler Toledo Analytical Balance. Flies were then dried out for 24 hrs in an 80°C oven and re-weighed. The total water volume was calculated as the weight lost from drying.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2c">
<title>Hemolymph extraction</title>
<p>Groups of 15 flies were beheaded, placed upside-down in a truncated pipette tip in a 1.5ml Eppendorf and centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 rpm at 4°C. The haemolymph was then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Drinking assays</title>
<p>Assay 1: Groups of 15 female flies were placed in vials containing dried fly food and a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube filled with water. The Eppendorf tubes were weighed before and after a 24-hr period. The difference in weight, adjusted for evaporation using a control tube lacking a fly, was calculated and normalised per fly. Assay 2: Cohorts of flies were starved for 5 hours before being provided with a water source for 1 hour. To estimate water consumption, the mean weight of water in the starved cohort was subtracted from the weight of flies given access to water.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2e">
<title>Cold-stress assays</title>
<p>&gt;75 flies of each genotype were placed in empty glass tubes and uniformly submerged in an ice bucket for 10 minutes. To assess chill-coma recovery, flies were filmed and considered recovered once they stood upright and began walking. Survival was scored periodically over a 3-day period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2f">
<title>Lifespan</title>
<p>Lifespan assays were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atilano et al., 2023</xref>). Eggs were collected over a 24-hour period on grape juice agar plates and then pipetted onto SYA food at a uniform density. Female flies were split into groups of 15 in vials, transferred to fresh food every 2–3 days, and monitored for survival.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Ionic stress and natriuresis assays</title>
<p>Experimental flies were raised on SYA food as described above for three weeks before being transferred to food containing 4% NaCl or KCl, with or without a water source provided by 1% agar in a pipette tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Van Dam et al., 2020</xref>). For dehydration assays, flies were raised without a water source on active dry yeast (<italic>Saf-Levure</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2h">
<title>FRUMS (Fluorescent Renal Uptake and Metabolite Secretion) assay</title>
<p>A volume of 23 nL of 2.5% (w/v) Brilliant Blue FCF-E133 (Florio Colori) in ddH₂O was injected into the haemolymph using a Drummond Nanoject II Microinjector. Blue flies were then scored manually every hour for qualitative clearance of dye from the hemolymph and subsequently from the MT and gut.</p>

<sec id="s2i">
<title>Tissue preparation and immunostaining</title>
<p>MTs and brains were dissected in ice-cold PBS and immediately fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes. The tissues were then washed three times for 20 minutes each in PBS-T (0.5% Triton-X), followed by a 30-minute incubation in blocking solution (5% Normal Goat Serum in PBS-T). Primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C with gentle nutation. Tissues were then washed three times for 20 minutes in PBS-T and incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution for 2 hours at room temperature. This was followed by three additional 20-minute washes in PBS-T before mounting in Vectashield Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories). Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-cora C615.15 (DSHB,1:200), rabbit anti-Ref(2)P (ab178440, 1:200), mouse anti-FK2 (Sigma 04263, 1: 800). The secondary antibodies used were goat anti-mouse Alexa488 (A11001) and goat-rabbit Alexa568 (A11036), both at a dilution of 1:250. For BODIPY experiments, 20 µM BODIPY<sup>TM</sup> 505/515 was incubated 1:100 in addition to the primary antibody.</p>
<p>Tissues with genetically encoded fluorescent markers (YFP-PTS, mito-Grx1-roGFP2 and cyto-Grx1-roGFP2) were dissected in 20 mM NEM in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes, washed for 20 minutes in PBS-T, and mounted in PBS.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2j">
<title>Dextran uptake assay</title>
<p>Fly abdomens were dissected from 28-day-old flies and incubated in 0.33 mg/mL Texas Red 10,000 MW dextran (Thermo Fisher) in PBS for 5 minutes. The abdomens were then washed twice in PBS, fixed in 4% PFA for 20 minutes, and washed for 20 minutes in PBS-T. Finally, the samples were mounted in VECTASHIELD mounting medium with DAPI and imaged on a Zeiss 700 confocal microscope.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2k">
<title>Live imaging</title>
<p>Tissues were dissected at room temperature and transferred to 50 nM Lysotracker<sup>TM</sup> Red DND-99 (Thermo Fisher), Mitotracker<sup>TM</sup> Red CMH<sub>2</sub>XROS, or DHE (Thermo Fisher) in PBS, followed by immediate imaging at 20x magnification using a Zeiss 700 or 880 confocal microscope. For mitoQC experiments, MTs were dissected in cold PBS and immediately imaged. For lipid peroxidation analysis, MTs were dissected in PBS and incubated in 20 µM BODIPY<sup>TM</sup> 581/591 in Schneider’s medium for 30 minutes. After two PBS washes, tissues were mounted in PBS and immediately imaged</p>

<title>Reduced glutathione (GSH) assay</title>
<p>GSH levels were measured using a Glutathione Assay Kit (Cayman Chemicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, groups of 10 flies were homogenised with glass beads (Sigma) in MES buffer using a Precellys Ribolyser. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 minutes and the resulting supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Samples were deproteinated in 50 mg/ml metaphosphoric acid and basified with 1/20 4M triethanolamine. A 50 µl aliquot of each sample was loaded into Greiner transparent flat-bottom 96-well plates (Cellstar) containing 150 µl enzyme buffer. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm at 5-minute intervals for 30 minutes using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader. GSH values were calculated from the slope of a standard curve generated using known Glutathione Persulfide (GSSG) concentrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2m">
<title>NAD/NADH assay</title>
<p>NAD/NADH quantification was performed using a NAD+/NADH Quantification Colorimetric Kit (Biovision) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Groups of 10 flies were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 300 µL of extraction buffer. Samples were deproteinated by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C using Amicron Ultra 0.5 mL 10,000 MW filters. The samples were then divided into NAD and NADH groups, where NAD was decomposed by incubation at 60°C for 1 hour. Following this, samples were incubated in NAD cycling buffer and developer, and absorbance readings were taken at 450 nm using a Tecan Infinite M200 plate reader.</p>

<title>Flies lacking <italic>Gba1b</italic> display age-dependent MT degeneration</title>
<p>Since both sphingolipid accumulation and PD are linked to renal disease, we aimed to assess the renal system in a previously characterised GD <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, lacking the main fly orthologue of <italic>GBA1</italic>, known as <italic>Gba1b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kinghorn et al., 2016</xref>). Fly MTs consist of a tubulated epithelial sheet composed of principal cells (PCs) and stellate cells (SCs) surrounding a lumen. To investigate structural integrity, we stained the MTs with coracle (Cora), a core component of the septate junction (SJ), a specialised cell-cell junction which is essential for barrier function and transcellular water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dornan et al., 2023</xref>). In control fly MTs, Cora marked clearly defined cell vertices throughout the tubule. However, in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fly MTs, the number of well-defined SJ vertices was significantly reduced, and Cora was frequently mislocalised throughout the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Notably, these structural abnormalities were absent in day 1 <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fly MTs, indicating that the loss of tissue architecture is progressive.</p>

<p>Since lipid aggregation is a hallmark of metabolic disorders, we stained MTs with the lipid marker BODIPY, which revealed a significant increase in luminal lipids in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies compared to controls (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Moreover, counter-staining with the nuclear marker DAPI identified a significant increase in small nuclei proliferating from the ureter, presumptively corresponding to renal stem cells (RSCs), extending into the absorptive zone of the MT in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies compared to age-matched control MTs. RSCs are known to proliferate in response to stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Singh et al., 2007</xref>), resulting in decreased water flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Martinez-Corrales et al., 2019</xref>).</p>
<p>Transcellular water flux principally occurs through SCs, and given the observed loss of normal tissue architecture, we quantified SCs in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fly MTs through expression of the membrane-localised CD8:RFP using the SC-specific driver C724-Gal4. We observed a significant reduction in SC numbers in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fly MTs compared to those seen in control flies, alongside a loss of their characteristic star or bar morphology (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The gut and brain of <italic>Gba1b<bold><sup>-/-</sup></bold></italic> flies, similar to macrophages in GD patients, are characterised by enlarged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Kinghorn et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atilano et al 2023</xref>). Consistent with this, staining of MTs with LysoTracker<sup>TM</sup>, an acidic vesicle dye, revealed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> fly MTs, consistent with pronounced lysosomal expansion in a subset of renal cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>As MTs play a critical role in redox balance, with mitochondrial activity in PCs being pivotal to physiological function, we examined mitochondrial morphology using mito-GFP expression. In control PCs, mitochondria appeared fused and tubulated, whereas in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-<bold>/-</bold></sup></italic> fly MTs, they were predominantly punctate, indicative of defective mitochondrial fusion-fission homeostasis (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We next stained with MitoTracker<sup>TM</sup> CM-H2XRos, a mitochondrial-specific fluorescent probe used to measure reactive oxygen species (ROS). This demonstrated reduced staining intensity in the MTs of <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies. This is likely consistent with a decrease in mitochondrial ROS production, due to impaired mitochondrial membrane potential and dysfunction of the electron transport chain (ETC) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). In keeping with this, NADH, but not NAD+, was decreased in whole <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies, suggesting impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism (Figure S1A).</p>
<p>Finally, to assess MT physiological function, we employed the FRUMs assay, in which blue food dye is injected into the hemolymph, and its clearance into the tubules and subsequent excretion serve as a proxy for water homeostasis. <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies exhibited increased retention of blue dye in both the hemolymph and subsequently the tubules, indicating impaired MT-mediated hemolymph clearance (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>Ion and water homeostasis is dysregulated in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies</title>
<p>To investigate the impact of these defects in MT morphology and function on water homeostasis, we measured water weight in aged <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies. Our analysis revealed an increase in both total water weight and percentage body water weight (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>), partially attributable to an elevated hemolymph volume in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Notably, this increase was not due to heightened water intake, as <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies exhibited either reduced or unchanged drinking behaviour across multiple assays (Figure S2A-B).</p>

<p>To determine the physiological consequences of this water retention, we subjected <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies to a desiccative stress assay and observed that they exhibited a small but significant dehydration resistance compared to controls (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies also retained a higher level of water throughout the course of the dehydration assay (Figure S2C). As MTs play a crucial role in regulating ion homeostasis, we subjected <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies to ionic stress assays using food supplemented with 4% NaCl or KCl. We observed that <italic>Gba1b</italic> mutants were highly sensitive to both ionic stress conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D, E</xref>). To determine whether the lethality observed in these assays was due to desiccative stress from water loss accompanying excess salt efflux through the MTs, or direct cellular ionic stress, we hypothesised that providing a water source should enable flies with functional MTs to maintain homeostasis under ionic stress conditions. To test this, we measured both water levels and lifespan under ionic stress while supplementing a water source via 1% agar-filled pipette tip (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>, S2D). Water supplementation led to a substantial lifespan extension in control flies exposed to 4% NaCl, with a smaller yet significant extension in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). NaCl exposure led to a reduction in water weight, which was rescued by water supplementation in control but not <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies (Figure S2D). These observations suggest that the early mortality in control flies under ionic stress primarily results from dehydration rather than direct ionic toxicity. On the other hand, although dehydration contributes to <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mortality, a significant component of their susceptibility to ionic stress is likely due to defective natriuresis, leading to impaired ion homeostasis.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, cold tolerance is closely linked to altered ion homeostasis. To investigate this, we subjected aged control and <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies to a chill-coma stress assay and found that flies lacking G<italic>ba1b</italic> exhibited a remarkable resistance to chill-induced damage, whereas control flies experienced rapid mortality within 24 hours (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Hemolymph clearance and nephrocyte function is diminished in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies</title>
<p>Podocyte-like nephrocytes filter small macromolecules through a size-excluding slit-diaphragm system, after which they are then taken up non-selectively through fluid-phase endocytosis and degraded in the lysosome (Weavers et al., 2019). To assess endocytic function, we incubated dissected pericardial nephrocytes with Texas-red dextran to visualise early endosomes. At 4 weeks of age, <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies exhibited a population of endosome-negative nephrocytes, indicating a loss of endosomal activity, and consequently, hemolymph filtration (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>).

These findings suggest that defects in both MT function and glomerular filtration contribute to increased circulating waste, potentially leading to secondary toxic consequences.</p>

<title><italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> MTs display loss of redox homeostasis capacity</title>
<p>The renal system is key to organismal redox homeostasis, a process thought to play a key role in the pathogenic mechanisms of GD and PD progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kishi et al., 2024</xref>). Glutathione (GSH), the most abundant antioxidant in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, plays a crucial role in redox homeostasis by reducing hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and lipid hydroperoxides (ROOH) via GSH peroxidases. To evaluate redox balance, we measured total GSH levels in whole flies from both control and <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> groups. Our results revealed a significant decrease in GSH in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies, indicating a compromised ability to maintain redox equilibrium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). To further evaluate the glutathione redox potential (E<sub>GSH</sub>) in MTs, we utilised the redox-sensitive green, fluorescent biosensor Grx1-roGFP2, targeted to both the mitochondria and cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Albrecht et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings revealed a shift toward a more reduced glutathione state in the mitochondria of <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fly tubules compared to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, while cytosolic glutathione typically maintains a less oxidised GSH/GSSG ratio than mitochondria, it was paradoxically more oxidised in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tubules relative to controls (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>). This indicates that despite a potential reduction in mitochondrial ROS production, the tubules fail to effectively regulate basal ROS levels. These abnormalities may contribute to the impaired physiological function of the MTs.</p>

Since glutathione primarily detoxifies H₂O₂ and ROOH, rather than superoxide, this reduction could indicate lower mitochondrial ROS production or altered superoxide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Winterbourn, 2016</xref>).</p>

<title>Induction of antioxidant effector Nrf2 worsens renal and neurological phenotypes in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies</title>
<p>To investigate the contribution of redox dyshomeostasis to <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fly disease phenotypes, we overexpressed the antioxidant regulator Nrf2/CnC in PCs, a manipulation previously shown to prematurely impair renal function (Burbridge et al., 2021). Consistent with this, whilst Nrf2 overexpression resulted in a modest but statistically significant lifespan reduction in control flies, its overexpression in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies led to a dramatic lifespan shortening (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies have an increased susceptibility to antioxidant-mediated tubular dysfunction. In addition, we observed that Nrf2 overexpression in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies resulted in an increase in renal stem cell proliferation at the ureter (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>Given that Nrf2 overexpression shortens lifespan in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies, we investigated the effects of overexpressing its downstream antioxidant targets, <italic>Sod1</italic>, <italic>Sod2</italic>, and <italic>CatA</italic>, both ubiquitously using the <italic>tub-Gal4</italic> driver and with <italic>c42-Gal4</italic>, which expresses in PCs. While antioxidant gene overexpression provided variable benefits in healthy control flies, ubiquitous or tubule overexpression was detrimental in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies, shortening the lifespan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B-F</xref>), suggesting that MT and organismal responses to oxidative stress may advance disease phenotypes and contribute to systemic redox imbalance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examined the effects of PGC1α overexpression, a key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and an upstream activator of Nrf2. Ubiquitous overexpression of PGC1α extended lifespan in healthy controls but did not significantly impact the lifespan of <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies (Figure S3C). Expression of either PGC1α or NDI, a yeast NADH dehydrogenase that bypasses mitochondrial complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Sanz et al., 2010</xref>), using <italic>c42-Gal4</italic> led to a reduction in lifespan in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies, suggesting that mitochondrial or ETC defects in tubules may not be the key driver of redox-stress in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>(Figure S3C, D).</p>
<p>Given that antioxidant activation is detrimental in <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>flies, we investigated whether repressing the antioxidant response could have a protective effect.

<p>Mitophagy occurs in a spatially segregated manner in the mammalian kidney, where intense mitolysosome staining is visible in the proximal convoluted tubule, the site of high active transport demands and, consequently, elevated mitochondrial activity and turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Mcwilliams et al., 2016</xref>).

<p>Using tubule-specific expression of mitoQC, we found that <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>fly MTs exhibited a reduced ratio of non-acidified to acidified mitochondria compared to control flies, suggesting that unlike <italic>park<sup>1/1</sup></italic> tubules, mitophagy remains functional and potentially overactive.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Despite growing epidemiological evidence linking renal disease to neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Meléndez-Flores &amp; Estrada-Bellman, 2021</xref>), the mechanistic and directional relationships between these conditions remain unresolved. Here, we identify progressive renal dysfunction as a previously underappreciated feature in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of GD and PD. Flies lacking either the main <italic>GBA1</italic> orthologue, <italic>Gba1b,</italic> or the mitophagy regulator <italic>Parkin, park,</italic> exhibit age-dependent degeneration of the renal system. This is characterised by disorganised MTs, impaired nephrocyte function, redox imbalance, and lipid accumulation. These renal impairments contribute to organismal decline, including fluid imbalance, ionic hypersensitivity, and worsening neurodegeneration.</p>
<p>A key finding is that <italic>Gba1b</italic>-deficient flies exhibit a collapse of redox homeostasis that does not align with classical oxidative stress. Redox-sensitive probes revealed lipid peroxidation and cytosolic oxidation alongside modest mitochondrial reduction in <italic>Gba1b</italic>⁻<sup>/</sup>⁻ MTs. This divergence was further supported by opposite responses to redox-targeted interventions. In <italic>Gba1b</italic><sup>⁻/</sup>⁻ flies, overexpression of Nrf2 or antioxidant enzymes (SOD1, SOD2, CatA), and supplementation with ascorbic acid, all led to worsened survival. These results suggest a critical loss of redox buffering capacity, where both oxidative and reductive shifts are deleterious. This redox fragility sets <italic>Gba1b</italic>-related pathology apart from conventional oxidative stress models (Dias et al., 2014) and echoes recent findings that both oxidative and reductive stress can impair renal function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Burbridge et al., 2021). These observations underscore the potential risks of unselective antioxidant therapies in <italic>GBA1</italic>-related diseases and suggest that redox tone may serve as a biomarker of tissue vulnerability and therapeutic responsiveness.</p>
<p>In contrast to <italic>Gba1b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> flies, those lacking <italic>park</italic> benefit from antioxidant pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Whitworth et al., 2005</xref>), consistent with oxidative stress as a key driver of pathology. This model-specific disparity underscores the need for tailored therapeutic approaches. Clinically, mitophagy has been shown to protect against renal injury and nephrotoxicity (Tang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018), reinforcing <italic>parkin</italic>’s role in renal health.</p>
<p>Notably, the source of renal damage differs between models. In <italic>park</italic><sup>1/1</sup> flies, renal defects are tissue-autonomous: tubule-specific re-expression of <italic>Parkin</italic> restores water regulation. Conversely, <italic>Gba1b</italic> is not expressed in the renal system, pointing to a non-cell-autonomous mechanism of dysfunction. This suggests that systemic factors, such as circulating glycosphingolipids or a loss of extracellular vesicle-mediated delivery of GCase, may mediate renal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, sphingolipid accumulation is a hallmark of GD, and lipid dysregulation has been directly implicated in renal pathology. For example, mutations in the ceramide synthase gene <italic>CERS2</italic> cause renal dysfunction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Imgrund et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, ceramide buildup induces podocyte apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yoo et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila sply</italic> mutants, deficient in sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, also display nephrotic-like phenotypes with slit diaphragm defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lovric et al., 2017</xref>). It should be noted, however, that these are developmental and static in nature, unlike the progressive degeneration in <italic>Gba1b</italic>⁻<sup>/</sup>⁻ flies.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial analysis further revealed that <italic>Gba1b</italic> deficiency impairs mitochondrial morphology, reduces membrane potential, and limits NADH availability, all hallmarks of dysfunction seen in <italic>Gba1</italic>-deficient mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Osellame et al., 2013</xref>). However, mitophagy appears preserved in <italic>Gba1b</italic>⁻<sup>/</sup>⁻ MTs, in contrast to <italic>park</italic><sup>1/1</sup> flies. A reduction in intact mitochondria in both models suggests that excessive degradation may contribute to renal stress, albeit through divergent upstream mechanisms.</p>
<p>Strikingly, rapamycin, a known mTOR inhibitor and autophagy inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bjedov et al., 2010</xref>), rescued renal structure and function in <italic>Gba1b</italic><sup>⁻/</sup>⁻ flies, including water retention, RSC proliferation, and lipid peroxidation. This aligns with findings that mTOR overactivation contributes to podocyte damage in glomerular disease (Godel et al., 2011). These effects occurr despite unaltered mitophagy, pointing toward alternative mechanisms such as improved lipid handling or redox buffering. In contrast, rapamycin had limited effects on renal function in <italic>park¹/¹</italic> flies, highlighting mechanistic divergence between lysosomal and mitochondrial models. In GD, where lysosomal clearance is impaired, rapamycin may enhance autophagic flux to bypass the enzymatic block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Atilano et al., 2023</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, these findings establish renal degeneration as a driver of systemic decline in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of GD and PD. Recent evidence for a brain-kidney axis in PD, where α-synuclein accumulates in renal tissue and may retrogradely propagate to the brain under renal failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Yuan et al., 2025</xref>), supports the relevance of the renal system to PD. We propose that renal oxidative stress could influence such inter-organ signalling, with potential feedback on neurodegenerative cascades. Future validation of these mechanisms in mammalian models will be essential to define translational relevance.</p>
<p>If confirmed, our findings could inform new biomarker strategies and therapeutic targets for <italic>GBA1</italic> mutation carriers and other at-risk groups. Maintaining renal health may represent a modifiable axis of intervention in neurodegenerative disease. Our results also reinforce the need for precision in redox modulation, particularly where antioxidant therapies may cause harm. Finally, the opposing effects of rapamycin in <italic>Gba1b</italic> and <italic>park</italic> models demonstrate that effective treatments must account for the underlying molecular defect. Renal imaging or biomarker assays in <italic>GBA1</italic> mutation carriers may provide a means to monitor disease progression or therapeutic response. Identifying redox fragility and mTOR sensitivity as actionable parameters opens new avenues for screening in both invertebrate and vertebrate systems.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we uncover a critical and previously overlooked role for the renal system in GD and PD pathogenesis. We demonstrate that redox dyshomeostasis, renal degeneration, and mTOR-responsive pathways are central features of disease in <italic>Gba1b</italic>-deficient flies, and mechanistically distinct from those in <italic>Park</italic> mutant models. These findings support a broader, integrated view of neurodegenerative disease and pave the way for organ-specific interventions in disorders long considered purely neurocentric. Renal health, redox homeostasis and autophagy status emerge as key modulators of disease trajectory, offering a new conceptual and therapeutic framework beyond the brain.</p>

<p>This is a <bold>valuable</bold> manuscript that reframes Gaucher's disease pathology through the analysis of renal health, using a Drosophila model mutant for glucocerebrosidase (GBA1). The authors provide physiological and cellular data showing that renal dysfunction may be a critical disease-modifying feature. This work broadens the field's focus beyond the nervous system to include systemic ionic regulation as a potential contributor to disease initiation and progression. The genetic and experimental approaches are <bold>solid</bold> and offer a rationale for investigating analogous dysfunction in human tissues; however, several claims extend beyond the presented evidence and would benefit from additional experimental support to fully support the conclusions.</p>

<p>This study investigates the contribution of renal dysfunction to systemic and neuronal decline in Drosophila models of Gaucher disease (Gba1b mutants) and Parkinson's disease (Parkin mutants). While lysosomal and mitochondrial pathways are known drivers in these disorders, the role of kidney-like tissues in disease progression has not been well explored.</p>
<p>The authors use Drosophila melanogaster to model renal dysfunction, focusing on Malpighian tubules (analogous to renal tubules) and nephrocytes (analogous to podocytes). They employ genetic mutants, tissue-specific rescues, imaging of renal architecture, redox probes, functional assays, nephrocyte dextran uptake, and lifespan analyses. They also test genetic antioxidant interventions and pharmacological treatment.</p>
<p>The main findings show that renal pathology is progressive in Gba1b mutants, marked by Malpighian tubule disorganization, stellate cell loss, lipid accumulation, impaired water and ion regulation, and reduced nephrocyte filtration. A central theme is redox dyshomeostasis, reflected in whole-fly GSH reduction, paradoxical mitochondrial versus cytosolic redox shifts, reduced ROS signals, increased lipid peroxidation, and peroxisomal impairment. Antioxidant manipulations (Nrf2, Sod1/2, CatA, and ascorbic acid) consistently worsen outcomes, suggesting a fragile redox balance rather than classical oxidative stress. Parkin mutants also develop renal degeneration, with impaired mitophagy and complete nephrocyte dysfunction by 28 days, but their mechanism diverges from that of Gba1b. Rapamycin treatment rescues several renal phenotypes in Gba1b but not in Parkin, highlighting distinct disease pathways.</p>
<p>The authors propose that renal dysfunction is a central disease-modifying feature of Gaucher and Parkinson's disease models, driven by redox imbalance and differential engagement of lysosomal (Gba1b) vs. mitochondrial (Parkin) mechanisms. They suggest that maintaining renal health and redox balance may represent therapeutic opportunities and biomarkers in neurodegenerative disease. This is a significant manuscript that reframes GD/PD pathology through the lens of renal health. The data are extensive. However, several claims are ahead of the evidence and should be supported with additional experiments.</p>
<p>Major Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The abstract frames progressive renal dysfunction as a &quot;central, disease-modifying feature&quot; in both Gba1b and Parkin models, with systemic consequences including water retention, ionic hypersensitivity, and worsened neuro phenotypes. While the data demonstrates renal degeneration and associated physiological stress, the causal contribution of renal defects versus broader organismal frailty is not fully disentangled. Please consider adding causal experiments (e.g., temporally restricted renal rescue/knockdown) to directly establish kidney-specific contributions.</p>
<p>(2) The manuscript shows multiple redox abnormalities in Gba1b mutants (reduced whole fly GSH, paradoxical mitochondrial reduction with cytosolic oxidation, decreased DHE, increased lipid peroxidation, and reduced peroxisome density/Sod1 mislocalization). These findings support a state of redox imbalance, but the driving mechanism remains broad in the current form. It is unclear if the dominant driver is impaired glutathione handling or peroxisomal antioxidant/β-oxidation deficits or lipid peroxidation-driven toxicity, or reduced metabolic flux/ETC activity. I suggest adding targeted readouts to narrow the mechanism.</p>
<p>(3) The observation that broad antioxidant manipulations (Nrf2 overexpression in tubules, Sod1/Sod2/CatA overexpression, and ascorbic acid supplementation) consistently shorten lifespan or exacerbate phenotypes in Gba1b mutants is striking and supports the idea of redox fragility. However, these interventions are broad. Nrf2 influences proteostasis and metabolism beyond redox regulation, and Sod1/Sod2/CatA may affect multiple cellular compartments. In the absence of dose-response testing or controls for potential off-target effects, the interpretation that these outcomes specifically reflect redox dyshomeostasis feels ahead of the data. I suggest incorporating narrower interpretations (e.g., targeting lipid peroxidation directly) to clarify which redox axis is driving the vulnerability.</p>
<p>(4) This manuscript concludes that nephrocyte dysfunction does not exacerbate brain pathology. This inference currently rests on a limited set of readouts: dextran uptake and hemolymph protein as renal markers, lifespan as a systemic measure, and two brain endpoints (LysoTracker staining and FK2 polyubiquitin accumulation). While these data suggest that nephrocyte loss alone does not amplify lysosomal or ubiquitin stress, they may not fully capture neuronal function and vulnerability. To strengthen this conclusion, the authors could consider adding functional or behavioral assays (e.g., locomotor performance)</p>
<p>(5) The manuscript does a strong job of contrasting Parkin and Gba1b mutants, showing impaired mitophagy in Malpighian tubules, complete nephrocyte dysfunction by day 28, FRUMS clearance defects, and partial rescue with tubule-specific Parkin re-expression. These findings clearly separate mitochondrial quality control defects from the lysosomal axis of Gba1b. However, the mechanistic contrast remains incomplete. Many of the redox and peroxisomal assays are only presented for Gba1b. Including matched readouts across both models (e.g., lipid peroxidation, peroxisome density/function, Grx1-roGFP2 compartmental redox status) would make the comparison more balanced and strengthen the conclusion that these represent distinct pathogenic routes.</p>
<p>(6) Rapamycin treatment is shown to rescue several renal phenotypes in Gba1b mutants (water retention, RSC proliferation, FRUMS clearance, lipid peroxidation) but not in Parkin, and mitophagy is not restored in Gba1b. This provides strong evidence that the two models engage distinct pathogenic pathways. However, the therapeutic interpretation feels somewhat overstated. Human relevance should be framed more cautiously, and the conclusions would be stronger with mechanistic markers of autophagy (e.g., Atg8a, Ref(2)p flux in Malpighian tubules) or with experiments varying dose, timing, and duration (short-course vs chronic rapamycin).</p>
<p>(7) Several systemic readouts used to support renal dysfunction (FRUMS clearance, salt stress survival) could also be influenced by general organismal frailty. To ensure these phenotypes are kidney-intrinsic, it would be helpful to include controls such as tissue-specific genetic rescue in Malpighian tubules or nephrocytes, or timing rescue interventions before overt systemic decline. This would strengthen the causal link between renal impairment and the observed systemic phenotypes.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In the present study, the authors tested renal function in Gba1b-/- flies and its possible effect on neurodegeneration. They showed that these flies exhibit progressive degeneration of the renal system, loss of water homeostasis, and ionic hypersensitivity. They documented reduced glomerular filtration capacity in their pericardial nephrocytes, together with cellular degeneration in microtubules, redox imbalance, and lipid accumulation. They also compared the Gba1b mutant flies to Parkin mutants and evaluated the effect of treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Restoration of renal structure and function was observed only in the Gba1b mutant flies, leading the authors to conclude that the mutants present different phenotypes due to lysosomal stress in Gba1b mutants versus mitochondrial stress in Parkin mutant flies.</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that: &quot;renal system dysfunction negatively impacts both organismal and neuronal health in Gba1b-/- flies, including autophagic-lysosomal status in the brain.&quot; This statement implies that renal impairments drive neurodegeneration. However, there is no direct evidence provided linking renal defects to neurodegeneration in this model. It is worth noting that Gba1b-/- flies are a model for neuronopathic Gaucher disease (GD): they accumulate lipids in their brains and present with neurodegeneration and decreased survival, as shown by Kinghorn et al. (The Journal of Neuroscience, 2016, 36, 11654-11670) and by others, which the authors failed to mention (Davis et al., PLoS Genet. 2016, 12: e1005944; Cabasso et al., J Clin Med. 2019, 8:1420; Kawasaki et al., Gene, 2017, 614:49-55).</p>
<p>(2) The authors tested brain pathology in two experiments:</p>
<p>(a) To determine the consequences of abnormal nephrocyte function on brain health, they measured lysosomal area in the brain of Gba1b-/-, Klf15LOF, or stained for polyubiquitin. Klf15 is expressed in nephrocytes and is required for their differentiation. There was no additive effect on the increased lysosomal volume (Figure 3D) or polyubiquitin accumulation (Figure 3E) seen in Gba1b-/- fly brains, implying that loss of nephrocyte viability itself does not exacerbate brain pathology.</p>
<p>(b) The authors tested the consequences of overexpression of the antioxidant regulator Nrf2 in principal cells of the kidney on neuronal health in Gba1b-/- flies, using the c42-GAL4 driver. They claim that &quot;This intervention led to a significant increase in lysosomal puncta number, as assessed by LysoTrackerTM staining (Figure 5D), and exacerbated protein dyshomeostasis, as indicated by polyubiquitin accumulation and increased levels of the ubiquitin-autophagosome trafficker Ref(2)p/p62 in Gba1b-/- fly brains (Figure 5E). Interestingly, Nrf2 overexpression had no significant effect on lysosomal area or ubiquitin puncta in control brains, demonstrating that the antioxidant response specifically in Gba1b-/- flies negatively impacts disease states in the brain and renal system.&quot;</p>
<p>
Notably, c42-GAL4 is a leaky driver, expressed in salivary glands, Malpighian tubules, and pericardial cells (Beyenbach et al., Am. J. Cell Physiol. 318: C1107-C1122, 2020). Expression in pericardial cells may affect heart function, which could explain deterioration in brain function.</p>
<p>Taken together, the contribution of renal dysfunction to brain health remains debatable.</p>
<p>Based on the above, I believe the title should be changed to: Redox Dyshomeostasis Links Renal and Neuronal Dysfunction in Drosophila Models of Gaucher disease. Such a title will reflect the results presented in the manuscript.</p>
<p>(3) The authors mention that Gba1b is not expressed in the renal system, which means that no renal phenotype can be attributed directly to any known GD pathology. They suggest that systemic factors such as circulating glycosphingolipids or loss of extracellular vesicle-mediated delivery of GCase may mediate renal toxicity. This raises a question about the validity of this model to test pathology in the fly kidney. According to Flybase, there is expression of Gba1b in renal structures of the fly.</p>
<p>(4) It is worth mentioning that renal defects are not commonly observed in patients with Gaucher disease. Relevant literature: Becker-Cohen et al., A Comprehensive Assessment of Renal Function in Patients With Gaucher Disease, J. Kidney Diseases, 2005, 46:837-844.</p>
<p>(5) In the discussion, the authors state: &quot;Together, these findings establish renal degeneration as a driver of systemic decline in Drosophila models of GD and PD...&quot; and go on to discuss a brain-kidney axis in PD. However, since this study investigates a GD model rather than a PD model, I recommend omitting this paragraph, as the connection to PD is speculative and not supported by the presented data.</p>
<p>(6) The claim: &quot;If confirmed, our findings could inform new biomarker strategies and therapeutic targets for GBA1 mutation carriers and other at-risk groups. Maintaining renal health may represent a modifiable axis of intervention in neurodegenerative disease,&quot; extends beyond the scope of the experimental evidence. The authors should consider tempering this statement or providing supporting data.</p>
<p>(7) The conclusion, &quot;we uncover a critical and previously overlooked role for the renal system in GD and PD pathogenesis,&quot; is too strong given the data presented. As no mechanistic link between renal dysfunction and neurodegeneration has been established, this claim should be moderated.</p>
<p>(8) The relevance of Parkin mutant flies is questionable, and this section could be removed from the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Hull et al examine Drosophila mutants for the Gaucher's disease locus GBA1/Gba1b, a locus that, when heterozygous, is a risk factor for Parkinson's. Focusing on the Malpighian tubules and their function, they identify a breakdown of cell junctions, loss of haemolymph filtration, sensitivity to ionic imbalance, water retention, and loss of endocytic function in nephrocytes. There is also an imbalance in ROS levels between the cytoplasm and mitochondria, with reduced glutathione levels, rescue of which could not improve longevity. They observe some of the same phenotypes in mutants of Parkin, but treatment by upregulation of autophagy via rapamycin feeding could only rescue the Gba1b mutant and not the Parkin mutant.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper uses a range of cellular, genetic, and physiological analyses and manipulations to fully describe the renal dysfunction in the GBa1b animals. The picture developed has depth and detail; the data appears sound and thorough.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper relies mostly on the biallelic Gba1b mutant, which may reflect dysfunction in Gaucher's patients, though this has yet to be fully explored. The claims for the heterozygous allele and a role in Parkinson's is a little more tenuous, making assumptions that heterozygosity is a similar but milder phenotype than the full loss-of-function.</p>

<p>We concur that this would help strengthen our conclusions. However, manipulating Gba1b in a tissue-specific manner remains challenging due to its propensity for secretion via extracellular vesicles (ECVs). Leo Pallanck and Marie Davis have elegantly shown that ectopic Gba1b expression in neurons and muscles (tissues with low predicted endogenous expression) is sufficient to rescue major organismal phenotypes. Consistent with this, we have been unable to generate clear tissue-specific phenotypes using Gba1b RNAi.</p>
<p>We will pursue more detailed time-course experiments of the progression of renal pathology, (water weight, renal stem cell proliferation, redox defects, etc.) with the goal of identifying earlier-onset phenotypes that potentially drive dysfunction.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">

<p>We agree that we have not yet established a core driver of redox imbalance. Identifying one is likely to be challenging, especially as our RNA-sequencing data from aged Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> fly heads (Atilano et al., 2023) indicate that several glutathione S-transferases (GstD2, GstD5, GstD8, and GstD9) are upregulated. We can attempt overexpression of GSTs, which has been elegantly shown by Leo Pallanck to ameliorate pathology in Pink1/Parkin mutant fly brains. However, mechanisms that specifically suppress lipid peroxidation or its associated toxicity, independently of other forms of redox damage, remain poorly understood in Drosophila. Our position is there probably will not be one dominant driver of redox imbalance. Notably, CytB5 overexpression has been shown to reduce lipid peroxidation (Chen et al., 2017), and GstS1 has been reported to conjugate glutathione to the toxic lipid peroxidation product 4-HNE (Singh et al., 2001). Additionally, work from the Bellen lab demonstrated that overexpression of lipases, bmm or lip4, suppresses lipid peroxidation-mediated neurodegeneration (Liu et al., 2015). We will therefore test the effects of over-expressing CytB5, bmm and lip4 in Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies to help further define the mechanism.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The observation that broad antioxidant manipulations (Nrf2 overexpression in tubules, Sod1/Sod2/CatA overexpression, and ascorbic acid supplementation) consistently shorten lifespan or exacerbate phenotypes in Gba1b mutants is striking and supports the idea of redox fragility. However, these interventions are broad. Nrf2 influences proteostasis and metabolism beyond redox regulation, and Sod1/Sod2/CatA may affect multiple cellular compartments. In the absence of dose-response testing or controls for potential off-target effects, the interpretation that these outcomes specifically reflect redox dyshomeostasis feels ahead of the data. I suggest incorporating narrower interpretations (e.g., targeting lipid peroxidation directly) to clarify which redox axis is driving the vulnerability.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are in agreement that Drosophila Cnc exhibits functional conservation with both Nrf1 and Nrf2, which have well-established roles in proteostasis and lysosomal biology that may exacerbate pre-existing lysosomal defects in Gba1b mutants. In our manuscript, Nrf2 manipulation forms part of a broader framework of evidence, including dietary antioxidant ascorbic acid and established antioxidant effectors CatA, Sod1, and Sod2. Together, these data indicate that Gba1b mutant flies display a deleterious response to antioxidant treatments or manipulations. To further characterise the redox state, we will quantify lipid peroxidation using Bodipy 581/591 and assess superoxide levels via DHE staining under our redox-altering experimental conditions.</p>
<p>As noted above, we will attempt to modulate lipid peroxidation directly through CytB5 and GstS1 overexpression, acknowledging the caveat that this approach may not fully dissociate lipid peroxidation from other aspects of redox stress. We have also observed detrimental effects of PGC1α on the lifespan of Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies and will further investigate its impact on redox status in the renal tubules.</p>

This inference currently rests on a limited set of readouts: dextran uptake and hemolymph protein as renal markers, lifespan as a systemic measure, and two brain endpoints (LysoTracker staining and FK2 polyubiquitin accumulation). While these data suggest that nephrocyte loss alone does not amplify lysosomal or ubiquitin stress, they may not fully capture neuronal function and vulnerability. To strengthen this conclusion, the authors could consider adding functional or behavioral assays (e.g., locomotor performance)</p>

<p>We will address this suggestion by performing DAM activity assays and climbing assays in the Klf15; Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> double mutants.</p>

<p>(5) The manuscript does a strong job of contrasting Parkin and Gba1b mutants, showing impaired mitophagy in Malpighian tubules, complete nephrocyte dysfunction by day 28, FRUMS clearance defects, and partial rescue with tubule-specific Parkin re-expression. These findings clearly separate mitochondrial quality control defects from the lysosomal axis of Gba1b. However, the mechanistic contrast remains incomplete. Many of the redox and peroxisomal assays are only presented for Gba1b. Including matched readouts across both models (e.g., lipid peroxidation, peroxisome density/function, Grx1-roGFP2 compartmental redox status) would make the comparison more balanced and strengthen the conclusion that these represent distinct pathogenic routes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that park<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> mutants have been characterised in greater detail than park<sup>⁻/⁻</sup>. The primary aim of our study was not to provide an exhaustive characterisation of park¹/¹, but rather to compare key shared and distinct mechanisms underlying renal dysfunction. We have included several relevant readouts for park<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> tubules (e.g., Figure 7D and 8H: mito-Grx1-roGFP2; Figure 8J: lipid peroxidation using BODIPY 581/591). To expand our characterisation of park¹/¹ flies, we will express the cytosolic Grx1 reporter and the peroxisomal marker YFP::Pts.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) Rapamycin treatment is shown to rescue several renal phenotypes in Gba1b mutants (water retention, RSC proliferation, FRUMS clearance, lipid peroxidation) but not in Parkin, and mitophagy is not restored in Gba1b. This provides strong evidence that the two models engage distinct pathogenic pathways. However, the therapeutic interpretation feels somewhat overstated. Human relevance should be framed more cautiously, and the conclusions would be stronger with mechanistic markers of autophagy (e.g., Atg8a, Ref(2)p flux in Malpighian tubules) or with experiments varying dose, timing, and duration (short-course vs chronic rapamycin).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We will measure Atg8a, polyubiquitin, and Ref(2)P levels in Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> and park<sup>¹/¹</sup> tubules following rapamycin treatment. In our previous study focusing on the gut (Atilano et al., 2023), we showed that rapamycin treatment increased lysosomal area, as assessed using LysoTracker<sup>TM</sup>. We will extend this analysis to the renal tubules following rapamycin exposure. Another reviewer requested that we adopt more cautious language regarding the clinical translatability of this work, and we will amend this in Version 2.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(7) Several systemic readouts used to support renal dysfunction (FRUMS clearance, salt stress survival) could also be influenced by general organismal frailty. To ensure these phenotypes are kidney-intrinsic, it would be helpful to include controls such as tissue-specific genetic rescue in Malpighian tubules or nephrocytes, or timing rescue interventions before overt systemic decline. This would strengthen the causal link between renal impairment and the observed systemic phenotypes.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>As noted in our response to point 1, we currently lack reliable approaches to manipulate Gba1b in a tissue-specific manner. However, we agree that it is important to distinguish kidney-intrinsic dysfunction from generalised organismal frailty. In the park model, we have already performed renal cell-autonomous rescue: re-expression of Park specifically in Malpighian tubule principal cells (C42-Gal4) throughout adulthood partially normalises water retention, whereas brain-restricted Park expression has no effect on renal phenotypes. Because rescuing Park only in the renal tubules is sufficient to correct a systemic fluid-handling phenotype in otherwise mutant animals, these findings indicate that the systemic defects are driven, at least in part, by renal dysfunction rather than nonspecific organismal frailty.</p>
<p>To strengthen this causal link, we will now extend this same tubule-specific Park rescue (C42-Gal4 and the high-fidelity Malpighian tubule driver CG31272-Gal4) to additional systemic readouts raised by the reviewer. Specifically, we will assay FRUMS clearance and salt stress survival in rescued versus non-rescued park mutants to determine whether renal rescue also mitigates these systemic phenotypes.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>(1) The authors claim that: &quot;renal system dysfunction negatively impacts both organismal and neuronal health in Gba1b-/- flies, including autophagic-lysosomal status in the brain.&quot; This statement implies that renal impairments drive neurodegeneration. However, there is no direct evidence provided linking renal defects to neurodegeneration in this model. It is worth noting that Gba1b-/- flies are a model for neuronopathic Gaucher disease (GD): they accumulate lipids in their brains and present with neurodegeneration and decreased survival, as shown by Kinghorn et al. (The Journal of Neuroscience, 2016, 36, 11654-11670) and by others, which the authors failed to mention (Davis et al., PLoS Genet. 2016, 12: e1005944; Cabasso et al., J Clin Med. 2019, 8:1420; Kawasaki et al., Gene, 2017, 614:49-55).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>With the caveats noted in the responses below, we show that driving Nrf2 expression using the renal tubular driver C42 results in decreased survival, more extensive renal defects, and increased brain pathology in Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies, but not in healthy controls. This suggests that a healthy brain can tolerate renal dysfunction without severe pathological consequences. Our findings therefore indicate that in Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies, there may be an interaction between renal defects and brain pathology. We do not explicitly claim that renal impairments drive neurodegeneration; rather, we propose that manipulations exacerbating renal dysfunction can have organism-wide effects, ultimately impacting the brain.</p>
<p>The reviewer is correct that our Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> fly model represents a neuronopathic GD model with age-related pathology. Indeed, we reproduce the autophagic-lysosomal defects previously reported (Kinghorn et al., 2016) in Figure 5. We agree that the papers cited by the reviewer merit inclusion, and in Version 2 we will incorporate them into the following pre-existing sentence in the Results:</p>
<p>“The gut and brain of Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies, similar to macrophages in GD patients, are characterised by enlarged lysosomes (Kinghorn et al., 2016; Atilano et al., 2023).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors tested brain pathology in two experiments:</p>
<p>(a) To determine the consequences of abnormal nephrocyte function on brain health, they measured lysosomal area in the brain of Gba1b-/-, Klf15LOF, or stained for polyubiquitin. Klf15 is expressed in nephrocytes and is required for their differentiation. There was no additive effect on the increased lysosomal volume (Figure 3D) or polyubiquitin accumulation (Figure 3E) seen in Gba1b-/- fly brains, implying that loss of nephrocyte viability itself does not exacerbate brain pathology.</p>
<p>(b) The authors tested the consequences of overexpression of the antioxidant regulator Nrf2 in principal cells of the kidney on neuronal health in Gba1b-/- flies, using the c42-GAL4 driver. They claim that &quot;This intervention led to a significant increase in lysosomal puncta number, as assessed by LysoTrackerTM staining (Figure 5D), and exacerbated protein dyshomeostasis, as indicated by polyubiquitin accumulation and increased levels of the ubiquitin-autophagosome trafficker Ref(2)p/p62 in Gba1b-/- fly brains (Figure 5E). Interestingly, Nrf2 overexpression had no significant effect on lysosomal area or ubiquitin puncta in control brains, demonstrating that the antioxidant response specifically in Gba1b-/- flies negatively impacts disease states in the brain and renal system.&quot;Notably, c42-GAL4 is a leaky driver, expressed in salivary glands, Malpighian tubules, and pericardial cells (Beyenbach et al., Am. J. Cell Physiol. 318: C1107-C1122, 2020). Expression in pericardial cells may affect heart function, which could explain deterioration in brain function.</p>
<p>Taken together, the contribution of renal dysfunction to brain health remains debatable.</p>
<p>Based on the above, I believe the title should be changed to: Redox Dyshomeostasis Links Renal and Neuronal Dysfunction in Drosophila Models of Gaucher disease. Such a title will reflect the results presented in the manuscript</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that C42-Gal4 is a leaky driver; unfortunately, this was true for all commonly used Malpighian tubule drivers available when we began the study. A colleague has recommended CG31272-Gal4 from the Perrimon lab’s recent publication (Xu et al., 2024) as a high-fidelity Malpighian tubule driver. If it proves to maintain principal-cell specificity throughout ageing in our hands, we will repeat key experiments using this driver.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors mention that Gba1b is not expressed in the renal system, which means that no renal phenotype can be attributed directly to any known GD pathology. They suggest that systemic factors such as circulating glycosphingolipids or loss of extracellular vesicle-mediated delivery of GCase may mediate renal toxicity. This raises a question about the validity of this model to test pathology in the fly kidney. According to Flybase, there is expression of Gba1b in renal structures of the fly.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our evidence suggesting that Gba1b is not substantially expressed in renal tissue is based on use of the Gba1b-CRIMIC-Gal4 line, which fails to drive expression of fluorescently tagged proteins in the Malpighian tubules and we have previously shown there is no expression within the nephrocytes with this driver line (Atilano et al., 2023). This does not exclude the possibility that Gba1b functions within the tubules. Notably, Leo Pallanck has provided compelling evidence that Gba1b is present in extracellular vesicles (ECVs) and given the role of the Malpighian tubules in haemolymph filtration, these cells are likely exposed to circulating ECVs. The lysosomal defects observed in Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> tubules therefore suggest a potential role for Gba1b in this tissue.</p>
<p>John Vaughan and Thomas Clandinin have developed mCherry- and Lamp1.V5-tagged Gba1b constructs. We intend to express these in tissues shown by the Pallanck lab to release ECVs (e.g., neurons and muscle) and examine whether the protein can be detected in the tubules.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) It is worth mentioning that renal defects are not commonly observed in patients with Gaucher disease. Relevant literature: Becker-Cohen et al., A Comprehensive Assessment of Renal Function in Patients With Gaucher Disease, J. Kidney Diseases, 2005, 46:837-844.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have identified five references indicating that renal involvement, while rare, does occur in association with GD. We agree that this is a valid citation and will include it in the revised introductory sentence:</p>
<p>“However, renal dysfunction remains a rare symptom in GD patients (Smith et al., 1978; Chander et al., 1979; Siegel et al., 1981; Halevi et al., 1993).”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(5) In the discussion, the authors state: &quot;Together, these findings establish renal degeneration as a driver of systemic decline in Drosophila models of GD and PD...&quot; and go on to discuss a brain-kidney axis in PD. However, since this study investigates a GD model rather than a PD model, I recommend omitting this paragraph, as the connection to PD is speculative and not supported by the presented data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Our position is that Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> represents a neuronopathic Gaucher disease model with mechanistic relevance to PD. The severity of GBA1 mutations correlates with the extent of GBA1/GCase loss of function and, consequently, with increased PD risk. Likewise, biallelic park<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> mutants cause a severe and heritable form of PD, and the Drosophila park<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> model is a well-established and widely recognised system that has been instrumental in elucidating how Parkin and Pink1 mutations drive PD pathogenesis.</p>
<p>We therefore see no reason to omit this paragraph. While some aspects are inherently speculative, such discussion is appropriate and valuable when addressing mechanisms underlying a complex and incompletely understood disease, provided interpretations remain measured. At no point do we claim that our work demonstrates a direct brain-renal axis. Rather, our data indicate that renal dysfunction is a disease-modifying feature in these models, aligning with emerging epidemiological evidence linking PD and renal impairment.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(6) The claim: &quot;If confirmed, our findings could inform new biomarker strategies and therapeutic targets for GBA1 mutation carriers and other at-risk groups. Maintaining renal health may represent a modifiable axis of intervention in neurodegenerative disease,&quot; extends beyond the scope of the experimental evidence. The authors should consider tempering this statement or providing supporting data.</p>
<p>(7) The conclusion, &quot;we uncover a critical and previously overlooked role for the renal system in GD and PD pathogenesis,&quot; is too strong given the data presented. As no mechanistic link between renal dysfunction and neurodegeneration has been established, this claim should be moderated.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that these sections may currently overstate our findings. In Version 2, we will revise them to ensure our claims remain balanced, while retaining the key points that arise from our data and clearly indicating where conclusions require confirmation (“if confirmed”) or additional study (“warrants further investigation”).</p>
<p>“If confirmed, our findings could inform new biomarker strategies and therapeutic targets for patients with GD and PD. Maintaining renal health may represent a modifiable axis of intervention in these diseases.”</p>

<p>(8) The relevance of Parkin mutant flies is questionable, and this section could be removed from the manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We intend to include the data for the Parkin loss-of-function mutants, as these provide essential support for the PD-related findings discussed in our manuscript. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration that Parkin mutants display defects in Malpighian tubule function and water homeostasis. We therefore see no reason to remove these findings. Furthermore, as Reviewer 1 specifically requested additional experiments using the Park fly model, we plan to incorporate these analyses in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>Minor comments:</p>
<p>(1)  Figure 1G: The FRUMS assay is not shown for Gba1b-/- flies.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The images in Figure 1G illustrate representative stages of dye clearance. We have quantified the clearance time course for both genotypes. During this process, the tubules of Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies, similar to controls, sequentially resemble each of the three example images. As the Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> tubules appear morphologically identical to controls, differing only in population-level clearance dynamics, we do not feel that including additional example images would provide further informative value.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) In panels D and F of Figure 2, survival of control and Gba1b-/- flies in the presence of 4% NaCl is presented. However, longevity is different (up to 10 days in D and ~3 days in F for control). The authors should explain this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree. In our experience, feeding-based stress survival assays show considerable variability between experiments, and we therefore interpret results only within individual experimental replicates. We have observed similar variability in oxidative stress, starvation, and xenobiotic survival assays, which may reflect batch-specific or environmental effects.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In Figure 7F, the representative image does not correspond to the quantification; the percentage of endosome-negative nephrocytes seems to be higher for the control than for the park1/1 flies. Please check this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The example images are correctly oriented. Typically, an endosome-negative nephrocyte shows no dextran uptake, whereas an endosome-positive nephrocyte displays a ring of puncta around the cell periphery. In park¹/¹ mutants, dysfunctional nephrocytes exhibit diffuse dextran staining throughout the cell, accompanied by diffuse DAPI signal, indicating a complete loss of membrane integrity and likely cell death. We have 63× images from the preparations shown in Figure 7F demonstrating this. In Version 2, we will include apical and medial z-slices of the nephrocytes to illustrate these findings (to be added as supplementary   data).</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In Figure 7H, the significance between control and park1/1 flies in the FRUMS assay is missing.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We observe significant dye clearance from the haemolymph; however, the difference in complete clearance from the tubules does not reach statistical significance. This may speculatively reflect alterations in specific aspects of tubule function, where absorption and transcellular flux are affected, but subsequent clearance from the tubule lumen remains intact. We do not feel that our current data provide sufficient resolution to draw detailed conclusions about tubule physiology at this level.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The paper relies mostly on the biallelic Gba1b mutant, which may reflect dysfunction in Gaucher's patients, though this has yet to be fully explored. The claims for the heterozygous allele and a role in Parkinson's is a little more tenuous, making assumptions that heterozygosity is a similar but milder phenotype than the full loss-of-function.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that studying heterozygotes may provide valuable insight into GBA1-associated PD. We will therefore assess whether subtle renal defects are detectable in Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> heterozygotes. We clearly state that GBA1 mutations act as a risk factor for PD rather than a Mendelian inherited cause. Consistent with findings from Gba heterozygous mice, Gba1b<sup>⁻/⁻</sup> flies display minimal phenotypes (Kinghorn et al. 2016), and any observable effects are expected to be very mild and age dependent.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(1) Figure 1c, the loss of stellate cells. What age are the MTs shown? Is this progressive or developmental?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>These experiments were conducted on flies that were three weeks of age, as were all manipulations unless otherwise stated. We will ensure that this information is clearly indicated in the figure legends in Version 2. We did not observe changes in stellate cell number at three days of age, and this result will be included in the supplementary material in Version 2. Our data therefore suggest that this is a progressive phenotype.</p>

<p>(2) I might have missed this, but for Figure 3, do the mutant flies start with a similar average weight, or are they bloated?</p>

<p>We will perform an age-related time course of water weight in response to Reviewer 1’s comments. For all experiments, fly eggs are age-matched and seeded below saturation density to ensure standardised conditions. Gba1b mutant flies do not exhibit any defects in body size or timing of eclosion.</p>
