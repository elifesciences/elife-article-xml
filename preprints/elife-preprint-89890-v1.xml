<title>Abstract</title>
<p>Growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR) and prolactin (PRL) receptor (PRLR) are transmembrane class I cytokine receptors that co-exist in various normal and cancerous cells. Both receptors respond to their associated ligands predominantly by activating the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways, and both are also known to initiate receptor-specific JAK2-independent signaling. Together with their cognate ligands, these receptors have been associated with pro-tumorigenic effects in various cancers, including breast cancer (BC). Human GH is known to bind GHR and PRLR, while PRL can only bind PRLR. A growing body of work suggests that GHR and PRLR can form heteromers in BC cells, modulating GH signal transduction. However, the dynamics of PRLR and GHR on the plasma membrane and how these could affect their respective signaling still need to be understood.</p>
<p>To this end, we set out to unravel the spatiotemporal dynamics of GHR and PRLR on the surface of human T47D breast cancer cells and γ2A-JAK2 cells. We applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and quantified the colocalization and availability of both receptors on the plasma membrane at the nanometer scale at different time points following treatment with GH and PRL. In cells co-expressing GHR and PRLR, we surprisingly observed that not only GH but also PRL treatment induces a significant loss of surface GHR. In cells lacking PRLR or expressing a mutant PRLR deficient in JAK2 binding, we observed that GH induces downregulation of membrane-bound GHR, but PRL no longer induces loss of surface GHR. Colocalizations of GHR and PRLR were confirmed by proximity ligation (PL) assay.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that PRLR-GHR interaction, direct or indirect, is indispensable for PRL-but not GH-induced loss of surface GHR and for both GH-induced and PRL-induced increase of surface PRLR, with potential consequences for downstream signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest that JAK2 binding via the receptor intracellular domain’s Box1 element is crucial for the observed regulation of one class I cytokine receptor’s cell surface availability via ligand-induced activation of another class I cytokine receptor. Our findings shed new light on the reciprocal and collective role that PRLR and GHR play in regulating cell signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growth hormone (GH) and prolactin (PRL) are hormones emanating mainly from the anterior pituitary. The primary function of GH is regulating anabolism and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>], while PRL has important roles in breast development and lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. There is mounting evidence pointing at both hormones and their receptors playing roles in various types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>], including breast cancer (BC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>], where GHR is frequently present and PRLR is often found overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]. While they have been mostly associated with pro-tumorigenic effects, PRL has also been reported to show anti-tumor effects and, like PRLR, has been associated with good prognosis in certain BC subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]. However, a humanized neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of PRLR showed no anti-tumor effect when administered in patients with PRLR-positive metastatic BC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. This suggests that PRLRs’ pro-tumorigenic function may not be as relevant as previously thought or depends on other circumstances such as the presence or absence of other hormone receptors, with which they may interact.</p>
<p>Both GH receptor (GHR) and PRL receptor (PRLR) are structurally similar transmembrane glycoproteins and belong to the class I cytokine receptor superfamily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. GH can bind and introduce a conformational change to both GHR and PRLR, allowing receptor activation and downstream signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>], but, unlike GH, PRL can only bind to PRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Both GHR and PRLR lack intrinsic kinase activity. However, as is characteristic of their superfamily members, both receptors contain a proline-rich Box1 motif in the membrane-proximal region of their intracellular domains (ICDs). Following ligand binding, downstream signal transduction involves predominantly activating the associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), bound to the receptors’ Box1 elements. This is followed by phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>], although other receptor-specific JAK2-independent signal transduction pathways may also be activated.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence indicates that GHR and PRLR interact. Two decades ago, it was shown that ovine GHR (oGHR) and PRLR (oPRLR) can tightly associate with each other following stimulation with placental lactogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>]. These studies utilized chimeric receptors consisting of the extracellular domain (ECD) of human granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (hGM-CSF) receptor (hGM-CSFR) along with a part of either oGHR ICD or oPRLR ICD. After hGM-CSF treatment of cells co-expressing oGHR chimera and oPRLR chimera, JAK2 was effectively activated, and protein-protein interaction of both chimeric receptors was detected via co-immunoprecipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>]. Additionally, our previous work revealed a specific ligand-independent human GHR (hGHR) - human PRLR (hPRLR) association in human T47D breast cancer cells, which endogenously express both receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Further, the use of split luciferase complementation assays has suggested that hGHR homodimers and hPRLR homodimers form hGHR/hPRLR multimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>] and extracellular subdomain 2 of the hGHR or hPRLR determines the dimerization partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. Although biochemical studies and luciferase complementation assays strongly support the notion that an interplay between hGHR and hPRLR exists, the observed outcomes are ascribed to total receptors within cells, irrespective of subcellular localization.</p>
<p>In the present study, we directly visualized the cell surface interaction of hGHR and hPRLR and how it changes upon ligand treatment. Specifically, we used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>] to visualize single receptor clusters of hGHR and hPRLR on cell surfaces. In dSTORM, a super-resolution microscopy technique, individual fluorophores cycle through reversible transitions between a dark and a fluorescent state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>]. Thus, a fluorophore emits photons multiple times before permanently being photobleached. These blinking events and their localizations are recorded and, although the exact number of proteins in clusters is difficult to determine, the number of localizations is strongly correlated with the number of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>]. Thus, the dSTORM approach can deliver high-resolution images to reveal the localization or arrangement of individual membrane receptor systems providing valuable insight into their interactions with other proteins at the cell surface. Given that receptors are highly trafficked to and from the cell surface and to avoid signal detection from cytosolic receptors, we used monoclonal antibodies to distinctly label the extracellular S2 domain of GHR and PRLR on non-permeabilized cells. Descriptive spatial analysis using Ripley’s K- and L-function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref>] indicates that both hGHR and hPRLR are organized in nanometer-scale clusters on the T47D cell surface. To further gain quantitative information about GHR and PRLR nanoclusters, we applied DBSCAN (density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>]. Subsequently, individual cluster contours were delineated, individual clusters were assigned a cluster ID, and receptor abundance was analyzed separately for each cluster and receptor. By doing so, we detected and calculated homomeric and heteromeric hGHR and hPRLR clusters on cell surfaces. Colocalizations of GHR and PRLR were also confirmed by proximity ligation (PL) assay. Lastly, we explored which receptor domains determine the interaction of hGHR and hPRLR by creating different truncated or modified hPRLR variants. Our findings indicate that the intracellular Box1 region is an essential determinant of hGHR and hPRLR association, suggesting JAK2 may play an important role in the observed ligand-induced and PRLR-mediated downregulation of GHR – which could also elicit or add to PRLR’s observed anti-tumor effect.</p>

<title>Ligands induce an increase in PRLR localizations and a decrease in GHR localizations at the surface of T47D cells</title>
<p>To investigate the dynamic spatial distribution of endogenous hGHR and hPRLR on the surface of breast cancer cells, we used dSTORM under the total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) illumination mode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref>]. The dSTORM images show that hGHR and hPRLR form nanometer-scale clusters and are broadly distributed on the surface of T47D cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). To assess the ligands’ effects on the spatial distribution of hGHR and hPRLR on the cell surface, we conducted time-course experiments using T47D cells with human GH or human PRL (500 ng/ml each). Such stimulation is known to induce rapid and substantial STAT5 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. We first analyzed the cell surface localization density (number of localizations per μm<sup>2</sup>) of hGHR or hPRLR in both resting and ligand-stimulated conditions. The abundance of surface-hPRLR was rapidly increased, reaching its maximum after 3 min of GH or PRL treatment with a ∼5.6-fold and ∼4.5-fold increase compared to the basal value, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). This increase was followed by a rapid decline: after GH treatment for 5 min, the localization density dropped from 200.6 ± 14.7 per μm<sup>2</sup> to 57.2 ± 3.6 per μm<sup>2</sup>; after PRL treatment for 5 min, the density fell from 159.4 ± 16.2 per μm<sup>2</sup> to 94.8 ± 16.0 per μm<sup>2</sup>. In contrast to hPRLR, the density of hGHR significantly decreased from 43.3 ± 5.5 per μm<sup>2</sup> basally to 25.8 ± 2.7 per μm<sup>2</sup> after 3min of GH stimulation. After 5 min and 10 min of GH stimulation, the density of hGHR remained relatively low at 26.6 ± 2.3 per μm<sup>2</sup> and 19.3 ± 1.5 per μm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Surprisingly, PRL, which does not bind to hGHR, also induced a loss of surface hGHR on T47D cells. After 1 min of PRL treatment, only 36% of hGHR remained on the cell surface compared to the basal state, and hGHR density remained low for at least 10 min (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). A schematic illustration of GH- and PRL-induced hGHR and hPRLR density changes is shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>. We previously observed that hGHR and hPRLR specifically co-immunoprecipitate in the absence of added ligands in T47D cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]; thus, we postulate that the propensity of hGHR and hPRLR to physically interact underlies our observed loss of hGHR in response to PRL stimulation.</p>

<title>GH or PRL stimulation induces a redistribution of hGHR and hPRLR clusters</title>
<p>We analyzed the dSTORM images using the DBSCAN algorithm to identify different clusters and determine the number of receptor localizations within a cluster (termed ‘cluster size’) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). We then performed a localization distribution analysis and plotted a histogram of the relative frequency of localizations (termed ‘distribution plot’ in this study).

<p>To gain a better understanding of the changes in GHR-PRLR colocalizations, we obtained and analyzed the corresponding bivariate cluster size distributions. Their median values are summarized in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>. As can be seen, hGHR responds quickly and transiently to GH stimulation by forming larger clusters. After GH treatment for 1 min, the median number of hGHR blinking events in a cluster reaches its peak and amounts to 85.6 ± 20.9 localizations in comparison with 33.3 ± 1.7 localizations per cluster in the basal state (P value = 0.0035). After 5 min, this number is reduced approximately to its pre-stimulation value (29.1 ± 2.2) but appears to continue to fluctuate for at least another 25 minutes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). In turn, hPRLR responds to GH in a less prominent manner: The median number of hPRLR blinking events in a cluster in the basal state is 16.5 ± 0.7. After 3 min of GH stimulation, the median of PRLR cluster size reaches its maximum, which is 22.5 ± 3.9 (P value = 0.1496), and afterward declines to its basal level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the response to GH, hGHR reacts also quickly to PRL treatment. The median number of hGHR blinking events in a cluster culminates at 1 min of PRL treatment with 45.8 ± 5.0 (compared with basal level, P value = 0.0098). In distinction, hPRLR response to PRL is slower. The median number of hPRLR blinking events in a cluster reaches its peak at 5 min of PRL treatment with a median number of 23.3 ± 2.8 (compared with basal level, P value = 0.0233), and after 10 min the median is only slightly less than that maximum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). Together, these results indicate that upon ligand stimulation hGHR cluster sizes increase transiently and significantly, while changes of hPRLR cluster sizes occur slowly and more subtly.</p>

<title>Spatial proximity of hGHR and hPRLR upon ligand stimulation</title>
<p>Nanoscale interactions of hGHR and hPRLR on the cell surface have yet to be well established. To evaluate the extent of hGHR and hPRLR surface colocalization on T47D cells, we utilized proximity ligation assays (PLAs). In PLAs, a positive signal appears only when two target proteins are in proximity (&lt;40 nm). Notably, individual treatment with GH or PRL for 5 min decreased the PLA signal observed in untreated cells by 34.4% and 28.1%, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), suggesting either ligand caused a reduction in the total number of colocalized hGHR and hPRLR clusters. To further validate these observations, we calculated the ratio of colocalized clusters in dSTORM images. Treatment with GH or PRL for 1 min reduced the proportion of colocalized clusters by nearly 50% (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). To analyze their compositions, we plotted 3D distributions for the colocalized clusters after ligand treatments (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref> and <xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">S1B</xref>). The probability of observing co-localized clusters with numbers of hGHR and hPRLR that fall into certain bins is identified by color and by the height of the bar on the z-axis. Following GH treatment for 1 min and 3 min, the number of smallest clusters decreased, and the number of medium-sized clusters increased, suggesting a shift of the bivariate distribution of co-localized cluster sizes toward medium-sized clusters (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1A</xref>). The distribution of colocalized clusters after 5 min of GH treatment is similar to that at the basal state. In contrast, after treatment with PRL for 3 min or more, the number of medium to large-sized clusters, majoritarily containing either GHR or PRLR, decreased, while the number of smallest clusters increased (<xref rid="figS1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1B</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that hGHR and hPRLR are spatially accessible to each other and form receptor complexes on the T47D cell surface and that the nature of these complexes changes differentially depending on the stimulating ligand.</p>

<title>Reduction of hGHR induced by PRL on the cell surface is dependent on the presence of PRLR</title>
<p>PRL strongly binds PRLR but not GHR. Yet, PRL induces a decrease of hGHR on the surface of cells expressing both hGHR and hPRLR. Thus, we sought to investigate the effect of PRL on hGHR in the absence of hPRLR. We utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate hPRLR knockout T47D cells (termed T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub>).</p>
<p>In addition, to evaluate isolated hPRLR responses to ligands, we also generated hGHR knockout T47D cells (termed T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub>). Immunoblot analysis with specific GHR and PRLR antibodies confirmed the absence of hPRLR in T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells and hGHR in T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub> cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). Similar to our results with parental T47D cells, GH treatment of T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells rapidly reduces the density of surface hGHR, suggesting that hPRLR need not be present to allow this GH-induced effect (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). However, contrary to findings in parental T47D cells, PRL treatment of T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells fails to modulate hGHR surface density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). Like parental T47D cells, treatment of T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub> cells with GH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>) or PRL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>) yielded increased hPRLR surface localizations. Thus, we conclude that the PRL-induced decrease of hGHR in T47D cells is dependent on the presence of hPRLR, but the ability of both GH and PRL to increase surface hPRLR in T47D cells is independent of hGHR’s presence.</p>

<p>To extend our observations, we next examined the GH and PRL responses in a cellular reconstitution system: γ2A-JAK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>] is a human JAK2-deficient fibrosarcoma cell line reconstituted with JAK2 that stably expresses JAK2 but lacks hGHR and hPRLR. To independently study the role of each receptor in this setting, we used our previously generated stable transfectants of γ2A-JAK2 cells that harbor either hGHR or hPRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref>] and verified the presence of the indicated receptor by immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5F</xref>). Consistent with the observation in T47D<sub>ΔPRLR</sub> cells, γ2A-JAK2-hGHR cells responded with a loss of surface hGHR density to GH stimulation but not to PRL stimulation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5G</xref>). Interestingly, as in T47D<sub>ΔGHR</sub> cells, treatment of γ2A-JAK2-hPRLR cells with either GH or PRL (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5H</xref>) promotes increased surface hPRLR. Thus, our findings in both cell systems suggest that hPRLR-hGHR interaction, direct or indirect, is indispensable for PRL-induced but not for GH-induced loss of surface hGHR.</p>

<title>Box 1 region in hPRLR contributes to PRL-induced GHR downregulation</title>
<p>The hPRLR-dependent PRL-induced hGHR downregulation indicates that hPRLR can modulate the density of hGHR on the cell surface in response to PRL. To investigate this interaction, we generated a set of truncation or deletion mutants of hPRLR: (1) hPRLR-tr292, which truncates the intracellular domain of hPRLR distal to the membrane-proximal intracellular domain box 1 element; (2) hPRLR-tr238, which contains only 4 amino acids of the proximal intracellular domain and does not include box 1; and (3) hPRLR-Δbox1, in which the box 1 region (243aa-251aa) is internally deleted (shown in <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>). Expression of hPRLR-tr292, hPRLR-tr238, and hPRLR-Δbox1, as well as wild-type hPRLR, was detected by immunoblotting using monoclonal antibodies targeting the ECD of PRLR (mAb<sub>ext-1.48</sub>). Since hPRLR-tr238 contains only 4aa in its ICD, no immunoblot signal was detected using a polyclonal antibody (Ab<sub>AL-84</sub>) targeting the hPRLR ICD. In contrast, the expression of hPRLR-tr292 was easily detected by Ab<sub>AL-84</sub> (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). We then transiently transfected each hPRLR construct into the γ2A-JAK2-hGHR cells, which stably express hGHR, and analyzed the changes of cell surface hGHR localizations. In cells expressing wild-type hPRLR (hPRLR-WT), the localizations of hGHR significantly decreased 3 min post-exposure to GH and PRL (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>). Similarly, under the same treatment, in cells expressing hPRLR-tr292, the localization of hGHR on the cell membrane was reduced in response to each ligand (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). However, in hPRLR-tr238-expressing cells, the localization of hGHR was diminished by GH stimulation but slightly increased by PRL stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6E</xref>). To further investigate the role of the box1 region for hGHR and hPRLR functional interaction, we studied hPRLR-Δbox1 expressing cells and found that upon PRL treatment, hGHR localizations did not decrease on the cell surface (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6F</xref>). As a negative control, we transfected the cells with vector (pcDNA3.1). hGHR localization decreased upon GH stimulation but remained at basal levels upon PRL stimulation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6G</xref>). In addition, in hPRLR-ΔBox1 and hGHR expressing cells, the JAK2 and STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation levels were assessed in response to GH and PRL stimulations. Treatment of 500ng/ml GH induces a dramatic increase in both JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation. In contrast, 500ng/ml PRL treatment does not cause JAK2 or STAT5 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6H</xref>), consistent with PRLR Box1 being required for effective coupling of PRL occupancy of PRLR to activation of JAK2 and phosphorylation of STAT5 and the inability of PRL to signal via GHR.</p>

<p>Next, we analyzed colocalization in each group.

<title>Box 1 region in hGHR plays an essential role in regulating PRLR and GHR interaction</title>
<p>From our observations (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), we concluded that the JAK2 binding site, i.e., the box 1 region, in hPRLR is required for PRL-induced hGHR down-regulation from the cell surface. To further assess whether the JAK2 binding site on hGHR is also essential, we generated hGHR-ΔBox1, in which the box 1 region (297aa – 305aa) was deleted (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>). In cells expressing both hGHR-ΔBox1 and hPRLR we observed that GH does not alter the hGHR-ΔBox1 localizations on the cell surface, while PRL slightly increases hGHR-ΔBox1 localizations (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Together, these results re-affirm that binding of JAK2 to hGHR is also required for hPRLR-mediated regulation of hGHR availability on the cell surface.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The non-ligand-bound states of hGHR and hPRLR have been extensively investigated. Pre-homodimerization of hGHR and hPRLR has been reported using structural and biochemical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">67</xref>]. At the same time, a recent study supports the notion that GHR, at physiological densities, exists as monomers on the cell surface and becomes activated by a ligand-induced dimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>]. The current study uses a highly precise and sensitive single-molecule localization microscopy approach to study the formation of hGHR and hPRLR nanoclusters and the cell surface receptor availability. Our super-resolution images reveal that in human T47D breast cancer cells and the γ2A-JAK2 cell exogenous expression system, the cluster size of hGHR and hPRLR in the basal state range from a few localizations per cluster up to a thousand localizations per cluster.</p>
<p>With GH or PRL treatment, the number of hGHR on both T47D and γ2A-JAK2 cell surfaces is decreased, indicating the removal of surface hGHR. Moreover, the distribution curve of hGHR shifts toward larger cluster sizes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting a ligand-induced aggregation of receptors. In turn, hPRLR numbers dramatically increase on the cell surface in response to ligand stimulation. The newly presented hPRLR clusters may impact the distribution of cluster sizes, which may explain why the median of hPRLR cluster sizes does not change much with ligand treatment.</p>
<p>Our PL assay data indicate that distances between hGHR and hPRLR are small (less than 40nm). This implies that hGHR and hPRLR form co-localized clusters in unstimulated states, suggesting hGHR and hPRLR are physically accessible to one other. With GH stimulation, the fraction of co-localized receptors is decreased. Given that GH treatment enhances the coimmunoprecipitation of total cellular hGHR and hPRLR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>], the decrease in co-localized surface receptors can likely be attributed to removing co-localized receptors from the cell surface.</p>
<p>It is well documented that hPRLR is engaged by both PRL and GH, while hGHR only responds to GH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we found that PRL induces a down-regulation of cell surface hGHR in cells that co-express hGHR and hPRLR (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating that hPRLR directly or indirectly interacts with hGHR. Interestingly, PRL was unable to induce hGHR down-regulation in cells either lacking hPRLR or expressing hPRLR without its Box1 region (hPRLR-tr238 or hPRLR-ΔBox1), suggesting that JAK2 and PRLR association is required for hGHR-hPRLR interaction that in turn allows PRL-induced hGHR downregulation. Notably, previous work showed that GHR and JAK2 association is necessary for JAK2 to stabilize cell surface GHR and inhibit constitutive GHR down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Furthermore, single-particle tracking studies showed that, in the presence of JAK2, a higher level of ligand-induced dimerization of GHR was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">68</xref>].</p>
<p>Moreover, JAK2 with intact kinase activity is required for GH-induced GHR down-regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref>]. Similarly, the box1 region of PRLR also associates with JAK2, and deletion or modulation of the last proline residue of box1 abrogates PRLR function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">69</xref>]. Collectively, these findings suggest that the box1 regions in hGHR and hPRLR play a crucial role in the transduction of the individual signaling cascades and hGHR-hPRLR association.</p>
<p>Here we found that, in the resting state, the degree of hGHR-hPRLR colocalization is higher in cells expressing hPRLR with the box1 motif. This suggests JAK2 may not only stabilize GHR but also support the formation of hGHR-hPRLR-containing clusters. Previously, it has been suggested that such clusters are comprised of hGHR homodimers and hPRLR homodimers that together form (hGHR-hGHR) – (hPRLR-hPRLR) hetero-multimers or higher order oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>]. Indeed, because the intracellular domains (ICD) of both hGHR and hPRLR are highly disordered, the flexibility of their ICDs may provide room for recruiting JAK2 and stabilizing the hGHR-hPRLR association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">71</xref>]. Moreover, a study of the crystal structure of erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and leptin receptor (LEPR), which also belong to the class I cytokine receptor family, revealed recently that JAK2/EPOR and JAK2/LEPR complexes contained four JAK2 and four EPOR or LEPR molecules, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">72</xref>]. Hence, it is possible that hGHR-hGHR homodimers and hPRLR-hPRLR homodimers form complexes in a similar fashion (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). We propose that this JAK2/Box1-mediated interaction of receptors is not limited to hGHR and hPRLR but may generalize to other receptors of the class I cytokine receptor family. We note, however, that determinants within particular receptors (perhaps residing in their extracellular and/or transmembrane domains) and their intracellular JAK2 association domains may facilitate, to varying degrees, their propensity to form multimeric aggregates. GHR and PRLR, for example, may tend to do so more avidly with each other than either one does with other cytokine receptors. Additional studies are required to determine and understand the modes and functions of the hGHR-hPRLR association.</p>

<p>Lastly, hPRL/hPRLR-mediated downregulation of surface hGHR may be a relevant factor in the observed anti-tumor effect of PRLR signaling, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) expressing PRLR but lacking other interfering hormone receptors. As previously shown, the TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 show significantly increased GHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>] while expressing no or only endogenous levels of PRLR, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]. PRL treatment significantly decreased cell viability and invasive capacity of MDA-MB-231 cells following the restoration of PRLR expression. In MDA-MB-453 cells, PRL caused a significant reduction in cell viability. A xenograft model with inoculated MDA-MB-453 cells confirmed the growth inhibitory effect of PRL treatment <italic>in vivo</italic>, suggesting PRLR expression as an indicator of a favorable prognosis. Future research will have to investigate our hypothesis that PRLR-mediated downregulation of surface GHR contributed to the anti-tumoral effect of PRL treatment in PRLR-positive TNBC.</p>

<p>In this study, Chen et al. used super-resolution microscopy on T47D cells to investigate the cell surface distribution of hGHR and hPRLR in steady-state and in response to ligand stimulation. The initial findings of this study suggest both PRL and GH stimulation lead to a decrease in GH receptors but an increase in the PRLR on the cell surface. A subset of both receptors co-localize in close proximity and may form heteromers. Moreover, the study revealed that the box 1 region in GHR plays an essential role in the regulation of its interaction with the PRLR, and the box 1 region in the PRLR is involved in the PRL-induced downregulation of the GHR. The most innovative aspect of this study is the super-resolution microscopy methodology that permits the analysis of proteins on the level of single molecules, and other notable advances are the generation of T47D cells that lack the PRLR and GHR. The questions after reading this manuscript are what novel insights have been gained that significantly go beyond what was already known about the interaction of these receptors and, more importantly, what are the physiological implications of these findings? The proposed significance of the results in the last paragraph of the Discussion section is speculative since none of the receptor interactions have been investigated in TNBC cell lines. Moreover, no physiological experiments were conducted using the PRLR and GH knockout T47D cells to provide biological relevance for the receptor heteromers. The proposed role of JAK2 in the cell surface distribution and association of both receptors as stated in the title was only derived from the analysis of box 1 domain receptor mutants. A knockout of JAK2 was not conducted to assess heteromer formation.</p>
<p>There are additional points that require the authors' attention:</p>
<p>1. Except for some investigation of γ2A-JAK2 cells, most of the experiments in this study were conducted on a single breast cancer cell line. In terms of rigor and reproducibility, this is somewhat borderline. The CRISPR/Cas9 mutant T47D cells were not used for rescue experiments with the corresponding full-length receptors and the box1 mutants. A missed opportunity is the lack of an investigation correlating the number of receptors with physiological changes upon ligand stimulation (e.g., cellular clustering, proliferation, downstream signaling strength).</p>
<p>2. An obvious shortcoming of the study that was not discussed seems to be that the main methodology used in this study (super-resolution microscopy) does not distinguish the presence of various isoforms of the PRLR on the cell surface. Is it possible that the ligand stimulation changes the ratio between different isoforms? Which isoforms besides the long form may be involved in heteromer formation, presumably all that can bind JAK2?</p>
<p>3. Changes in the ligand-inducible activation of JAK2 and STAT5 were not investigated in the T47D knockout models for the PRL and GHR. It is also a missed opportunity to use super-resolution microscopy as a validation tool for the knockouts on the single cell level and how it might affect the distribution of the corresponding other receptor that is still expressed.</p>
<p>4. Why does the binding of PRL not cause a similar decrease (internalization and downregulation) of the PRLR, and instead, an increase in cell surface localization? This seems to be contrary to previous observations in MCF-7 cells (J Biol Chem. 2005 October 7; 280(40): 33909-33916).</p>
<p>5. Some figures and illustrations are of poor quality and were put together without paying attention to detail. For example, in Fig 5A, the GHR was cut off, possibly to omit other nonspecific bands, the WB images look 'washed out'. 5B, 5D: the labels are not in one line over the bars, and what is the point of showing all individual data points when the bar graphs with all annotations and SD lines are disappearing? As done for the y2A cells, the illustrations in 5B-5E should indicate what cell lines were used. No loading controls in Fig 5F, is there any protein in the first lane? No loading controls in Fig 6B and 6H.</p>
<p>6. The proximity ligation method was not described in the M&amp;M section of the manuscript.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
Chen Chen et al. investigated the interaction between GHR and PRLR at the cell surface using STORM-type super-resolution microscopy, proximity ligation assay, and mutagenesis. They found that GH and PRL change the surface expression of GHR and PRLR. Upon stimulation, the hGHR cluster size significantly increases in a transient manner, whereas changes in hPRLR occur more slowly. In their previous publication, the authors found that hGHR and hPRLR co-immunoprecipitate in the absence of ligands. Based on that finding and the observations here, the authors examined colocalization of hGHR and hPRLR in clusters with proximity ligation assays and found that the receptors form complexes on the surface of T47D cells, and that these complexes respond differently to the ligands. Remarkably, the experiments in cells lacking either hGHR or hPRLR showed that PRLR is necessary for the reduction of surface hGHR induced by PRL. Studies with truncation or deletion of hPRLR mutants, suggest the box 1 region in hPRLR plays a critical role in stabilizing the hGHR-hPRLR complexes. This region contains the JAK2 binding site, and the authors show that binding of JAK2 to hGHR is also required for hPRLR-mediated regulation of hGHR surface expression. Cytokine receptors have very important broad-ranging roles in regulating cells and physiological roles. Therefore, the new findings described here will significantly expand our understanding of the structure-function relationship that drives a core signalling mechanism in cell biology.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
I particularly appreciate that the authors used different angles to examine the mechanism of GHR-PRLR interaction and that they also checked the conclusions with CRISPR/Cas9 technology and with a cellular reconstitution system.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
I could not fully evaluate some of the data, mainly because several details on acquisition and analysis are lacking. It would be useful to know what the background signal was in dSTORM and how the authors distinguished the specific signal from unspecific background fluorescence, which can be quite prominent in these experiments. Typically, one would evaluate the signal coming from antibodies randomly bound to a substrate around the cells to determine the switching properties of the dyes in their buffer and the average number of localisations representing one antibody. This would help evaluate if GHR or PRLR appeared as monomers or multimers in the plasma membrane before stimulation, which is currently a matter of debate. It would also provide better support for the model proposed in Figure 8. Since many of the findings in this work come from the evaluation of localisation clusters, an image showing actual localisations would help support the main conclusions. I believe that the dSTORM images in Figures 1 and 2 are density maps, although this was not explicitly stated. Alexa 568 and Alexa 647 typically give a very different number of localisations, and this is also dependent on the concentration of BME. Did the authors take that into account when interpreting the results and creating the model in Figures 2 and 8? I believe that including this information is important as findings in this paper heavily rely on the number of localisations detected under different conditions. Including information on proximity labelling and CRISPR/Cas9 in the methods section would help with the reproducibility of these findings by other groups.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The authors are interested in the relative importance of PRL versus GH and their interactive signaling in breast cancer. After examining GHR-PRLR interactions in response to ligands, they suggest that a reduction in cell surface GHR in response to PRL may be a mechanism whereby PRL can sometimes be protective against breast cancer.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The strengths of the study include the interesting question being addressed and the application of multiple complementary techniques, including dSTORM, which is technically very challenging, especially when using double labeling. Thus, dSTORM is used to show co-clustering of GHR and PRLR, and, in response to PRL, rapid internalization of GHR and increased cell surface PRLR. Proximity ligation assays demonstrate that some GHR and PRLR are within 40 nm (≈ 4 plasma membranes) of each other and that upon ligand stimulation, they move apart. Intact receptor knockin and knockout approaches and receptor constructs without the Jak2 binding domain demonstrate a) a requirement for the PRLR for there to be PRL-driven internalization of GHR, and b) that Jak2-PRLR interactions are necessary for the stability of the GHR-PRLR colocalizations.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The manuscript suffers from a lack of detail, which in places makes it difficult to evaluate the data and would make it very difficult for the results to be replicated by others. In addition, the manuscript would very much benefit from a full discussion of the limitations of the study. For example, the manuscript is written as if there is only one form of the PRLR while the anti-PRLR antibody used for dSTORM would also recognize the intermediate form and short forms 1a and 1b on the T47D cells. Given the very different roles of these other PRLR forms in breast cancer (Dufau, Vonderhaar, Clevenger, Walker and other labs), this limitation should at the very least be discussed. Similarly, the manuscript is written as if Jak2 essentially only signals through STAT5 but Jak2 is involved in multiple other signaling pathways from the multiple PRLRs, including the long form. Also, while there are papers suggesting that PRL can be protective in breast cancer, the majority of publications in this area find that PRL promotes breast cancer. How then would the authors interpret the effect of PRL on GHR in light of all those non-protective results?</p>
