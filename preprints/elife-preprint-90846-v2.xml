<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p><italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters encode transcription factors that drive regional specialization during animal development: <italic>e.g.</italic> the Hox factor Ubx is expressed in the insect metathoracic (T3) wing appendages and differentiates them from T2 mesothoracic identities. <italic>Hox</italic> transcriptional regulation requires silencing activities that prevent spurious activation and regulatory crosstalks in the wrong tissues, but this has seldom been studied in insects other than <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which shows a derived <italic>Hox</italic> dislocation into two genomic clusters that disjoined <italic>Antennapedia</italic> (<italic>Antp</italic>) and <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>). Here we investigated how <italic>Ubx</italic> is restricted to the hindwing in butterflies, amidst a contiguous <italic>Hox</italic> cluster. By analysing Hi-C and ATAC-seq data in the butterfly <italic>Junonia coenia</italic>, we show that a Topologically Associated Domain (TAD) maintains a hindwing-enriched profile of chromatin opening around <italic>Ubx</italic>. This TAD is bordered by a Boundary Element (BE) that separates it from a region of joined wing activity around the <italic>Antp</italic> locus. CRISPR mutational perturbation of this BE releases ectopic <italic>Ubx</italic> expression in forewings, inducing homeotic clones with hindwing identities. Further mutational interrogation of two non-coding RNA encoding regions and one putative <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory module within the <italic>Ubx</italic> TAD cause rare homeotic transformations in both directions, indicating the presence of both activating and repressing chromatin features. We also describe a series of spontaneous forewing homeotic phenotypes obtained in <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies, and discuss their possible mutational basis. By leveraging the extensive wing specialization found in butterflies, our initial exploration of <italic>Ubx</italic> regulation demonstrates the existence of silencing and insulating sequences that prevent its spurious expression in forewings.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Hox</italic> genes are key specifiers of antero-posterior regional identity in animals, and thus require robust regulatory mechanisms that confine their expression to well-delimited sections of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Lewis 1978</xref>). Their genomic arrangement into <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters has provided a rich template for the study of gene regulation, with mechanisms including chromatin silencing and opening, 3D conformational changes, and non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mallo and Alonso 2013</xref>). However, this rich body of work has been almost exclusively performed in mice and fruit flies. In order to decipher how diverse body plans and morphologies evolved, we must start assessing the mechanisms of Hox gene regulation in a wider range of organisms.</p>
<p>The <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) gene encodes a Hox family transcription factor involved in the specification of segment identities in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Hughes and Kaufman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Heffer and Pick 2013</xref>). In insects, the conserved expression of <italic>Ubx</italic> in the metathoracic (T3) segment is required for their differentiation from Ubx-free tissues in the mesothorax (T2), and has been a key factor for the specialization of metathoracic serial appendages including T3 legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Mahfooz et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c76">Refki et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Tomoyasu 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Feng et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Buffry et al. 2023</xref>) and hindwings or their derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">Tomoyasu 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Loker et al. 2021</xref>). The mechanisms of <italic>Ubx</italic> segment-specific expression have been intensively studied in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Mallo and Alonso 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hajirnis and Mishra 2021</xref>), where <italic>Hox</italic> genes are separated into two genomic loci, the Antennapedia (ANT-C, <italic>Antp</italic>) and Bithorax clusters (BX-C). In short, the BX-C complex that includes <italic>Ubx</italic>, <italic>abdominal-A</italic> (<italic>abd-A</italic>), and <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>) is compartmentalized into nine chromosomal domains that determine the parasegmental expression boundaries of these three genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maeda and Karch 2015</xref>). For instance, the deletion of a small region situated between <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>abd-A</italic> produces the <italic>Front-ultraabdominal</italic> phenotype (<italic>Fub</italic>) where the first abdominal segment (A1) is transformed into a copy of the second abdominal segment A2, due to a gain-of-expression of <italic>abd-A</italic> in A1 where it is normally repressed (Bender and Lucas 2013). At the molecular level, the <italic>Fub</italic> boundary is enforced by insulating factors that separate Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) of open-chromatin, while also allowing interactions of <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>abd-A</italic> enhancers with their target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Postika et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">Srinivasan and Mishra 2020</xref>). Likewise, the <italic>Fab-7</italic> deletion, which removes a TAD boundary insulating <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>Abd–B</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Moniot-Perron et al. 2023</xref>), transforms parasegment 11 into parasegment 12 due to an anterior gain-of-expression of <italic>Abd-B</italic> (Gyurkovics et al. 1990). By extrapolation, one may expect that if the <italic>Drosophila Hox</italic> locus was not dislocated into two complexes, Antp and Ubx 3D contact domains would be separated by a Boundary Element (BE), and that deletions similar with <italic>Fub</italic> and <italic>Fab-7</italic> mutations would result in gain-of-function mutations of <italic>Ubx</italic> that could effectively transform T2 regions into T3 identities.</p>
<p>The BX-C locus also includes non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pease et al. 2013</xref>), some of which are processed into miRNAs known to repress <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>abd-A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Gummalla et al. 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Garaulet and Lai 2015</xref>). <italic>Fub-1/bxd</italic> long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) situated 5’ of <italic>Ubx</italic> are thought to participate in <italic>Ubx</italic> regulation in the PS5 (posterior T3 to anterior A1) parasegment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Petruk et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ibragimov et al. 2023</xref>). An intronic lncRNA dubbed <italic>lncRNA:PS4</italic> is expressed in the PS4 parasegment (posterior T2 - anterior T3), and appears to stabilize <italic>Ubx</italic> in this region in mutant contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hermann et al. 2022</xref>). Little is known about how insect <italic>Hox</italic> genes are regulated outside of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where they co-localize into a single <italic>Hox</italic> cluster, and where <italic>Antp</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> thus occur in contiguous positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaunt 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Mulhair and Holland 2022</xref>). A few <italic>Hox</italic>-related miRNAs are evolutionarily conserved across the locus in arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Pace et al. 2016</xref>), and an early study in <italic>Tribolium</italic> characterized the embryonic expression of a <italic>Hox</italic> cluster non-coding transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c81">Shippy et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>These knowledge gaps lead us to consider the use of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) as alternative model systems for the study of <italic>Ubx</italic> function and regulation. Lepidopteran forewings and hindwings are functionally and morphologically differentiated, and CRISPR mosaic knock-outs (mKOs) showed that <italic>Ubx</italic> is necessary for the specification of hindwing color patterns, shape, and venation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tendolkar et al. 2021</xref>). In three species of nymphalid butterflies (<italic>Heliconius erato</italic>, <italic>Junonia coenia</italic>, and <italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic>), CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function of <italic>Ubx</italic> induces regional-specific homeotic transformations of hindwing patterns into their forewing counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Matsuoka and Monteiro 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tendolkar et al. 2021</xref>), reminiscent of homeotic aberrations that are sporadically observed in butterfly wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">Sibatani 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Nijhout and Rountree 1995</xref>). The ectopic activation of <italic>Ubx</italic> into the pupal forewing results in the gain of hindwing features, suggesting Ubx is sufficient to drive T3-like identity when expressed in T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Lewis et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">Tong et al. 2014</xref>). Besides its roles in adult wing differentiation, <italic>Ubx</italic> is also known to repress thoracic leg identity in transient embryonic appendages of the first abdominal segment, called pleuropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c106">Zheng et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Masumoto et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">Tong et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tendolkar et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Matsuoka et al. 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The general organization of Hox gene clusters has been well described in Lepidoptera, but their regulation has been seldom studied. Lepidopteran genomes have accumulated divergent <italic>Hox3</italic> copies, named <italic>Shox</italic> genes, that are required during early embryonic development but do not appear to play homeotic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Ferguson et al. 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Livraghi 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Mulhair et al. 2022</xref>). A lncRNA and two miRNAs were identified in the intergenic region between <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>Abd-B</italic> in the silkworm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c97">Wang et al. 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c96">2019</xref>). In butterfly wings, the regulation of <italic>Ubx</italic> shows strong patterns of segment-specific regulation at two levels. First, the <italic>Ubx</italic> transcript has been consistently identified as the most differentially expressed mRNA between the two wing sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Hanly et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c98">Wang et al. 2022</xref>). Second, comparison of ATAC-seq signals reveal that forewing vs. hindwing have identical open-chromatin profiles during development across the genome, except at the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lewis and Reed 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">van der Burg et al. 2019</xref>). Thus, the ability of the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus to be robustly activated in hindwings and repressed in forewings is likely driving most subsequent differences between these tissues. In this study, we provide an initial assessment of the regulation of the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus during butterfly wing development. To do this, we leverage genomic resources and CRISPR mutagenesis with a focus on two laboratory species belonging to the Nymphalinae sub-family, <italic>J. coenia</italic> and <italic>Vanessa cardui</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Livraghi et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Martin et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">van der Burg et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022</xref>). We identify putative regulatory regions likely involved in the repression and activation of <italic>Ubx</italic> expression, and discuss the potential mechanisms restricting it to hindwings. Finally, we describe a collection of spontaneous wing homeotic mutants in <italic>Heliconius spp.</italic> and elaborate on the categories of mutations that could underlie these phenotypes by misregulating <italic>Ubx</italic>.</p>

<p>We provide annotations of the <italic>Ubx</italic> genomic region in four Nymphalinae butterflies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>).

<p>All Nymphalinae show a similar organization of the region spanning <italic>Ubx</italic>. Interestingly, the first intron of <italic>Ubx</italic> encodes a long non-coding RNA in opposite orientation to <italic>Ubx</italic>, that we dub here <italic>lncRNA:Ubx-IT1</italic> (abbr. <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic>), based on the recommended nomenclature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">Seal et al. 2022</xref>). Orthologous versions of <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> are detected in most NCBI RefSeq genome annotations throughout Lepidoptera (<italic>e.g.</italic> the ncRNA <italic>NCBI:XR_960726</italic> in <italic>Plutella xylostella</italic>), implying it is a conserved feature of the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus in this insect order. Finally, both annotations from <italic>V. cardui, A. io,</italic> and <italic>J. coenia</italic> show a long intergenic non-coding transcript starting in antisense orientation about 10-15 kb 5’ of <italic>Ubx</italic>, that we dub here <italic>lincRNA:Ubx-AS5’</italic> (abbr. <italic>Ubx-AS5’</italic>).

Of note, Ubx is confined to the peripodial membranes of insect T2 wing appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c101">Weatherbee et al. 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">Prasad et al. 2016</xref>), which may explain residual detection in some of the forewing samples here. <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> was significantly enriched in hindwings compared to forewings, albeit at ∼100-fold lower count levels than <italic>Ubx</italic> in the same samples. The <italic>Hox</italic> gene <italic>Antp</italic> showed a minor forewing enrichment, confirming that while <italic>Ubx</italic> expression is robustly repressed in T2 forewing tissues, <italic>Antp</italic> expression is permitted in both T2 and T3 appendages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matsuoka and Monteiro 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Paul et al. 2021</xref>).

<title>Chromatin 3D conformation reveals a Boundary Element between <italic>Antp</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic></title>
<p>Genome-wide Hi-C sequencing can be used to generate heatmaps that capture the conformation of 3D chromatin in tissues, and has been used extensively to study <italic>Drosophila Hox</italic> cluster organisation into TADs that prevent regulatory crosstalk between adjacent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ibragimov et al. 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Moniot-Perron et al. 2023</xref>). Here we used Hi-C to assess the 3D chromatin architecture of the <italic>Hox</italic> cluster interval in the butterfly <italic>J. coenia</italic>, using existing datasets that were generated from fifth instar larval forewings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">van der Burg et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022</xref>). In larval forewings, the <italic>Hox</italic> chromatin conformation landscape consists of three well-delimited TADs, the first one spanning <italic>proboscipedia</italic> (<italic>pb</italic>) to <italic>Sex comb reduced</italic> (<italic>Scr</italic>), the second one around <italic>Antp</italic>, and the third one <italic>Ubx</italic>, <italic>abd-A, and Abd-B</italic> (<bold>Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref></bold>). A Boundary Element (BE), was robustly called (see Methods) at the region separating the <italic>Antp</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> TADs, situated in the <italic>Ubx</italic> last intron. Because TAD boundary prediction has a coarse resolution, we arbitrarily define the candidate BE region as a 15-kb interval centered in the <italic>Ubx</italic> last intron, and dub it <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic>. A binding motif analysis identified 4 CTCF binding sites in a 1-kb interval within <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic>, two of which were found in a tightly linked, convergent orientation (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>), which is consistent with TAD insulating role in mediating chromatin loop-extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Guo et al. 2015</xref>).

<title>Differential forewing vs. hindwing chromatin-opening across the <italic>Antp-Ubx</italic> interval</title>
<p>In flies, the <italic>Ubx/abd-A</italic> section is organized into regulatory domains that display differential activities across the antero-posterior axis, following what has been called the open-for-business model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maeda and Karch 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Gaunt 2022</xref>). Here we tested if this pattern extends to butterfly species with a contiguous <italic>Hox</italic> cluster. To do this we used ATAC-seq datasets from <italic>J. coenia</italic> forewing (T2), hindwing (T3), and whole-head tissues sampled across fifth instar larval and early pupal stages, similarly to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">van der Burg et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Van Belleghem et al. 2023</xref>). These data reveal that chromatin opening along the <italic>Antp/Ubx/abd-A</italic> interval is partitioned into several regions showing a transition of T2 to T3 activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). From the anterior to posterior <italic>Hox</italic> collinear order (<italic>i.e.</italic> from <italic>Antp</italic> towards <italic>abd-A</italic>), chromatin-opening forms a block of forewing-enriched activity close to <italic>Antp</italic> and its 5’ region, to a block of activity in both forewings and hindwings that stops at the <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic>. This region is consistent with the fact that <italic>Antp</italic> is expressed in both wing pairs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). From <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE,</italic> the interval including <italic>Ubx</italic> and a large upstream region is strongly enriched for hindwing opening, consistently with previous studies that found it to be the only genomic region showing this pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Lewis and Reed 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c95">van der Burg et al. 2019</xref>).

<title>Comparison of 3D conformation and open-chromatin profiles between larval forewings and mid-pupal hindwings</title>
<p>The Hi-C dataset analyzed above was prepared from larval forewings, and forewings do not express Ubx (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). Next, we repeated our analysis on a Hi-C dataset generated in pupal hindwings instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c94">van der Burg et al. 2020</xref>), <italic>i.e.</italic> in a later-stage tissue expressing <italic>Ubx</italic>. We found two main differences in this contact landscape compared to the larval forewing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 3</bold></xref>). First, the TAD spanning from <italic>proboscipedia</italic> (<italic>pb</italic>) to <italic>fushi-tarazu</italic> (<italic>ftz</italic>) faded in intensity, while in contrast, the TAD around <italic>Antp</italic> remained strongly organized. Second, <italic>Ubx</italic> lost its physical association to the <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>Abd-B</italic> domains, and gained a TAD boundary situated in the <italic>Ubx-AS5’</italic> intron. It is difficult to disentangle effects from staging (larval vs. pupal) and tissues (forewing vs. hindwing) in this comparison. Specifically, these differences we observed may be due to chromatin remodeling between stages, as somewhat expected during metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gutierrez-Perez et al. 2019</xref>). Alternatively, it is also possible hindwing development requires <italic>Ubx</italic> to be insulated from the more posterior enhancers. These issues will require further investigation, for instance using profiling of histone marks, with pairwise forewing-hindwing comparison at single stages. Nonetheless the later hindwing sample showed a maintenance of <italic>Antp-Ubx</italic> separation. First, while <italic>Ubx</italic> formed a smaller TAD spanning its coding exons 1-2, this region conserved a domain of hindwing-enriched open-chromatin. Second, boundary prediction called two possible, tightly linked TAD limits in the <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> region, showing that the last intron of <italic>Ubx</italic> still acts as an insulating region. In conclusion, our preliminary comparison of <italic>Hox</italic> 3D conformation indicates that the <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> is relatively stable across two stages and wing serial homologs.</p>

<title>Mutagenic perturbation of <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> results in forewing homeosis</title>
<p>Next, we reasoned that the forewing-enriched ATAC-seq peak present in the inferred boundary interval (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>) might mediate the binding of insulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">Savitsky et al. 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Stadler et al. 2017</xref>), or act as a transcriptional silencer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Segert et al. 2021</xref>). Several genomic features support the former hypothesis. First, the only forewing-enriched ATAC-seq peak across a 150-kb region (spanning the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene and the <italic>Antp-Ubx</italic> intergenic region), coincides with the midpoint between the two tentative <italic>hicFindTADs</italic> boundary predictions inferred from HiC data (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>). Second, during motif scans conducted across that 150-kb region we found 8 predicted binding-sites for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CCCTC-Binding Factor (CTCF) clustered in a 5-kb region around the differentially accessible region, and none elsewhere in the last Ubx intron (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>), suggesting the forewing-enriched ATAC-seq peak may function as a transcriptional insulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gambetta and Furlong 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Postika et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kyrchanova et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kaushal et al. 2022</xref>). Last, the two candidate CTCF binding motifs that are within the forewing-enriched ATAC-seq peak are also conserved across Lepidoptera and Trichoptera (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>), two lineages that diverged around 300 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Kawahara et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">Thomas et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we used CRISPR targeted mutagenesis to perturb <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> and assess its functionality, and designed a single sgRNA in a conserved sequence within the forewing-enriched ATAC-seq (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). Remarkably, CRISPR mutagenesis of the <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> target induced G<sub>0</sub> mutants with homeotic transformations of their forewings into hindwings (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figs. 4B-C</bold></xref> <bold>and S2</bold>), including identity shifts in patterns, venation, and wing shape. It is important to note that none of the resulting crispants showed hindwing effects. Thus, we can reasonably attribute forewing homeotic phenotypes to indel mutations restricted to the intronic region, without disruption of the <italic>Ubx</italic> transcript, as this would result in hindwing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Matsuoka and Monteiro 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tendolkar et al. 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Homeotic clones are first visible in <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> crispants at the pupal stage, with streaks of thinner cuticle, sometimes associated with local necrosis or with suture defects in the ventral midline, in particular where leg and wing pouches adjoin (<bold>Fig. S3</bold>). When dissected out of the pupa, these mutant forewings also show streaks of more transparent wing epithelium, concomitantly with the territories of thinner cuticle above, and PCR genotyping of affected pupal wing tissue confirmed the presence of CRISPR-induced mutations at the <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> target site (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>). Color pattern homeotic clones were salient at the adult stage, with for example, clonal losses of the forewing specific white-band, and partial acquisitions of the large M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub> hindwing eyespot. In one specimen, an ectopic, partial M<sub>1</sub>-M<sub>2</sub> hindwing eyespot appeared in the R<sub>5</sub>-M<sub>1</sub> region, suggesting a perturbation of the eyespot induction process in this wing. Nymphalid forewings have five radial veins (R<sub>1-5</sub>), which provide sturdiness for flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c102">Wootton 1993</xref>), while hindwings have only two Radial veins. Forewing homeotic mutants showed mosaic venation defects in the Radial vein area (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4B</bold></xref>). Finally, higher expressivity mutant forewings were smaller and rounder, reminiscent of hindwing shape.</p>
<p>Next, we dissected fifth instar larval wing disks from developing <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> crispants, and monitored the expression of Ubd-A (Ubx and Abd-A epitopes), normally restricted to the hindwing and only present in the forewing peripodial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c100">Weatherbee et al. 1999</xref>). Crispants showed forewing clones with strong ectopic expression of Ubd-A (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figs. 4D-E</bold></xref> <bold>and S5</bold>). This result supports the inference that <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> forewing homeoses are due to the de-repression of <italic>Ubx</italic> in this tissue.</p>

<title>Mutational interrogation of lncRNA-encoding regions at the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus</title>
<p>We used CRISPR mutagenesis to test the function of the two lncRNA-encoding loci at the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus. Mutagenesis of the <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> first exon in <italic>J. coenia</italic>, and of the <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> promoter in <italic>V. cardui</italic>, both resulted in crispants with small homeotic phenotypes in forewings and hindwings (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figs. 5</bold></xref> <bold>and S6</bold>). This result contrasts with <italic>Ubx</italic> exon mKO experiments, which only generate hindwing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tendolkar et al. 2021</xref>). Given the scarcity of <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> crispants obtained (11 out of 236 adults), and the small size of the homeotic clones within them, we infer the occasional phenotypes may be due to rare alleles. Thus, rather than evidence of functionality of the <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> transcript, the homeotic phenotypes may rather reflect the effects of regulatory perturbation on <italic>Ubx</italic> itself, with some random mutations in this intronic region resulting in hindwing <italic>Ubx</italic> loss-of-function, and some others triggering derepression in forewings. Likewise, next we mutagenized the first exon of <italic>Ubx-AS5’</italic>, located upstream of the <italic>Ubx</italic> promoter, and obtained twelve hindwing mutants and a single forewing mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6</bold></xref> <bold>and S7</bold>). As with <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> CRISPR experiments, these results may be explained by regulatory disruption of <italic>Ubx</italic> transcription, with a higher ratio of hindwing phenotypes compared to forewings linked to the proximity of the <italic>Ubx</italic> promoter. Overall, we conclude that the mutational interrogation at these loci can result in dual loss (hindwing) and gain (forewing) of <italic>Ubx</italic> function effects. Deciphering whether or when these effects affected <italic>Ubx</italic> expression via local <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory modules, impairment of lncRNA transcripts, or larger indels overlapping with <italic>Ubx</italic> exons, will require further study (see Discussion).</p>

<title>Dual effects of mutagenesis in a putative <italic>Ubx cis-</italic>regulatory module</title>
<p>In an attempt to probe for <italic>Ubx</italic> hindwing-specific regulatory sequences, we focused on a ∼ 25kb region in the first intron of <italic>Ubx</italic> that displays an ATAC-seq signature of hindwing enrichment in open-chromatin relative to forewings, hereafter dubbed <italic>CRM11</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref>). We subdivided this differentially accessible region into four peaks (<italic>11a, b, c</italic> and <italic>d</italic>). Targeting the ATAC-seq peaks with multiple sgRNAs spanning sub-domains <italic>11a</italic> and <italic>11c</italic> (<italic>UbxCRE11a2c5</italic> in <italic>V. cardui</italic>, <italic>11a2a3c5c6</italic> in <italic>J. coenia</italic>), or with a single target in <italic>11c</italic> (<italic>UbxCRE11c5</italic> in <italic>V. cardui</italic>) yielded dual homeoses : FW➞HW and HW➞FW (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig"><bold>Figs. 7B-D</bold></xref> <bold>and S8</bold>). Hindwing effects were reminiscent of <italic>Ubx</italic> protein coding knockouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c88">Tendolkar et al. 2021</xref>), indicating that these crispant alleles with a hindwing phenotype produce <italic>Ubx</italic> loss-of-function effects. Individuals with hindwing clones were 2.75 times more common than individuals with forewings in this dataset. Similarly to the lncRNA loci perturbation experiments, dual homeoses may indicate the presence of hindwing activators and forewing repressors in the <italic>CRM11</italic> region, with various CRISPR alleles producing a spectrum of indels and effects (see Discussion). It is noteworthy that while single-target experiments showed little lethality (55% hatching rate), dual or quadruple injection mixes resulted in low hatching rates of injected embryos (∼ 10%). Multiple targeting thus appears to induce high-rates of embryonic lethality, possibly due to chromosomal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cullot et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c107">Zuccaro et al. 2020</xref>).

<title>A sample of spontaneous homeotic mutants in <italic>Heliconius</italic> butterflies</title>
<p>Homeotic shifts between forewings and hindwings can occur naturally in Lepidoptera, and have been documented as pattern aberrations in museum specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c82">Sibatani 1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">1983</xref>). As a complement to CRISPR-induced homeoses, we document here a rich sample of forewing/hindwing homeotic mutants in the genus <italic>Heliconius</italic>, systematically collected by L. E. Gilbert between 1987 and 2016 in captive stocks at UT Austin, as well as in the wild. Across these 15 spontaneous mutants, 12 show HW➞FW clones (<bold>Fig. S10</bold>), against 3 specimens with FW➞HW effects (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 8</bold></xref>). Mutant clones in this dataset were always posterior to the M<sub>2</sub> vein. Only 2 mosaic phenotypes were found on a dorsal side, with the 13 others appearing ventrally. These homeotic mosaics show pattern shifts with complete fore/hindwing conversions of scale types, as seen for instance in the loss of gray wing coupling scales on posterior ventral forewings (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 8A-B</bold></xref>), or conversely, in their acquisition in posterior hindwings (arrowheads in <bold>Fig. S10B-D, H</bold>). Homeoses also include noticeable local changes in wing shape, particularly in hindwings (asterisks in <bold>Fig. S10</bold>). Taken together, these effects are akin to CRISPR-induced perturbations at the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus. We speculate that fore/hindwing homeotic aberrations, found in nature and captive stocks, result from mutations at the <italic>Ubx</italic> locus itself.</p>

<title>An intronic region with ATAC-seq hindwing-enrichment regulates <italic>Ubx</italic></title>
<p>All CRISPR targets yielded homeotic phenotypes (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 9</bold></xref>), with two kinds of interference with <italic>Ubx</italic> expression – forewing gain-of-function effects, and hindwing loss-of-function effects – and indicating the presence of regulatory sequences (broadly defined), that repress or enhance <italic>Ubx</italic> expression in this region. It is crucial here to highlight the limitations of the method, in order to derive proper insights about the functionality of the regulatory regions we tested. In essence, butterfly CRISPR experiments generate random mutations by non-homologous end joining repair, that are usually deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Connahs et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">Van Belleghem et al. 2023</xref>). Ideally, regulatory CRISPR-induced alleles should require genotyping in a second (G<sub>1</sub>) generation to be properly matched to a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022</xref>). Possibly because of lethal effects, we failed to pass <italic>Ubx</italic> locus G<sub>0</sub> mutations to a G<sub>1</sub> generation for genotyping, and were thus limited here to mosaic analysis. As adult wings scales are dead cells, the genetic material building a given color phenotype is lost at this stage, but we circumvented this issue by genotyping a pupal forewing displaying an homeotic phenotype in the more efficient <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> perturbation experiment (<bold>Fig. S4</bold>). In this case, PCR amplification of a 600 bp fragment followed by Sanger sequencing recovered signatures of indel variants, with mixed chromatograms starting at the targeted sites. But in all other experiments (<italic>CRM11, IT1</italic>, and <italic>AS5’</italic> targets), we did not genotype mutant tissues, as they were only detected in adult stages and generally with small clone sizes. Some of these clones may have been the results of large structural variants, as data from other organisms suggests that Cas9 nuclease targeting can generate larger than expected mutations that evade common genotyping techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">Shin et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Adikusuma et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Kosicki et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Cullot et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Owens et al. 2019</xref>). Even under the assumption that such mutations are relatively rare in butterfly embryos, the fact we injected &gt;100 embryos in each experiment makes their occurrence likely (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 9</bold></xref>), and we are unable to assign a specific genotype to the homeotic effects we obtained in <italic>CRM11, IT1</italic> and <italic>AS5’</italic> perturbation assays.</p>

<p>When targeting hindwing-enriched ATAC-seq peaks within the first intron of <italic>Ubx –</italic> from <italic>CRM11</italic> to the hindwing-enriched open-chromatin peak that coincides with the first exon of <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> – we obtained a mixture of hindwing and forewing phenotypes. Given the potential heterogeneity of allele sizes in these experiments, it is difficult to conclude robustly about the function of individual targets. Nonetheless, the phenotypic data and in particular the obtention of dual homeoses suggest we disrupted sequences that are necessary to <italic>Ubx</italic> activation in hindwings, as well as to its repression in forewings. Bifunctional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements that can switch between enhancer and silencer roles are prevalent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gisselbrecht et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">Segert et al. 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Pang et al. 2022</xref>). The <italic>CRM11</italic> and <italic>IT1</italic> targets adjoin or overlap with open-chromatin signals in both wing sets (<bold><xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7A</xref></bold>), providing circumstantial evidence that these regions might serve as bifunctional elements. Similar observations were recently made in mutational interrogation experiments of the butterfly <italic>WntA</italic> patterning gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022</xref>). Alternatively, silencers and enhancers may be tightly linked and interact in close proximity to shape gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Méndez-González et al. 2023</xref>), implying in our case that forewing and hindwing phenotypes are mediated by alleles spanning adjacent but distinct elements. A formal test of these mechanisms would require germline transmission and genotyping of these alleles, which was unsuccessful in our attempts at crossing <italic>Ubx cis</italic>-regulatory crispants.</p>
<p>In contrast with the dual effects obtained when targeting <italic>CRM11a+c</italic> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 9</bold></xref>), <italic>CRM11b</italic> perturbation resulted in hindwing-limited effects, and may suggest that an <italic>Ubx</italic> enhancer was consistently compromised in this specific dataset. The high lethality and small size of mutant wing streaks suggest that only individuals with sparse, small mutant mitotic clones can survive to the adult stage. If this is true, <italic>CRM11</italic> may contain pleiotropic enhancers that are vital for normal <italic>Ubx</italic> function at earlier stages, but expression-reporter studies will be required to test this.</p>

<title>Parsing lncRNA-encoding regions – correlation or cause?</title>
<p>LncRNAs are emerging as important regulators of gene expression and developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c105">Zhang et al. 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">Statello et al. 2021</xref>). <italic>IT1</italic> targeting generated a majority of forewing phenotypes, suggesting perturbation of <italic>Ubx</italic> repression in the T2 segment. However, <italic>IT1</italic> showed low expression in forewing RNAseq datasets from <italic>K. inachus,</italic> and higher expression in the hindwing (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>), a pattern inconsistent with a repressive role of the antisense <italic>IT1</italic> transcript on <italic>Ubx</italic> expression. It is generally challenging to disentangle the effects of transcription of a non-coding element from the potential effects of adjacent enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Natoli and Andrau 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pease et al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, an alternative explanation would be that the phenotypes are confounded by the overlap and proximity to open-chromatin regions, which may play <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory roles on <italic>Ubx</italic> via DNA-protein interactions, rather than via the lncRNA. If this is the case, it is possible that the targeted <italic>Ubx-IT1</italic> site, which yielded homeoses in both directions and bears both forewing and hindwing open-chromatin, is a bifunctional <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element that can shift regulatory activities between these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Gisselbrecht et al. 2020</xref>). Targeted mutagenesis of the <italic>Ubx-AS5’</italic> first exon mainly generated hindwing phenotypes, although with a relatively low-efficiency. Because this target is about 10 kb away from the <italic>Ubx</italic> promoter itself, it is plausible that the observed phenotypes were due to large deletions reaching the promoter region of <italic>Ubx</italic>. As mutational interrogation alone cannot discern if phenotypic effects arose from regulatory failure at the chromatin or transcript level, determining if <italic>AS5’</italic> and <italic>IT1</italic> are functional lncRNAs will need further examination. Of note, a systematic in-situ hybridization survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Pease et al. 2013</xref>) showed that <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos express an antisense transcript in its 5’ region (<italic>lncRNA:bxd</italic>), as well as within its first intron (<italic>lncRNA:PS4</italic>). It is thought that <italic>Drosophila bxd</italic> regulates <italic>Ubx</italic>, possibly by transcriptional interference or by facilitation of the <italic>Fub-1</italic> boundary effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c72">Petruk et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Ibragimov et al. 2023</xref>), while the possible regulatory roles of <italic>PS4</italic> remain debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Hermann et al. 2022</xref>). While these dipteran non-coding transcripts lack detectable sequence similarity with the lepidopteran <italic>IT1</italic> and <italic>AS5’</italic> transcripts, further comparative genomics analyses of the <italic>Ubx</italic> region across the holometabolan insect phylogeny should clarify the extent to which Hox cluster lncRNAs have been conserved or independently evolved.</p>

<title>A TAD boundary element likely acts as an insulator preventing <italic>Ubx</italic> forewing expression</title>
<p>Tight maintenance of TAD boundaries at the <italic>Hox</italic> locus is crucial for accurate segment identity and is facilitated by insulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">Stadler et al. 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gambetta and Furlong 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c75">Ramírez et al. 2018</xref>). The <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> element we targeted is in a good position to block interactions between <italic>Antp</italic> and <italic>Ubx</italic> (<bold>Figs. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>-<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></bold>). Consistent with this idea, the last intron of <italic>Ubx</italic> contains 8 CTCF binding motifs that are all clustered within 5-kb around the forewing-enriched ATAC peak, including two sites at highly conserved positions that are only 100-bp away from the CRISPR target (<bold>Fig. S1</bold>). CTCF sites prevent cross-talk between regulatory domains in the fly BX-C complex, and result in <italic>Hox</italic> misexpression when deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">Postika et al. 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kyrchanova et al. 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Kaushal et al. 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Kahn et al. 2023</xref>). Thus, the density of CTCF sites in this region may be indicative of a <italic>bona fide</italic> insulator active in forewings.</p>
<p>CRISPR mutagenesis of <italic>Antp-Ubx_BE</italic> generated FW➞HW homeoses associated with a gain of UbdA antigenicity in forewings, with no effects in the other direction, in stark contrast with other targets (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 9B</bold></xref>). This suggests a possible loss of the TAD boundary in the crispant clones, resulting in a TAD fusion or in a long-range interaction between a T2-specific enhancer and <italic>Ubx</italic> promoter. Similar deletion alleles resulting in a TAD fusion and misexpression effect have been described at the <italic>Notch</italic> locus in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arzate-Mejía et al. 2020</xref>), in digit-patterning mutants in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Lupiáñez et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Anania et al. 2022</xref>), or at murine and fly <italic>Hox</italic> loci depleted of CTCF-mediated regulatory blocking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Narendra et al. 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Gambetta and Furlong 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Kyrchanova et al. 2020</xref>). It will be interesting to profile the binding of insulator proteins and transcriptional repressors across the butterfly <italic>Hox</italic> TAD landscape to shed more light onto the mechanisms of <italic>Ubx</italic> insulation, using <italic>in vivo</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bowman et al. 2014</xref>), or <italic>in silico</italic> predictions that take advantage of updated binding matrices for insect insulator proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Mitra et al. 2018</xref>). Of note, our CRISPR target is adjacent to an hindwing-enriched peak that also presented CTCF binding sites (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>). Following a similar logic, this site could be a candidate insulator specific to <italic>Ubx</italic>-expressing tissues like the hindwing, a hypothesis that will require further testing. Lastly, it is worth noting that the <italic>Antp/Ubx</italic> TAD boundary we identified is intragenic, within the last intron of <italic>Ubx</italic>. It is unclear if this feature affects transcription, but this configuration might be analogue to the <italic>Notch</italic> locus in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which includes a functional TAD boundary in an intronic position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Arzate-Mejía et al. 2020</xref>).</p>

<title>Making sense of spontaneous wing homeotic mutants</title>
<p>In this article, we documented a large sample of spontaneous homeotic mutants obtained in <italic>Heliconius spp.</italic> All homeotic clones were limited to the wing posterior compartments (<italic>ie.</italic> posterior to the M<sub>2</sub> vein), possibly because of parasegmental, compartment-specific regulatory domains that played historic roles in the study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> BX-C regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Maeda and Karch 2015</xref>).

<title>Antibody stainings</title>
<p>Fifth instar wing disks were dissected in ice cold Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS), fixed for 15-20 min at room temperature in methanol-free formaldehyde diluted to 4% in PBS / 2 mM EGTA (egtazic acid), washed in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PT), stored in PT with 0.5% Bovine Serum albumin (PT-BSA), incubated overnight at 4°C in PT-BSA with a 1:5 dilution of the anti-UbdA peptide antibody serum (mouse monoclonal FP6.87, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and washed in PT. A 1:250 dilution of anti-Mouse IgG antibody coupled to AlexaFluor488 or Rabbit AlexaFluor555 was made in PT-BSA and spun down at 14,000 rcf to remove aggregates, and incubated with wings for 2 h at room temperature, before additional washes, incubation in 50% glycerol-PBS with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) nuclear stain, and incubation and mounting in 60% glycerol-PBS with 2 mM of EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid).</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The existence of hox gene complexes conserved in animals with bilateral symmetry and in which the genes are arranged along the chromosome in the same order as the structures they specify along the anteroposterior axis of organisms is one of the most spectacular discoveries of recent developmental biology. In brief, homeotic mutations leads to the transformation of a given body segment of the fly into the copy of the next adjacent segment. For the sake of understanding the main observation of this work, it is important to know that in loss-of-function (LOF) alleles, a given segment develops like a copy of the segment immediately anterior to it, and in gain-of-function mutations (GOF), the affected segment develop like a copy of the immediately posterior segment. Over the last 30 years the molecular lesions associated with GOF alleles led to a model where the sequential activation of the hox genes along the chromosome result from the sequential opening of chromosomal domains. Most of these GOF alleles turned out to be deletions of boundary elements (BE) that define the extend of the segment-specific regulatory domains. The fruit fly Drosophila is a highly specialized insect with a very rapid mode of segmentation. Furthermore, the hox clusters in this lineage have split. Given these specificities it is legitimate to question whether the regulatory landscape of the BX-C we know of in D.melanogaster is the result of very high specialization in this lineage, or whether it reflects a more ancestral organization. In this article, the authors address this question by analyzing the continuous hox cluster in butterflies. They focus on the integenic region between the Antennapedia and the Ubx gene, where the split occurred in D.melanogaster. Hi-C and ATAC-seq data suggest the existence of a boundary element between 2 Topologically-Associated-Domain (TAD) which is also characterized by the presence of CTCF binding sites. Butterflies have 2 pairs of wings originating form T2 (forewing) specified by Antp and T3 specified by Ubx (hindwing). Remarkably, CRISPR mutational perturbation of this boundary leads to the hatching of butterflies with homeotic clones of cells with hindwings identities in the forewing (a posteriorly oriented homeotic transformation). In agreement with this phenotype, the authors observe ectopic expression of Ubx in these clones of cells. In other words, CRISPR mutagenesis of this BE region identified by molecular tool give rise to homeotic transformations directed towards more posterior segment as the boundary mutations that had been 1st identified on the basis of their posterior oriented homeotic transformation in Drosophila. None of the mutant clones they observed affect the hindwing, indicating that their scheme did not affect the nearby Ubx transcription unit. This is a reassuring and important 1st evidence that some of the regulatory paradigm that have been proposed in fruit flies are also at work in the common ancestor to Drosophilae and Lepideptora.</p>
<p>Given the large size of the Ubx transcription unit and its associated regulatory regions it is not surprising that the authors have identified ncRNA that are conserved in 4 species of Nymphalinae butterflies, some of which also present in D.melanogaster. Attempts to target the promoters by CRISPR give rise to clones of cells in both forewings and hindwings, suggesting the generation of regulatory mutations associated with both LOF and GOF transformations. The presence of clones with dual homeosis suggest the targeting of Ubx activator and repression CRMs. Unfortunately, these experiments do not allow us to make further conclusions on the role of these ncRNA or in the identification of specific regulatory elements. To the opinion of this referee, some recent papers addressing the role that these ncRNA may play into boundary function should be taken with caution, and evidences that ncRNA(s) regulate boundaries in the BX-C in a WT context are still lacking.</p>
<p>Strengths: the convincing GOF phenotype resulting from the targeting of the Antp-Ubx_BE</p>
<p>Weaknesses: the lack of comparisons with the equivalent phenotypes obtained in D.melanogaster with for example the Fub mutation</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This valuable paper examines the Bithorax complex in several butterfly species, in which the complex is contiguous and not split, as it is in the well-studied fruit fly Drosophila. Based on genetic screens and genetic manipulations of a boundary element involved in segment-specific regulation of Ubx, the authors provide solid evidence for their conclusions, which could be further strengthened by additional data and analyses. The data presented are relevant for those interested in the evolution and function of Hox genes and of gene regulation in general.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are deeply grateful to the eLife editorial team and the two reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive feedback. We have used this feedback to improve our manuscript and have provided a point-by-point response below.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p>
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>In their article, &quot;Cis-regulatory modes of Ultrabithorax inactivation in butterfly forewings,&quot; Tendolkar and colleagues explore Ubx regulation in butterflies. The authors investigated how Ubx expression is restricted to the hindwing in butterflies through a series of genomic analyses and genetic perturbations. The authors provide evidence that a Topologically Associated Domain (TAD) maintains a hindwing-enriched profile of chromatin around Ubx, largely through an apparent boundary element. CRISPR mutations of this boundary element led to ectopic Ubx expression in forewings, resulting in homeotic transformation in the wings. The authors also explore the results of the mutation in two non-coding RNA regions as well as a possible enhancer module. Each of these induces homeotic phenotypes. Finally, the authors describe a number of homeotic phenotypes in butterflies, which they relate to their work.</p>
<p>Together, this was an interesting paper with compelling initial data. That said, I have several items that I feel would warrant further discussion, presentation, or data.</p>
<p>First, I would not state, &quot;Little is known about how Hox genes are regulated outside of flies.&quot; They should add &quot;in insects&quot; since so much in known in vertebrates</p>
</disp-quote>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For Figure 1, it would aid the readers if the authors could show the number of RNAseq reads across the locus. This would allow the readership to evaluate the frequency of the lncRNAs, splice variants, etc.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have found it useful in the past to feature “Sashimi Plots”, as they provide a good overview of transcript splicing junctions and read support. Here we could not accommodate this in our Fig. 1A as this would require compiling the RNAseq reads from many tissues and stages to be meaningful, and we would lose the resolution on forewing vs hindwing tissues that is important in this article (only the Kallima inachus dataset allows this comparison, and was used in Fig 1B). More specifically, the wing transcriptomes available for J. coenia and V. cardui are not deep enough to provide a good visualization of Antp alternative promoter usage or on AS5’ transcription.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>How common are boundary elements within introns? Typically, boundary elements are outside gene bodies, so this could be explored further. This seems like an interesting bit of biology which, following from the above point, it would be interesting to, at a minimum, discuss, but also relate to how transcription occurs through a possible boundary element (are there splice variants, for example?).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We do not see evidence of alternative splicing, and prefer to avoid speculating on transcriptional effects, but we agree that the intragenicity of the TAD boundary is interesting. We briefly highlighted this point in the revised Discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;Lastly, it is worth noting that the Antp/Ubx TAD boundary we identified is intragenic, within the last intron of Ubx. It is unclear if this feature affects Ubx transcription, but this configuration might be analogue to the Notch locus in Drosophila, which includes a functional TAD boundary in an intronic position (Arzate-Mejía et al. 2020).&quot;</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The CRISPR experiments led to compelling phenotypes. However, as a Drosophila biologist, I found it hard to interpret the data from mosaic experiments. For example, in control experiments, how often do butterflies die? Are there offsite effects? It's striking that single-guide RNAs led to such strong effects. Is this common outside of this system? Is it possible to explore the function effects at the boundary element - are these generating large deletions (for example, like Mazo-Vargas et al., 2022)? For the mosaic experiments, how frequent are these effects in nature or captive stocks? Would it be possible to resequence these types of effects? At the moment, this data, while compelling, was hard to put into the context of the experiments above without understanding how common the effects are. Ideally, there would be resequencing of these tissues, which could be targeted, but it was not clear to me the general rates of these variants.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with this assessment completely: mosaics complicate the proper interpretation of CRISPR based perturbation assays in regulatory regions. Here, unlike in Mazo-Vargas et al. (2022), we were unable to breed homeotic effects to a G1 generation, possibly because the phenotypes are dominant and lethal at the embryonic stage (see also our reply to Reviewer 2). This means that mosaic mutants are often survivors with clones of restricted size in the wing, and they are probably rare, but we are unable to meaningfully measure a mutation spectrum frequency (e.g. how often large deletions are generated). As mentioned in the first paragraph of our Discussion, we think that many of the phenotypes we observed (besides the Ubx GOF effects from the BE targeting) were confounded by alleles that could include large SVs. We aim to address these questions in an upcoming manuscript, at a locus where regulatory perturbation does not impact survival, including using germline mutants and unbiased genotyping (whole genome resequencing).</p>
<p>We elaborated on this issue in our Discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;It is crucial here to highlight the limitations of the method, in order to derive proper insights about the functionality of the regulatory regions we tested. In essence, butterfly CRISPR experiments generate random mutations by non-homologous end joining repair, that are usually deletions (Connahs et al. 2019; Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022; Van Belleghem et al. 2023). Ideally, regulatory CRISPR-induced alleles require genotyping in a second (G1) generation to be properly matched to a phenotype (Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022). Possibly because of lethal effects, we failed to pass G0 mutations to a G1 generation for genotyping, and were thus limited here to mosaic analysis. As adult wings have lost scale building cells that may underlie a given phenotype, we circumvented this issue by genotyping a pupal forewing displaying an homeotic phenotype in the more efficient Antp-Ubx_BE perturbation experiment (Fig. S4). In this case, PCR amplification of a 600 bp fragment followed by Sanger sequencing recovered signatures of indel variants, with mixed chromatograms starting at the targeted sites. But in all other experiments (CRM11, IT1, and AS5’ targets), we did not genotype mutant tissues, as they were only detected in adult stages and generally with small clone sizes. Some of these clones may have been the results of large structural variants, as data from other organisms suggests that Cas9 nuclease targeting can generate larger than expected mutations that evade common genotyping techniques (Shin et al. 2017; Adikusuma et al. 2018; Kosicki et al. 2018; Cullot et al. 2019; Owens et al. 2019). Even under the assumption that such mutations are relatively rare in butterfly embryos, the fact we injected &gt;100 embryos in each experiment makes their occurrence likely (Fig. 9), and we are unable to assign a specific genotype to the homeotic effects we obtained in CRM11, IT1 and AS5’ perturbation assays.&quot;</p>
<p>Our revision also includes a new Fig. S4 that features the mosaic genotyping of a G0 Antp-Ubx_BE mutant tissue. While this does not fully address the reviewer questions, it provides reasonable validation that the frequent GOF effects we observed upon perturbation at this target site are generated by on-target indels from DNA repair.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The existence of hox gene complexes conserved in animals with bilateral symmetry and in which the genes are arranged along the chromosome in the same order as the structures they specify along the anteroposterior axis of organisms is one of the most spectacular discoveries of recent developmental biology. In brief, homeotic mutations lead to the transformation of a given body segment of the fly into a copy of the next adjacent segment. For the sake of understanding the main observation of this work, it is important to know that in loss-of-function (LOF) alleles, a given segment develops like a copy of the segment immediately anterior to it, and in gain-of-function mutations (GOF), the affected segment develops like a copy of the immediately posterior segment. Over the last 30 years the molecular lesions associated with GOF alleles led to a model where the sequential activation of the hox genes along the chromosome result from the sequential opening of chromosomal domains. Most of these GOF alleles turned out to be deletions of boundary elements (BE) that define the extent of the segment-specific regulatory domains. The fruit fly Drosophila is a highly specialized insect with a very rapid mode of segmentation. Furthermore, the hox clusters in this lineage have split. Given these specificities it is legitimate to question whether the regulatory landscape of the BX-C we know of in D.melanogaster is the result of very high specialization in this lineage, or whether it reflects a more ancestral organization. In this article, the authors address this question by analyzing the continuous hox cluster in butterflies. They focus on the intergenic region between the Antennapedia and the Ubx gene, where the split occurred in D.melanogaster. Hi-C and ATAC-seq data suggest the existence of a boundary element between 2 Topologically-Associated-Domain (TAD) which is also characterized by the presence of CTCF binding sites. Butterflies have 2 pairs of wings originating from T2 (forewing) specified by Antp and T3 specified by Ubx (hindwing). Remarkably, CRISPR mutational perturbation of this boundary leads to the hatching of butterflies with homeotic clones of cells with hindwings identities in the forewing (a posteriorly oriented homeotic transformation). In agreement with this phenotype, the authors observe ectopic expression of Ubx in these clones of cells. In other words, CRISPR mutagenesis of this BE region identified by molecular tool give rise to homeotic transformations directed towards more posterior segment as the boundary mutations that had been 1st identified on the basis of their posterior oriented homeotic transformation in Drosophila. None of the mutant clones they observed affect the hindwing, indicating that their scheme did not affect the nearby Ubx transcription unit. This is reassuring and important first evidence that some of the regulatory paradigms that have been proposed in fruit flies are also at work in the common ancestor to Drosophilae and Lepidoptera.</p>
<p>Given the large size of the Ubx transcription unit and its associated regulatory regions it is not surprising that the authors have identified ncRNA that are conserved in 4 species of Nymphalinae butterflies, some of which also present in D.melanogaster. Attempts to target the promoters by CRISPR give rise to clones of cells in both forewings and hindwings, suggesting the generation of regulatory mutations associated with both LOF and GOF transformations. The presence of clones with dual homeosis suggests the targeting of Ubx activator and repression CRMs. Unfortunately, these experiments do not allow us to make further conclusions on the role of these ncRNA or in the identification of specific regulatory elements. To the opinion of this reviewer, some recent papers addressing the role that these ncRNA may play in boundary function should be taken with caution, and evidence that ncRNA(s) regulate boundaries in the BX-C in a WT context is still lacking.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The convincing GOF phenotype resulting from the targeting of the Antp-Ubx_BE.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The lack of comparisons with the equivalent phenotypes obtained in D.melanogaster with for example the Fub mutation.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>In the whole paper, the authors bring the notion of boundaries through the angle of the existence of TADs and ignore almost entirely to explain the characteristics of boundary mutation in the BX-C. To my knowledge examples where targeted boundary deletions between TADs result in misregulation of the neighboring genes, and/or a phenotype, are extremely sparse (especially in the context of the mouse hox genes). Given the extensive litterature describing the boundary mutations and their associated GOF phenotypes, the paper would certainly gain strength if the authors justify their approach through this wealth of information. I must admit that this referee is surprised by the absence of any references to the founding work of the Karch and Bender laboratories on this topic. As a matter of fact, one of the founding members of the boundary class of regulatory elements was already brought in 1993 with the Fab-7 and Mcp elements of the BX-C. Based on gain-of-function homeotic phenotypes, additional Fab boundaries were added to the list. Finally, in 2013, Bender and Lucas
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606092/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3606092/</ext-link>) identified the Fub boundary element that delimits the Ubx and abd-A domains in the BX-C. Fub fulfills the criterium of lying at the border of 2 neighboring TADs. Significantly, a deletion of Fub leads to a very penetrant and strong homeotic gain-of-function phenotype in which the flies hatch with a 1st abdominal segment transformed into the 2nd. In agreement with this, abd-A is expressed one parasegment too anterior in embryos. This is exactly the observation gathered from the targeted mutations in the Antp-Ubx_BE; a dominant transformation of anterior to posterior wing accompanied by an ectopic expression of Ubx in the forming primordia of the forwing where it is normally silenced. I believe the paper would gain credibility if the results were reported with the knowledge of the similarities with Fub.</p>
<p>Line 53, I am not aware of the existence of TADs for each of the 9 regulatory domains. The insulators delimit the extent of the regulatory domains but certainly not of TADs.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions, as well as for the correction – we agree our previous text suggested that all BX-C boundaries are TAD boundaries, which was incorrect. We added a new introduction paragraph that combines classic literature on GOF mutations at boundary elements with recent evidence these are TAD insulators, including Fub (as suggested), and adding Fab-7 for breadth of scope.</p>
<p>&quot;For instance, the deletion of a small region situated between Ubx and abd-A produces the Front-ultraabdominal phenotype (Fub) where the first abdominal segment (A1) is transformed into a copy of the second abdominal segment A2, due to a gain-of-expression of abd-A in A1 where it is normally repressed (Bender and Lucas 2013). At the molecular level, the Fub boundary is enforced by insulating factors that separate Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) of open-chromatin, while also allowing interactions of Ubx and abd-A enhancers with their target promoters (Postika et al. 2018; Srinivasan and Mishra 2020). Likewise, the Fab-7 deletion, which removes a TAD boundary insulating abd-A and Abd–B (Moniot-Perron et al. 2023), transforms parasegment 11 into parasegment 12 due to an anterior gain-of-expression of Abd-B (Gyurkovics et al. 1990). By extrapolation, one may expect that if the Drosophila Hox locus was not dislocated into two complexes, Antp and Ubx 3D contact domains would be separated by a Boundary Element (BE), and that deletions similar with Fub and Fab-7 mutations would result in gain-of-function mutations of Ubx that could effectively transform T2 regions into T3 identities.&quot;</p>

<p>As we could not detect sequence similarities, we preferred to avoid drawing homology, and we intentionally avoided reference to the fly transcripts when we named IT1 and AS5’. This said, we agree it is important to clarify that further studies are needed to clarify this relationship. We elaborated on this point in our discussion:</p>
<p>&quot;Of note, a systematic in-situ survey (Pease et al. 2013) showed that Drosophila embryos express an antisense transcripts in its 5’ region (lncRNA:bxd), as well as within its first intron (lncRNA:PS4). It is thought that Drosophila bxd regulates Ubx, possibly by transcriptional interference or by facilitation of the Fub-1 boundary effect (Petruk et al. 2006; Ibragimov et al. 2023), while the possible regulatory roles of PS4 remain debated (Hermann et al. 2022). While these dipteran non-coding transcripts lack detectable sequence similarity with the lepidopteran IT1 and AS5’ transcripts, further comparative genomics analyses of the Ubx region across the holometabolan insect phylogeny should clarify the extent to which Hox cluster lncRNAs have been conserved or independently evolved.&quot;</p>

<p>Lines 323-337: it is not entirely clear to this referee (a drosophilist) if those spontaneous mutations can be inbred or whether these individuals are occasional mosaics. In general, did anyone try to derive lines from those mosaic animals? Is it possible to hit the germline at the syncitial stages at which the guides are injected? Are the individuals with wing phenotype fertile? Given the fact that the Antp-Ubx_BE mutations should be dominant, I wonder if this characteristic would not help in identifying germline transmission. Similar remark for the discussion where the authors explain at line 360, that genotyping can only be done in the progeny of the Go. I do not have the impression that the authors have performed this genotyping and if I am right, I do not understand why.</p>

<p>We improved our discussion section on this topic (new text in orange):</p>
<p>&quot;It is crucial here to highlight the limitations of the method, in order to derive proper insights about the functionality of the regulatory regions we tested. In essence, butterfly CRISPR experiments generate random mutations by non-homologous end joining repair, that are usually deletions (Connahs et al. 2019; Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022; Van Belleghem et al. 2023). Ideally, regulatory CRISPR-induced alleles require genotyping in a second (G1) generation to be properly matched to a phenotype (Mazo-Vargas et al. 2022). Possibly because of lethal effects, we failed to pass G0 mutations to a G1 generation for genotyping, and were thus limited here to mosaic analysis. As adult wings have lost scale building cells that may underlie a given phenotype, we circumvented this issue by genotyping a pupal forewing displaying an homeotic phenotype in the more efficient Antp-Ubx_BE perturbation experiment (Fig. S4). In this case, PCR amplification of a 600 bp fragment followed by Sanger sequencing recovered signatures of indel variants, with mixed chromatograms starting at the targeted sites. But in all other experiments (CRM11, IT1, and AS5’ targets), we did not genotype mutant tissues, as they were only detected in adult stages and generally with small clone sizes. Some of these clones may have been the results of large structural variants, as data from other organisms suggests that Cas9 nuclease targeting can generate larger than expected mutations that evade common genotyping techniques (Shin et al. 2017; Adikusuma et al. 2018; Kosicki et al. 2018; Cullot et al. 2019; Owens et al. 2019).

<p>We agree that the work we conducted with mosaics has important caveats. So far, our attempts at breeding homeotic G0 mutants have not been fruitful at this locus, while less deleterious loci can yield viable alleles into further generations, such as WntA (published) and cortex (in prep.). We prefer to stay vague about negative data here, as it is difficult to disentangle if they were due to real mutational effects (e.g. the alleles can be dominant and lethal in the G1 generation) to failure to germline carriers of mutations as founders, or to health issues that are often amplified by inbreeding depression (including a possible iflavirus in our V. cardui cultures).</p>
<p>We concur with the prediction that Antp-Ubx_BE mutations are probably dominant, and intend to follow up with similar GOF experiments in the Plodia pantry moth, a laboratory model for lepidopteran functional genomics that is more amenable than butterflies to inbreeding and long-term studies in mutant lines. In our experience
(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.643661/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fevo.2021.643661/full</ext-link>), Ubx coding knock-out can be more extensive in Plodia than in butterflies, so we think these animals will also be more resilient to the deleterious effects of the GOF phenotype.</p>
