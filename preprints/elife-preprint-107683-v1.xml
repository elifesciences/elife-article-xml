<title>Abstract</title><p>Astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming via depletion of PTBP1, a potent repressor of neuronal splicing, has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, but its efficacy remains debated. While some reported successful conversion, others disputed this, citing a lack of neuronal gene expression as evidence of failed reprogramming. This interpretation was further challenged, attributed to incomplete PTBP1 inactivation, fueling ongoing controversy. Mechanistic understanding of the conversion, or the lack thereof, requires investigating, in conjunction with lineage tracing, the effect of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function in mature astrocytes on RNA splicing, which has not yet been examined. Here, we genetically ablated PTBP1 in adult Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 Ai14 mice to determine whether lineage traced <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout astrocytes exhibited RNA splicing alterations congruent with neuronal differentiation. We found no widespread induction of neurons, despite a minuscule fraction of knockout cells showing neuron-like transcriptomic signatures. Importantly, PTBP1 loss in mature astrocytes induced splicing alterations unlike neuronal splicing patterns. These findings suggest that targeting PTBP1 alone is ineffective to drive neuronal reprogramming and highlight the need for combining splicing and lineage analyses. Loss of astrocytic PTBP1 is insufficient to induce neuronal splicing, contrasting with its well-known role in other non-neuronal cells, and instead affects a distinct astrocytic splicing program.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neurons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) possess limited regenerative capacity, posing a great challenge in restoring brain function in neurodegenerative disease. The irreversible nature of CNS damage has spurred a wave of effort to convert non-neuronal cells into functional neurons to compensate for those lost in disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The use of endogenous cells for direct neuronal conversion presents key advantages stemming from their proliferative capacity, maintenance of epigenetic and transcriptomic aging signatures lost upon reprogramming to stem cells, and bypassing a proliferative intermediate stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>. Diverse neuronal conversion protocols targeting microglia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>, oligodendrocyte precursor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, pericytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, and astrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup> have shown feasibility of neural reprogramming. However, such approaches remain controversial for therapeutic application. <italic>In vivo</italic> neuronal reprogramming studies often achieve variable levels of success and provide inadequate evidence to explicitly show converted neurons originate from endogenous non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Recent reports have aimed to achieve neuronal reprogramming in the brain through depletion of polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. PTBP1 is an RNA-binding protein that functions as a master repressor of neuronal splicing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. To date, seven studies have reported the success of glial <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion to induce neuronal conversion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Initial observations by Weinberg et al. demonstrated an apparent generation of functional striatal neurons from oligodendrocytes targeted by an oligotropic adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) encoding <italic>Ptbp1</italic> siRNAs in wild-type rats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Qian et al. employed delivery of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors encoding <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA as well as <italic>Ptbp1</italic> antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) into the substantia nigra of 6-hydroxydopamine-treated (6-OHDA) mice modeling Parkinson’s disease (PD), and reported generation of new neurons and reversal of PD phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Zhou et al. delivered CRISPR-CasRx guide RNAs targeting <italic>Ptbp1</italic> mRNA to 6-OHDA mouse striatum and reported induction of dopaminergic neurons and rescue of motor deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. Maimon et al. used intracerebroventricular (ICV) delivery of anti-<italic>Ptbp1</italic> ASO to generate new neurons in aged wild-type mouse hippocampus and improve cognitive measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Yang et al. reported neuronal reprogramming of astrocytes in a mouse model of spinal cord injury by viral GFAP promoter-driven <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA administration and accompanying recovery of motor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. Yuan et al. used viral delivery of GFAP promoter-driven <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA into the cortex of an ischemic stroke mouse model to induce astrocyte-to-neuron conversion and reported brain tissue repair of the infarction site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Fukui et al. virally transduced astrocytes with <italic>AAV-pGFAP-CasRx-SgRNA-Ptbp1</italic> by tail vein injection into adult mice following ischemic stroke and reported generation of neurons in the dentate gyrus and rescue of memory deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. However, some studies have called this reprogramming approach into question. For example, Guo et al. failed to detect converted hippocampal, striatal, or substantia nigral neurons upon <italic>AAV-GFAP-shPtbp1</italic> injection in both wild-type and modeled Alzheimer’s disease mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>These studies exercised a variety of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> targeting approaches across a range of disease models but did not demonstrate that newly converted neurons truly arose from resident glial cells. Subsequent studies have conducted lineage tracing experiments to investigate the effects of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss on glia-to-neuron conversion. Wang et al. delivered AAVs encoding <italic>Ptbp1</italic> shRNA or <italic>AAV-GFAP-CasRx-Ptbp1</italic> and a fluorescent reporter to the striatum of an astrocyte lineage-tracing mouse model and found no co-labeling of lineage-traced astrocytes with <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Chen et al. employed Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 mice bred with hemagglutinin (HA) reporter mice to lineage trace reactive astrocytes in the substantia nigra or striatum of 6-OHDA mice treated with <italic>AAV-shPtbp1</italic> or Ptbp1 ASO and observed no neuronal conversion in traced glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. Hoang et al. found similar results in the mouse retina upon genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout (KO) by tamoxifen induction in GLAST-Cre/ER<sup>T<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>; Sun1-GFP<italic><sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic>; <italic>Ptbp1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mice in Mϋller glia, with only subtle changes in gene expression by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted Mϋller glia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. A follow-up study using Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2; Sun1-GFP<sup>lox/lox</sup>; Ptbp1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup> mice provided identical results by 2, 4, and 8 weeks following Cre induction in mouse cortex, striatum, and substantia nigra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Taken together, these independent studies have cast doubt on <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function approaches for neuronal reprogramming <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Counterarguments against the lack of astrocyte-to-neuron conversion have emerged, concerning the degree of PTBP1 depletion and inconsistency between approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. First, insufficient knockdown of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> using RNAi or CRISPR systems may result in ineffective loss of function. Second, durations following PTBP1 depletion do not align precisely between studies. Even Hoang et al.’s investigation using a genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout was challenged by Hao et al. for inefficiencies, who attributed the lack of gene expression changes based on the scRNA-seq data obtained at 4 weeks after 4-OHT induction of knockout to ineffective PTBP1 depletion <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The controversy centers on the interpretation of the absence of gene expression changes: Hao et al. interpreted this as an insufficient loss of PTBP1 function, while Hoang et al. viewed it as a failure of astrocyte-to-neuron conversion. Indeed, no prior studies on astrocyte-to-neuron conversion, including those reporting positive conversion, have investigated PTBP1’s well-established molecular function of regulating alternative splicing.</p>
<p>Thus, three key issues remain concerning the effectiveness of adult <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss-of-function on neuronal reprogramming in the brain. First, no study has simultaneously examined the impact of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss on both alternative splicing and cellular changes, which is needed to firmly establish, or rule out, a direct relationship between PTBP1’s molecular function and its influence on neuronal reprogramming. The downstream effect of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss on alternative splicing in astrocytes remains unknown. Second, additional <italic>Ptbp1</italic> genetic mutants are needed to rigorously evaluate <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss-of-function <italic>in vivo,</italic> as only one previous study has used genetic deletion. This is necessary because Hao et al. argued that complete deletion of PTBP1 induced cell death and there could be off-target effects of various knockdown approaches in prior publications. Third, thorough investigation of transcriptomic changes upon astrocytic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout for a longer period matching those in reports of positive conversion is needed for a fair comparison.</p>
<p>Here, we address both the RNA splicing and cell type changes following PTBP1 depletion in mature astrocytes using astrocyte-specific inducible <italic>Ptbp1</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO) mice carrying a different <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loxp allele than the one in Hoang’s study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. We performed genetic lineage tracing, and enriched the control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes in adult <italic>Ptbp1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup>;tdT+/-;Aldh1l1-Cre+/-</italic> mice for scRNA-seq analysis as well as for bulk RNA-seq and splicing analysis following <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion. We observed efficient depletion of PTBP1 from astrocytes but no neuronal conversion in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion. Our RNA-seq analysis of <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted astrocytes showed minimal alterations in astrocytic gene expression but obvious changes in RNA splicing profiles, confirming loss of PTBP1 function. However, these splicing changes do not resemble the characteristics typically observed in neuronal splicing. ScRNA-seq analysis further revealed limited astrocyte-to-neuron conversion following genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss. We conclude that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion in mature astrocytes effectively alters RNA splicing but is insufficient to induce widespread neuronal conversion. Intriguingly, our findings also indicate that PTBP1 in mature astrocytes, unlike in other non-neuronal cell types, is a dispensable repressor of neuronal splicing and controls a distinct astrocytic splicing program.</p>

<title>Establishing an astrocyte-specific <italic>Ptbp1</italic> conditional KO (cKO) mouse model</title>
<p>To specifically knockout <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in mature astrocytes, we crossed <italic>Ptbp1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mice containing Loxp sites flanking <italic>Ptbp1</italic> exon 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> with the astrocyte-specific tamoxifen inducible mouse line Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and with a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter line Ai14 (LSL-tdTomato-WPRE) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). This allows labeling of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes (<italic>Ptbp1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup>;tdT+/-;Aldh1l1-Cre+/-</italic>) by the tdTomato reporter for downstream analyses. This <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loxp allele is different from the previous astrocyte-to-neuron conversion study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>, in which the promoter and 1st exon were removed. The Cre-dependent reporter is also different from Hoang et al.’s study, which used LSL-Sun1-sfGFP. Therefore, our experiments provide an independent assessment of astrocyte-specific <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO and monitoring of cKO cells.</p>

<p>Since astrocyte maturation persists in the first month following birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>, we administered tamoxifen by intraperitoneal (IP) injection for five consecutive days from postnatal day 35 to 39 (P35-39). We then collected and analyzed mouse brains at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after tamoxifen induction, following the schedule in Hao et al. study that reported positive conversion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). We first analyzed the consistency of the Cre reporter expression between control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice. We found that Cre reporter-positive tdTomato-expressing cells made up approximately 6-7% of the cortical cell population 4 weeks after tamoxifen induction and persisted for the duration of the 12 week analysis window (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-D</xref>). The ratio of tdT<sup>+</sup> to DAPI<sup>+</sup> cells in the cortex remained around 6% at 8 weeks and 12 weeks following tamoxifen induction and did not change between control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>). These results showed that the Cre activity, indicated by tdTomato expression, already reached a plateau by 4 weeks after tamoxifen injection and remained stable through 12 weeks. These findings demonstrate a reliable marker for tracing the targeted population and suggest negligible cell death in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO cells. Almost all tdT<sup>+</sup> cells co-stained with astrocyte marker s100β, indicating the reliability of the tdTomato as an astrocyte reporter in this mouse model (Figure 1–figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>Immunostaining for PTBP1 showed 90-96% of cortical tdT<sup>+</sup> astrocytes are PTBP1<sup>+</sup> in <italic>Ptbp1<sup>loxp/+</sup>;tdT+/-;Aldh1l1-Cre+/-</italic> or <italic>Ptbp1<sup>+/+</sup>;tdT+/-;Aldh1l1-Cre+/-</italic> mice (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). We found that less than 0.8% of tdT<sup>+</sup> astrocytes co-stained with PTBP1 in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice, indicating efficient astrocyte-specific deletion of PTBP1 in the cortex (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). The KO is specific to tdT<sup>+</sup> cells, as we observed no tdTomato expression in PTBP1<sup>+</sup> cells in the cKO animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>) and the percentage of tdT<sup>+</sup>PTBP1<sup>+</sup> cells decreased from around 36% to 0.2% of the total PTBP1 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>). These findings further confirm the mutually exclusive expression pattern of PTBP1 and tdTomato in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice and high efficiency of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO in tdT<sup>+</sup> cells of the cortex. Taken together, we find that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice exhibit robust induction of astrocyte-specific reporter expression, efficient and specific PTBP1 depletion, making it a reliable model to study loss of PTBP1 function in mature astrocytes in the adult mouse brain.</p>

<title><italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion does not induce the astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in mouse cortex</title>
<p>A number of independent studies have claimed that knockdown of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in mature astrocytes/Müller glia in mouse brain, retina or spinal cord induces neuronal conversion accompanied by functional recovery as late as 12 weeks after PTBP1 knockdown <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Others have disputed these claims <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup> arguing that observed conversion is biased by the use of less rigorous cell type specific promoters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Only one group from the latter studies used a genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> KO mouse model to test astrocyte-to-neuron conversion upon <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss and obtained negative results <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The pro-conversion group challenged this study for its short observation window, i.e., examining <italic>Ptbp1</italic> mutant mice only up to 8 weeks after 4-OHT induction rather than at 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Here, we employed an independent astrocyte-specific genetic <italic>Ptbp1 c</italic>KO mouse model for this controversial topic.

For a fair comparison, we assessed the degree of neuronal conversion at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after tamoxifen injection to fully cover previously reported investigation windows. We confirmed the non-neuronal expression pattern of PTBP1 in the adult wild-type mouse brain, showing little PTBP1 co-staining with NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in the cortex, striatum or hippocampus (Figure 1–figure supplement 2). We found similar results in control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO mice, with less than 0.1% of NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells co-staining with PTBP1 in the cortex across the 4 to 12-week period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref>; Figure 1–figure supplement 3). In contrast, PTBP1 co-staining with s100β, GFAP, and Iba1 showed PTBP1 expression in both astrocytes and microglia (Figure 1–figure supplements 2 and 3). However, we observed very little astrocyte-to-neuron conversion (indicated by tdT<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells) upon <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO, even at 12 weeks after tamoxifen induction (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). Consistent with the lack of noticeable astrocyte-to-neuron conversion, the proportion of cortical NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells to total cell counts remained unchanged between control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO animals and throughout the 4 to 12-week period (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1I</xref>).</p>

<p>Our analysis revealed a wide range of splicing changes, identifying 581 differentially spliced events (DSEs) in 467 genes across eight types of alternative RNA splicing patterns (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4B-C</xref>). We confirmed that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> exon 2 was not expressed in the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO samples (percent spliced in [PSI] = 14.9), while it remained fully included in the control samples (PSI = 100), demonstrating the high KO efficiency of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in astrocytes and the purity of the isolated tdT<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4D</xref>).

<p>Gene enrichment analysis for differentially spliced genes (DSGs) revealed enrichment in pathways related to generic transcription, chromatin organization, DNA damage checkpoint signaling, cell junction organization, and epigenetic regulation of gene expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F</xref>).

<p>We conducted pair-wise comparisons of the splicing profiles between control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes as well those observed in DIV 0 (radial glia) and DIV 28 (maturing neurons). Correlation analysis demonstrated that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes retained a splicing profile very similar to the control astrocytes (ρ = 0.92), and to a lesser degree DIV 0 radial glia (ρ = 0.80), but distinct from that of DIV 28 neurons (ρ = 0.24). Control astrocytes also appeared more similar to DIV 0 radial glia than DIV 28 neurons (ρ = 0.79 and 0.24 for DIV 0 and DIV 28, respectively) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B</xref>). These results show that mature astrocytes exhibit splicing profiles different from radial glia or neurons but substantially closer to those of radial glia than neurons. More importantly, despite inducing significant splicing changes, PTBP1 loss has not forced astrocytes to adopt a neuronal splicing pattern. Pairwise comparisons using developmental cortical tissue show similar correlation results that the control and cKO astrocytes are more similar to E10 cortices than P0 cortices (Figure 5–figure supplement 1).</p>
<p>Next, we compared the splicing changes induced by PTBP1 loss and those by differentiation. The scatter plot of delta PSI (dPSI) in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes (cKO vs. Control) against the developmental splicing changes in <italic>in vitro</italic> neuronal differentiation (DIV 28 vs. DIV 0) showed that differentiation caused many more splicing alterations most of which were not affected by PTBP1 depletion in astrocytes (F2 and F6 in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5C-D</xref>). Events with positive correlation (F1 and F5) are not significantly more frequent than those with negative correlation (F3 and F7). F1 and F5 represent only 14.7% of total differential splicing events associated with neuronal differentiation, vs. 11.8% for F3 and F7, and the magnitudes of splicing changes induced by PTBP1 loss are substantially smaller than those occurring in differentiation. Indeed, only 17% of events in F1 and F5 are significantly different between <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO and control (|dPSI| &gt; 10, adjusted Fisher’s exact test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, and Welch’s t-test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Therefore, PTBP1 depletion in mature astrocytes has caused an insignificant and incoherent effect of gaining characteristics of neuronal splicing. Similar results were observed when analyzing splicing changes during cortical development (Figure 5–figure supplement 1). In summary, splicing alterations upon <italic>Ptbp1</italic> deletion are primarily astrocyte-specific and do not align with the typical neuron-related splicing patterns observed during neuronal development.</p>

<p>The PCA of gene expression profiles, combined with RNA-seq data from the <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated neurons, showed distinct clustering of control and cKO astrocytes from differentiating neurons (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). The two astrocyte samples were closely grouped together and resembled DIV 0-1 cells, or radial glia, on PC1, but were positioned separately from all neuronal samples on PC2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref>). Correlation analysis demonstrated almost identical gene expression profiles between control and <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes (ρ = 0.99) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>). Control astrocytes appeared more similar to DIV 0 radial glia than to DIV 28 neurons (ρ = 0.43 and 0.36 for DIV 0 and DIV 28, respectively). This result highlights that mature astrocytes have more similarity to the expression profile of radial glia than neurons, as well as splicing profiles, but are still quite distinct. These patterns are not affected by PTBP1 depletion. Similar results were observed in samples of developmental cortical tissue, where PCA demonstrated clear separation between astrocytes and neuronal samples (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>), with no increase in correlation by PTBP1 loss (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref>). These findings indicate that, even with PTBP1 loss, cKO astrocytes retain a transcriptional profile very distinct from that of neurons, underscoring that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> deficiency alone does not induce astrocyte-to-neuron reprogramming at the transcriptomic level.</p>

<p>Although we observed no changes in cell type proportion, we identified a very small subset of excitatory neurons expressing the Cre transgene (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7F</xref>). Specifically, there were two distinct excitatory neuron subpopulations, Exc-1 and Exc-2 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7B</xref>). Only the Exc-1 cluster contained Cre+ cells, all of which were exclusively from the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO samples (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7H</xref>). Out of the 30 cKO cells in the Exc-1 cluster, seven were Cre+, suggesting a restricted and selective expression pattern in this subset.</p>
<p>However, of all the Cre+ cells from <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO samples (<italic>n</italic> = 1,460), only 0.48% (= 7/1,460) were categorized as excitatory neurons, while 90.62% (= 1,323/1,460) were astrocytes (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7G</xref>). This observation shows that the loss of PTBP1 does not effectively drive astrocyte-to-neuron conversion.

On the other hand, we cannot exclude the possibility of rare neuronal expression of Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 in individual animals, since in our lineage tracing experiments we also observed a very small fraction (&lt;1%) of tdT<sup>+</sup>NeuN<sup>+</sup> cells in animals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout approach in combination with lineage tracing and transcriptomic analyses, we found little evidence to support that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function efficiently induces astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in the adult mouse brain. Our lineage tracing data accord with recent studies that examined the effects of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss through AAV, Cas13X, ASO, and genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. Our RNA-seq data from <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted astrocytes shows no enhancement of neuron-related gene expression, and our scRNA-seq analysis did not uncover any widespread changes in cell type proportion at 12 weeks after <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion apart from a very small subgroup of Cre+ neurons with unknown origin.</p>
<p>Our study is the first to examine RNA splicing changes in <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes. In contrast to minimal gene expression changes, <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes exhibit widespread splicing alterations, confirming PTBP1’s splicing regulatory function and a clear loss of PTBP1 function in our isolated astrocytes. As a well-characterized repressor of neuronal RNA splicing, PTBP1 has been shown to regulate brain-specific exons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Our analysis in mature astrocytes suggests that PTBP1 regulates a core astrocytic splicing network distinct from its neuronal or developmental splicing regulatory role. While the function of astrocyte-specific PTBP1 splicing regulation remains to be understood, our data indicate that loss of <italic>Ptbp1</italic> in astrocytes is not sufficient to induce neuron-specific splicing patterns, unlike its well-established effect in other non-neuronal cell types.</p>
<p>Previous genetic <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout studies have used mutant mice harboring LoxP sites flanking the <italic>Ptbp1</italic> promoter and the first exon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup>. Our study produced similar findings by using a different <italic>Ptbp1<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mouse line carrying loxP sites that flank the second exon. We confirmed our <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion was exclusive and specific to astrocytes using the Aldh1l1-Cre/ERT2 transgenic mice and the Ai14 Cre reporter mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, our genetic targeting approach mitigates concerns of leaky neuronal Cre expression associated with GFAP-based reagents or promoters raised by previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Our findings reinforce the conclusion that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion in astrocytes is not sufficient to induce neuronal conversion irrespective of the genetic targeting method employed to induce <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss. We did not detect broad induction of neuronal cell types among <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO astrocytes in our scRNA-seq analysis, but uncovered a very small subpopulation of Cre+ excitatory neurons among <italic>Ptbp1</italic> cKO cells. These cells make up &lt;0.5% <italic>Ptbp1</italic>-depleted cells, indicating that while <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss could promote acquisition of neuronal identity, such a phenomenon is exceedingly rare or may be an experimental artifact.</p>

<title>Limitations of current studies and future directions</title>
<p>Molecular markers and transcriptomic analyses provide important assessment of key molecular changes and alterations of transcriptome-defined cell states associated with <italic>in vivo</italic> reprogramming but do not capture any cellular or morphological transformation. Continuous live imaging of converted cells is necessary to document loss of glial morphology and acquisition of neuronal cytoarchitecture during the conversion process, which has only recently been performed <italic>in vivo</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref></sup>. While our data indicate that <italic>Ptbp1</italic> depletion in adult astrocytes is not sufficient to induce efficient neuronal conversion, targeting other cell types for <italic>Ptbp1</italic> loss of function may be possible to promote neurogenesis and rescue neurodegenerative dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref></sup>. The use of genetic knockout approaches, stringent lineage tracing analyses, and comprehensive transcriptomic and splicing profiling remain critical for future studies of cellular reprogramming.</p>

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>At the desired time points, mice were anesthetized by CO2, perfused with cold PBS (pH 7.4) and cold 4% paraformaldehyde (Acros Organics #AC416785000) in PBS. Mouse brains were dissected out and post-fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight. In the following day, the brains were washed three times with pH7.4 PBS, embedded in 3% agarose in PBS and then sectioned to 100 μm using a Vibratome LEICA VT1000S (Leica). Immunostaining was carried out as previously described. Briefly, brain sections were rinsed three time (30 min/each) with PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min, incubated in a blocking buffer (10% donkey serum, 2% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 in pH7.4 PBS) for one hour at room temperature. Then the sections were incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. The primary antibodies used in this study are mouse S100β (Sigma #S2532, 1:500), rabbit PTBP1 (1:1000), gift from Dr. Douglas Black<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>), rabbit PTBP2 (1:1000, gift from Dr. Black, and from this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>), mouse NeuN (EMD Millipore # MAB377, 1:400), goat Iba1 (Abcam #ab5076, 1:1000), chicken tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, Aves labs #TYH, 1:1000), and mouse GFAP (Cell Signaling Technology #3670, 1:500). On the second day, sections were rinsed three times with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated in appropriate Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, 1:1000) in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. On the third day, the sections were washed three times with PBS, incubated with DAPI in PBS (Sigma #D9542, 1:500) for one hour at room temperature, washed for three times again with PBS, and then mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific # P36930).

<title>Single cell isolation</title>
<p>To obtain the single cell suspension from adult mouse brain, we adapted the isolation method from a previous publication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup> and then further purified the samples with the Debris Removal reagent (Miltenyi Biotec #130-109-398) according to vendor’s manual. To inhibit RNase activity, we supplemented the cell dissociation buffer and resuspension buffer with RNase inhibitor (Sigma #3335402001).</p>
<p>The mouse was perfused with 100ml cold PBS to thoroughly wash out blood. The desired brain regions were dissected out, rinsed with cold HBSS, gently chopped into 1-2mm, and incubated in 2.5ml HBSS with 20U/ml papain (Worthington Biochemical #LK003176) and 0.005% DNase I (Sigma #11284932001) in 37°C for 15min with gentle agitation every 5min. The tissue lysis was triturated 4 times using a silanized glass pipet (Thermo Fisher Scientific #NC0319875) and then another 15min incubation in 37°C as above. After the completion of the lysis, 2.5ml ice-cold HBSS+ (HBSS with 0.2U/ul RNase inhibitor, 0.5% BSA and 2mM EDTA) was added and the sample was centrifuged at 300g at 4°C for 5min. Then the supernatant was removed and 1ml ice-cold HBSS+ was added to the cell pellets. The sample was triturated 3 times using fire polished silanized glass pipet, transferred into a pre-chilled 15ml tube, centrifuge at 100g at 4°C for 15 seconds. The supernatant at step was considered as single cell suspension and transferred into a clean 15ml tube on ice. A new 1ml ice-cold HBSS+ was added to the cell pellets, the above steps were repeated 3-4 times, and the single cell suspension was pooled together (around 3-4ml). The single cell suspension was filtered by 30 μm MACS® SmartStrainer (Miltenyi Biotec #130098458) to remove cell debris and large clumps, and then was subjected to Debris Removal reagent for further purification following vendor’s manual. The single cells were resuspended in 500ul cold cell resuspension buffer (1X PBS with 0.5% BSA and 1.0U/μl RNase Inhibitor) and followed by tdT<sup>+</sup> cell sorting.</p>

<title>Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)</title>
<p>Cells were sorted by using MoFlo Astrios EQ Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter) with Summit version 6.3 software. tdTomato was excited by a 561 nm laser, and detected by emissions spectra between 561-579 nm. Total cell population was selected by forward and side scatter profiles, and doublet populations were excluded by side scatter area vs. side scatter height plot gating only singlets. Fluorescence gates were established by comparing tdT<sup>+</sup> and tdT<sup>-</sup> cells, with tdT<sup>+</sup> cells sorted for RNA extraction into cold Trizol LS. The FAC sorting process was completed within 2-3 hours per sample.</p>

<sec id="s4h">
<title>Bulk RNA-sequencing</title>
<p>For bulk RNA-sequencing, mice at 4 weeks after tamoxifen injection were collected for single tdT<sup>+</sup> cell sorting. Differently, the single cells were directly sorted into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 750 μL of Trizol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific #10296028). Cell sorting in each tube proceeded until volume reached 1mL and then a new tube with Trizol LS was replaced until the end of the sorting. Total RNA was extracted according to manufacturer’s instructions for Trizol reagent. The RNA quality was monitored by Agilent TapeStation 4150 in the Genomics core facility in UCR. The samples passed the quality check were sent to Novogene for library preparation and sequencing.</p>
<p>For quality control and alignment of raw bulk RNA-seq reads from <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout samples, we employed the Snakemake workflow “preprocessing_RNAseq.smk” from SnakeNgs (version 0.2.0) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/NaotoKubota/SnakeNgs">https://github.com/NaotoKubota/SnakeNgs</ext-link>). In brief, low-quality reads were filtered using fastp (version 0.23.4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref></sup>, and the remaining reads were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10) using STAR (version 2.7.11a)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>, with Ensembl transcript annotation (v102). Quality metrics were then collected with Picard (version 3.1.1) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>) and summarized using MultiQC (version 1.25)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> . We applied Shiba (version 0.4.0)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> to the mapped reads with the default parameters for differential gene expression and splicing analysis. Shiba internally employs DESeq2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup> for differential gene expression analysis. Genes with adjusted <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 and the absolute log2 fold change greater than 1 were considered DEGs. For differential splicing analysis, events with adjusted Fisher’s exact test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, dPSI greater than 10, and Welch’s t-test <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered DSEs. Enrichment analysis was performed for differentially spliced genes (DSGs) using Metascape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For comparison of the transcriptome signatures with our <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout samples, we analyzed RNA-seq data from mouse cortex across various developmental stages and ages <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, as well as from in vitro differentiated neurons (DIV-8 (embryonic stem cells), DIV-4 (neuroepithelial stem cells), DIV0 (radial glia), DIV-1, DIV-7, DIV-16, DIV-21, and DIV-28)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">60</xref></sup>. We employed the Snakemake workflow “preprocessing_RNAseq.smk” for quality control and read alignment. Shiba was used to perform differential gene expression and splicing analysis and to quantify transcript per million (TPM) for each gene and PSI for each alternative splicing event. Correlations in gene expression and splicing profiles were then assessed for DEGs and DSEs detected either in astrocytes or neuronal samples.</p>

<title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title>
<p>Both mouse brain cortices were collected 12 weeks after tamoxifen injection and subjected to single cell isolation.

To enrich the tdT<sup>+</sup> cells, for each animal, the cells subjected to 10x procedure were mixed as 1:1 ratio of tdT<sup>+</sup> and tdT<sup>-</sup> from the same animal.</p>
<p>For quantification of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) in our scRNA-seq reads from <italic>Ptbp1</italic> knockout samples, we employed the Snakemake workflow “kb-nac.smk” from SnakeNgs (version 0.2.0).

<p>This study reports <bold>important</bold> negative results by showing that genetic removal of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 in astrocytes is not sufficient to induce their conversion into neurons, challenging prior claims in the field. It also provides a systematic and insightful analysis of the role of PTBP1 in regulating astrocyte-specific splicing. The evidence is <bold>convincing</bold>, as the experiments are technically robust, rigorously controlled, and supported by both imaging and transcriptomic analyses.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Zhang et al. used a conditional knockout mouse model to re-examine the role of the RNA-binding protein PTBP1 in the transdifferentiation of astroglial cells into neurons. Several earlier studies reported that PTBP1 knockdown can efficiently induce the transdifferentiation of rodent glial cells into neurons, suggesting potential therapeutic applications for neurodegenerative diseases. However, these findings have been contested by subsequent studies, which in turn have been challenged by more recent publications. In their current work, Zhang et al. deleted exon 2 of the Ptbp1 gene using an astrocyte-specific, tamoxifen-inducible Cre line and investigated, using fluorescence imaging and bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, whether this manipulation promotes the transdifferentiation of astrocytes into neurons across various brain regions. The data strongly indicate that genetic ablation of PTBP1 is not sufficient to drive efficient conversion of astrocytes into neurons. Interestingly, while PTBP1 loss alters splicing patterns in numerous genes, these changes do not shift the astroglial transcriptome toward a neuronal profile.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Although this is not the first report of PTBP1 ablation in mouse astrocytes in vivo, this study utilizes a distinct knockout strategy and provides novel insights into PTBP1-regulated splicing events in astrocytes. The manuscript is well written, and the experiments are technically sound and properly controlled. I believe this study will be of considerable interest to a broad readership.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The primary point that needs to be addressed is a better understanding of the effect of exon 2 deletion on PTBP1 expression. Figure 4D shows successful deletion of exon 2 in knockout astrocytes. However, assuming that the coverage plots are CPM-normalized, the overall PTBP1 mRNA expression level appears unchanged. Figure 6A further supports this observation. This is surprising, as one would expect that the loss of exon 2 would shift the open reading frame and trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the PTBP1 transcript. Given this uncertainty, the authors should confirm the successful elimination of PTBP1 protein in cKO astrocytes using an orthogonal approach, such as Western blotting, in addition to immunofluorescence. They should also discuss possible reasons why PTBP1 mRNA abundance is not detectably affected by the frameshift.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript by Zhang and colleagues describes a study that investigated whether the deletion of PTBP1 in adult astrocytes in mice led to an astrocyte-to-neuron conversion. The study revisited the hypothesis that reduced PTBP1 expression reprogrammed astrocytes to neurons. More than 10 studies have been published on this subject, with contradicting results. Half of the studies supported the hypothesis while the other half did not. The question being addressed is an important one because if the hypothesis is correct, it can lead to exciting therapeutic applications for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>In this study, Zhang and colleagues conducted a conditional mouse knockout study to address the question. They used the Cre-LoxP system to specifically delete PTBP1 in adult astrocytes. Through a series of carefully controlled experiments, including cell lineage tracing, the authors found no evidence for the astrocyte-to-neuron conversion.</p>
<p>The authors then carried out a key experiment that none of the previous studies on the subject did: investigating alternative splicing pattern changes in PTBP1-depleted cells using RNA-seq analysis. The idea is to compare the splicing pattern change caused by PTBP1 deletion in astrocytes to what occurs during neurodevelopment. This is an important experiment that will help illuminate whether the astrocyte-to-neuron transition occurred in the system. The result was consistent with that of the cell staining experiments: no significant transition was detected.</p>
<p>These experiments demonstrate that, in this experimental setting, PTBT1 deletion in adult astrocytes did not convert the cells to neurons.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is a well-designed, elegantly conducted, and clearly described study that addresses an important question. The conclusions provide important information to the field.</p>
<p>
To this reviewer, this study provided convincing and solid experimental evidence to support the authors' conclusions.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The Discussion in this manuscript is short and can be expanded. Can the authors speculate what led to the contradictory results in the published studies? The current study, in combination with the study published in Cell in 2021 by Wang and colleagues, suggests that observed difference is not caused by the difference of knockdown vs. knockout. Is it possible that other glial cell types are responsible for the transition? If so, what cells? Oligodendrocytes?</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>(1) The primary point that needs to be addressed is a better understanding of the effect of exon 2 deletion on PTBP1 expression. Figure 4D shows successful deletion of exon 2 in knockout astrocytes. However, assuming that the coverage plots are CPM-normalized, the overall PTBP1 mRNA expression level appears unchanged. Figure 6A further supports this observation. This is surprising, as one would expect that the loss of exon 2 would shift the open reading frame and trigger nonsense-mediated decay of the PTBP1 transcript. Given this uncertainty, the authors should confirm the successful elimination of PTBP1 protein in cKO astrocytes using an orthogonal approach, such as Western blotting, in addition to immunofluorescence. They should also discuss possible reasons why PTBP1 mRNA abundance is not detectably affected by the frameshift.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Indeed, the deletion of exon 2 introduces a frameshift that is predicted to disrupt the PTBP1 open reading frame and trigger nonsensemediated decay (NMD). While our CPM-normalized coverage plots (Figure 4D) and gene-level expression analysis (Figure 6A) suggest that PTBP1 mRNA levels remain largely unchanged in cKO astrocytes, we acknowledge that this observation is counterintuitive and merits further clarification.</p>
<p>We suspect that the process of brain tissue dissociation and FACS sorting for bulk or single cell RNA-seq may enrich for nucleic material and thus dilute the NMD signal, which occurs in the cytoplasm. Alternatively, the transcripts (like other genes) may escape NMD for unknown mechanisms. Although a frameshift is a strong indicator for triggering NMD, it does not guarantee NMD will occur in every case. We will include this discussion in the revised manuscript to provide additional context for the apparent discrepancy between mRNA abundance and protein loss.</p>
<p>Regarding the validation of PTBP1 protein depletion in cKO astrocytes by Western blotting, we acknowledge that orthogonal approaches to confirm PTBP1 elimination would address uncertainty around the effect of exon 2 deletion on PTBP1 expression. The low cell yield of cKO astrocytes poses a significant burden on obtaining sufficient samples for immunoblotting detection of PTBP1 depletion. On average 3-5 adult animals per genotype are needed for each biological replicate. Our characterization of this Ptbp1 deletion allele in other contexts show the loss of full length PTBP1 proteins in ESCs and NPCs using Western blotting. Furthermore, germline homozygous mutant mice do not survive beyond embryonic day 6, supporting that it is  a loss of function allele.</p>

<p>(2) The authors should analyze PTBP1 expression in WT and cKO substantia nigra samples shown in Figure 3 or justify why this analysis is not necessary.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this important question. We used Aldh1l1-CreERT2, which is designed to be active in all the astrocyte throughout mouse brain. Although we have systematically verified PTBP1 elimination in different mouse brain regions (cortex and striatum) at multiple time points (from 4w to 12w after tamoxifen administration), we agree that it remains necessary and important to demonstrate whether the observed lack of astrocyte-to-neuron conversion is indeed associated with sufficient PTBP1 depletion. We will analyze the PTBP1 expression in the substantia nigra, as we did in the cortex and striatum.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We agree that assessing the positional distribution of CU-rich motifs between PTBP1-activated and PTBP1-repressed exons would provide valuable insight into the position-specific regulatory mechanisms of PTBP1. In response, we will perform separate motif enrichment analyses for PTBP1-activated and PTBP1-repressed exons and examine whether their positional patterns differ. This will help clarify whether these exons are differentially regulated by PTBP1 through distinct motif positioning in mature astrocytes.</p>

We agree that transcriptomewide differences in gene expression between astrocytes and developing neurons could confound the interpretation of splicing differences.

</disp-quote>
<p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s careful reading and valuable suggestions. These will help us improve the manuscript. We will expand the Discussion. The contradictory results in the previously published studies can be due to the stringency and neuronal leakage of the astrocytespecific GFAP promoter that some investigators chose. Other possibilities include alternative cell origin, increased neuronal resilience, or combinations of as yet unidentified factors.</p>
