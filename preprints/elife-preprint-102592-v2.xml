<title>Abstract</title>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is an intracellular parasite that subverts host cell functions via secreted virulence factors. Up to 70% of parasite-controlled changes in the host transcriptome rely on the MYR1 protein, which is required for the translocation of secreted proteins into the host cell. Mice infected with MYR1 knock-out (KO) strains survive infection, supporting a paramount function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> virulence and proliferation. However, we have previously shown that MYR1 mutants have no growth defect in pooled <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR-Cas9 screens in mice, suggesting that the presence of parasites that are wild-type at the <italic>myr1</italic> locus in pooled screens can rescue the phenotype. Here, we demonstrate that MYR1 is not required for the survival in IFN-γ-activated murine macrophages, and that parasites lacking MYR1 are able to expand during the onset of infection. While ΔMYR1 parasites have restricted growth in single-strain murine infections, we show that the phenotype is rescued by co-infection with wild-type (WT) parasites <italic>in vivo,</italic> independent of host functional adaptive immunity or key pro-inflammatory cytokines. These data show that the major function of MYR1-dependent secreted proteins is not to protect the parasite from clearance within infected cells. Instead, MYR-dependent proteins generate a permissive niche in a paracrine manner, which rescues ΔMYR1 parasites within a pool of CRISPR mutants in mice. Our results highlight an important limitation of otherwise powerful <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screens and point towards key functions for MYR1-dependent <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-host interactions beyond the infected cell.</p>

<title>Significance statement</title>
<p>Pooled CRISPR screens are powerful tools to interrogate gene function in a high-throughput manner. Genes conferring fitness advantages or disadvantages upon disruption can be identified by sequencing. However, in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> pooled CRISPR screens in mice, fitness defects for some selected mutants drastically diverge from those observed in single-strain infections. Here, we show that a growth defect of a single <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> gene deletion mutant is rescued if co-infected with wildtype parasites. These results shine light on <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>’s ability to subvert the host response beyond the infected cell, and highlight an important limitation of pooled CRISPR screens in mice. This limitation is probably encountered in CRISPR screens in general where paracrine effects occur.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pooled CRISPR screens have been an extraordinarily powerful genetic tool to identify gene function in an unbiased manner using negative or positive selection. They have been applied in various cell culture conditions and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in combination with different genetic or chemical bottlenecks to identify genes in a specific setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). Fitness-conferring genes are identified by assessing the relative abundance of cells with different genetic perturbations within a pool of mutants upon selective pressure.</p>
<p>We have previously performed pooled CRISPR screens in mice with the intracellular parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, to identify exported parasite proteins that are important for survival in his natural host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). For the majority of tested genes, the phenotypes observed in pooled CRISPR screens are concordant to those observed in single-strain infections using clonal mutants for those genes. To our surprise, however, we found that while some <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> genes are required for survival in single-strain mutant KO murine infections, this fitness defect phenotype is lost when the same mutants are part of a heterogenous mutant pool used for CRISPR screens in mice. We hypothesised that individual mutants can be rescued by paracrine effects triggered by other parasites in the pool, pointing towards a potential limitation of pooled CRISPR screens to detect a subset of important virulence factors in <italic>Toxoplasma.</italic> This limitation likely is not restricted to <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, or other infectious contexts, but CRISPR screens in general where paracrine effects are operating.</p>
<p><italic>Toxoplasma</italic> is a ubiquitous parasitic pathogen in all warm-blooded animals. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection is widespread in livestock and wild animals, as well as in humans, where one third of the population is estimated to be seropositive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>). Following oral infection by oocysts or latent stage tissue cysts, the parasite grows as tachyzoites in intermediate hosts, before disseminating to distal organs. The host immune response is pivotal to reduce parasite burden caused by rapidly proliferating tachyzoites. However, it is not sufficient to completely clear infection, as surviving parasites can differentiate into the chronic bradyzoite forms and establish tissue cysts in the central nervous system and skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>). During the onset of infection, recognition of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by host innate immune cells triggers the production of IL-12, amongst other pro-inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>). IL-12 has a protective role during toxoplasmosis, primarily by triggering IFN-γ production in lymphocytes and thereby linking innate and adaptive immunity during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>). IFN-γ is a pivotal cytokine in conferring resistance against <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection since it induces expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) that limit intracellular parasite proliferation and curtail infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>). These antimicrobial effects are enhanced by other pro-inflammatory cytokines. An example is TNF, which acts as a co-stimulatory signal to trigger IFN-γ production by NK cells exposed to the parasite, and boosts the antimicrobial activity of IFN-γ-activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>). Following <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection, host cells can also secrete chemokines such as CCL2, which drives recruitment of CCR2<sup>+</sup>Ly6C<sup>high</sup> inflammatory monocytes from the bone marrow to the infected sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). There, they can differentiate into monocyte-derived dendritic cells or macrophages and act as an extra line of defence against the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to survive clearance by host immune cells and to disseminate within the infected host, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> relies on an array of over 250 secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Following invasion, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> replicates inside a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) separated from the host cytoplasm by the PV membrane (PVM). During and after host cell invasion, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> secretes proteins from the rhoptries and the dense granules. Secreted proteins from these organelles are not only pivotal for vacuole establishment, but also nutrient uptake, reprogramming of the infected cell and protection against the host immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). In order to exert their effect, some <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proteins secreted from dense granules must cross the PVM, likely via a multi-protein translocon that depends on MYR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). GRA16, a dense granule effector that relies on MYR-dependent export to exit the PV and reach the host cytosol, was shown to drive upregulation of the transcription factor c-Myc in host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>). After the identification of MYR1 other putative components of the MYR translocon – MYR2, MYR3, MYR4, ROP17 – were identified, using their ability to trigger GRA16-dependent c-Myc induction in infected cells as a surrogate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). It was subsequently suggested that most, if not all exported dense granule proteins that reach the host cell cytosol might depend on functional MYR1 for translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). To date, seven virulence factors have been shown to be MYR1-dependent: IST, NSM, HCE1/TEEGR, GRA16, GRA18, GRA24 and GRA28. Once exported, these parasite proteins can interfere with host cell transcription and contribute to the establishment of permissive niches for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> proliferation and survival via multiple downstream mechanisms. Examples include boosting resistance against IFN-γ-dependent antimicrobial mechanisms (IST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>)), arresting the host cell cycle (HCE1/TEEGR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>)), inhibiting programmed host cell death pathways (NSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>)) and modulating cytokine/chemokine secretion (GRA16, GRA18, GRA24, GRA28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>).</p>
<p>Given the combined importance of exported dense granule effectors, it is not surprising that the vast majority of transcriptional changes in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>-infected human fibroblasts are dependent on MYR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>), and that isogenic MYR1-deficient strains are avirulent in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>). In pooled <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screens, however, we have shown that parasites lacking MYR1 had no fitness defect in a five-day infection experiment within the mouse peritoneum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). This is in agreement with results from <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screens performed in other labs using different parasite strains and mouse backgrounds where no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>), or only very mild growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>) have been observed for MYR1. This divergence of results between isogenic infection, which clearly shows an important role for MYR1 in murine infections, and the pooled CRISPR screens, which show no defect of MYR1 mutants, led us to hypothesise that: 1) MYR1, and therefore proteins that rely on the MYR1 complex for translocation, are not essential for the cell-autonomous survival of parasites in macrophages, the main cell type infected in the first days of a peritoneal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>); and 2) ΔMYR1 parasites within a pool of mutants may be rescued by MYR1-competent parasites via a paracrine effect, setting up a parasite-permissive immune environment in which MYR1-deficient mutants can thrive.</p>
<p>Here, we verify both hypotheses, showing that MYR1 is not important for the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cell-autonomous survival within macrophages, and deploy co-infection strategies proving that MYR1-competent parasites can trans-rescue the growth defect of ΔMYR1 parasites <italic>in vivo</italic>. This rescue does not depend on the host adaptive immune response and surprisingly still occurs despite high levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines. This knowledge is paramount to understand the biological function of MYR1-driven rewiring of the host cell, and consequently the function of MYR1-dependent effector proteins. It also highlights an important limitation of otherwise powerful <italic>in vivo</italic> pooled CRISPR screens in <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> where loss-of-function of a protein in one parasite can be rescued by other parasites in the pool. This limitation likely extends to CRISPR screens in other biological contexts in which paracrine effects operate.</p>

<title>MYR1 is not essential for survival within IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages</title>
<p>To test whether MYR1 was required for the parasite cell-autonomous survival in immune cells, we infected IFN-γ-primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with WT or MYR1 KO parasites established in the type II Prugniaud (Pru) genetic background, and quantified infected cells after 24 h. As GRA12 was shown to be required for parasite survival in IFN-γ-stimulated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) and had a strong growth defect in our pooled <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>), we included a ΔGRA12 strain in these experiments as positive control. As negative control, we included parasites lacking IST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">SI Appendix, Fig. S1b</xref>), a known MYR1-dependent factor that inhibits the induction of interferon-stimulated genes. IST protects the parasites against intracellular restriction when the infection precedes IFN-γ activation, but not if <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infects primed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). As expected, ΔGRA12 parasites showed a significant reduction in the proportion of infected cells in the presence of IFN-γ (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Infection with ΔMYR1 was comparable to ΔIST and not significantly different to that of WT parasites, although a slight increase in restriction was observed for ΔIST and ΔMYR1. Our results are in line with findings from Wang and colleagues where deletion of MYR1 in a more virulent type I strain similarly causes no fitness defect in IFN-γ-activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>To further validate the role of virulence factors in conferring parasite resistance against IFN-γ-mediated host defence, we assessed replication of ΔMYR1 or ΔGRA12 in competition with WT parasites over two lytic cycles in IFN-γ-treated or unprimed BMDMs, and in HFFs as control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). As expected, ΔGRA12 was outcompeted by WT parasites exclusively in BMDMs pre-stimulated with IFN-γ, confirming its role to survive the cytokine-mediated clearance in macrophages (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). On the contrary, ΔMYR1 parasites displayed a fitness defect compared to WT parasites, regardless of the infected cell type and independently of IFN-γ treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). This result is in line with the smaller size of the ΔMYR1 plaques established in HFFs compared to the parental strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), which recapitulates published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>

<title>MYR1 mutants expand during the course of infection and can form tissue cysts <italic>in vivo</italic></title>
<p>To investigate the growth of ΔMYR1 parasites <italic>in vivo</italic> and follow infection over time, we generated parasite strains expressing firefly luciferase (Luc) in the wild-type (WT-Luc) or ΔMYR1 backgrounds (ΔMYR1-Luc, SI Appendix Fig. S1c). We injected mice with 25,000 tachyzoites and monitored parasite growth over 7 days by intravital imaging (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). As expected from the reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> growth phenotype in HFFs and BMDMs, ΔMYR1-Luc showed reduced bioluminescent signal compared to WT-Luc parasites (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref>), confirming that the growth defect <italic>in vitro</italic> results in analogous phenotypes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Nevertheless, MYR1-deficient parasites were still able to expand in mice, as bioluminescence signal increased from day 3 to day 5 post infection (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-c</xref>). This initial increase of growth is similar to what was observed for ΔIST parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). ΔMYR1-Luc<italic>-</italic>infected mice that survived the acute phase of infection for four weeks p.i. carried a low number of cysts in the brain (3.4 cysts/brain on average; 0-13 cysts/brain detected, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). This is similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>) indicating that expression of luciferase does not decrease the ability to produce cysts and further supports the notion that ΔMYR1 parasites are able to form cysts, albeit at low numbers. As mice infected with WT parasites succumbed during the acute stage of infection, we cannot compare cyst numbers between the two strains.</p>

<title>MYR1-dependent secreted factor(s) rescue ΔMYR1 <italic>in vivo</italic> growth defect via a paracrine mechanism, independent of host adaptive immunity</title>
<p>We have shown that ΔMYR1 parasites have reduced <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> growth, despite not having any significant growth defect when in a pool with other mutants. Therefore, we hypothesised that MYR1-competent parasites within the KO pool generate a permissive environment that ultimately promotes growth of the ΔMYR1 mutants in a paracrine fashion. To test this hypothesis, we performed co-infection experiments where mice were injected with an inoculum containing a 20:80 ratio of ΔMYR1-Luc parasites with either WT parasites or ΔMYR1 mutants not expressing luciferase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). This setting allows us to assess if the presence of WT parasites affects growth of ΔMYR1-Luc parasites within the peritoneum. Our results show that ΔMYR1-Luc parasites proliferate better in mice co-infected with WT parasites than with ΔMYR1 parasites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-c</xref>). These results support a paracrine role of MYR1-mediated effectors <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<caption><title>Model illustrating paracrine rescue of ΔMYR1 parasites in pooled CRISPR screens.</title>
<p>Left panel: In single-strain infections ΔMYR1 parasites grow slowly within the peritoneum and are cleared. Right panel: Growth of ΔMYR1 parasites within a CRISPR pool is rescued by the presence of MYR-competent parasites. In cells infected with MYR1 competent parasites, MYR-dependent effectors enter the host cell, leading to secretion of cytokines that promote a favourable immune environment. MYR1 mutants are able to proliferate under these conditions (i.e are rescued <italic>in trans</italic>). However, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> virulence factor mutants required for survival within a cell (cell-autonomous), such as GRA12, can not be rescued in trans.</p></caption>
    <graphic xlink:href="609334v2_fig4rev.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To understand what mediates this trans-rescue phenotype, we assessed the production of selected pro-inflammatory cytokines important during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection. Mice infected with a mix of ΔMYR1:WT or ΔMYR1:ΔMYR1 parasites display comparable levels of IL-12p40 in both peritoneum and serum at day 7 p.i. However, ΔMYR1:WT infections elicited higher levels of CCL2/MCP-1, TNF and especially IFN-γ compared to the ΔMYR1:ΔMYR1 mix (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">SI Appendix Fig. S1d-f</xref>).</p>
<p>Considering that ΔMYR1-Luc growth is rescued even when high levels of IFN-γ are produced in the peritoneal cavity, we wanted to assess whether disrupting IFN-γ-producing cell populations would impact the trans-rescue phenotype. Lymphocytes, in particular CD8<sup>+</sup>, Th1-committed CD4<sup>+</sup> and γδ T cells, are the main sources of IFN-γ during <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>). Thus, we applied the same mixed infection strategy in Rag2-deficient mice that do not produce mature T and B cells, and therefore fail to deploy adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). As expected, an overall higher parasitaemia was detected in <italic>Rag</italic>2<sup>-/-</sup> mice when compared to WT mice, due to the known role of the T and B cells to control infection. Nevertheless, in both <italic>Rag</italic>2<sup>-/-</sup> and WT control mice ΔMYR1-Luc parasites proliferate more when mixed with WT parasites than with ΔMYR1 parasites (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). These results confirm that the host adaptive response is not essential for the trans-rescue of MYR1-deficient <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> during acute infection.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work we show that deletion of MYR1, and by extension MYR1-dependent effectors, does not impact the ability of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> to initiate an infection in mice and survive in IFN-γ-stimulated murine macrophages. While clonal ΔMYR1 mutants have a significantly reduced growth compared to WT parasites <italic>in vivo</italic>, co-infection with WT parasites increased their ability to proliferate. This finding supports results from pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens, where loss-of-function mutants of <italic>Myr1</italic> and other genes previously shown to be involved in PV translocation of effector proteins, show no (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>) or only relatively minor fitness defects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). The rescue phenotype observed in mixed infections is very unlikely to occur through co-infection of host cells by WT and ΔMYR1 parasites, as in the peritoneal exudate from infected mice less than 2% of all infected cells were co-infected (data not shown). As such, our data indicates that some MYR1-dependent effectors cause changes in infected murine cells, that in turn provide a favourable environment for parasite growth in a paracrine manner. This is important as: 1) It shows that the major transcriptional changes caused by MYR-dependent effectors are not required for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> to survive cell-autonomous immune responses in IFN-γ-primed cells; 2) Paracrine rescue in pooled CRISPR-Cas9 screens may mask a significant amount of proteins required for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> survival; 3) It is likely that this “paracrine masking effect” can be found in CRISPR screens in other biological contexts, e.g.: other host-microbe interaction screens, and possibly even in non-infectious biological contexts, such as pooled CRISPR screen approaches to study cancer immunity and to discover regulators of innate and adaptive immunity crosstalk (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>)).</p>
<p>We found that the presence of WT parasites in a mixed inoculum with ΔMYR1 mutants elicited significantly higher levels of IFN-γ and TNF in the peritoneum than ΔMYR1 mutants alone. As IFN-γ was shown to be a major cytokine to limit <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> growth in a cell-autonomous manner, and that TNF acts mainly by enhancing the antimicrobial effects in IFN-γ-activated cells, one would expect that ΔMYR1-Luc parasites would be more restricted when injected in combination with WT parasites. However, we observed the opposite, as higher ΔMYR1-Luc parasitaemia was observed in ΔMYR1:WT than in ΔMYR1:ΔMYR1 mixes. These data provide further support that MYR1, and by extension MYR1-dependent effectors, do not protect <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> from the IFN-γ-mediated intracellular clearance in mice.</p>
<p>What could be the driving force of the rescue? We show that the adaptive immune system plays no role, pointing towards cells of the innate immune system. Higher CCL2 levels in mice infected with ΔMYR1:WT suggests higher inflammatory Ly6C<sup>high</sup> monocytes recruitment to infected tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>). These cells could be responsible for the high levels of TNF and IFN-γ detected. While monocytes have been shown in multiple reports to be important for limiting <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> upon exposure to IFN-γ in infected niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>), it is possible that recruited monocytes also provide an important reservoir for parasites to grow in the peritoneum. However, how ΔMYR1 parasites are eventually cleared in homogenous infections in the absence of high levels of CCL2 is not yet known.</p>
<p>Individual MYR-related effectors that may be responsible for the paracrine rescue have not been investigated here and we hypothesise that the phenotype is likely the concerted result of multiple effectors that affect cytokine secretion. For example, previous studies showed that both GRA18 and GRA28 can induce release of CCL22 from infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>), while GRA16 and HCE1/TEEGR impair NF-kB signalling and the potential release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>). Regardless of the effector(s), our results highlight an important novel function of MYR1-dependent effectors by establishing a supportive environment in <italic>trans</italic> for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> growth within the peritoneum.</p>
<p>We further confirm previous results using luciferase-expressing ΔMYR1 parasites that MYR1 appears to be dispensable for the formation and persistence of latent <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> stages <italic>per se</italic>. As MYR1 has been demonstrated to be dispensable for stage conversion <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>), the relatively low number of cysts is likely explained by a failure of ΔMYR1 parasites to efficiently disseminate and/or persist within the murine host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>). In alternative, we hypothesise that the absence of CCL2 in ΔMYR1 infections limits recruitment of host cells that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> can potentially use as vehicles to reach the brain.</p>
<p>This work also highlights the limitations of restriction-based CRISPR-screens in capturing the variety of pathogen’s mechanisms to survive host clearance. Novel applications of the CRISPR screens, for example in combination with single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>) or with functional assays to explore immunological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>) could help understand how infected cells affect the neighbouring environment to support infection, and contribute to parasite survival, dissemination and persistence within the host. Here, we show that MYR1-dependent proteins play a critical role in promoting a favourable environment for growth beyond the infected cell in a paracrine manner. This is different to the injection of rhoptry effector proteins by <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> into cells it does not invade, which requires parasite-host cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>), and provides a novel angle on how the parasite can systematically alter the host environment in its favour during infection.</p>
<p>Our work draws attention to an understudied aspect of pathogen manipulation in complex multicellular settings which warrants further studies. The limitation we highlight here, that mutant phenotypes can be masked in pooled CRISPR screens, likely extends to other experimental setups where paracrine effects are possible.</p>

<p>Previous studies have highlighted some of these paracrine activities of Toxoplasma - and Rasogi et al (mBio, 2020) used a single cell sequencing approach of cells infected in vitro with the WT or MYR KO parasites - and one of their conclusions was that MYR-1 dependent paracrine activities counteract ROP-dependent processes. Similarly, Chen et al (JEM 2020) highlighted that a particular rhoptry protein (ROP16) could be injected into uninfected macrophages and move them to an anti-inflammatory state that might benefit the parasite.</p>
<p>Caveats around immunity and as yet no insight into how this works. In Fig 2 there is a marked defect in the ability of the parasites to expand at day 2 and day 5.

<p>Comments on revisions:</p>
<p>The authors have provided their perspective on the original review. There were some previous comments that revolved around whether some of the early changes were masked by pooling data sets where they have reiterated that it is not statistically different. Would have been nice to have seen out addressed by having experiments that were appropriately powered. But it's their call.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Torelli et al., the authors propose that the major function of MYR1 and MYR1-dependent secreted proteins is to contribute to parasite survival in a paracrine manner rather than to protect parasites from cell-autonomous immune response. The authors conclude that these paracrine effects rescue ∆MYR1 or knockouts of MYR1-dependent effectors within pooled in vivo CRISPR screens.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors raised a more general concern that pooled CRISPR screens (not only in Toxoplasma but also other microbes or cancers) would miss important genes by &quot;paracrine masking effect&quot;. Although there is no doubt that pooled CRISPR screens (especially in vivo CRISPR screens) are powerful techniques, I think this topic could be of interest to those fields and researchers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this version, the reviewer is not entirely convinced of the 'paracrine masking effect' because the in vivo experiments should include appropriate controls (see major point 2) in the first submission.</p>
<p>After the revision, although no experiments were added, this reviewer considered that the points have been sufficiently discussed and commented on.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<p>We thank the reviewers for their time and thoughtful comments on our manuscript.</p>
<p>We realised a preliminary version of Figure 2 was initially submitted, which we are replacing now with a novel version. Differences between the two figures are : 1) The schematic in Figure 2a was replaced with a new one in line with that of Figure 3a; 2) in Figure 2c details about the statistical analysis were removed from the legend and one datapoint that was erroneously removed at day 5 for the ΔMYR1-Luc condition was included. Regardless, these changes do not affect the results and the conclusions initially drawn.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We are aware of both these studies, where the injection of rhoptry proteins into cells that the parasite does not invade alters the host transcriptional profile establishing a permissive environment. However, here we propose a different paracrine effect that goes beyond the injected/uninfected cell. Specifically, we propose that one or more MYR1-dependent effectors alter the cytokine secretion profile of infected cells, which leads to overall changes in the immune response such as cell types recruited to the site of infection, or the activation state.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>Yes, we also hypothesise an early effect based on the data. Growth continues until day 5 at least, and then plateaus towards day 7, which makes us believe that the effect takes place within the first 5 days. We agree with the reviewer that the MYR1-mediated rescue acts before the involvement of the adaptive immune response, which is supported by our results obtained in Rag2-/- mice shown in Figure 3e.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript by Torelli et al., the authors propose that the major function of MYR1 and MYR1-dependent secreted proteins is to contribute to parasite survival in a paracrine manner rather than to protect parasites from cell-autonomous immune response. The authors conclude that these paracrine effects rescue ∆MYR1 or knockouts of MYR1-dependent effectors within pooled in vivo CRISPR screens.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors raised a more general concern that pooled CRISPR screens (not only in Toxoplasma but also other microbes or cancers) would miss important genes by &quot;paracrine masking effect&quot;. Although there is no doubt that pooled CRISPR screens (especially in vivo CRISPR screens) are powerful techniques, I think this topic could be of interest to those fields and researchers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>In this version, the reviewer is not entirely convinced of the 'paracrine masking effect' because the in vivo experiments should include appropriate controls (see major point 2).</p>
<p>(1) It is convincing that co-infection of WT and ∆MYR1 parasites could rescue the growth of ∆MYR1 in mice shown by in vivo luciferase imaging. Also, this is consistent with ∆MYR1 parasites showing no in vivo fitness defect in the in vivo CRISPR screens conducted by several groups. Meanwhile, it has been reported previously and shown in this manuscript that ∆MYR1 parasites have an in vitro growth defect; however, ∆MYR1 parasites show no in vitro fitness defect the in vitro pooled CRISPR screen. The authors show that the competition defect of ∆MYR1 parasites cannot be rescued by co-infection with WT parasites in Figure 1c, which might indicate that no paracrine rescue occurred in an in vitro environment. The authors seem not to mention these discrepancies between in vitro CRISPR screens and in vitro competition assays. Why do ∆MYR1 parasites possess neutral in vitro fitness scores in in vitro CRISPR screens? Could the authors describe a reasonable hypothesis?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer raises a very interesting point, which at this stage, we cannot fully explain. A technical explanation could be that the relatively small growth defect detected for clean KOs, is not well represented in the CRISPR screens due to the variability of guides, where smaller differences in growth are not reliably captured and hidden within the noise of the assays. Another technical explanation may be median-centering: if the majority of KOs in the pool have a small growth defect, median centering would push these towards a zero. We have observed and reported this phenomenon in Young et al., 2019 for libraries containing a larger fraction of genes with a negative fitness score. In the library used here focusing on secreted proteins, we have not observed a strong trend to negative fitness scores, but cannot exclude smaller shifts. Because we have no solid base to favour any of the above mentioned explanations, we have decided to not speculate too much on this in the manuscript. However, we wanted to show all the data as the difference between these results may not be technical, but biological, which could inform future studies or results by us and others.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) The authors developed a mixed infection assay with an inoculum containing a 20:80 ratio of ΔMYR1-Luc parasites with either WT parasites or ΔMYR1 mutants not expressing luciferase, showing that the in vivo growth defect of ∆MYR1 parasites is rescued by the presence of WT parasites. Since this experiment lacks appropriate controls, interpretation could be difficult. Is this phenomenon specific to MYR1? If a co-inoculum of ∆GRA12-Luc with either WT parasites or GRA12 parasites not expressing luciferase is included, the data could be appropriately interpreted.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not quite sure what appropriate controls the reviewer refers to. We show here in Figures 3c and 3f that increasing parasite load by co-infecting mice with ∆MYR1 parasites is not sufficient to rescue ∆MYR1-Luc parasite growth. Co-infection with WT parasites, however, does result in increased ∆MYR1-Luc parasitaemia at day 7 p.i., indicating that MYR1 competence is required for the <italic>in vivo</italic> trans-rescue we describe. As ∆GRA12 parasites have a very strong cell-autonomous restriction <italic>in vitro</italic> and severe growth defect <italic>in vivo</italic> (Torelli et al., BioRxiv), these parasites would be rapidly depleted, which is also observed in all CRISPR screens from various laboratories. Therefore we do not think that co-infection with GRA12-deficient parasites would be an informative experiment here. We do speculate that mutant parasites for other proteins required for export (i.e. MYR 2, 3, 4, ROP17) could also be trans-rescued in addition to mutants for other MYR-dependent proteins such as GRA24 and GRA28, which remodel cytokine secretion and could individually, or synergistically, affect host cell immunity. Dissecting which <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> factor/s and host cytokine signalling pathways drive this trans-rescue effect is highly interesting, but beyond the scope of this manuscript. Here, we focused on the basic concept that an individual mutant can be rescued in trans <italic>in vivo,</italic> which we think is of importance beyond the field of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> research.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) In the Discussion part, the authors argue that the rescue phenotype of mixed infection is not due to co-infection of host cells (lines 307-310). This data is important to support the authors' paracrine hypothesis and should be shown in the main figure.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We understand the reviewer’s concern for rescue by co-infection of the same cell, but we largely exclude this hypothesis as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> cell-autonomous effectors, such as GRA12 and ROP18, would also be rescued if that were to happen on a larger scale. We previously performed an <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment to assess co-infection rates of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) by imaging using infection doses comparable to those used in the trans-rescue experiments. The total infection rate of PECs was 2.3%, so the overall number of infected cells per image was low, and not suitable for publication purposes. We tried to capture more cells using FACS analysis, however, PECs are highly autofluorescent in the yellow/green channels, which prevented us from drawing adequate conclusions using our GFP and mCherry strains. Because we see no rescue of GRA12 or ROP18 in CRISPR screens, and the overall <italic>in vivo</italic> co-infection rates were very low as observed by imaging, we did not think that generating strains expressing different fluorochromes compatible with standard FACS analysis, and then performing more <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments was best use of resources at the time.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) In the Discussion part, the authors assume that the rescue phenotype is the result of multiple MYR1-dependent effectors. I admit that this hypothesis could be possible since a recently published paper described the concerted action of numerous MYR1-dependent or independent effectors contributing to the hypermigration of infected cells (Ten Hoeve et al., mBio, 2024). I think this paragraph would be kind of overstated since the authors did not test any of the candidate effectors. Since the authors possess ∆IST parasites, they can test whether IST is involved in the &quot;paracrine masking effect&quot; or not to support their claim.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MYR1 deletion impairs the export of multiple <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> effectors into the host cell, including GRA16, GRA24, GRA28, HCE1/TEEGR etc, many of which can influence cytokine levels. As such, we speculate that it is a combination of multiple effector proteins that are responsible for the trans-rescue. As stated above, which parasite effectors, host cell types and cytokines are involved in the phenotype we describe are part of ongoing and future studies. Here, we wanted to focus on the key message, that in <italic>in vivo</italic> CRISPR screens, paracrine rescue of individual mutants can occur. While we will test IST mutants, it is probably not the top candidate as it only prevents upregulation of ISGs after exposure to IFN-γ, but has probably no role in already stimulated cells. As we still observe strong rescue past day 3, when IFN-γ levels are already elevated (Nishiyama 2020 Parasitol Int), IST probably plays no dominant role.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>(1) Figure 1 - it's not obvious what concentration of IFN-gamma is being used in these assays (sorry if this is stated somewhere else).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>All <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were performed with 100 U/ml IFN-γ as stated in the Material &amp; Methods section, however added this information in the figure legend of Figure 1.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(2) Figure 3 This reviewer wonders if earlier differences are buried in the data sets. In Figure 3b it looks like there are early differences but this is lost in the collated data analysis in 3c. An early difference is quite apparent in Figure 2.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree with the reviewer that a difference is visible at day 3 and 5 in Figure 3b, however differences between experimental groups became statistically significant only at day 7 in Figure 3c (N = 4 biological replicates). We cannot compare results between Figure 3c and Figure 2c as the latter reports 100% WT or ΔMYR1 infections and not 20:80 mixes.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(3) The authors conclude from their in vitro studies that MYR-1 is not required for in vitro growth in IFN-g activated macrophages. Given that the WT parasites still rescue MYR KO parasites in RAG mice it does imply that this paracrine effect would impact early innate responses. Since RAG mice do have a strong ILC/NK cell response that leads to the local production of IFN-g it would seem like a reasonable candidate. Do the authors know if the MYR KO have improved growth in the absence of IFN-g in vivo? This could be done using KO mice or with IFN-g neutralization.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>MYR1 displayed a neutral score in CRISPR screens in IFN-γ KO mice (Tachibana et al Cell Reports 2023), suggesting that lack of IFN-γ does not specifically improve MYR1 mutant growth compared to other mutants in a pool. We believe that the rescue is rather driven by other cytokines that have been shown to be altered in a MYR1 dependent manner (i.e CCL2, IL-6, IL-12). But as laid out before, this is subject of future studies.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p>
<p>The authors previously published a study that combines CRISPR screens in Toxoplasma and host transcriptome by scRNA-seq (Butterworth et al., Cell Host Microbe 2023). I think the authors possess transcriptome of ∆MYR1-infected HFFs. Although I understand this screen is conducted in in-vitro culture and human fibroblasts, are there any differentially expressed genes or pathways that could explain the paracrine rescue phenomenon described in this manuscript?</p>

<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment, which is however hard to address.  Thousands of host cell genes within multiple pathways are affected by MYR1 deletion (Naor et al. mBio 2018; Butterworth et al. Cell Host Microbe 2023). Therefore the PerturbSeq dataset is not helpful to pinpoint specific immune mechanisms of rescue, and is speculative without any experimentation to back it up. However, we added a sentence in line 350 of the discussion to highlight known MYR1-related effects on immune-related pathways. “Individual MYR-related effectors that may be responsible for the paracrine rescue have not been investigated here and we hypothesise that the phenotype is likely the concerted result of multiple effectors that affect cytokine secretion. For example, previous studies showed that both GRA18 and GRA28 can induce release of CCL22 from infected cells (He 2018 eLife; Rudzki 2021 mBio), while GRA16 and HCE1/TEEGR impair NF-kB signalling and the potential release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and TNF (Seo 2020 Int J Mol Sci; Braun 2019 Nat Microbiol). Regardless of the effector(s), our results highlight an important novel function of MYR1-dependent effectors by establishing a supportive environment in <italic>trans</italic> for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> growth within the peritoneum.”</p>
