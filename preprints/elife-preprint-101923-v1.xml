<title>Summary</title><p>PIEZO channels transmit mechanical force signals to cells, allowing them to make critical decisions during development and in pathophysiological conditions. Their fast/slow inactivation modes have been implicated in mechanopathologies, but remain poorly understood. Here, we report several near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of fast-inactivating wild-type human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) and its slow-inactivating channelopathy mutants with or without its auxiliary subunit MDFIC. Our results suggest that the faster inactivating hPIEZO1 has a more flattened and extended architecture than the slower inactivating curved mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1). The multi-lipidated MDFIC subunits insert laterally into the hPIEZO1 pore module like mPIEZO1, resulting in a more curved and extended state. Interestingly, the high-resolution structures suggest that the pore lipids, which directly seal the central hydrophobic pore, are involved in the rapid inactivation of hPIEZO1. While the severe hereditary erythrocytosis mutant R2456H significantly slows down the inactivation of hPIEZO1, the hPIEZO1-R2456H-MDFIC complex shows a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H. These results suggest that the pore lipids may be involved in the mechanopathological rapid inactivation mechanism of PIEZO channels.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells rely on mechanosensitive (MS) channels, which rapidly convert force into ion flow, to sense environmental changes and make appropriate decisions throughout the prokaryotic and eukaryotic kingdoms. In bacteria, two major MS channels, the small-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscS) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup> and large-conductance mechanosensitive channel (MscL) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup> channels, are responsible for bacterial force sensing. In contrast, in mammals, only the PIEZO <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, two-pore domain K(+) channel (K2P) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> and TMEM63 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> channels have been identified as bona fide MS channels. Structural studies indicate that not all MS channels are constructively conserved, ranging from monomer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> to heptamer <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>, but they are likely to obey two putative principles of force-from-lipid (FFL) and force-from- filament (FFF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>.Within the heptameric MscS channel in bacteria, three types of lipids, the pore lipids, the gatekeeper lipids, and the pocket lipids, sense and transduce force at corresponding positions <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Similarly, the pseudo-tetrameric MS K2P channels also utilize at least three types of lipids to regulate channel activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>. In particular, pore lipids seal the channel pores and could be removed by the mechanical force upon activation of the MscS, MS K2P and TMEM63 channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. In the trimeric PIEZO channels, membrane curvature is likely associated with channel activation <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>. Although the PIEZO channel also obeys the FFL principle <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>, the role of the lipids in PIEZO channel gating remains elusive.</p>
<p>Hereditary erythrocytosis (HX), also known as inherited dehydrated stomatocytosis, is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes dehydration of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in haemolytic anaemia. Genetic studies have shown that familial HX mutations occur in the gene encoding the human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) channel <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. Electrophysiological analyses show that some HX mutations exhibit slower inactivation gating kinetics than wildtype hPIEZO1. The slower inactivation may result in the higher open probability and delayed inactivation of hPIEZO1; thus, these mutations are considered gain of function (GOF) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. In addition to changes in gating kinetics, some of the HX mutations show alterations in response to osmotic pressure and in membrane protein trafficking <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the populations with a mild GOF PIEZO1 allele are likely to be resistant to malaria infection, while some present a strong association with increased plasma iron <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Although the corresponding GOF mutant of PIEZO1 in mice can partially mimic the human phenotype, hPIEZO1 exhibits faster inactivation gating kinetics than mPIEZO1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore, mPIEZO1 presents a native “GOF” state relative to hPIEZO1 regarding inactivation gating kinetics. Recently, it has been reported that the MyoD-family inhibitor, MDFIC/MDFI, are auxiliary subunits of PIEZO channels to prolong inactivation and reduce mechanosensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Identifying MDFIC/MDFI enriches the regulation approaches of PIEZO channel inactivation gating kinetics, which may broaden our insight into force sensing in animals and humans. Although the inactivation phenotype of PIEZO channels are very susceptible to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, the molecular basis of their inactivation remains unclear.</p>
<p>Here we report the structural basis of hPIEZO1 gating and inactivation based on the architecture of wild-type human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1) and its slow inactivating channelopathy mutants with or without its auxiliary subunit MDFIC at near-atomic resolution by cryo-EM. Our high-resolution structures support a model in which the pore lipids directly seal the central hydrophobic pore and involve fast inactivation of hPIEZO1. This model also provides a mechanistic understanding of the severe hereditary erythrocytosis mutant R2456H with a more curved and contracted structure with an inner helix twist due to the broken link between the pore lipid and R2456H.</p>

<title>Overall structure of the full-length hPIEZO1</title>
<p>hPIEZO1 is known to have faster inactivation gating kinetics than mPIEZO1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The structural basis of this difference remains unresolved. To resolve this, we synthesized a codon-optimized full- length hPIEZO1 with a C-terminal GFP and flag tag into the pBM vector <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup> and this construct exhibits similar mechanosensitivity and fast inactivation gating properties as previously reported by whole-cell poking assay (Extended Data Fig. 2a). We overexpressed hPIEZO1 in 12 liters of HEK293F suspension cells, extracted the protein with lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) and purified it in a digitonin environment. The symmetric peak of the full-length hPIEZO1 suggests the protein is homogenous. The smeared bands around 300 kDa on SDS-PAGE indicate the potential presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) and the lower bands may be the binding partners or degraded fragment of hPIEZO1 (Extended Data Fig. 1a-b).</p>
<p>The purified hPIEZO1 protein was subjected to the standard cryo-EM workflow, resulting in a cryo-EM density map at a total resolution of 3.3 Å from approximately 87K particles (Extended Data Fig. 3a-e) that allowed us to build a near-atomic model of hPIEZO1 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Among the 9 transmembrane helix units (THUs) containing four transmembrane helices for each predicted by primary sequences, the two N-terminal ones are not visible in the cryo-EM density map. The rest of the THUs, along with the pore module consisting of an anchor, an outer helix (OH), an inner helix (IH), and a cap domain, are resolved (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Compared to the anchor, OH and IH, the resolution of the cap domain is slightly lower, which may be due to the flexibility of the cap domain. On the intracellular side, a long beam helix supports the THU7-9 and pore modules. Each hPIEZO1 subunit has a curved blade structure and the three subunits form the trimeric PIEZO channel, exhibiting a bowl-like shape. The hPIEZO1 density map, filtered with a low pass filter, shows a disk approximately 30 nm wide with a horn-like density in the peripheral blade region, likely due to the PTMs such as glycosylation. Interestingly, we see a large density below the central pore module at the intracellular side, which may be potential auxiliary subunits, consistent with the lower molecular weight bands on SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b-g</xref>).</p>

<title>hPIEZO1 is more flattened and extended than mPIEZO1</title>
<p>Several studies using high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup> and 3D interferometric photoactivation localization microscopy (iPALM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> suggest that PIEZO blades may receive mechanical force through sensing membrane curvature. The reshaping of the curvature of the PIEZO conducts force to the pore region, which may result in the channel pore opening and ion flow. Structural comparison of hPIEZO1 and curved mPIEZO1 shows that hPIEZO1 presents a more flattened structure from the side view (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The blades of hPIEZO1 are about 5 Å down towards the cytoplasmic side than those of mPIEZO1. Meanwhile, the cap domain of hPIEZO1 is slightly upwards to the extracellular side (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). In the top view, the distal blades rotate counterclockwise about 22 Å compared to mPIEZO1 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Therefore, hPIEZO1 appears more extended than the curved mPIEZO1. Meanwhile, hPIEZO1 still maintains a sizeable curved state compared to the flattened mPIEZO1 structure. From the top view, the two structures are very similar (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c-d</xref>). The pore radius of hPIEZO1 is between that of the curved and flattened mPIEZO1. Therefore, the curved hPIEZO1 may still represent a non-conducting state (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e-h</xref>), and the differences in curvature and pore radius may be implicated in channel gating properties of hPIEZO1 and mPIEZO1.</p>

<title>GOF channelopathy mutants, hPIEZO1-A1988V, hPIEZO1-E756del and hPIEZO1-R2456H, are structurally unstable</title>
<p>The success in solving hPIEZO1 structure encouraged us to probe the structural basis of channelopathy. We selected the mild GOF mutants hPIEZO1-A1988V and hPIEZO1-E756del, common in African populations with a slightly longer inactivation time, and the more severe R2456H mutant with a much longer inactivation time <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. However, when we tried to solve their structures based on the same method, i.e., overexpressing and purifying these three channelopathy mutants in HEK293F suspension cells, extracting them with LMNG detergent and purifying them in a digitonin environment (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Extended Data Fig. 1c-e</xref>), we can only obtain three channelopathy mutant proteins and their raw cryo-EM images. Still, we failed to achieve satisfactory 2D class averages of them (Extended Data Fig. 5-6 and 7a-b). As a result, we could not generate high- resolution 3D density maps of hPIEZO1-E756del and hPIEZO1-R2456H. We then tried and obtained almost twice as many hPIEZO1-A1988V images as the wild type but only achieved a 3.7 Å resolution cryo-EM density map (Extended Data Fig. 7). Yet, the resulting overall structure is similar to the wild type (Extended Data Fig. 8). Based on these results, these three hPIEZO1 channelopathy GOF mutants may be structurally unstable than wild type.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>The structure of hPIEZO1-MDFIC complex</title>
<p>MDFIC, a MyoD family inhibitor protein, has recently been identified as an auxiliary subunit of piezo channels capable of decelerating channel inactivation and attenuating channel mechanosensitivity <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. To solve the structural basis of MDFIC on hPIEZO1, we co-expressed it with hMDFIC in HEK293F and purified the complex (Extended Data Fig. 1a, 1f). We obtained a 3.0 Å resolution cryo-EM density map of the hPIEZO1-MDFIC complex (Extended Data Fig. 9). The overall cryo-EM density map is similar to hPIEZO1 alone with a disc of about 30 nm (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-f</xref>), but allowed us to validate the MDFIC density with multi-lipidated cysteines on the C-terminal amphipathic helix (Extended Data Fig. 12). Clearly, this C-terminal helix inserted laterally into the pore module where the exact position of mPIEZO1 is found (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a-f</xref>). Interestingly, while MDFIC does not significantly alter the curvature of mPIEZO1, it induces a more curved and contracted architecture in hPIEZO1 from the side and top views, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g-h</xref>). These results suggest that MDFIC decelerates hPIEZO1 inactivation and weakens its mechanosensitivity by remodeling the pore module and exerting more blade curvature.</p>

<title>MDFIC stabilizes GOF channelopathy hPIEZO mutant complexes</title>
<p>The curving effect of MDFIC on hPIEZO1 further encouraged us to test if it can stabilize the unstable channelopathy mutants hPIEZO1-A1988V, hPIEZO1-E756del and hPIEZO1-R2456H (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). Indeed, electrophysiological studies showed that co-expression of these channelopathy mutants with MDFIC resulted in significantly reduced mechanosensitivity and inactivation rate (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We then co-expressed these hPIEZO1 mutants with MDFIC in HEK293F suspension cells and purified the resulting complex as the same method (Extended Data Fig. 1g-i). Surprisingly, with standard cryo-EM analysis, we obtained high-quality 2D class averages for hPIEZO1-A1988V-MDFIC and hPIEZO1-E756del-MDFIC.

<p>The unexpected higher resolution maps of hPIEZO1-A1988V-MDFIC and hPIEZO1-E756del- MDFIC reveal a bowl-like disc of about 30 nm for both complexes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h-j</xref>).

The smaller disc is mainly due to the more significant contraction of the blade arms and a more curved state compared to the wild-type hPIEZO1-MDFIC in the side view (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5g-h</xref>).

<title>R2456 anchors a lipid at the pore module</title>
<p>Then, we wished to build a pore module based on the solved structures. We were surprised to find an apparent lipid density in wild-type hPIEZO1-MDFIC, hPIEZO1-A1988V-MDFIC and even more evident in the 2.8 Å resolution map of hPIEZO1-E756del-MDFIC in the pore module, where one of its hydrophobic fatty acid tails inserts into the hydrophobic pore formed by I2447, V2450 and F2454, thus sealing the pore to prevent ion flow (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-c</xref>). Even more surprisingly, the hydrophilic phosphate head interacts directly with R2456, a residue with the more severe form of GOF mutation, on the side of the inner helix of the pore. In addition, another fatty acid chain of the pore lipid interacts with the acyl chains of the covalently linked MDFIC lipids, forming a stable hPIEZO1-multi-lipidated MDFIC-pore lipid complex (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a-c</xref>). We also carefully checked the corresponding pore lipid configuration in the 3.3 Å resolution map of hPIEZO1 and the 3.8 Å resolution map of hPIEZO1-A1988V without the multi-lipidated MDFIC auxiliary subunit and found that in wild-type hPIEZO1, similar pore lipids also insert into the hydrophobic pore interacting with R2456 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). However, in the mild GOF hPIEZO1-A1988V, which has a slower inactivation rate compared to wild-type hPIEZO1, the acyl chains of the pore lipid are retracted from the central hydrophobic pore to the side of the IH, although the hydrophilic phosphate group heads still interact with R2456 (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>).

<title>Pore lipids may involve the fast inactivation of hPIEZO1</title>
<p>Our results support a putative model that the hydrophobic acyl chain tails of the pore lipids insert into the hydrophobic pore region and seal the pore (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref>). Consistently, the slower inactivating hPIEZO1-A1988V mutant has the same hydrophobic acyl chain tails retracted from the hydrophobic pore region, implying that the pore lipids involve the fast inactivation of hPIEZO1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8a</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). The evidence supporting this model is based on previous electrophysiological functional studies that substitution of the hydrophobic pore, formed by I2447, V2450, and F2454, with a hydrophilic pore prolongs the inactivation time for both PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 channels <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. More robust evidence comes from the HX channelopathy mutant R2456H wherein disrupting the interaction between the hydrophilic phosphate group head and R2456, which leads to remodeling of the blade and pore module (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d-h</xref>), thus significantly prolonging the inactivation time. These results suggest that the pore lipids involve the fast inactivation of hPIEZO1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8d</xref>). Consistently, in curved and flattened mPIEZO1 structures <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, pore lipids are occupying the similar lateral side of the pore, but not sealing the pore like the hPIEZO1-A1988V mutant (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>-e and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8c</xref>). Similarly, we suspect that the curved and flattened mPIEZO1 structures are not sealed by pore lipid and thus may not adopt the deep inactivation state, consistent with electrophysiological results showing a slower inactivation manner of mPIEZO1.</p>

<p>The multi-lipidated MDFIC functions to stabilize the pore lipids that seal the hydrophobic pore further through interactions between hydrophobic acyl chain tails of the pore lipids and the lipids covalently linked to MDFIC (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Once activated, the PIEZO-MDFIC complexes assume much slower inactivation (Extended Data Fig. 2), consistent with the model that the multi-lipidated MDFIC makes the PIEZO challenging to open by mechanical force (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>). Therefore, we deduce that the hPIEZO1-MDFIC/hPIEZO1-A1988V-MDFIC/hPIEZO1-E756del-MDFIC reshape the pore module and fall into a deep resting state, in which it becomes rather tricky to remove the pore lipid from the hydrophobic pore by mild mechanical force. On the other hand, once the pore lipids are removed by a higher threshold of the mechanical force, it is equally more difficult for the pore lipids to return to the hydrophobic pore region and regain the stable pore module-multi- lipidated MDFIC-pore lipid complex, thus resulting in the very prolonged slow inactivation phenotype (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8b</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8d</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Piezo ion channels are the critical force sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup> that allow cells to sense their physical environment and regulate the cell fate. Intracellular signaling pathways have become the focus of research to understand the mechanism of mechanical force involved by piezo channels in cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. MyoD was the first transcription factor identified to specify cell fate in a cell-autonomous fashion, ushering decades of investigation into cell fate control that led to the discovery of iPSC reprogramming<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. It is intriguing that MyoD interacting proteins MDFIC and MDFI are auxiliary factors for the PIEZO mechanosensitive ion channels, suggesting that these complexes link the cell force sensing and cell fate control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Indeed, mice with PIEZO deletions are lethal, supporting the idea that mechanosensing through these channels is critical in cell fate control during development. To understand the role of PIEZO or PIEZO-MDFIC/MDFI in human cell fate control, we solved the structure of hPIEZO1 in complex with and without MDFIC. MDFIC enables hPIEZO1 to respond to different forces by modifying the pore module through lipid interactions.</p>
<p>The fast and slow inactivation modes may allow cells to respond to external forces more accurately. Indeed, inactivation is widespread in different types of ion channels. Inactivation can be plastic, driven by intrinsic and extrinsic cues, and regulates many physiological processes. Mechanistically, inactivation follows different principles in different ion channels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. The inactivation rate of PIEZO channels is essential for the physiological functions of different cell types, including neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Moreover, different subtypes and species of PIEZO channels exhibit different inactivation rates. For example, hPIEZO1 and mPIEZO2 have a faster inactivation rate than mPIEZO1 <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. More importantly, abnormal inactivation of the PIEZO channel is one of the dominant outcomes of clinical PIEZO channelopathy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup>. The MDFIC inserts into the PIEZO pore module and significantly reshapes channel inactivation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>, which may also link PIEZO channel inactivation to cell fate. The lack of knowledge regarding the faster inactivating hPIEZO1 has prevented the acquisition of structural information about the relationship of true fast inactivating wild-type hPIEZO1 between cell fate determination, as well as clinically significant hPIEZO1 GOF slow inactivating channelopathies. Our work has the following implications:</p>
<p>First, we present the near-atomic cryo-EM structures of the fast inactivation hPIEZO1 and its slow inactivation channelopathy mutants, illuminating the fast inactivation mechanism of PIEZO channels involved by the pore lipids, which ingenious seals the hydrophobic pore.</p>
<p>Second, the overall structure of the curved hPIEZO1 shows a more flattened and extended state compared to the curved mPIEZO1, although there is no strong evidence yet for a link between curvature and inactivation. However, based on the mild GOF mutants hPIEZO1-A1988V and hPIEZO1- E756del, which are in the blade arm region, the correlation between curvature and inactivation is relatively evident, as the blade region indeed influences the channel inactivation. And all the force signal will transduce to the pore region, removing the pore lipid barrier. Therefore, the pore lipid will likely play a key role in PIEZO gating.</p>
<p>Lastly, the inactivation can be modulated by extrinsic cues, such as MDFIC, and the channelopathy mutants of PIEZO channels often cause a slower inactivation rate. The primary mechanism of PIEZO channel fast inactivation may provide clues against the clinical mechanopathologies. More importantly, these insights may inspire further investigation into mechanosensing channels as cell fate regulators in the near future.</p>

Therefore, the MDFIC may attenuate the mechanosensitivity of wild-type hPIEZO1 and GOF channelopathy mutants. All data are replicated at least three times and the statistic is based on the mean ± SEM.</p></caption>

<title>Constructs</title>
<p>A synthetic codon-optimized gene fragment encoding residues 1 to 2521 of the hPIEZO1 was cloned into a modified pEG-BacMam vector (Goehring et al., 2014) using EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzyme. The resulting protein has enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and an FLAG- modified antibody recognition sequence (DYKDDDDK) on the C terminus, separated by a PreScission protease (Ppase) cleavage site (LFQ/GP). Other mutations were built on its base by point mutations.</p>
<p>The cDNA for full-length human MDFIC (residues 1–246) was fished from the human cDNA library and cloned into a similarly modified pEG-BacMam vector with no tag.</p>

<title>Protein expression</title>
<p>Expi-HEK293F cells grown in HEK293 medium (Yocon) at 37°C with 6% CO2. <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> Sf9 cells were cultured in Sf-900 II SFM medium (Gibco) at 27°C. Cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination and were negative.</p>
<p>hPIEZO1 and its mutations were expressed alone or co-expressed with the MDFIC subunit in expi- HEK293F cells using the BacMam technology. Bacmid carrying hPIEZO1 or MDFIC subunit was generated by transforming E.<italic>coli</italic> DH10Bac cells with the corresponding pEG-BacMam construct and Recombinant Bacmids were screened by blue-white spot validation. Baculoviruses were produced by transfecting Sf9 cells at a density of 1×10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup> per ml with the bacmid using Cellfectin II (Invitrogen). To increase the viral titer, the recombinant virus has undergone two rounds of amplification to generate the P3 virus.</p>
<p>Expi-HEK293F cells in suspension were cultured to a density of 3×106 cells/ml and infected with the P3 virus. For expression of hPIEZO1 alone, cell culture was infected with 8% (v:v) of hPIEZO1 baculovirus. For co-expression of hPIEZO1 and MDFIC subunit, cell culture was infected with 4% (v:v) hPIEZO1 baculoviruses and 4% (v:v) MDFIC baculoviruses. After 12h, sodium butyrate was added to 10 mM final concentration and the temperature was decreased to 30°C. After 60 h of expression, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 r.p.m., 4°C for 10 min, resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl.</p>

<title>Protein purification</title>
<p>The cell pellet was homogenized in a TBS buffer supplemented with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) by ultrasonication. Then, large organelles and insoluble matter were pelleted by centrifugation at 8000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 36,000 r.p.m for 30 min in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman). The membrane pellet was mechanically homogenized and solubilized in extraction buffer containing TBS, 1% (w/v) lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG) and 0.1% (w/v) cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS) for an hour with stirring. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 36,000 r.p.m. for 1 h in a Ti45 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was loaded onto anti-FLAG G1 affinity resin (GenScript) by gravity flow. The resin was further washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing TBS and 0.02% (w/v) LMNG, and protein was eluted with an elution buffer containing TBS, 0.02% (w/v) LMNG, and 230 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The C- terminal EGFP tag of eluted protein was removed by Ppase cleavage at 4 °C overnight. The protein was further concentrated by a 100-kDa cutoff concentrator (Millipore) and loaded onto a Superose 6 increase 10/300 column (GE Healthcare) running in TBS with 0.01% (w/v) digitonin. Peak fractions were combined for cryo-EM sample preparation.</p>

<title>Cryo-EM sample preparation</title>
<p>For cryo-EM sample preparation, 3 μl aliquots of the protein sample were loaded onto glow- discharged (20 s, 15 mA; Pelco easiGlow, Ted Pella) Au grids (Quantifoil,Au R1.2/1.3, 300 mesh). The grids were blotted for 6 s with 3 forces after waiting for 20 s and immersed in liquid ethane using Vitrobot (Mark IV, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 100% humidity and 8°C.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>Cryo-EM data were collected at a nominal magnification of 215K (resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 0.57 Å) on a Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV equipped with a K3 or Falcon4i Summit detector and GIF Quantum energy filter (slit width 20-eV) in super-resolution mode. Movie stacks were automatically acquired using EPU software. The defocus range was set from −0.9 to −1.3 μm. Each movie stack, consisting of 32 frames, was exposed for 2.72 seconds with a total dose of ∼40 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<title>Image processing and model building</title>
<p>Data processing was carried out with cryoSPARC suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. Patch CTF estimation was carried out after alignment and summary of all 32 frames in each stack using the patch motion correction. Initial particles were picked from a few micrographs using blob picker in cryoSPARC and 2D averages were generated. Final particle picking was done by template picker using templates from those 2D results. After three rounds of 2D classification, ab-initio reconstruction, non-uniform refinement and local refinement for reconstructing the density map. All maps were low-pass filtered to the map- model FSC value. The reported resolutions were based on the FSC=0.143 criterion. An initial model was generated by mPIEZO1(7WLT). Then, we manually completed and refined the model using Coot. Subsequently, the models were refined against the corresponding maps by PHENIX. We used PyMol and UCSF Chimera<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> for structural analysis and graphics generation.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological recording</title>
<p>PIEZO1-KO-HEK293T cells were a gift obtained from Bailong Xiao Lab and cultured on coverslips placed in a 12-well plate containing DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells in each well were transiently transfected with 1 μg hPIEZO1 or mutant hPIEZO1 plasmids fused with GFP or co-transfected with MDFIC plasmid (weigh ratio=1:3) using polyethyleneimine (PEI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 12–20 h, the coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber containing the external solution (10 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2). Borosilicate micropipettes (OD 1.5 mm, ID 0.86 mm, Sutter) were pulled and fire polished to 2–5 MΩ resistance. For whole-cell recordings, the pipette solution was 10 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.4, 150 mM CsCl, and 5 mM EGTA. The bath solution was 10 mM HEPES-Na pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM glucose, 2 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2.</p>
<p>Recordings were obtained at room temperature (∼25 °C) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, a Digidata 1550 digitizer, and pCLAMP 10.7 software (Molecular Devices). The patches were held at −80 mV and the recordings were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 20 kHz. Mechanical poking was delivered to the cell being patched under whole-cell configuration at an angle of 80° using a fire-polished glass pipette (the tip diameter 3-4 mm) Downward movement of the probe toward the cell was driven by a Clampex controlled piezo-electric crystal micro-stage (Physik Instrument; E625 LVPZT Controller/Amplifier). The probe had a velocity of 1 μm/ms during the downward/upward motion and the stimulus was maintained for 1 s. A series of mechanical steps in 1 mm increments was applied every 1.4 s.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript by Shan, Guo, Zhang, Chen et al., shows a raft of interesting data including the first cryo-EM structures of human PIEZO1. Clearly, the molecular basis of PIEZO channel inactivation is of great interest and as such this manuscript provides some valuable extra information that may help to ultimately build a molecular picture of PIEZO channel inactivation. However, the current manuscript though does not provide any compelling evidence for a detailed mechanism of PIEZO inactivation.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This manuscript documents the first cryo-EM structures of human PIEZO1 and the gain of function mutants associated with hereditary anaemia. It is also the first evidence showing that PIEZO1 gain of function mutants are also regulated by the auxiliary subunit MDFIC.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>While the structures are interesting and clear differences can be seen in the presence of the auxiliary subunit MDFIC the major conclusions and central tenets of the paper, especially a role for pore lipids in inactivation, lack data to support them. The post-translational modification of PIEZOs auxiliary subunit MDFIC is not modelled as a covalent interaction.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>Mechanically activated ion channels PIEZOs have been widely studied for their role in mechanosensory processes like touch sensation and red blood cell volume regulation. PIEZO in vivo roles are further exemplified by the presence of gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in humans that lead to disease pathologies. Hereditary xerocytosis (HX) is one such disease caused due to GOF mutation in Human PIEZO1, which are characterized by their slow inactivation kinetics, the ability of a channel to close in the presence of stimulus. But how these mutations alter PIEZO1 inactivation or even the underlying mechanisms of channel inactivation remains unknown. Recently, MDFIC (myoblast determination family inhibitor proteins) was shown to directly interact with mouse PIEZO1 as an auxiliary subunit to prolong inactivation and alter gating kinetics. Furthermore, while lipids are known to play a role in the inactivation and gating of other mechanosensitive channels, whether this mechanism is conserved in PIEZO1 is unknown. Thus, the structural basis for PIEZO1 inactivation mechanism, and whether lipids play a role in these mechanisms represent important outstanding questions in the field and have strong implications for human health and disease.</p>
<p>To get at these questions, Shan et al. use cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) to investigate the molecular basis underlying differences in inactivation and gating kinetics of PIEZO1 and human disease-causing PIEZO1 mutations. Notably, the authors provide the first structure of human PIEZO1 (hPIEZO1), which will facilitate future studies in the field. They reveal that hPIEZO1 has a more flattened shape than mouse PIEZO1 (mPIEZO1) and has lipids that insert into the hydrophobic pore region. To understand how PIEZO1 GOF mutations might affect this structure and the underlying mechanistic changes, they solve structures of hPIEZO1 as well as two HX-causing mild GOF mutations (A1988V and E756del) and a severe GOF mutation (R2456H). Unable to glean too much information due to poor resolution of the mutant channels, the authors also attempt to resolve MCFIC-bound structures of the mutants. These structures show that MDFIC inserts into the pore region of hPIEZO1, similar to its interaction with mPIEZO1, and results in a more curved and contracted state than hPIEZO1 on its own. The authors use these structures to hypothesize that differences in curvature and pore lipid position underlie the differences in inactivation kinetics between wild-type hPIEZO1, hPIEZO1 GOF mutations, and hPIEZO1 in complex with MDFIC.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>This is the first human PIEZO1 structure. Thus, these studies become the stepping stone for future investigations to better understand how disease-causing mutations affect channel gating kinetics.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Many of the hypotheses made in this manuscript are not substantiated with data and are extrapolated from mid-resolution structures.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, the authors used structural biology approaches to determine the molecular mechanism underlying the inactivation of the PIEZO1 ion channel. To this end, the authors presented structures of human PIEZO1 and its slow-inactivating mutants. The authors also determined the structures of these PIEZO1 constructs in complexes with the auxiliary subunit MDFIC, which substantially slows down PIEZO1 inactivation. From these structures, the authors suggested an anti-correlation between the inactivation kinetics and the resting curvature of PIEZO1 in detergent. The authors also observed a unique feature of human PIEZO1 in which the lipid molecules plugged the channel pore. The authors proposed that these lipid molecules could stabilize human PIEZO1 in a prolonged inactivated state.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Notedly, this manuscript reported the first structures of a human PIEZO1 channel, its channelopathy mutants, and their complexes with MDFIC. The evidence that lipid molecules could occupy the channel pore of human PIEZO1 is solid. The authors' proposals to correlate PIEZO1 resting curvature and pore-resident lipid molecules with the inactivation kinetics are novel and interesting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, additional evidence is needed to support the authors' proposals.</p>
<p>(1) The authors determined the apo structure of human PIEZO1, which showed a more flattened architecture than that of the mouse PIEZO1. Functionally, the inactivation kinetics of human PIEZO1 is faster than its mouse counterpart. From this observation (and some subsequent observations such as the complex with MDFIC), the authors proposed the anti-correlation between curvature and inactivation kinetics. However, the comparison between human and mouse PIEZO1 structure might not be justified. For example, the human and mouse structures were determined in different detergent environments, and the choice of detergent could influence the resting curvature of the PIEZO structures.</p>
<p>(2) Related to point 1), the 3.7 Å structure of the A1988V mutant presented by the authors showed a similar curvature as the WT but has a slower inactivating kinetics.</p>
<p>(3) Related to point 1), the authors stated that human PIEZO1 might not share the same mechanism as mouse PIEZO1 due to its unique properties. For example, MDFIC only modifies the curvature of human PIEZO1, and lipid molecules were only observed in the pore of the human PIEZO1. Therefore, it may not be justified to draw any conclusions by comparing the structures of PIEZO1 from humans and mice.</p>
<p>(4) Related to point 1), it is well established that PIEZO1 opening is associated with a flattened structure. If the authors' proposal were true, in which a more flattened structure led to faster inactivation, we would have the following prediction: more opening is associated with faster inactivation. In this case, we would expect a pressure-dependent increase in the inactivation kinetics. Could the authors provide such evidence, or provide other evidence along this direction?</p>
<p>(5) In Figure S2, the authors showed representative experiments of the inactivation kinetics of PIEZO1 using whole-cell poking. However, poking experiments have high cell-to-cell variability. The authors should also show statics of experiments obtained from multiple cells.</p>
<p>(6) In Figure 2 and Figure 5, when the authors show the pore diameter, it could be helpful to also show the side chain densities of the pore lining residues.</p>
<p>(7) The authors observed pore-plugging lipids in slow inactivating conditions such as channelopathy mutations or in complex with MDFIC. The authors propose that these lipid molecules stabilize a &quot;deep resting state&quot; of PIEZO1, making it harder to open and harder to inactivate once opened. This will lead to the prediction that the slow-inactivating conditions will lead to a higher activation threshold, such as the mid-point pressure in the activation curve. Is this true?</p>
