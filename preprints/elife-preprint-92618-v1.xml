<abstract>
<p>Recently, we have achieved a significant milestone with the creation of the Fly Cell Atlas. This single-nuclei atlas encompasses the entire fly, covering the entire head and body, in addition to all major organs. This atlas catalogs hundreds to thousands of cell types, of which we annotated 250. This still leaves many clusters to be fully characterized, in particular in the brain. Furthermore, with single-nuclei sequencing, all information about the spatial location of the cells and of the mRNAs within these cells is lost. Here, we provide a solution to this problem. In a proof of concept study, we have applied spatial transcriptomics using a selected gene panel to pinpoint the locations of 150 mRNA species in the adult fly. This enabled us to map unknown cell types identified in the Fly Cell Atlas to their spatial locations in the brain. Additionally, spatial transcriptomics discovered interesting principles of mRNA localization in large crowded muscle cells that may spark future mechanistic investigations. Furthermore, we present a set of computational tools that will allow for easier integration of spatial transcriptomics and single-cell datasets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Single-cell technologies have revolutionized biological research, allowing researchers for the first time to study complex tissues with unprecedented resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klein et al., 2015</xref>), leading to the creation of tissue-specific atlases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Schaum et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">The Tabula Sapiens consortium, 2022</xref>). However, upon tissue dissociation into single cells, all spatial information of the cell in the organism and of the mRNAs within the cell is lost, since all data of the cell are compressed into one multidimensional data point. This is a significant drawback, as the localization of a cell type within a tissue can inform about the function of this cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tomancak et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, many mRNAs show subcellular localization patterns that may have functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jambor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>This loss of information can be circumvented using spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT). In SRT, spatial information of the RNA species is determined either through the use of spatially localized barcoded DNA arrays with or without the use of microfluidics, followed by sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Rodriques et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), or by imaging using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) methods. While barcoded sequencing approaches allow unbiased mapping of all transcripts, their spatial resolution is, in general, lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Moses &amp; Pachter, 2022</xref>). FISH identifies the position of each RNA molecule independently at a high spatial resolution, but is limited in throughput to a few genes. Recently, technical breakthroughs have been presented to increase the number of genes to several hundred through the use of barcoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Eng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Lubeck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c71">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>The adult fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is a widely used model for cell biology, neurobiology, physiology and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Sokolowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Grenier &amp; Leulier, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Benton, 2022</xref>). The recent completion of the entire adult fly cell atlas (FCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>), and the aging fly cell atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lu et al., 2023</xref>) provided an in-depth annotation of various cell types, however without information about the localization of these cells or their mRNAs. In addition, several single-cell clusters were left unannotated although marker genes were identified.</p>
<p>Here we applied Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) to create a FISH-based spatial transcriptomics dataset of the entire head and body of adult <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies. While embryonic development has already been studied using SRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), we present the first high-throughput single-molecule FISH-based SRT dataset of the various tissues of the adult fly. We compare the data with existing RNA atlases, using the spatial data to validate annotations in the body and identify unknown clusters in the brain. Furthermore, we use the data to reveal subcellular mRNA localization patterns in the flight muscle cells and regionalized RNA expression in the head. Expression patterns of 100 genes in the brain and 50 genes in the body can be visualized interactively using TissUUmaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Solorzano et al., 2020</xref>) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.spatialfly.aertslab.org">www.spatialfly.aertslab.org</ext-link>.</p>

<title>Creation of a spatial atlas of the entire fly body and its head</title>
<p>In analogy to the FCA strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>), we intended to create a spatial atlas of the entire adult fly body and, additionally, of the head separately. Based on expression data from the FCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>), we selected 50 genes for the fly body samples, and 100 genes for the head samples. These genes were carefully chosen to label the most important known cell types of the adult fly, and to include some unknown ones, suggested from the atlas data (Table S1-S2, <xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Fig. S1</xref>). This approach should allow us to separate the large heterogeneity of neurons in different populations. Adult fly samples were cryofrozen, sectioned, attached to slides and fixed (see Methods), after which they were profiled using Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). Using this workflow we detected on average 190,622 mRNA molecules for the head samples (min=101,548, max=260,989), ranging from 106 (<italic>Poxn</italic>) to 185,820 (<italic>trio</italic>) per gene (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a-b</xref>) and 1.5 million mRNA molecules for the body samples (min=1,448,593, max=1,727,479), ranging from 323 (<italic>MsR1</italic>) to 1,991,469 (<italic>Act88F</italic>) counts per gene used (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3a-b</xref>).</p>

<p>For the head samples, we aimed to image as many different neuronal populations as possible. Thus, we performed coronal sections at different depths in the head (n=13), covering anterior to posterior parts of the head (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2a,c</xref>). For the body samples, sagittal sections were performed through the middle of the animal (n=5) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, <xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3a</xref>). These sagittal sections show some small differences in structures in the abdomen, but overall are very similar to each other, showing the reproducibility of our methods. In total, we analyzed 5 body sample sections from one adult male fly and found a high correlation between them (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Fig. S3c</xref>, see Methods).</p>

<title>Spatial transcriptomics allows the identification of cell types in the body</title>
<p>The genes for the body datasets were selected to cover a wide range of different cell types. The expression of <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>Syt1</italic> is marking neurons, both in the central and peripheral nervous system at the expected locations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The glial marker <italic>repo</italic> shows the location of glial cells across the body (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). The expression of different trypsins is unique to the digestive system. Interestingly, <italic>alpha-</italic> and <italic>betaTrypsin</italic> show distinct patterns, with <italic>betaTrypsin</italic> localized on the inner side of the gut, while <italic>alphaTrypsin</italic> is localized more distally, suggesting a subcellular localization of these trypsin isoform coding mRNAs to apical or basal regions of the gut enterocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Using the fat body marker <italic>AkhR</italic> and the oenocyte marker <italic>FASN2</italic>, different populations of fat tissue and oenocytes were identified in the abdomen of the fly at the expected locations. The hemocyte marker <italic>Hml</italic> shows distinct local enrichments in head, thorax and abdomen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). In addition, <italic>LanB1</italic>, which codes for LamininB1, an important component of the extracellular matrix present around many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c69">Yarnitzky &amp; Volk, 1995</xref>), is widely produced in different cell types and not only in hemocytes. While co-expression of <italic>LanB1</italic> with <italic>Hml</italic> in hemocytes is detected as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Matsubayashi et al., 2017</xref>) (15.5%) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), surprisingly most of <italic>LanB1</italic> overlaps with epithelial cells (<italic>grh</italic> (13.4%) and <italic>pain</italic> (28.0%)) or muscle cells (<italic>Mlp84B</italic> (40.9%) and <italic>Mp20</italic> (25.4%) (see Methods)). Next, we used <italic>esg</italic> to mark adult stem cell populations. The expression of <italic>esg</italic> in our sections is mostly limited to the gut, matching its reported expression in the intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jiang &amp; Edgar, 2011</xref>) and the somatic cyst stem cells (Sênos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Demarco et al., 2022</xref>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Mhc</italic> and <italic>sls</italic> were used to label all muscle cells, while <italic>TpnC4</italic> and <italic>Act88F</italic> allowed to specifically label the indirect flight muscles (IFM) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a</xref>). Finally, we used <italic>grh, hth, svp</italic> and <italic>pain</italic> to identify epithelial cells and their subtypes. Together, these data show that our spatial transcriptomics data can identify the spatial location of most known large classes of cell types of the adult fly and also identify unexpected subcellular mRNA localizations in some cell types.</p>

<title>Molecular Cartography is highly specific</title>
<p>Many marker genes used in this study are well characterized and known to be highly specific for one particular cell type or present in one body location. Hence, their expression can be used to estimate the specificity of the mRNA detection method and determine false-positive rates of mRNA spots. For this specificity analysis, we chose to work with marker genes linked to muscle cells. We used the expression of <italic>Act88F</italic> and <italic>TpnC4</italic>, both of which are almost exclusively expressed in the indirect flight muscles present only in the thorax (and possibly in muscles around the ejaculatory bulb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fyrberg et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Agianian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Sarov et al., 2016</xref>). We segmented the flight muscles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) and calculated the percentage of marker genes detected in the segmented area compared to the entire imaged area. We find that 99.1% of <italic>TpnC4</italic> and 99.6% of <italic>Act88F</italic> are specifically expressed in their expected regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). Signals outside of these regions are negligible. This highlights the specificity of the transcriptomics method and the reliability of detected mRNA signals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2d">
<title>Building a spatial tissue atlas of the fly body</title>
<p>Having shown the specificity of our method, we wanted to use the combinatorial power of our data to assign cell type identities more reliably. Often, cell types can only be reliably identified by a combination of several marker genes. Therefore, we investigated co-expression signatures of known cell type marker genes in the spatial transcriptomics data. This may also help identify more rare cell types or specific cell states. To implement this idea on our spatial data, we computationally assigned every mRNA molecule to a 5 µm by 5 µm square in a square-grid fashion. All squares in this grid were then scored for mRNA signatures of different cell classes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Next, we assigned every square to the cell class for which they showed the highest signal (see Methods). This signature-based method annotated all major cell types or tissues of the adult reliably, including muscles, neurons, glia, fat and epithelial cells, oenocytes and the male reproductive organ (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b</xref>). This analysis also enabled the identification of cell populations with more sparse gene expression like the heart (combination of <italic>Hand</italic> and <italic>tin</italic>) or the male reproductive tract (combination of <italic>Awh</italic>, <italic>eyg</italic> and <italic>svp</italic>). In conclusion, the major cell types of the adult fly could be localized using the power of combining mRNA localizations of different marker genes and their spatial proximity.</p>
<p>As a next step, we aimed to assign cell type locations without prior knowledge of their markers. To do so, we used all 132,642 different squares from each of the 5 body samples and performed clustering based on the counts of the 50 genes analyzed (see Methods). This led to the identification of 142 clusters that we visualized as a UMAP plot, separating muscle from neuronal and epithelial cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). The spatial visualization of this unsupervised analysis of cell types confirmed our previous supervised annotation of cell types based on gene signatures (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). In addition, it showed an unexpected presence of multiple clusters in the large flight muscle cells, suggesting subcellular mRNA patterns. These results underscore the power of assigning the spatial location of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell types with spatial transcriptomics.</p>
<p>Finally, we looked at the expression of genes in one particular organ to identify its different cell types. In the FCA, we had previously identified <italic>Awh</italic>, <italic>eyg</italic> and <italic>nAChRalpha1</italic> to label the male accessory gland main cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). Our SRT data confirm this co-expression, showing the labeling of the main gland cells in the abdomen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Next, we performed a more detailed comparison of our SRT data with the FCA scRNA-seq. We calculated the correlation between genes in both SRT and scRNA-seq to find if co-expression is maintained in both datasets (see Methods). In general, gene-gene correlations between SRT and scRNA-seq match significantly (r=0.69, p&lt;1e-100), with no major disagreements between the two (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Fig. S4a-b</xref>). This indicates that in general SRT data corroborate results obtained from scRNA-seq. To study gene-gene relations in more detail, we devised an algorithm that calculates for each gene its colocalization with other genes (see Methods) (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5a-b</xref>). This colocalization matrix was then clustered to find groups of genes that are co-expressed. These groups match with the major cell types, while also highlighting genes expressed in male reproduction to be specifically localized. In addition, this analysis method grouped neuronal and muscular genes into the same cluster, consistent with the close proximity between these two cell types (Fig S5c).</p>
<p>In conclusion, cell-type-specific marker genes can be used for the unambiguous identification of cell types in SRT data. Furthermore, we highlight both high specificity and high reproducibility across adult fly body sections in our data. Together, this dataset represents the first SRT dataset for the adult fly body.</p>

<title>Subcellular localization of mRNA in muscle cells</title>
<p>Unsupervised clustering revealed the presence of multiple spatial subclusters in the muscles, especially in the indirect flight muscle (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c, d</xref>), suggesting transcriptional heterogeneity or subcellular mRNA localization. Such mRNA localization could result from directed mRNA transport or anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Martin &amp; Ephrussi, 2009</xref>). To investigate this interesting observation in more detail, we segmented our sections containing the three main types of adult muscles: head, leg and indirect flight muscles. Muscle cells represent by far the largest cells in the body, forming polynucleated syncytia, with the indirect flight muscles containing more than five hundred nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chaturvedi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Kaya-Çopur et al., 2021</xref>). These nuclei are distributed in specific patterns depending on the muscle fiber-type. In tubular muscle fibers found in the head or the legs, the nuclei are located in the center of the muscle, in a row surrounded by the contractile myofibrils. In the fibrillar indirect flight muscles, the nuclei are arranged in multiple rows located between the contractile myofibril bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Luis &amp; Schnorrer, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Schönbauer et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, the nuclei are equally distributed along the length of the large 1 mm long flight muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Spletter et al., 2018</xref>). This organization has been proposed to optimize the distribution of mRNAs by minimizing transport distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Bruusgaard et al., 2003</xref>). Misalignment of the nuclei has been linked to a variety of severe myopathies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Folker &amp; Baylies, 2013</xref>). While snRNA-seq allows studying of potentially different types of nuclei in the muscle, FISH has been proposed as a method to study and describe mRNA localization in muscle fibers in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Denes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pinheiro et al., 2021</xref>).</p>
<p>Amongst the 50 genes we had selected were six genes that code for sarcomere protein components, four of which are specifically expressed in different muscle groups, <italic>Act88F</italic> and <italic>TpnC4</italic> in indirect flight muscles, <italic>Act79B</italic> and <italic>TpnC41C</italic> in leg muscles. Our SRT data verified these spatially distinct expression patterns, again reassuring the specificity of our method (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>

<p>By analyzing the subcellular localization of the sarcomere protein coding mRNAs in detail we noticed that mRNAs of the pan-muscular gene <italic>sls</italic>, show a striking proximity to the muscle nuclei marked by DAPI (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). To quantify this proximity and the subcellular patterns accurately, we first identified each nucleus by segmenting the DAPI signal and then calculated the position of each mRNA molecule in the muscle cell and its distance to the closest nucleus (see Methods, resolution is 0.136 µm). This identified genes, whose mRNAs are nuclei-enriched (<italic>sls</italic>) and nuclei-depleted (<italic>TpnC4</italic>) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b-d</xref>, <xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6a</xref>). We found a similar difference in leg and head muscles with <italic>sls</italic> staying in proximity or within the nuclei, in contrast to <italic>TpnC41C</italic> located at a distance (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6b-c</xref>). Previously, mRNA distributions quantified in <italic>in vitro</italic> grown mammalian skeletal muscles were linked to mRNA sizes, with large mRNAs spreading further from the nuclei than small mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Pinheiro et al., 2021</xref>). This does not appear to be the general rule for <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles as <italic>sls</italic> mRNAs are much longer (isoform lengths: 15,263 - 56,489 nt) than <italic>TpnC4</italic> (longest is 859 nt) or TpnC41C mRNAs (longest is 1880 nt).</p>
<p>Even more striking than the sole distance from the nuclei is that mRNAs from particular genes, most prominently <italic>Act88F</italic> in flight muscles, are concentrated in longitudinal stripes in the inter-myofibril space, where most nuclei, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi are located (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>). mRNAs from <italic>TpnC4</italic> or <italic>Mhc</italic> are enriched in the complementary stripes at the location of the myofibrils and mitochondria (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>), resulting in a spatial division of the flight muscles that correlates with their intracellular architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Avellaneda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Luis &amp; Schnorrer, 2021</xref>). A similar division was found in leg muscles, with central stripes of <italic>Act79B</italic> mRNA close to the nuclei and <italic>Mhc</italic> as well as <italic>TpnC41C</italic> in the myofibril regions (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Fig. S6b</xref>). These findings underscore the power of SRT to identify unexpected mRNA localization patterns that in particular in the large muscle cells may be of functional relevance.</p>
<p>Another interesting question that SRT may help to answer is whether all nuclei in a large flight muscle fiber follow the same transcriptional program. The FCA data did not reveal an obvious subdivision into different subclusters that demonstrated transcriptional heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Hence, we were surprised to find that the nuclei located at the anterior and posterior ends of the flight muscle fibers, facing the muscle-tendon attachment sites, show a concentration of <italic>sls</italic> mRNA compared to the other nuclei (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a, e, Fig</xref>. S6a). Of the 50 genes tested, <italic>sls</italic> is the only gene that showed such a distinct mRNA localization pattern.</p>
<p>To conclude, we found three main types of mRNA localization in the indirect flight muscle: nuclei-enriched patterns, complementary striped bands and concentrations at the terminal nuclei close to the muscle attachment sites. To our knowledge, none of these patterns had been identified before.</p>

<title>Spatial transcriptomics allows the localization of cell types in the head and brain</title>
<p>To investigate the localization of cell types in the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> head, we took 13 sections of different fly heads sectioned across the longitudinal direction, covering most regions of the fly head. The diversity between sections originating from different brain regions is represented by lower correlations between the samples (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Fig. S2c</xref>). Using the marker genes <italic>para</italic> (neurons), <italic>alrm</italic> (astrocytes) and <italic>ninaC</italic> (photoreceptors), we were able to annotate different classes of cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). <italic>ninaE</italic>, a second photoreceptor marker was too highly expressed, leading to optical crowding and thus was removed from the analysis.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="561233v1_fig4.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To look at cell types, we made use of our annotated scRNA-seq atlas of the fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Pech et al., 2023</xref>). First, we checked the expression of <italic>C15</italic>, <italic>acj6</italic>, <italic>Oaz</italic>, <italic>caup</italic> and <italic>unpg</italic>, known markers for olfactory projection neurons (OPNs). OPNs are neurons that relay information from the antennal lobe to downstream processing centers including the mushroom body and the lateral horn. The co-expression of all markers is only detected in the most anterior samples, corresponding to the location of OPN cell bodies (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>), again showing the precision of our method. Next, we investigated the expression of markers for perineurial glia (<italic>repo, moody</italic>, <italic>Indy</italic>, <italic>Vmat</italic>), which form the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and find them at the periphery of the brain, the expected location (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>).</p>
<p>We compared gene-gene relationships, by calculating gene-gene correlations in the spatial dataset and the single-cell dataset (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7a-b</xref>). In general, we find a strong match (r=0.68), but with several mismatches. While <italic>pros</italic>-<italic>dati</italic> co-expression is conserved between both modalities (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7c</xref>), co-expression of several other gene pairs is only detected in one modality (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7d-e</xref>). For example, we only find widespread expression of Vmat outside of the optic lobe in the BBB, far from the expected location of most dopaminergic neurons in the central brain (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7e</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Vmat</italic> expression does not overlap with DAPI-stained nuclei nor DAT (strong marker for dopaminergic neurons), suggesting an mRNA transport mechanism to locate selected mRNAs away from the cell body (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7e</xref>). Alternatively, glial nuclei, which are much smaller than neuronal nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mu et al., 2021</xref>), might not all be detected with our methodology. Similarly, the neuropeptides Ilp2 and Pdf show a weak overlap with the DAPI staining, instead forming patterns (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7e</xref>). Thus, SRT can recapitulate the location of known cell types in the fly brain by using established marker genes and additionally identify expression at novel locations for some of these.</p>
<p>Compared with other organs, the cell type diversity of the fly brain is extremely complex. A key challenge in scRNA-seq is the annotation of clusters to cell types. In our scRNA-seq dataset, there are 188 distinct clusters, of which only 83 are annotated today. Recent efforts to map the fly brain through EM and connectomics studies have identified 4,552 morphological cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schlegel et al., 2023</xref>). SRT can provide a bridge between scRNA-seq studies and morphology-based studies. As such, it becomes possible to annotate unknown clusters based on the spatial localization of their marker genes. To pave the way towards such integration, we focused on unannotated clusters in our brain dataset. It is important to note that current neuronal nomenclature is based on neuropils (axons and dendrites) and not on the location of the neuronal nuclei. Therefore, we used the established neuropil nomenclature to describe the location of the detected nuclei, but this does not necessarily mean that the axons of these cells also project there.</p>
<p>To identify the location of unknown clusters in the brain, we started with Fer1 expression, as it is a strong marker for cluster 120 in our scRNA dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Using SRT we show conclusively that these cells are located in the central brain, in the ventral gnathal ganglion and saddle, and the superior intermediate protocerebrum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Similarly, we show that <italic>AstC</italic> expression (cluster 122) is limited to the dorsal part of the central brain, consistent with its expression in DN1 and DN3 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>). Next, we investigated the expression of <italic>otp</italic> (clusters 30 and 62), which marks nuclei close to the lateral horn and the superior neuropils (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Finally, we found the expression of <italic>vg</italic> (cluster 20) to be limited to the boundary region between the optic lobe (OL) and the central brain (CB) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). These results confirm that combining scRNA-seq with SRT technologies can indeed identify defined locations of formerly unknown cell clusters in the fly brain.</p>
<p>Next, we wanted to find genes enriched to specific spatial locations in our brain SRT data. To do so, we assigned mRNA molecules to spots using a similar 5 µm resolution grid as done above for the body data. By performing unsupervised clustering using all mRNA localizations from all datasets together, we identified 23 clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4f</xref>). Consistent with our aim for sectioning along the brain’s A-P axis, different slices display a different cluster composition (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Fig. S7g</xref>). All neuronal clusters were selected using <italic>para</italic> expression and their location assigned them to the optic lobe (OL), the central brain (CB) or the retina (photoreceptor, PR). By performing differential expression between the domains, we identified enriched genes for each (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). As expected, photoreceptor genes such as <italic>ninaC</italic> and <italic>lz</italic> were strongly enriched in the retina. We found a large group of genes shared between the OL and CB, with upregulation of <italic>pros</italic> in the central brain and of <italic>scro</italic> in the OL (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>). Analyzing the expression of these genes in different samples indeed confirmed a strong boundary in expression of these two transcription factors (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4h</xref>), corroborating earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). This shows that SRT alone can also identify specific markers for the major brain cell types, as shown above for the body, without any prior knowledge.</p>
<p>Finally, we wanted to compare gene expression between the dorsal and ventral parts of the brain, because a previous study had found that some scRNA-seq clusters in the fly brain could be divided into ventral <italic>Wnt4</italic> and dorsal <italic>Wnt10</italic> positive subclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Özel et al., 2021</xref>). Using <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Wnt10</italic> mRNA localizations we could confirm these findings, and show that although expression is sparse, <italic>Wnt4</italic> and <italic>Wnt10</italic> mRNAs are strongly enriched in the ventral or dorsal regions of the brain, respectively (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4i</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, our SRT atlas of the fly brain shows that SRT data allows the identification of clusters and cell types. We also showed how SRT can be used to identify and localize unknown clusters of scRNA data, serving as a link between morphology data and single-cell data. Finally, SRT can be used for the discovery and confirmation of regional marker genes by performing region-based differential expression.</p>

<title>Automated cell type annotation of SRT using scRNA-seq data</title>
<p>One of the key prospects for SRT, is to be able to identify unknown clusters and infer their spatial location. This requires the SRT data to be integrated with scRNA-seq data. Multiple methods have been developed for this purpose so far, including Tangram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biancalani et al., 2021</xref>) and SpaGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelaal et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we used and compared three different approaches to represent SRT data: 5 μm-spaced grid rasterization, neighborhood embedding, and nuclei segmentation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). The grid and neighborhood embedding are both spatially unaware of the cell’s location. In the grid method, automatic segmentation takes place over the entire sample by grouping mRNA molecules together every 5 μm, while neighborhood embedding is segmentation-free and models every mRNA molecule independently. This makes it possible to also visualize spatial patterns at subcellular resolution, but leads to a very large dataset and hence is computationally heavy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Partel &amp; Wählby, 2021</xref>). While the grid-based approach can be run in several hours, neighborhood embedding takes several days. Finally, we performed a segmentation method of the nuclei and assigned mRNA molecules to each nucleus. While this is the most intuitive method, several challenges occur in the fly head. To start, different densities of nuclei require imaging with different parameters to visualize both sparse and dense nuclei regions. In addition, the dense nuclei regions at the edge of the OL and CB are very difficult to segment with normal imaging techniques (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="561233v1_fig5.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/>
</fig>
<p>To compare different label transfer methods we applied lasso regression, Tangram and SPaGE. We found that regression-based integration in the grid method and SpaGE in the neighborhood embedding method are able to match the blood-brain barrier and the chiasm glia in the optic lobe very well, together with astrocytes and ensheathing glia in the central brain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In contrast, the nuclei segmentation method performs poorly for matching glial subtypes, since most of the glial nuclei are not detected, leading to the removal of most glial mRNAs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). Therefore, we also ran Tangram on the grid-quantification, leading to the detection of different glial types (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8a-d</xref>). This shows a disadvantage of nuclei-aware methods compared to methods that take all mRNA spots into account.</p>
<p>In the OL, all methods can accurately identify neurons from the different layers. In the CB, both the grid-based and the segmentation methods are able to locate the peptidergic neurons (insulin-producing cells, Pdf-neurons) in the correct location, while neighborhood embedding fails to retrieve these (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d, e</xref>). However, Tangram also labels some non-peptidergic segmented nuclei as insulin-producing unless thresholds for mapping scores are manually adjusted to reflect the different proportions of cell types that are present in the spatial transcriptomics data (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8e</xref>). In a more posterior central brain sample, nuclei segmentation and grid methods are able to identify the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body. These are also found in the neighborhood embedding, but the signal is noisier (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e</xref>). Neighborhood embedding likely performs poorly on cell types that are determined by high expression of only 1 gene (e.g. neuropeptides), since the neighborhood is not affected by this.</p>
<p>Finally, we investigated how the three approaches perform in linking unknown scRNA-seq clusters to spatial locations. Here we see that in the grid and neighborhood embedding methods, two unknown clusters are spatially localized, while the nuclei segmentation method can spatially localize four clusters (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). Cluster 20 which was marked by vg expression is found by each technique (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>), same as cluster 79. Cluster 79 labels the outside of the retina, fitting with high expression of <italic>Cpr72Ec</italic>, a structural protein for the eye lens, which is expressed by interommatidial pigment cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the other methods, Tangram detects a ventral-dorsal division in the retina, with cluster 15 matching to the dorsal part. This mapping is driven by the expression of <italic>mirr</italic>, a gene known to be expressed in the dorsal half of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">McNeill et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8f</xref>). Tangram also maps cluster 69, mostly by expression of <italic>caup</italic>. Like its Iroquouis family member <italic>mirr</italic>, <italic>caup</italic> is detected in the dorsal half of the eye, but it shows additional expression in various locations in the central brain (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Fig. S8g</xref>). Cluster 69 represents multiple subclusters in scRNA-seq data, and similarly it maps to multiple locations in the spatial data. A larger gene panel will help to dissect and locate the subclusters.</p>
<p>To conclude, we find that using a 5 μm by 5 μm grid leads to similar clustering results as performing a computationally heavy neighborhood embedding analysis. However, the neighborhood embedding does increase the resolution to single mRNA spots, leading to a better visualization and a higher spatial accuracy. The nuclei segmentation method is limited in the fly brain by the lack of resolution to identify the individual nuclei in very densely packed brain regions. While Tangram was the best method to identify unknown clusters, it also led to false-positive labeling of multiple cell types leading to the necessity of accurate thresholding. We find that using a simple regression model works as well or even better as designated methods when marker genes are used, while running much faster. The designated methods might show improved performance when using larger gene panels. Therefore, we suggest relying on a consensus of different methods to optimally integrate scRNA-seq data with SRT.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we present the first SRT dataset of the adult fly brain and body using highly multiplexed FISH. We used a 50-gene panel in the body, which made it possible to identify all major cell types in the adult male fly. Several measures of co-expression were used, which showed high concordance with published single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Li et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, expression of key marker genes could be used to identify the location of rare cell populations in the adult body. For example, expression of <italic>Hml</italic> showed the location of resident hemocytes, while <italic>esg</italic> was used to mark stem cells in the reproductive and intestinal tract. Therefore, SRT can be used to locate different cell populations in the fly body. Most of the published classical mRNA in situ hybridizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tomancak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jambor et al., 2015</xref>) as well as a recent high throughput FISH study used the easily accessible fly embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), We expanded SRT here to the more complex anatomy of the adult fly, which requires sectioning and large data sampling, both at the microscope and at the computer. Thus, this proof of principle study will inspire future approaches that should be able increase gene throughput on the adult fly significantly. While SRT based on smFISH in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c68">Yao et al., 2023</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fang et al., 2022</xref>) is limited to one tissue, large-scale brain atlases are being built and integrated with single-cell RNA-seq data. In flies, we show that both the brain and the whole-body can be sliced and imaged.</p>
<p>Compared to studies that focus on individual adult tissues, SRT of the entire adult fly made it possible to investigate the specificity of marker genes in the context of all tissues. We found that many markers are indeed highly specific to certain cell types, as we quantified for <italic>Act88F</italic> and <italic>TpnC4</italic> for the flight muscles. This also allowed us to estimate the false detection rate of the mRNA dots to less than 1%. Still, some marker genes showed additional unexpected expression (e.g., expression of <italic>tin</italic> and <italic>TpnC4</italic> in the ejaculatory bulb muscles), which was not detected in single-cell RNA-seq. Further, we found broad expression of LanB1 in many cell types, not only in hemocytes. As such, SRT can provide a more sensitive readout, including the spatial localization, and may inspire which other tissues might be interesting to investigate in the future when studying a particular gene function.</p>
<p>Performing SRT on the adult head led to additional challenges due to the small size of the head and the high density of the cell bodies in certain brain regions. Indeed, due to the small area of the head, samples often were tricky to adhere homogeneously to the slides and significant deformation occurred. An extra challenge occurs in the segmentation of nuclei, since <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuronal nuclei are multiple magnitudes smaller compared to human neuronal nuclei (5 cubic micrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Mu et al., 2021</xref>)). Here, expansion microscopy would help to increase the required resolution to reliably resolve each single nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Steib et al., 2022</xref>). Expansion microscopy methods should be easily compatible with SRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Fan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Pownall et al., 2023</xref>), which would be more challenging for single-molecule localization techniques that allow super-resolution imaging like DNA-PAINT, as they are harder but not impossible to multiplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Agasti et al., 2017</xref>). Recent work on adult flight muscles showed that DNA-PAINT can indeed be applied to adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissue to achieve below 5 nm resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Schueder et al., 2023</xref>). Alternatively, 3D imaging could be used to improve nuclei segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Pachitariu &amp; Stringer, 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>In the head, we used a 100-gene panel and showed that this selection is sufficient to identify the major classes of cell types in the brain, including some very specific neuronal cell types like peptidergic neurons, Kenyon cells and different OL neurons. This provided a proof of principle of SRT in identifying cell types in the fly adult brain despite the small size of its cells and their high density.</p>
<p>SRT can serve as a bridge between different modalities, similar to the Rosetta stone, to link scRNA-seq atlases with spatial information, including connectomics in the brain. Using informative markers that were enriched in unknown clusters of single-cell RNA-seq data, we were able to locate the nuclei in the fly brain that showed expression of those markers. Hence, we were able to locate a series of formerly unknown cell clusters to defined brain regions. The next challenge lies in connecting these nuclei to the neuronal connectome using connectomics studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Schlegel et al., 2023</xref>), in order to unambiguously identify the individual cell types. This nicely illustrates that SRT can provide the missing link between large scale single-cell transcriptomics studies and the morphology of complex neuronal architectures.</p>
<p>We explored several computational techniques to integrate SRT with single-cell RNA-seq including grid-rasterization, nuclei-segmentation and neighborhood embedding. Given the dense packing of the small nuclei in the fly brain, and the likely presence of mRNA transport away from the nucleus of origin, nuclei-segmentation leads to a loss of information compared to the other nuclei-unaware techniques. We further find that the mapping of some clusters is dominated by the presence of strong marker genes. Therefore, we predict strong improvements when it will be possible to use larger gene panels in the near future. Currently, sequencing-based methods such as Stereo-seq hold an advantage in number of genes that can be profiled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), but smFISh-based approaches are scaling rapidly and will soon allow to routinely image 1000s of genes at higher resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Fang et al., 2022</xref>).</p>
<p>The most exciting advantage of SRT compared to single-cell techniques applied to cells or nuclei in suspension, is the possibility to study mRNA localization within the tissue-context analyzed. As expected from findings in the embryo that reported a large number of mRNAs as non-homogeneously localized and thus likely transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Jambor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Tomancak et al., 2002</xref>), we found localized mRNAs in at least three different cell types. First, we found that different trypsin isoforms locate to opposite apical-basal locations in enterocytes of the adult gut. Such apical-basal mRNA transport processes are well described in the embryonic epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bullock et al., 2006</xref>), however, to our knowledge not yet known in the adult fly gut epidermis, where secretion of the enzymes at the correct side of the cell should be critical. Second, in the brain, we identified localized patterns of mRNAs coding for the neuropeptides <italic>Pdf</italic> and <italic>Ilp2.</italic> These mRNAs are likely transported into axons or dendrites, away from the cell body, a process often critical for brain development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Holt &amp; Bullock, 2009</xref>). As both genes are very important regulators of adult physiology, the identified localization patterns may inspire future studies.</p>
<p>Third, in muscle cells, SRT revealed different patterns of mRNA distributions that suggest both mRNA transport and local synthesis in a subset of nuclei only. The latter is true for the terminal nuclei facing the muscle-tendon attachment sites that show increased localization and hence likely increased expression of the titin homolog <italic>sls</italic>. Sls protein is a critical component of the flight muscle sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>) and also located at the terminal Z-disc linking the force-probing myofibrils to the tendon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Green et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, also in mammalian muscles, it was recently found that the terminal muscle fiber nuclei that face the tendon cells apply a specialized transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; Esteves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">de Lima et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, we found here that within muscle fibers most mRNAs are non-randomly distributed with the most prominent patterns showing <italic>sls</italic> mRNA staying close to the nuclei that likely produce the RNA, whereas <italic>Act88F</italic> and <italic>TpnC4</italic> display alternating striped patterns that recapitulate the functional specializations within the muscle fibers, with locating myofibrils, mitochondria and ER to defined locations in muscle fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Luis &amp; Schnorrer, 2021</xref>). It also has been proposed that ribosomes are concentrated at particular locations in mammalian muscles and build translational hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Denes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Lewis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Rudolph et al., 2019</xref>). Whether such concentrations exist in fly muscles is not known. Hence, it will require future investigations to identify the functional significance of localizing mRNAs to particular localizations only and to identify the localization mechanisms.</p>
<p>To conclude, we have shown that medium throughput SRT on entire fly head and body samples is methodologically possible and leads to informative new discoveries that will spark interesting follow-up studies. All our data can be freely explored on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spatialfly.aertslab.org">https://spatialfly.aertslab.org</ext-link>. This has opened avenues for potential full 3D slicing and imaging of an adult fly in its entirety at high resolution in the near future.</p>

<sec id="s4a">
<title>Full fly sectioning</title>
<p>Before preparation, to ensure full adult development, adult male Luminy flies were isolated and left for 3 days at 25°C. After this step, the flies were put on ice for 15 minutes, and their wings were clipped. Flies were then transferred to a freezing mold, alive, embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT compound, VWR), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Flies were sectioned with a cryostat (Leica CM 3050 S, Leica Biosystems, Germany). 10 µm sections were transferred to coverslips coated with gelatin (porcine skin, 300g Bloom Type A, Merck) and stored at -80℃.</p>

<title>Fly head sectioning</title>
<p>Adult flies (male and females) were anesthetized on a fly pad using CO2 gas, to cut off their heads with a scalpel. Heads were then placed on a pre-cooled metal surface on dry ice and covered with a drop of OCT. Frozen OCT blocks were stored at -80℃ until sectioning. Sections of 10 µm thickness were produced with a Leica CM3050 S cryostat and placed on uncoated coverslips, which were stored at -80℃.</p>

<sec id="s4c1">
<title>a. Gene selection and probe design</title>
<p>Guided by the fly cell atlas, 150 genes were selected to be the most informative for spatial transcriptomics, 50 genes for the whole-body samples (Table S1) and 100 genes for the head samples (Table S2). These genes were selected based on different criteria including: marking specific cell populations, strong single-cell co-expression, marking unknown cell populations and showing broad expression.</p>
<p>The probes for the selected genes were designed using Resolve’s proprietary design algorithm. To speed up the process, the calculation of computationally expensive parts, especially the off-target searches, the selection of probe sequences was not performed randomly, but limited to sequences with high success rates. To filter highly repetitive regions, the abundance of k-mers was obtained from the background transcriptome using Jellyfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Marçais &amp; Kingsford, 2011</xref>). Every target sequence was scanned once for all k-mers and those regions with rare k-mers were preferred as seeds for full probe design. A probe candidate was generated by extending a seed sequence until a certain target stability was reached. A set of simple rules was applied to discard sequences that were found experimentally to cause problems. After these fast screens, every kept probe candidate was mapped to the background transcriptome using ThermonucleotideBLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Gans &amp; Wolinsky, 2008</xref>) and probes with stable off-target hits were discarded. Specific probes were then scored based on the number of on-target matches (isoforms), which were weighted by their associated APPRIS level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>), favoring principal isoforms over others. A bonus was added if the binding site was inside the protein-coding region. From the pool of accepted probes, the final set was composed by greedily picking the highest scoring probes. Catalog numbers for the specific probes are available upon request at Resolve Biosciences.</p>

<title>b. Molecular Cartography</title>
<p>Samples were then sent to Resolve Biosciences on dry ice for analysis. Upon arrival, tissue sections were thawed and rehydrated with isopropanol, followed by 1-min washes in 95% ethanol and 70% ethanol at room temperature. The samples were used for Molecular Cartography (100-plex combinatorial single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (protocol v.1.3; available for registered users), starting with the aspiration of ethanol and the addition of buffer DST1 followed by tissue priming and hybridization. Briefly, tissues were primed for 30 min at 37 °C followed by overnight hybridization of all probes specific for the target genes (see below for probe design details and target list). Samples were washed the next day to remove excess probes and fluorescently tagged in a two-step color development process. Regions of interest were imaged as described below and fluorescent signals were removed during decolorization. Color development, imaging and decolorization were repeated for multiple cycles to build a unique combinatorial code for every target gene that was derived from raw images as described below.</p>

<title>c. Imaging</title>
<p>Samples were imaged on a Zeiss Celldiscoverer 7, using the ×50 Plan Apochromat water immersion objective with an NA of 1.2 and the ×0.5 magnification changer, resulting in a ×25 final magnification. Standard CD7 LED excitation light source, filters and dichroic mirrors were used together with customized emission filters optimized for detecting specific signals. Excitation time per image was 1,000 ms for each channel (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was 20 ms). A z-stack was taken at each region with a distance per z-slice according to the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. The custom CD7 CMOS camera (Zeiss Axiocam Mono 712) was used. For each region, a z-stack per fluorescent color (two colors) was imaged per imaging round. A total of eight imaging rounds were conducted for each position, resulting in 16 z-stacks per region. The completely automated imaging process per round (including water immersion generation and precise relocation of regions to image in all three dimensions) was realized by a custom Python script using the scripting API of the Zeiss ZEN software (open application development).</p>

<title>d. Spot segmentation</title>
<p>The algorithms for spot segmentation were written in Java and are based on the ImageJ library functionalities. The iterative closest point algorithm is written in C++ based on the libpointmatcher library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher">https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher</ext-link>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c5">
<title>e. Preprocessing</title>
<p>As a first step, all images were corrected for background fluorescence. A target value for the allowed number of maxima was determined based upon the area of the slice in µm² multiplied by the factor 0.5. This factor was empirically optimized. The brightest maxima per plane were determined, based upon an empirically optimized threshold. The number and location of the respective maxima was stored. This procedure was conducted for every image slice independently. Maxima that did not have a neighboring maximum in an adjacent slice (called a z group) were excluded. The resulting maxima list was further filtered in an iterative loop by adjusting the allowed thresholds for (Babs-Bback) and (Bperi-Bback) to reach a feature target value (Babs, absolute brightness; Bback, local background; and Bperi, background of periphery within one pixel). These feature target values were based upon the volume of the three-dimensional (3D) image. Only maxima still in a z group of at least two after filtering were passing the filter step. Each z group was counted as one hit. The members of the z groups with the highest absolute brightness were used as features and written to a file. They resemble a 3D point cloud.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s4c6">
<title>f. Final signal segmentation and decoding</title>
<p>To align the raw data images from different imaging rounds, images had to be corrected. To do so the extracted feature point clouds were used to find the transformation matrices. For this purpose, an iterative closest point cloud algorithm was used to minimize the error between two point clouds. The point clouds of each round were aligned to the point cloud of round one (reference point cloud). The corresponding point clouds were stored for downstream processes. Based upon the transformation matrices the corresponding images were processed by a rigid transformation using trilinear interpolation. The aligned images were used to create a profile for each pixel consisting of 16 values (16 images from two color channels in eight imaging rounds). The pixel profiles were filtered for variance from zero normalized by total brightness of all pixels in the profile. Matched pixel profiles with the highest score were assigned as an ID to the pixel. Pixels with neighbors having the same ID were grouped. The pixel groups were filtered by group size, number of direct adjacent pixels in group and number of dimensions with size of two pixels. The local 3D maxima of the groups were determined as potential final transcript locations. Maxima were filtered by number of maxima in the raw data images where a maximum was expected. Remaining maxima were further evaluated by the fit to the corresponding code. The remaining maxima were written to the results file and considered to resemble transcripts of the corresponding gene. The ratio of signals matching to codes used in the experiment and signals matching to codes not used in the experiment were used as estimation for specificity (false positives).</p>

<title>Clustering analysis of mRNA species based on proximity</title>
<p>Based on the observation that groups of mRNA species appeared to cluster into separated regions of sections, we devised a simple method to automatically extract these regions based on the proximity of different mRNA. mRNA species that were identified as being close were then gathered into the same cluster.</p>
<p>In practice, we first computed the proximity of mRNA species by pair (see <xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Fig. S5</xref>). Each localization of two mRNA species was transformed into disks of fixed diameters, each disk being centered on a given mRNA localization; the diameter used here was 4 µm. To generate one surface for a species and avoid counting multiple times the same area, disks of a given mRNA species were merged if they were overlapping. We then computed their overlap surface from the surfaces obtained from two different mRNA species. The proximity of one mRNA species (mRNA1) versus the over one (mRNA2) was defined as the ratio between the overlap surface and surface of the second mRNA species (mRNA2):
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="561233v1_ueqn1.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
Reciprocally,
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="561233v1_ueqn2.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
The calculation of proximity then allowed us to define a distance between two mRNA species:
<disp-formula>
<graphic xlink:href="561233v1_ueqn3.gif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif"/>
</disp-formula>
mRNA species that show perfect overlap get a distance of 0 in this metric, whereas mRNA species that do not show any overlap would get a distance of 2.</p>
<p>Finally, this metric was used in a hierarchical clustering analysis using Ward’s method. Clusters were then extracted from this analysis.</p>

An increment of 1000 was added to both spatial x-and y-coordinates to arrange all samples together. Only squares with more than 3 counts were kept, leading to 132,642 squares with information for 50 genes. The data was subsequently normalized with 10,000 as size factor and log transformed. This matrix was then used as input for PCA, after which 40 components were retained by evaluating variance ratio plots.

<p>Leiden resolution 1 was used to create average gene expression profiles for clusters. Clusters with mean expression of para&gt;0.05 were selected as neuronal clusters.

Spots in the grid were assigned to a category based on Z-scores. If z-normalised expression&gt;1, the spot was assigned to the category.

Higher weights for the single-cell clusters corresponds to a higher similarity between the cluster and the square. We only used weights &gt; 0.2 as confident matches.

<p>Nuclei in DAPI images were segmented with Cellprofiler (version 4.0.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>). Features of the DAPI images were enhanced (<italic>EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures, Enhance, Speckles</italic>) using a feature size of 100 pixels. Initial nuclei were detected using a size of 10- 100 pixels, global Otsu thresholding with two classes, intensity for distinguishing clumped objects, <italic>propagate</italic> for drawing dividing lines.

<p>Tangram (version 1.0.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Biancalani et al., 2021</xref>) was used to project cell type labels from single cell data. Here we used the <italic>cell</italic> mapping mode to map single cell data to each spatial slice separately. The mapping was computed on a NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB GPU. Prior to computing the mapping, segmented cells with less than three expressed genes and genes that were expressed in less than three cells were removed. Single cells and segmented cells were log-normalized in SCANPY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c67">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>) with a target-sum of 10<sup>4</sup>. All genes that are shared between the spatial data and single cell data after filtering were used for the mapping. Cell type labels for fly head samples were assigned separately for Glia, optic lobe (OL), central brain (CB) and unknown clusters (UNK) by considering only the subset cell types that we grouped into the category. A cell type label was assigned to a segmented cell based on the 95%-quantile of the mapping scores for a cell type (unless stated otherwise) if this resulted in a unique label assignment. Cell type labels for the grid rasterized spatial data were assigned in the same manner as we did for the segmented cells. The only exception being, that we downsampled the number of cells to a maximum of 5000 cells per cell type in the single cell data to limit the amounts of required video memory.</p>

<title>Neighborhood embedding and SpaGE</title>
<p>Segmentation-free analysis of fly head and body SRT datasets have been carried out using spage2vec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Partel &amp; Wählby, 2021</xref>). Briefly, spatial graphs of all mRNAs are first constructed for each different sample. Then, a graph convolution neural network trained in a self-superwise fashion projects each mRNA into an embedding space based on its spatial neighborhood composition. Such that mRNAs that share similar neighbors are mapped close together in the embedding space. Downstream clustering or visualization of mRNA embeddings unveil spatial gene expression patterns described by specific combinations of genes at subcellular resolution. Pseudo-cell counts have been generated for each mRNA by aggregating counts of <italic>k</italic> neighboring mRNAs (i.e. k=100) in the embedding space. Finally, integration of reference scRNA-seq datasets with spatial pseudo-cell counts have been implemented by projecting both datasets into a common shared space using SpaGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Abdelaal et al., 2020</xref>). Thereafter, cell type labels have been transferred from scRNA-seq cells to spatial pseudo-cells by kNN imputation (with k=100).</p>

<title>mRNA localization in muscle - distance to nuclei</title>
<p>For every detected mRNA molecule, the distance to the closest nucleus was calculated. First, we calculated a mask to segment the indirect flight muscle using <italic>Act88F</italic> mRNA spots. Using opencv2, we performed a Gaussian blur (ksize=5×5, sigma=1), followed by two erosion steps (5×5 and 4×4) to remove sparse signals. Then the spots were dilated thrice (50×50), followed by a final Gaussian blur (ksize=5×5, sigma=1). Only other mRNA species that overlap with this mask were kept for the distance analysis.</p>
<p>The nucleus segmentation was loaded as a black-white image. The nonzero function from opencv2 was used to find segmented pixels. Then for each mRNA spot, Euclidean distances were calculated to the segmented pixels, after which they were assigned to the closest pixel. To optimize the calculations, joblib’s Parallel function was used. This was repeated over all body samples and results were combined. Only genes for which at least 100 mRNA spots were detected across samples and not localized at the edges (faulty segmentation along the muscle boundary) were kept: <italic>Act88F</italic>, <italic>Mhc</italic>, <italic>TpnC4</italic>, <italic>sls</italic>, <italic>salm</italic> and <italic>CG32121</italic>.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In this manuscript, Janssens et al. addressed the challenge of mapping the location of transcriptionally unique cell types identified by single nuclei sequencing (snRNA-seq) data available through the Fly Cell Atlas. They identified 100 transcripts for head samples and 50 transcripts for fly body samples allowing the identification of every unique cell type discovered through the Fly Cell Atlas. To map all of these cell types, the authors divided the fly body into head and body samples and used the Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) method to visualize these transcripts. This approach allowed them to build spatial tissue atlases of the fly head and body, to identify the location of previously unknown cell types and the subcellular localization of different transcripts. By combining snRNA-seq data from the Fly Cell Atlas with their spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data, they demonstrated an automated cell type annotation strategy to identify unknown clusters and infer their location in the fly body. This manuscript constitutes a proof-of-principle study to map the location of the cells identified by ever-growing single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated by others.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The authors used the Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) method to visualize 100 transcripts for head samples and 50 transcripts for fly body samples in high resolution. This method achieves high resolution by multiplexing a large number of transcript visualization steps and allows the authors to map the location of unique cell types identified by the Fly Cell Atlas.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
Combining single-nuclei sequencing (snRNA-seq) data with spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data is challenging, and the methods used by the authors in this study cannot reliably distinguish between cells, especially in brain regions where the processes of different neurons are clustered, such as in neuropils. This means that a grid that the authors mark as a unique cell may actually be composed of processes from multiple cells.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
The landmark publication of the &quot;Fly Atlas&quot; in 2022 provided a single cell/nuclear transcriptomic dataset from 15 individually dissected tissues, the entire head, and the body of male and female flies. These data led to the annotation of more than 250 cell types. While certainly a powerful and data-rich approach, a significant step forward relies on mapping these data back to the organism in time and space. The goal of this manuscript is to map 150 transcripts defined by the Fly Atlas by FISH and in doing so, provide, for the first time, a spatial transcriptomic dataset of the adult fly. Using this approach (Molecular Cartography with Resolve Biosciences), the authors, furthermore, distinguish different RNA localizations within a cell type. In addition, they seek to use this approach to define previously unannotated clusters found in the Fly Atlas. As a resource for the community at large interested in the computational aspects of their pipeline, the authors compare the strengths and weaknesses of their approach to others currently being performed in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
1. The authors use Resolve Biosciences and a novel bioinformatics approach to generate a FISH-based spatial transcriptomics map. To achieve this map, they selected 150 genes (50 body; 100 head) that were highly expressed in the single nuclear RNA sequencing dataset and were used in the 2022 paper to annotate specific cell types; moreover, the authors chose several highly expressed genes characteristic of unannotated cell types. Together, the approach and generated data are important next steps in translating the transcriptomic data to spatial data in the organism.</p>
<p>
2. Working with Resolve, the authors developed a relatively high throughput approach to analyze the location of transcripts in Drosophila adults. This approach confirmed the identification of particular cell types suggested by the FlyAtlas as well as revealed interesting subcellular locations of the transcripts within the cell/tissue type. In addition, the authors used co-expression of different RNAs to unbiasedly identify &quot;new cell types&quot;. This pipeline and data provide a roadmap for additional analyses of other time points, female flies, specific mutants, etc.</p>
<p>
3. The authors show that their approach reveals interesting patterns of mRNA distribution (e.g alpha- and beta-Trypsin in apical and basal regions of gut enterocytes or striped patterns of different sarcomeric proteins in body muscle). These observations are novel and reveal unexpected patterns. Likewise, the authors use their more extensive head database to identify the location of cells in the brain. They report the resolution of 23 clusters suggested by the single-cell sequencing data, given their unsupervised clustering approach. This identification supports the use of spatial cell transcriptomics to characterize cell types (or cell states).</p>
<p>
4. Lastly, the authors compare three different approaches --- their own described in this manuscript, Tangram, and SpaGE - which allow integration of single cell/nuclear RNA-seq data with spatial localization FISH. This was a very helpful section as the authors compared the advantages and disadvantages (including practical issues, like computational time).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
1. Experimental setup. It is not clear how many and, for some of the data, the sex of the flies that were analyzed. It appears that for the body data, only one male was analyzed. For the heads, methods say male and female heads, but nothing is annotated in the figures. As such, it remains unclear how robust these data are, given such a limited sample from one sex. As such, the claims of a spatial atlas of the entire fly body and its head (&quot;a rosetta stone&quot;) are overstated. Also, the authors should clearly state in the main text and figure legends the sex, the age, how many flies, and how many replicates contributed to the data presented (not just the methods). What also adds to the confusion is the use of &quot;n&quot; in para 2 of the results. &quot; ... we performed coronal sections at different depths in the head (n=13)...&quot; 13 sections in total from 1 head or sections from 13 heads? Based on the body and what is shown in the figure, one assumes 13 sections from one head. Please clarify.</p>
<p>
2. Probes selected: Information from the methods section should be put into the main text so that it is clear what and why the gene lists were selected. The current main text is confusing. If the authors want others to use their approach, then some testing or, at the very least, some discussion of lower expressed genes should be added. How useful will this approach be if only highly expressed genes can be resolved? In addition, while it is understood that the company has a propriety design algorithm for the probes, the authors should comment on whether the probes for individual genes detect all isoforms or subsets (exons and introns?), given the high level of splicing in tissues such as muscle.</p>
<p>
3. Imaging: it isn't clear from the text whether the repeated rounds of imaging impacted data collection. In many of what appear to be &quot;stitched&quot; images, there are gradients of signal (eg, figure 2F); please comment. Also, since this a new technique, could a before and after comparison of the original images and the segmented images be shown in the supplemental data so that the reader can better appreciate how the authors assessed/chose/thresholded their data? More discussion of the accuracy of spot detection would be helpful.</p>
<p>
4. The authors comment on how many RNAs they detected (first paragraph of results). How do these numbers compare to the total mRNA present as detected by single-cell or single-nuclear sequencing?</p>
<p>
5. Using this higher throughput method of spatial transcriptomics, the authors discern different cell types and different localization patterns within a tissue/cell type.</p>
<p>
a. The authors should comment on the resolution provided by this approach, in terms of the detection of populations of mRNAs detected by low throughput methods, for example, in glia, motor neuron axons, and trachea that populate muscle tissue. Are these found in the images? Please show.</p>
<p>
b. The authors show interesting localization patterns in muscle tissue for different sarcomere protein-coding mRNAs, including enrichment of sls in muscle nuclei located near the muscle-tendon attachment sites. As this high throughput approach is newly being applied to the adult fly, it would increase confidence in these data, if the authors would confirm these data using a low throughput FISH technique. For example, do the authors detect such alternating &quot;stripes&quot; ( Act 88F, TpnC4, and Mhc) or enriched localization (sls) using FISH that doesn't rely on the repeated colorization, imaging, decolorization of the probes?</p>
<p>
6. The authors developed an unbiased method to identify &quot;new cell types&quot; which relies on co-expression of different transcripts. Are these new cell types or a cell state? While expression is a helpful first step, without any functional data, the significance of what the authors found is diminished. The authors need to soften their statements.</p>
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>
The authors' goal is to map single cell/nuclear RNAseq data described in the 2022 Fly Atlas paper spatially within an organism to achieve a spatial transcriptomic map of the adult fly; no doubt, this is a critical next step in our use of 'omics approaches. While this manuscript does the hard work of trying to take this next step, including developing and testing a new pipeline for high throughput FISH and its analysis, it falls short, in its present form, in achieving this goal. The authors discuss creating a robust spatial map, based on one male fly. Moreover, they do not reveal principles of mRNA localization, as stated in the abstract; they show us patterns, but nothing about the logic or function of these patterns. This same criticism can be said of the identification of &quot;new cell types, just based on RNA colocalization. In both cases (mRNA subcellular localization or cell type identification), further data in the form of validation with traditional low throughput FISH and genetic manipulations to assess the relation to cell function are required for the authors to make such claims.</p>
<p>Discussion of likely impact:</p>
<p>
If revised, these data, and importantly the approach, would impact those working on Drosophila adults as well as those working in other model systems where single cell/nuclear sequencing is being translated to the spatial localization within the organism. The subcellular localization data - for example, the size of transcripts and how that relates to localization or the patterns of sarcomeric protein localization in muscle - are intriguing, and would likely impact our thinking on RNA localization, transport, etc if confirmed. Lastly, the authors compare their computational approaches to those available in the field; this is valuable as this is a rapidly evolving field and such considerations are critical for those wishing to use this type of approach.</p>

<p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p>
<p>This study presents a valuable method to visualize the location of the cell types discovered through single-cell RNA sequencing. The evidence supporting the claims is solid, but the inclusion of a larger number of samples would strengthen the study. It would also be helpful to have the methods explained in more detail. The work will be of interest to those seeking to identify new cell types from scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq data.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We are surprised about the editor’s assessment of our paper as a “valuable” method. This is the first Drosophila adult spatial transcriptomics paper. Hence, we would at least consider this being an “important” method. Spatial transcriptomics has thus far only been done in embryos, which are easy to process for FISH for many decades. Integration with single-cell data is also new. We are further surprised that this assessment does not mention the identification of subcellular mRNA patterns in adult muscles as an “important” biological finding of this paper. We are not aware that any localized mRNAs in Drosophila muscles were known prior to our study. This shows the advantage of spatial transcriptomics over single-cell techniques.</p>
<p>The work indeed does not represent a full spatial fly adult atlas – however, a proof of principle study covering both the head and body that we consider at least “important”.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this manuscript, Janssens et al. addressed the challenge of mapping the location of transcriptionally unique cell types identified by single nuclei sequencing (snRNA-seq) data available through the Fly Cell Atlas. They identified 100 transcripts for head samples and 50 transcripts for fly body samples allowing the identification of every unique cell type discovered through the Fly Cell Atlas. To map all of these cell types, the authors divided the fly body into head and body samples and used the Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) method to visualize these transcripts. This approach allowed them to build spatial tissue atlases of the fly head and body, to identify the location of previously unknown cell types and the subcellular localization of different transcripts. By combining snRNA-seq data from the Fly Cell Atlas with their spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data, they demonstrated an automated cell type annotation strategy to identify unknown clusters and infer their location in the fly body. This manuscript constitutes a proof-of-principle study to map the location of the cells identified by ever-growing single-cell transcriptomic datasets generated by others.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The authors used the Molecular Cartography (Resolve Biosciences) method to visualize 100 transcripts for head samples and 50 transcripts for fly body samples in high resolution. This method achieves high resolution by multiplexing a large number of transcript visualization steps and allows the authors to map the location of unique cell types identified by the Fly Cell Atlas.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their comment, but are surprised that this assessment does not mention the identification of subcellular mRNA patterns in adult muscles as an important biological finding of this paper. This might be due to the visualization problem that this reviewer was facing with a greyscale version of the PDF as mentioned in the comments below. We do not know what caused the technical problem for this reviewer (the PDF figures are in color on the eLife website and on bioRxiv). We are surprised that the eLife discussion session did not resolve this issue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Combining single-nuclei sequencing (snRNA-seq) data with spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data is challenging, and the methods used by the authors in this study cannot reliably distinguish between cells, especially in brain regions where the processes of different neurons are clustered, such as in neuropils. This means that a grid that the authors mark as a unique cell may actually be composed of processes from multiple cells.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The size of the fly is one of the most challenging aspects of performing spatial transcriptomics. The small size of the samples led to detachment from the slides, which we solved by coating the slides with gelatin. While the resolution of Molecular Cartography is high (&lt;200nm), in the brain challenges remain as noted by the reviewer. Drosophila neuronal nuclei are notoriously small and cannot be easily resolved with current techniques. We agree that for a full atlas either expansion microscopy, 3D techniques or even higher resolution will be required.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The landmark publication of the &quot;Fly Atlas&quot; in 2022 provided a single cell/nuclear transcriptomic dataset from 15 individually dissected tissues, the entire head, and the body of male and female flies. These data led to the annotation of more than 250 cell types. While certainly a powerful and data-rich approach, a significant step forward relies on mapping these data back to the organism in time and space. The goal of this manuscript is to map 150 transcripts defined by the Fly Atlas by FISH and in doing so, provide, for the first time, a spatial transcriptomic dataset of the adult fly. Using this approach (Molecular Cartography with Resolve Biosciences), the authors, furthermore, distinguish different RNA localizations within a cell type. In addition, they seek to use this approach to define previously unannotated clusters found in the Fly Atlas. As a resource for the community at large interested in the computational aspects of their pipeline, the authors compare the strengths and weaknesses of their approach to others currently being performed in the field.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>1. The authors use Resolve Biosciences and a novel bioinformatics approach to generate a FISH-based spatial transcriptomics map. To achieve this map, they selected 150 genes (50 body; 100 head) that were highly expressed in the single nuclear RNA sequencing dataset and were used in the 2022 paper to annotate specific cell types; moreover, the authors chose several highly expressed genes characteristic of unannotated cell types. Together, the approach and generated data are important next steps in translating the transcriptomic data to spatial data in the organism.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for this comment but would like to add that the statement that we selected “150 genes (50 body; 100 head) that were highly expressed in the single nuclear RNA sequencing dataset” is not correct. We have chosen genes with widely differing expression levels (log-scale range of 3.95 in body, 5.76 in head). Many of the chosen genes are also transcription factors. In fact, the here introduced method is more sensitive than the single cell atlas: the tinman positive cells were readily located (even non-heart cells were found to express tinman), whereas in the single cell FCA data tinman expression is often not detected in the cardiomyocytes (Tinman is detected in 273 cells in the entire FCA (mean expression of 1.44 UMI in positive cells), and in 71 cells out of 273 cardial cells (26%)).</p>

<p>1. Working with Resolve, the authors developed a relatively high throughput approach to analyze the location of transcripts in Drosophila adults. This approach confirmed the identification of particular cell types suggested by the FlyAtlas as well as revealed interesting subcellular locations of the transcripts within the cell/tissue type. In addition, the authors used co-expression of different RNAs to unbiasedly identify &quot;new cell types&quot;. This pipeline and data provide a roadmap for additional analyses of other time points, female flies, specific mutants, etc.</p>
<p>1. The authors show that their approach reveals interesting patterns of mRNA distribution (e.g alpha- and beta-Trypsin in apical and basal regions of gut enterocytes or striped patterns of different sarcomeric proteins in body muscle). These observations are novel and reveal unexpected patterns. Likewise, the authors use their more extensive head database to identify the location of cells in the brain. They report the resolution of 23 clusters suggested by the single-cell sequencing data, given their unsupervised clustering approach. This identification supports the use of spatial cell transcriptomics to characterize cell types (or cell states).</p>
<p>1. Lastly, the authors compare three different approaches --- their own described in this manuscript, Tangram, and SpaGE - which allow integration of single cell/nuclear RNA-seq data with spatial localization FISH. This was a very helpful section as the authors compared the advantages and disadvantages (including practical issues, like computational time).</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>1. Experimental setup. It is not clear how many and, for some of the data, the sex of the flies that were analyzed. It appears that for the body data, only one male was analyzed. For the heads, methods say male and female heads, but nothing is annotated in the figures. As such, it remains unclear how robust these data are, given such a limited sample from one sex. As such, the claims of a spatial atlas of the entire fly body and its head (&quot;a rosetta stone&quot;) are overstated. Also, the authors should clearly state in the main text and figure legends the sex, the age, how many flies, and how many replicates contributed to the data presented (not just the methods). What also adds to the confusion is the use of &quot;n&quot; in para 2 of the results. &quot; ... we performed coronal sections at different depths in the head (n=13)...&quot; 13 sections in total from 1 head or sections from 13 heads? Based on the body and what is shown in the figure, one assumes 13 sections from one head. Please clarify.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: While we agree that sex differences present indeed an interesting opportunity to study with spatial transcriptomics, our goal was not to define male/female differences but rather to establish the technology to go into this detail if wanted in the future. In the revised version, we will provide a more detailed description of the sections, including their sex/genotype/age. We would like to point out that we verified the specificity of our FISH method on all the body sections (Figure 2A, TpnC4 &amp; Act88F) and not only on one. Furthermore, we also would like to state that the idea of “a rosetta stone” was mentioned as a future prospect. We will rewrite the discussion to make this more clear.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Probes selected: Information from the methods section should be put into the main text so that it is clear what and why the gene lists were selected. The current main text is confusing. If the authors want others to use their approach, then some testing or, at the very least, some discussion of lower expressed genes should be added. How useful will this approach be if only highly expressed genes can be resolved? In addition, while it is understood that the company has a propriety design algorithm for the probes, the authors should comment on whether the probes for individual genes detect all isoforms or subsets (exons and introns?), given the high level of splicing in tissues such as muscle.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: As stated above, while there is a slight bias to higher expressed genes (as expected for marker genes), we have also used very low expressed genes like tinman (body) or sens (head). This shows that our method is more sensitive than single-cell data, as ALL cardiomyocytes can be identified by tinman expression and not only some are positive, as is the case in the FCA data. In fact, the method can’t resolve too highly expressed genes due to optical crowding of the signal leading to a worse quantification. For this reason, ninaE was removed from the analysis (as mentioned in Spatial transcriptomics allows the localization of cell types in the head and brain and in Methods).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Methods, the probes are designed on gene level targeting all isoforms, but favoring principal isoforms (weighted by APPRIS level). The high level of splicing is indeed interesting and we expect that in the future spatial transcriptomics can help to generate more insight in this.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Imaging: it isn't clear from the text whether the repeated rounds of imaging impacted data collection. In many of what appear to be &quot;stitched&quot; images, there are gradients of signal (eg, figure 2F); please comment. Also, since this a new technique, could a before and after comparison of the original images and the segmented images be shown in the supplemental data so that the reader can better appreciate how the authors assessed/chose/thresholded their data? More discussion of the accuracy of spot detection would be helpful.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: Any high-resolution imaging (pixel size = 138 nm) of a large field of view (&gt;1mm) uses a stitching method to combine several individual images to reconstruct a large field of view. This does not generate signal gradients, apart from lower signal at the extreme edges of each of the individual images. The spot detection algorithm was written and used by Resolve Biosciences and benchmarked for human (Hela) and mouse (NIH-3T3) cell lines in Groiss et al. 2021 (Highly resolved spatial transcriptomics for detection of rare events in cells, biorxiv). The specificity of the decoded probes was found to lie between 99.45 and 99.9% here, matching the results we found for TpnC4 and Act88F (99.4 and 99.8%). We will add their analysis to our discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors comment on how many RNAs they detected (first paragraph of results). How do these numbers compare to the total mRNA present as detected by single-cell or single-nuclear sequencing?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The total number of mRNAs detected per spatial transcriptomics experiment is much higher for the body samples compared to single-cell experiments (FCA data). In the head it is slightly lower, but here it is important to note that not all cell types are present in each slice in the head (while they are all present in the head scRNA experiments). A comparison on the cell-type level would be more meaningful, and we will investigate this for the revision.</p>

<p>1. Using this higher throughput method of spatial transcriptomics, the authors discern different cell types and different localization patterns within a tissue/cell type.</p>
<p>a. The authors should comment on the resolution provided by this approach, in terms of the detection of populations of mRNAs detected by low throughput methods, for example, in glia, motor neuron axons, and trachea that populate muscle tissue. Are these found in the images? Please show.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We did not add any markers for trachea in our gene panel, but we do detect sparse spots of repo (glia) and elav/VGlut in the muscle tissues (Gad1/VAChT are hardly detected in the muscle tissue). This is consistent with the glutamatergic nature of motor neurons in Drosophila as described previously (Schuster CM (2006) Glutamatergic synapses of Drosophila neuromuscular junctions: a high-resolution model for the analysis of experience-dependent potentiation. Cell Tissue Res 326: 287–299.)</p>

<p>b. The authors show interesting localization patterns in muscle tissue for different sarcomere protein-coding mRNAs, including enrichment of sls in muscle nuclei located near the muscle-tendon attachment sites. As this high throughput approach is newly being applied to the adult fly, it would increase confidence in these data, if the authors would confirm these data using a low throughput FISH technique. For example, do the authors detect such alternating &quot;stripes&quot; ( Act 88F, TpnC4, and Mhc) or enriched localization (sls) using FISH that doesn't rely on the repeated colorization, imaging, decolorization of the probes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We thank the reviewer for their interest in the localization patterns in muscle tissue. We could confirm localized mRNA in all the sections analyzed, in flight muscles as well as in leg muscles. We furthermore show that Act 88F, TpnC4 are not detected outside of flight muscle cells (99.4% and 99.8% of the single molecular signal in flight muscles only). Hence, we already show the specificity test in a much more quantitative way compared to traditional FISH, which often includes amplification.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors developed an unbiased method to identify &quot;new cell types&quot; which relies on co-expression of different transcripts. Are these new cell types or a cell state? While expression is a helpful first step, without any functional data, the significance of what the authors found is diminished. The authors need to soften their statements.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: The term “new cell types” only appears in the title. We agree that with the current spatial map we cannot be sure to have found “new cell types”, instead we have shown where unannotated clusters from scRNA-seq map, based on gene expression. Therefore, we will tone down the title in the revised version and thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Appraisal:</p>
<p>The authors' goal is to map single cell/nuclear RNAseq data described in the 2022 Fly Atlas paper spatially within an organism to achieve a spatial transcriptomic map of the adult fly; no doubt, this is a critical next step in our use of 'omics approaches. While this manuscript does the hard work of trying to take this next step, including developing and testing a new pipeline for high throughput FISH and its analysis, it falls short, in its present form, in achieving this goal. The authors discuss creating a robust spatial map, based on one male fly. Moreover, they do not reveal principles of mRNA localization, as stated in the abstract; they show us patterns, but nothing about the logic or function of these patterns. This same criticism can be said of the identification of &quot;new cell types, just based on RNA colocalization. In both cases (mRNA subcellular localization or cell type identification), further data in the form of validation with traditional low throughput FISH and genetic manipulations to assess the relation to cell function are required for the authors to make such claims.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We have indeed used one male fly for the adult male body data. This is mainly due to the cost of the sample processing. We used 12 individuals for the head samples (from 1 individual we acquired 2 sections, a total of 13 sections). We show that the body samples show a high correlation with each other, while the head samples cover multiple depths of the head. Still, even in the head, we find that sections at similar depths show a high similarity to each other in terms of gene-gene co-expression and expression patterns. Although obtaining more sections would be valuable, we don’t believe it to be necessary for the current goals. Additional replicates beyond the ones we already provide would require significant amounts of extra time and budget, while they would produce similar results as we already show. We are therefore reluctant to repeat the effort again.</p>
<p>The usage of the term “new cell types” is indeed ambiguous and we will tone this down in the revised version. Instead, we meant that unannotated clusters could be mapped to their location. In the text, we further specify that this means that now we only have inferred the location of the nuclei and that for neurons their function/processes are still unknown. As such, our data provides a starting point to identify new cell types since their marker genes and nuclear location are inferred. The next step to identify “new cell types” would indeed be to acquire genetic access to the cell types and characterize them in more detail. This is currently beyond our goals, and therefore we will tone down the title in the revised version and thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion of likely impact:</p>
<p>If revised, these data, and importantly the approach, would impact those working on Drosophila adults as well as those working in other model systems where single cell/nuclear sequencing is being translated to the spatial localization within the organism. The subcellular localization data - for example, the size of transcripts and how that relates to localization or the patterns of sarcomeric protein localization in muscle - are intriguing, and would likely impact our thinking on RNA localization, transport, etc if confirmed. Lastly, the authors compare their computational approaches to those available in the field; this is valuable as this is a rapidly evolving field and such considerations are critical for those wishing to use this type of approach.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Response: We believe that our manuscript as it stands now is already an “important” paper that will strongly impact the Drosophila community (and beyond the spatial transcriptomics community). As it stands, it provides the groundwork for a full Drosophila adult spatial atlas, similar to how early scRNA-seq datasets provided a framework for the Fly Cell Atlas. In the manuscript we provide both experimental information on how to successfully perform spatial transcriptomics (treating slides for optimal attachment) and the data serves as a benchmark for future experiments to improve upon (similar to how early Drop-seq datasets were compared to later 10x datasets in single-cell transcriptomics). In addition, it also provides proof of principle methods on how to integrate the FCA data with these spatial data and it identifies localized mRNA species in large adult muscle cells, showing the complementarity of spatial techniques with single-cell RNA-seq. To conclude, this is the first spatial adult Drosophila transcriptomics paper, locating 150 mRNA species with easy data access in our user portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://spatialfly.aertslab.org/">https://spatialfly.aertslab.org/</ext-link>).</p>
