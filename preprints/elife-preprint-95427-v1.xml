<title>Abstract</title><p>Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides were suggested as healthier alternatives to sugar-sweetened beverages. Nevertheless, the potential detrimental effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain inadequately understood. Presently, we have established a zebrafish model that exhibits significant excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Utilizing this model, we observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). The excessively branched vessels were observed to be formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the endothelial cells in the embryos exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis and experiments validated that foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides by down-regulating the expression of <italic>marcksl1a</italic>. This study has provided new evidence showing the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) encompasses a group of chronic diseases characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Among patients with DM, cardiovascular complications, especially the direct and indirect effects of hyperglycemia on the human vascular network, persist as the primary cause of morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]. The harmful effects of hyperglycemia are closely associated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>]. Endothelial dysfunction (ECD) is a systemic pathological state exhibiting disrupted integrity, adhesion, altered proliferation capacity, migration, tube formation, and more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>]. High blood glucose levels over long periods have been demonstrated to be associated with vascular dysfunction both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The epidemiological evidence has indicated the positive correlation between risks of cardiovascular disease and DM with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and 100% fruit juices, thereby emphasizing the concerns for the adverse effects of sugar intake on cardiometabolic risk factors, regardless of whether the sugar is added or naturally occurring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]. Artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs), which incorporate noncaloric sweeteners or low-caloric additives, have been suggested as healthy alternatives to SSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]. ASBs contain sugar alcohols and polyols, such as sorbitol, xylitol, maltitol, mannitol, erythritol, isomalt, and lactitol. The consumption of ASBs worldwide has gradually increased in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]. However, accumulating studies in the last decade suggested that ASB consumption might be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these findings remain insufficiently documented.</p>
<p>The zebrafish has been recognized as a valuable animal model for studying metabolic diseases, such as hyperglycemia and diabetic complications, due to its functional conservation in glycol metabolism, pancreas structure, glucose homeostasis, adipose biology, and genetic similarities to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>]. The combination of embryonic transparency and transgenic lines, wherein endothelial cells are labeled specifically with fluorescent proteins, facilitates the high-resolution imaging analysis of vascular formation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Immersion of zebrafish in glucose solution has been found to induce diabetic complications, including vascular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. Several recent studies have investigated the effects of high glucose on vascular function in the zebrafish model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. However, the association between noncaloric monosaccharides and vascular dysfunctions, such as excessive angiogenesis, has not been elucidated. Here, we have successfully established a short-term zebrafish model that exhibits significantly excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) induced by glucose treatment. Using this model, we examined the effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development and investigated the molecular mechanisms. Our results provided new evidence for the negative roles of caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides on vascular development.</p>

<title>Establishment of a short-term model of high-glucose-induced excessive angiogenesis</title>
<p>To establish the short-term zebrafish hyperangiogenenic model induced by high-glucose treatment, we immersed the <italic>Tg(fli1aEP:EGFP-CAAX)<sup>ntu666</sup></italic>embryos, a transgenic line wherein the endothelial cells were labeled with membrane-bound GFP (Supplementary Figure 1), in glucose solution within a wide range of concentrations and time windows (Supplementary Figure 2). We subsequently measured the glucose concentration in the embryos and found that the glucose concentration in the embryos treated with high glucose was significantly higher than that in the control group (Supplementary Figure 3). We observed that exposing zebrafish embryos at either 24 hours post fertilization (hpf) or 48 hpf to a 6% D-glucose treatment for a duration exceeding 48 hours led to dramatically increased formation of blood vessels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>, Movie 1 and 2), especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs) in the indicated area (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref>). The hyperbranched endothelial cells were observed to sprout from existing vessels, including the ISVs, dorsal aorta (DA), and dorsal lateral anastomotic vessel (DLAV) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) in embryos treated with high glucose. Additionally, these ectopically branched angiogenic sprouts were not perfused by blood flow. Despite the abnormal vessel formation, no significant developmental defects were observed in these treated embryos when examined under a bright field microscope (Supplementary Figure 4a-c). Moreover, no excessive angiogenic phenotype was observed in the embryos treated with 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4% D-glucose within the corresponding time frame (Supplementary Figure 5). In addition, 6% sucrose treatment at the same condition did not lead to any noticeable abnormal phenotype of vessels (Supplementary Figure 4d-h).</p>

<title>Fructose and noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive angiogenesis</title>
<p>Fructose is a ketonic monosaccharide that is an energy source for living organisms. Therefore, our study investigated the potential effects of fructose on vascular dysfunction in comparison to glucose. The result demonstrated fructose-induced excessive angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos (Supplementary Figure 6). Wondering whether the effects of glucose and fructose on vascular development were mediated by metabolic events, we then conducted the same tests by using other noncaloric monosaccharides, including L-glucose, D-mannose, D-ribose, and L-arabinose, which could not be digested by animals. Interestingly, we observed that all these noncaloric monosaccharides could induce excessive angiogenesis, among which the L-glucose purchased from two companies resulted in a similar phenotype as efficiently as D-glucose did (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a-h</xref>). However, the disaccharides, including lactose, maltose, and sucrose, which were also tested, did not cause significant excessive angiogenic phenotype (Supplementary Figure 4e, f; Supplementary Figure 7). In addition, we also tested the effects of pyruvic acid but did not observe the excessive angiogenic phenotype in the embryos treated with pyruvic acid solution at 50 nm∼50 μm concentration (Supplementary Figure 8). Furthermore, we examined the arterial and venous identity of the hyperbranched vessels via live imaging analysis of the high glucose-treated <italic>Tg(flt1:YFP::kdrl:ras-mCherry)</italic> line, in which the YFP expression in the artery was relatively higher than that in the vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]. The result revealed that the hyperbranched ectopic vessels comprised arteries and veins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2i, j</xref>).</p>

<title>High glucose promotes quiescent endothelial differentiation into tip cells</title>
<p>Given that a high-glucose shock has been observed to induce excessive angiogenesis in 48 hpf embryos, it was hypothesized that the shock might play a crucial role in regulating the differentiation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into active tip cell-like cells and their subsequent behaviors. To investigate whether this was the case, we observed the behaviors of these ECs by confocal time-lapse imaging analysis. As shown in the result, in the control <italic>Tg(fli1aEP:EGFP-CAAX)<sup>ntu666</sup></italic> embryos, no significant activation of tip cells in the angiogenic sprouts was observed in the generated ISVs, DA, and DLAV in the embryos aged from 48 hpf to 5 dpf. Moreover, only a few ECs in established ISVs, DA, and DLAV extended filopodia, which quickly retracted (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a-c</xref>, Movie 3). However, many ECs initiated sprouting angiogenesis in the high glucose-treated embryos, extended dynamic filopodia to sense the surroundings, and formed excessive ectopic blood vessels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d-e</xref>, Movie 4). In a snapshot, we observed that some of the ECs protruded long and intricate sprouts simultaneously (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3f</xref>), and nearly all the ECs within an ISV underwent the outgrowth of filopodia in some extreme cases (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3g</xref>), suggesting that the high glucose treatment induced the endothelial differentiation into tip cell-like cells. Furthermore, we observed that these outgrowths of the ectopic angiogenic sprouts could establish a connection to the neighboring sprouts and vessels and thereby form complicated vascular structures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c, f, i, l, p</xref>).</p>

<title>Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of the endothelial cells isolated from glucose-treated embryos</title>
<p>We did a single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis to gain more insight into the potential mechanism through which glucose activates the endothelial cells. Due to the limited presence of endothelial cells within the zebrafish embryos, the analysis of these cells poses a challenge. Firstly, we isolated the EGFP-positive cells from control and high glucose-treated embryos. Following the proteolytic dissociation of embryos, the EGFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Around 300-500 zebrafish embryos were used for the ECs collection for each stage. The isolated ECs were analyzed using a large-scale scRNA-seq (10X Genomics) platform, and the pipeline is illustrated in the diagram (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>). Multiple criteria were applied to select the single cells, including the retention of the genes that were expressed (Unique Molecular Identifiers or UMI larger than 0) in at least 3 individual cells, the selection of cells with the gene expression count falling within the range of 500 to 3000, and the imposition of a threshold wherein the proportion of sequencing reads derived from the mitochondrial genome was limited to less than 5% (Supplementary Figure 9). Ultimately, 6051 endothelial cells were selected for further analysis (Supplementary Figure 10, Supplementary Table 1).</p>

<p>Through clustering analysis of gene expression, these ECs were categorized into 6 clusters using UMAP. These clusters include cluster 0, which consists of arterial and capillary ECs; cluster1, comprising endocardium; cluster2, consisting of venous and lymphatic ECs; cluster3, comprising arch ECs; cluster4, encompassing proliferating ECs; and cluster5, consisting of vesicle enriched ECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref>). The endothelial marker gene <italic>cdh5</italic> was expressed in all the clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>). The notch ligand <italic>dlc</italic> was highly expressed in arterial, capillary ECs, and arch ECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref>). The <italic>dab2</italic> and <italic>prox1</italic> were mainly enriched in venous and lymphatic ECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4e-f</xref>). The <italic>cdk1</italic>, which is a key player in cell cycle regulation, was specifically expressed in proliferating ECs (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4h</xref>). It was revealed that the ratio of arterial and capillary ECs and proliferating ECs was increased in the high glucose-treated embryos (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4i, j</xref>), consistent with the observation that glucose treatment resulted in excessive sprouting angiogenesis of ISVs.</p>

<title>Foxo1a was significantly downregulated in arterial and capillary ECs</title>
<p>To identify the potential molecules responsible for increasing the proportion of arterial and capillary ECs in the embryos treated with glucose, we analyzed and compared the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in arterial and capillary ECs of control and glucose-treated ECs. The results revealed that 1201 genes were up-regulated and 523 genes were down-regulated significantly (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). GO analysis revealed that these DEGs were enriched in several biological processes, including regulation of actin filament organization, blood vessel morphogenesis, development, angiogenesis, etc. (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref>).</p>

<p>Subsequently, we searched for transcription factors among the genes involved in the aforementioned biological processes that might participate in inducing excessive angiogenesis.

<title>Monosaccharides induced excessive angiogenesis through the <italic>foxo1a-marcksl1a</italic> pathway</title>
<p>A previous study has reported that <italic>marcksl1a</italic> overexpression in ECs in zebrafish led to a significant increase in filopodia formation, similar to the phenotype we observed in response to high glucose treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>].

<p>Given the results obtained from <italic>marcksl1a</italic> overexpression and loss of function of <italic>foxo1a</italic>, we hypothesized that <italic>marcksl1a</italic> might be a target gene of Foxo1a. Therefore, we investigated the impact of Foxo1 inhibition on marcksl1a expression in zebrafish embryos. As expected, qPCR analysis revealed that inhibition of Foxo1 by AS1842856 resulted in upregulation of <italic>marcksl1a</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7a, b</xref>), which suggested that Foxo1a might negatively regulate <italic>marcksl1a</italic> transcription in zebrafish. To further confirm it, we performed the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiment to validate the potential binding interaction between Foxo1 and <italic>marcksl1a</italic>. Since the amino acid sequence and DNA binding motifs of Foxo1 are highly conserved between zebrafish and mice (Supplementary Figure 11), we analyzed the 3 kb promoter region of <italic>marcksl1a</italic> to search the binding site sequence of mouse FOXO1 presented in the JASPAR database. Two candidate binding sites (BS) were found at −265 to −275 (BS1) and −153 to −163 (BS2) nucleotides upstream of the TSS of <italic>marcksl1a</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7c</xref>) and then used for the ChIP-PCR assay detection. The results showed that Foxo1a was enriched in both the predicted binding sites of <italic>marcksl1a</italic> (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7d</xref>) in zebrafish.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we successfully established a new zebrafish model with significant excessive angiogenesis, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in PDR more closely than previously established models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]. Seung-Hyun Jung et al. have described a short-term zebrafish model for diabetic retinopathy (DR) induced by high glucose, which exhibited blood vessel defects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]. However, these defects were limited to the disruption of tight junctions and dilation of hyaloid-retinal vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>], without the excessive angiogenesis and vascular blockage observed in PDR and our established model. Additionally, although Kristina Jörgens et al. have observed the hyperbranching of small vessel structures originating from the upper part of ISVs, growing horizontally towards and partially connecting to the neighboring ISVs Field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>], the angiogenic sprouts did not form a more complex structure that was observed in our research.</p>
<p>The excessive development of immature blood vessels represents a significant pathological condition in the progression of DR and nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]. Hyperglycemia has been considered one of the most causal factors causing vascular damage, including excessive angiogenesis. However, the exact mechanism through which hyperglycemia impairs the blood vessels is not well determined. To gain more insights into it, we performed the analysis of single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data of the endothelial cells isolated from D-glucose-treated embryos. The findings revealed an increased ratio of tip cells and proliferating ECs, accompanied by the altered expression of various angiogenic genes in the ECs of D-glucose-treated embryos.</p>
<p>Foxo1 has been validated to be essential for sustaining the quiescence of endothelial cells, with involvement in metabolism regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]. Moreover, it also plays important roles in diabetic microvascular complications including DR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">42</xref>]. Here, by combining the single-cell transcriptomic sequencing data analysis and experimental validation, we identified the transcription factor Foxo1a, which was significantly down-regulated in the embryos treated with high glucose, responsible for the excessive angiogenesis. Additionally, our result further revealed that Foxo1a exerts its regulatory function during this process by down-regulating its target gene <italic>marcksl1a</italic>, regardless of whether the embryos were treated with D-glucose or L-glucose. Taken together, our results suggested that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides treatment could lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells through the <italic>foxo1a-marcksl1a</italic> pathway.</p>
<p>The consumption of ASB has been linked to the occurrence and development of cardiovascular disease in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]. However, the potential mechanisms underlying the association have not been well documented. In recent years, positive associations between ASB and cardiovascular disease have been proposed, possibly due to several plausible factors, including the potential impact of ASBs on central nervous system circuits, gut hormone secretion, and gut microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">45</xref>]. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that the ASBs might stimulate appetite and increase calorie intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>].</p>
<p>For a long time, there has been considerable debate and conflicting opinions regarding how specific sugars affect the development of type 2 diabetes rather than excess calories per se [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>]. In this study, we have provided new evidence indicating that the administration of noncaloric monosaccharides leads to significant excessive angiogenesis, suggesting that the excessive angiogenesis may not be only attributed to the caloric properties. Since excessive angiogenesis is the major pathological feature of diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy, our findings are in support of a possible biological mechanism underlying the positive associations between noncaloric monosaccharides and microvascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes, suggesting that the noncaloric monosaccharides might not be suitable for ASB consumption.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, no notable abnormalities were observed in the vessels of embryos treated with disaccharides, including lactose, maltose, and sucrose, which is consistent with the previous study stating that intakes of sucrose, lactose, and maltose were not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>]. This finding implied that the effects induced by monosaccharides cannot be attributed to the osmotic pressure of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, despite the potential conversion of these disaccharides into monosaccharides, the restricted reaction rate may maintain them within a safe concentration range that is not harmful to the vessels in a short period.</p>
<p>In conclusion, to investigate the effects of monosaccharides on vascular development, we established a zebrafish model by treating the embryos with high concentrations of monosaccharides. Based on this model, we observed significant excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides, initiated by activating the quiescent endothelial cells into proliferating tip cells. The effects of monosaccharides on inducing excessive angiogenesis were then proved to be mediated by the <italic>foxo1a-marcksl1a</italic> pathway. The results have provided novel insights into the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides in human health and the underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This manuscript successfully established a new short-term model of diabetic retinopathy by treating zebrafish embryos with high concentrations of monosaccharides, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy in patients. They found that excessive angiogenesis induced by glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides was achieved by activating the quiescent endothelial cells into proliferating tip cells. Importantly, the authors further confirmed the effects of monosaccharides on inducing excessive angiogenesis were mediated by the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>These results showed the potentially detrimental effects of the noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function and provided novel insights into the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The mechanism of noncaloric monosaccharides inducing excessive sprouting angiogenesis is not solid enough.</p>

<p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive sprouting angiogenesis in zebrafish via foxo1a-marcksl1a signal&quot;. Liu et al. observed that glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides can prompt an excessive formation of blood vessels, particularly intersegmental vessels (ISVs). They propose that these branched vessels arise from the ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Moreover, through single-cell transcriptome sequencing analysis of embryonic endothelial cells exposed to glucose, they noted an increased proportion of arterial and capillary endothelial cells, proliferative endothelial cells, along with a series of upregulated genes in categories of blood vessel morphogenesis, development, and pro-angiogenesis. The authors provide evidence suggesting that caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides (NMS) induce excessive angiogenesis via the foxo1a-Marcksl1a pathway.</p>
<p>The authors address an important problem about the effects of artificially sweetened beverages such as noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessels. However, the study lacks adequate experimental data and comprehensive analyses to support the mechanistic conclusions, which require extensive revisions.</p>

<p>The authors have investigated the effect of noncaloric monosaccharides on angiogenesis in the zebrafish embryo. These compounds are used as substitutes of sugars to sweeten beverages and they are commonly used by diabetic patients. The authors show that noncaloric monosaccharides and glucose similarly induce excessive blood vessel formation due to the increased formation of tip cells by endothelial cells. The authors show that this excessive angiogenesis involved the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway.</p>
<p>A limitation of the study is that the mechanism of angiogenesis in the retinal circulation and in peripheral vasculature is certainly different.</p>
<p>This result suggests that these noncaloric monosaccharides share common side effects with glucose. Consequently, more caution should be taken with regard to the use of these artificial sweeteners. This work is of interest for better management of diabetes.</p>
