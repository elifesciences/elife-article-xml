<abstract>
<title>Abstract</title><p>Unlike genomic data, serological data have not been previously leveraged to evaluate the SARS-CoV-2 variants circulation. In Bolivia, sustained genomic surveillance capacities were lacking especially at the beginning of the pandemic. In 2021 and 2022 we estimated the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Bolivian blood donors and explored the feasibility of using virus serum neutralization data for variants thought to have circulated to map their circulation across all departments over a year-long follow-up period. Anti-S1 and anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgGs were studied, along with virus neutralization tests for ancestral-D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 lineages of SARS-CoV-2. Between 2021 and 2022, the overall prevalence of anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies increased reaching values over 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naïve to the virus. Viral neutralization data, analyzed through multiple approaches, revealed the spread of the Gamma variant up to 2021, particularly impacting northern departments. In 2022, Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments of the country and the emergence of Omicron BA.1 was detected. These trends align with publicly available genomic data from neighboring countries. Our serological analyses successfully identified both new antigenic groups, such as Omicron BA.1, and individual variants related to previously circulating groups, such as Delta. The study contributes insights into overall population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and variant-specific immunity levels across different regions of Bolivia. It also emphasizes the potency of seroprevalence studies in informing public health decisions and underscore their value in capturing the initial phases of emerging epidemics when variant diversity is limited, facilitating timely genomic surveillance setup.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Low- and middle-income countries in the Latin American region are vulnerable to health crises due to a combination of factors such as poverty, fragile political and health systems, persistent and pervasive inequality in income, health care, and education, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started in South America with the detection of the first case on February 26, 2020, at São Paulo, Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Although it was initially thought that the pandemic would have less of an impact on this region due to its younger population structure, the pandemic eventually had a significant impact, accounting for 25% of infections worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Seroprevalence studies are a valuable adjunct to active surveillance because they allow analysis of the level of immunity of a population to a specific pathogen without the need for prospective testing, and also provide information on the frequency of cases that do not attract medical attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. During the first years of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a few South American population-based seroprevalence studies were conducted in Colombia, Perú, Chile, and Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Reported seroprevalence values varied through time and geographical location. Notably, high prevalence was observed in locations such as Iquitos-Perú (70%) or Manaus-Brazil (54%) after the first wave<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. However, an unexpected violent second wave occurred concomitantly with the emergence of the Gamma variant, despite the high levels of seroprevalence reported earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. Despite the serious impact of COVID-19 on public health in Bolivia, research studies are still lacking: one study reported a seroprevalence of 43.4% in January 2021 among healthcare workers in the city of Cochabamba<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, but no nationwide seroprevalence study is currently available.</p>
<p>To date, the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 variants has mainly been studied through molecular surveillance. However, in countries without significant genomic surveillance capabilities at the start of the epidemic, it has become difficult to assess the spread and impact of variants. Here, we have attempted to reconstruct parts of the history of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Bolivia by studying the prevalence and specific neutralizing capacity of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood donors from all Bolivian departments after the second and third COVID-19 waves. Based on the results obtained, we discuss the potential contribution of seroprevalence and seroneutralization studies of viral variants and their complementarity with viral genomics data during the different phases of dissemination of a pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<sec id="s2aa">
<title>Background</title>
<p>In Bolivia, the first case of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on March 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020, and to date 1 209 619 cases and 22 407 deaths have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. As for the rest of South America, Bolivia has experienced five waves of SARS-CoV-2 cases: the initial wave (May-September 2020), followed by a second (January-July 2021), a third (December 2021 to February 2022), a fourth (June-August 2022) and the most recent (November 2022 to January 2023). Data on variants circulating in each wave in South America is available in several free-access databases (<italic>e.g.,</italic> the PAHO dashboard) but Bolivian genomic data are scarce and only few sequences have been deposited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>.</p>
<p><bold><italic>During the first wave</italic></bold>, COVID-19 cases in Bolivia neighboring countries were due to ancestral and D614G SARS-CoV-2 strains (Supplementary Figure S1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. <bold><italic>During the second wave,</italic></bold> Alpha, Gamma, Lambda and Mu variants were the main types identified, with variable distribution among countries. In contrast to Europe, the Alpha variant was not the most prevalent in any country of South America. Moreover, no specific wave was produced and no associated increase in mortality was observed due to the circulation of the Delta variant. <bold><italic>The start of the third wave</italic></bold>, as in the rest of the world, was concomitant with the emergence and spread of the Omicron (BA.1) variant. <bold><italic>The next two waves</italic></bold> were mainly caused by the Omicron variants BA.2/BA.5 and BQ.1/XBB, respectively.</p>

<title>Specimens and ethical considerations</title>
<p>Samples were collected from volunteer blood donors that agreed to participate in the study and provided written consent. The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Dr. Mario Ortíz Suárez hospital, Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia (N° FWA0002686) and by the National Blood Program from the Ministry of Health and Sports of Bolivia. Sampling was conducted in close collaboration with the National Blood Program and each Departmental Reference Blood Bank. A first batch of 4238 serum samples was collected between August 26, and October 04, 2021. Samples were obtained from all Departmental Reference Blood Banks of Bolivia, which included the cities of Beni (N=733), Chuquisaca (N=294), Cochabamba (N=500), La Paz (N=500), El Alto(N=500), Oruro (N=500), Pando (N=414), Potosí (N=197), Santa Cruz (N=600), Tarija (N=500). A second batch was collected between May 30 and June 23, 2022, including a total of 1161 sera from the Departmental Reference Blood Banks of Cochabamba (N=212), La Paz (N=264), Santa Cruz (N=186) and Tarija (N=499).</p>

<title>Vaccination coverage</title>
<p>Vaccination campaign against SARS-CoV-2 in Bolivia started on January 29, 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Following the SAGE recommendations, vaccination started for the healthcare workers, then extended to the elderly, and people living with underlying health conditions and later expanded to the general population. Vaccines distributed in Bolivia included the mRNA vaccines Comirnaty (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), the inactivated virus vaccines CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech, China) and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, China), the (adeno)viral vector vaccines Ad26.CoV2.S (Johnson &amp; Johnson), Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca), and Sputnik V (Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology). Administration of a booster dose was started on October 11, 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 vaccination coverage was estimated for both sampling periods (October 27, 2021 and May 30, 2022) based on data reported by the Bolivian Ministry of Health and the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. To calculate vaccination coverage, the number of vaccine doses administered by the Bolivian Ministry of Health was related (by department and nationally) to the total eligible population according to the Bolivian National Institute of Statistics. At the time of the first and second sampling periods, the eligible population included individuals over 18 years of age and over 11 years of age, respectively.</p>

<title>Immunoassays</title>
<p>All serum samples were first screened using the commercial kit Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Quantivac ELISA IgG (Euroimmun) according to manufacturer’s recommendations to detect anti-Spike S1 antibodies. Specimens with BAU/mL&lt;25.6, 25.6≤ BAU/mL&lt;35.2, and BAU/mL≥35.2 were considered negative, equivocal and positive, respectively.</p>
<p>Samples were also tested for the presence of anti-NCP SARS-CoV-2 IgG using an in-house qSAT assay, as described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. Briefly, the CTD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein (EVAg, ref: 100P-03957) was coupled to a MAGPLEX® magnetic microsphere (Luminex Corporation) using the xMAP® Antibody Coupling Kit (Luminex Corporation) following manufacturer’s recommendations (60 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> beads). The coupled beads were resuspended and counted on a Countess™ II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo) to a final concentration of 2×10<sup>6</sup> beads/ml. Samples diluted in Wash Solution (Thermo) at 1/400 were incubated with 1,000 coupled beads per well for 1 h at room temperature in a plate shaker protected from light. After two washes, the beads were incubated with R-Phycoerythrin AffiniPure F(ab’)₂ Fragment Goat Anti-Human IgG F(ab’)₂ (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature in a plate shaker protected from light. After washing, antigen-antibody reactions were read on an INTELLIFLEX® system (Luminex Corporation) and the results were expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI). Cut-off values for each SARS-CoV-2 antigen for the S, RBD and NCP were described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>For virus Neutralization Tests (VNT), strains from the B.1 (Bav-Pat1/2020 strain [D614G]), P.1 (SARS-CoV-2/2021/JP/TY7-503 strain [Gamma]), B.1.617.2 (SARS-CoV-2/2021/FR/0610 strain [Delta]), and B.1.1.529 (UVE/SARS-CoV-2/2021/FR/1514 strain [Omicron BA.1]) lineages of SARS-CoV-2 were used. Except for Bav-Pat1/2020 strain (courtesy of Prof. Drosten, Berlin), all strains were provided by the European Virus Archive (EVAg) repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.european-virus-archive.com">www.european-virus-archive.com</ext-link>). VNTs were performed for samples with a positive or equivocal result in the anti-Spike S1 ELISA as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>. Four separate VNT assays were performed in duplicate with strains representative of the D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 variants. Briefly, the test consisted in mixing 110µL of a serially diluted (from 1/20 to 1/40960) patient serum sample (in DMEM with 1% of penicillin/streptomycin, Non-Essential Amino Acids and Glutamine), with 110µL of a fixed quantity of a given SARS-CoV-2 strain, to reach a final concentration of 0.5 TCID<sub>50</sub>/µL of plasma dilution. This mixture was incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. One hundred µL was then transferred onto a confluent Vero E6 TMPRSS2+ cells monolayer and incubated at 37°C under 5% of CO<sub>2</sub>. On day 5 post infection, dilutions showing a cytopathic effect (CPE) were considered negative (no neutralization) and those without CPE were considered positive (complete neutralization of the SARS-CoV2 inoculum). The neutralization titer referred to as the highest serum dilution with a positive result. Specimens with a VNT titer ≥ 20 were considered positive.</p>

<sec id="s2d">
<title>SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence</title>
<p>Prevalence values for anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies, and for neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against the ancestral D614G (D614G), Gamma (γ), Delta (δ), and Omicron BA.1 (ο) variants were calculated using the Prevalence package RStudio version R-4.0.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref></sup>. Positive or negative status for each sample and every variable was determined using the cut-offs described above. For all variables, number of positive and negative results were used for prevalence computing.</p>
<p>Regarding nAbs, prevalence values for each variant (D614G, γ, δ, ο) in each department and nationwide were calculated using the regular seropositivity titer cut-off at 20 (samples with a titer ≥20 were considered positive) and an alternative “high level” seropositivity titer cut-off at</p>
<p>≥640.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the circulating variants using a “VNT Titers ratio method”</title>
<p>The circulation of variants in Bolivia before October 2021 and June 2022 was first analyzed through the distribution of samples exhibiting titers higher than the D614G ancestral strain for a given variant of interest (γ, δ, ο). The base 2 logarithm of VNT titer ratios (log2-ratios) for the following variants pairs was calculated: D614G/Gamma (D614G/γ), D614G/Delta (D614G/δ), D614G/Omicron BA.1 (D614G/ο). Negative log2-ratio indicated that the variant in the denominator (γ, δ, ο) had a higher titer than D614. A log2-ratio of 0 indicated that both variants presented the same titer. To evaluate the circulation level of γ, δ, and ο variants under increasingly stringent conditions, we calculated the proportion of the population with log2-ratio values of ≤0 (variant titer equal to or greater than D614G), ≤-1 (variant titer at least twice that of D614G), and ≤-2 (variant titer at least four times that of D614G) for each department.</p>

<title>Quantification of the circulating variants according to antigenic groups</title>
<p>Antigenic mapping of SARS-CoV-2 based on the neutralizing activity of each variant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> enables us to group the ancestral variants D614G, Alpha, Delta, Lambda, and Epsilon in one group (GI), Beta, Gamma, Mu, Iota, and Zeta in a second group (GII), and Omicron and its derivatives into a third group (GIII). To initiate the quantification of the variants circulating in Bolivia, we initially employed a straightforward approach to estimate the percentage of samples in each antigenic group within each department of Bolivia using two different methods (the “Average titer method” and the “Variant assignment method”).</p>
<sec id="s2g">
<title>Average titer method</title>
<p>To assess the neutralizing response across distinct antigenic groups, we used the average VNT titer for the D614G and Delta variants to delineate antigenic group I (GI). Antigenic group II (GII) was established based on the VNT titer for the Gamma variant, while antigenic group III (GIII) was defined by the VNT titer for the Omicron BA.1 variant. For evaluating the percentage of each antigenic group within different regions of Bolivia, GI was considered dominant if its titer surpassed those of GII and GIII. Similarly, GII was considered if its titer exceeded those of GI and GIII, and GIII was considered if its titer equaled or surpassed those of GI and GII. Additionally, the prevalences of GI (from ancestral, Alpha, Delta, Lambda, and Epsilon variants), the prevalences of GII (from Beta, Gamma, Mu, Iota, and Zeta variants), and the prevalences of GIII (from all Omicron-derived variants) were obtained for neighboring countries of Bolivia using publicly accessible genomic data when available.</p>

<title>Assignment rules</title>
<p>We implemented several rules taking into account the previously described decrease in neutralizing activity of variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup> to determine which of the four variants tested was expected to be responsible for the main or last infection (Supplementary Figure S2). Main rules relied on D614G/γ, D614G/δ, and D614G/ο log2-ratios to differentiate between D614G, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants. Given that Tarija had the lowest variant circulation level and the highest vaccination coverage among the departments analyzed as October 2021, this department was chosen as a reference for establishing the D614G cut-off values for the subsequent rules defining the infection by γ, δ and ο variants. Given that approximately 90% of the population in this department exhibited D614G/γ, D614G/δ, and D614G/ο log2-ratios ≥0, ≥0, and ≥1 respectively, the D614G variant was assigned to compliant samples. If any of these log2-ratios fell below these threshold values, the corresponding variant (γ, δ, or o) was assigned. Secondary rules were applied on a fraction of samples when the log2-ratios for two pairs were below the threshold values. Additional log2-ratios for Delta/Gamma (δ/γ), Gamma/Omicron BA.1 (γ/ο) and Delta/Omicron BA.1 (δ/ο) pairs were thus considered to differentiate between the two variants. If both the D614G/γ and D614G/δ log2-ratios were ≤ −1, a δ/γ log2-ratio ≤ 0 was chosen to indicate a Gamma infection, while a δ/γ log2-ratio ≥ 1 indicated a Delta infection. When the D614G/ο log2-ratio was ≤ 0 and the D614G/γ log2-ratio was also ≤ −1, a γ/ο log2-ratio ≥ 1 indicated a Gamma infection; otherwise (γ/ο log2-ratio ≤ 0) Omicron BA.1 was assigned. Similarly, if the D614G/ο log2-ratio was ≤ 0 and the D614G/δ log2-ratio was ≤ −1, a δ/ο log2-ratio ≥ 1 suggested a Delta infection; otherwise (δ/ο log2-ratio ≤ 0) Omicron BA.1 was assigned.</p>

A second sampling to follow the evolution of the virus 6 months later was carried out in the 3 most populated departments as well as in the most southern department (May 30 to June 23, 2022, corresponding to the phase before the fourth wave).</p>
<p>Among the 4738 blood donors included for the first period, age ranged from 18 to 64 years, with a median of 29 years (IQR, [23-37]). In the second period, 1161 blood donors were included, ranging in age from 18 to 82 years, with a median of 32 years (IQR, [25-41]).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To our knowledge, we are reporting the first serological study of SARS-CoV-2 to be carried out in Bolivia in 2021 and 2022, which included blood donors from all the country’s departments. This study enabled us to estimate the level of immunity of the population to SARS-CoV-2 nationwide and in the different regions of the country, thus providing valuable information on the circulation of these variants in Bolivia.</p>
<p>Our study has limitations. Firstly, the study was limited to blood donors in the major cities of Bolivia and may therefore not be fully representative of the populations of the country as a whole. In addition, our results are based on serological data and may not be strictly identical to the genomic data from a quantitative point of view, although they are likely to reflect similar trends and distributions (see below).</p>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Epidemiological assessment</title>
<p>As of October 2021, our data showed an anti-S1 SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 86.3%, indicating that a large part of the population had immunity against SARS-CoV-2 following infection, vaccination, or both (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Comparing the vaccination coverage with the anti-S1 antibody prevalence, we can infer that significant viral transmission occurred in the population before October 2021 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary Figure S3). These epidemiological data are in agreement with other population-based studies performed on the first half of 2021 in Perú and in the northwest of Brazil that reported high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence (63.6% and 65.0%, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. In Bolivia, the prevalence observed a few months later was even higher, suggesting sustained virus circulation. By June 2022, although our sample was limited to four departments, the data show a clear trend towards saturation in the prevalence of anti-S1, suggesting that almost the entire population had been vaccinated and/or infected by that time. With vaccination coverage having increased by around 13% (both for those who had received two doses and those who had received the booster), the significant increase (+31.2%) in the seroprevalence of anti-NCP antibodies indicates that a large proportion of the population has been exposed to the virus between October 2021 and June 2022 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Even if a proportion of newly vaccinated individuals had received an inactivated vaccine likely to generate an anti-NCP response, this cannot explain the observed increase in the prevalence of anti-NCP antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. This corresponds to the emergence of the Omicron BA.1 variant, which has been shown to cause a high rate of infection worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Consistently, as of October 2021, the prevalence of nAbs against the ancestral D614G (83.1%) and Gamma (80.8%) variants was very high throughout the country (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4). The 3 northern departments (Pando, La Paz and Beni) were the most exposed to the Gamma variant, as reflected by the highest Gamma GMTs (Supplementary Figure S5). By June 2022, the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against all variants had increased, reaching values higher than 90%, demonstrating that a large proportion of the Bolivian population was no longer naïve to the virus.</p>
<p>When looking at nAbs with high neutralization titers, new variant circulation patterns emerged (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> and Supplementary Figure S4). Some departments in the northern part of Bolivia, especially Pando, may have suffered a greater impact during the two first waves, since nAbs titers were higher for both the D614G and Gamma variants as of October 2021. To gain further insight into the variant circulation, we proposed additional analyses (”VNT Titers ratio method”, “Average titer method”, “Variant assignment method”; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Figures S6 to S8).</p>
<p>As of October 2021, a higher circulation of GII/Gamma was confirmed in northern Bolivia. Moreover, it is likely that the first two waves had a significant impact on Pando, since (despite having the lowest vaccine coverage in the country) high percentages of nAbs responses to the ancestral D614G and Gamma variants were observed. On the other hand, the southernmost department (Tarija) was probably the least affected, as it had the highest percentage of neutralizing response to ancestral viruses and the lowest to Gamma, which is consistent with its high vaccination coverage (the highest in the country). As for Delta, limited circulation was observed across the country, corresponding to the beginning of its circulation in Latin America (Supplementary Figure S1). As expected, no evidence of Omicron BA.1 was observed.</p>
<p>By June 2022, analyses showed that GII/Gamma continued to circulate in southernmost departments (Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, and Tarija). Besides, the high level of nAbs against GII/Gamma, observed in the first sampling period, in the population of La Paz seems to have waned and in the contrary GI/D614G nAbs have risen (+40%). This observation cannot be explained solely by an increase in vaccination coverage (Supplementary Figure S3), since vaccination increased by only 13%. GI/D614G nAbs augmentation could be related to the circulation of another GI variant, such as Lambda (which has circulated in the neighboring country of Perú), or alternatively, the infection by the Delta and/or Omicron BA.1 variant may have boosted the level of pre-existing anti-D614G nAbs in the population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. This boost of pre-existing Abs phenomenon, known as antigenic sin, has been extensively documented in the context of influenza infections and vaccinations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>. As for Delta, prevalences did not change significantly, between October 2021 and June 2022, reflecting the limited Delta wave in Latin America compared to Europe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Despite a significant global wave of the Omicron BA.1 variant in South America, less than 9% of the Bolivian population tested displayed a neutralizing antibody response against Omicron BA.1. This lower-than-expected nAbs response could be attributed to the possibility that this variant increased the levels of pre-existing nAbs to previous variants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Significance of serological results</title>
<p>To assess the significance and robustness of our serological results, we compared the results obtained with the different methods used and with genomic data from neighboring countries. We found that the patterns of circulation of antigenic groups/variants were consistent across the different serological methods used (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Figures S7 and S8) and that they nicely aligned with the percentage of each antigenic group/variants in the neighboring countries as computed from accessible genomic surveillance data (Supplementary Figure S1).</p>
<p>Serological analyses allowed detecting the emergence of a new antigenic group (<italic>e.g.</italic>, Omicron BA.1), but also of an individual variant related to a previously circulating antigenic group (<italic>e.g</italic>., Delta). Overall, the accuracy of the mapping seems to have diminished with time, the number of variants that have been circulated, vaccination and the saturation of prevalence estimates. As an example, the prevalence values found for Omicron BA.1 in June 2022 are likely to be underestimated (see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> and Supplementary Figures S1 and S8). Although the detection of a new antigenic group remained possible in this specific study during the late period of variants circulation, our results argue in favor of the greater usefulness of seroepidemiological studies for documenting the early stages of a new epidemic. This is of great interest because it gives time to set up genomic surveillance in countries with limited sequencing capacity at the start of an epidemic emergence.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study represents the first large-scale survey conducted in all the departments of Bolivia, with a follow-up period of almost a year. This has enabled us to document ongoing viral circulation and better characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Latin America, as well as providing essential information on the successive waves that have occurred in Bolivia. In particular, despite a high prevalence in 2022, which could suggest the development of herd immunity, subsequent waves demonstrate the virus ability to adapt and continue circulating in a population that is no longer naïve. Our results confirm and reiterate that seroprevalence studies are a powerful tool for informing public health decision-making. Our findings strongly support the idea that seroepidemiological studies are valuable for capturing the initial phases of a new epidemic, giving time for the establishment of genomic surveillance in countries with limited sequencing capacity at the onset of an emerging epidemic.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study provides valuable and comprehensive information about the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence during 2021 and 2022 in different regions of Bolivia. Moreover, data on immune responses against the SARS-CoV-2 variants based on neutralization tests denotes the presence of several virus variants circulating in the Bolivian population. Evidence for seroprevalence data provided by the authors is solid, across the study period, while data regarding variant circulation is limited to the early stages of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The major strength of this study is that it provided nationwide seroprevalence estimates from infection and/or vaccination based on antibodies against both spike and the nucleocapsid protein in a large representative sample of sera collected at two time-points from all departments of Bolivia, gaining insight into COVID-19 epidemiology. On the other hand, data from virus neutralization assays inferred the circulation during the study period of four SARS-CoV-2 variants in the population. Overall, the study results provide an overview of the level of viral transmission and vaccination and insights into the spread across the country of SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The assessment of a Lambda variant that circulated in several neighboring countries (Peru, Chile, and Argentina), which had a significant impact on the COVID-19 pandemic in the region, may have strengthened the study to contrast Gamma spread. In addition, even though neutralizing antibodies can certainly reveal previous infections of SARSCOV2 variants in the population, it is of limited value to infer from this information some potential timing estimates of specific variant circulation, considering the heterogeneous effects that past infections, vaccinations, or a combination of both could have on the level of variant-specific neutralizing antibodies and/or their cross-neutralization capacity.</p>
<p>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions:</p>
<p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, particularly regarding seroprevalence that reliably reflects the epidemiology of COVID-19 in Bolivia, and seroprevalence trends in other low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>A discussion of the likely impact of the work on the field, and the utility of the methods and data to the community:</p>
<p>Since this is the first study that has been conducted to assess indicators of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the population of Bolivia at a nationwide scale, seroprevalence data provided by geographic regions at two time-points can be useful as a reference for potential retrospective global meta-analysis and further explore and compare the risk factors for infection, variant distribution, and the impact on infection and vaccination, gaining deeper insights into understanding the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bolivia and in the region.</p>

<p>Significance of the findings:</p>
<p>In this study, blood donors were assessed using serology and viral neutralization assays to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. S1 and NCP antibodies were used to distinguish between vaccination and natural infection and virus-specific neut titers were used to determine which variants the antibodies respond to. The study reports almost universal antibody prevalence and increases in antibodies against specific variants at different points corresponding to circulating variants identified phylogenetically in neighbouring countries. The authors propose this approach for settings like Bolivia where genetic sequencing is not readily available. Unfortunately, there are significant limitations to this approach that limit its utility - serological data are available after the fact in a fast-moving pandemic and so are a poor alternative to phylogenetic data. Rather, serological information can supplement phylogenetic data and is most useful in estimating population-level immunity.</p>
<p>(1) Considerations in interpreting the results:</p>
<p>a. Serology provides different information to phylogenetic sequencing of the viruses and so both are important. Viral sequencing provides real-time information on circulating variants and indicates the proportion of each variant in circulation at any point as there are almost always multiple variants spreading but it is the fastest spreading variant that comes to dominate. Importantly serology measures asymptomatic infections as well, providing population estimates of infection that are not available through viral gene sequencing.</p>
<p>b. A major concern in the interpretation of serology is that antibody titers vary markedly over time with rapid declines in the first year post-infection or post-vaccination. However, these declines vary depending on whether hybrid immunity is present. Disentangling this retrospectively is a challenge. A low antibody titer could reflect an infection that occurred a few months ago but may be below the threshold for positivity at the time of testing. There is also substantial individual variability in antibody responses.</p>
<p>c. Serology becomes increasingly difficult to untangle when an individual has had doses of vaccine and multiple natural infections with different variants. Due to the importance of hybrid immunity in population risk to new variants, it would be useful for estimates of hybrid immunity to be generated based on anti-S1 and anti-NCP antibodies. From a population immunity perspective, this could be important in guiding future protection and boosting strategies.</p>
<p>d. Since there is cross-neutralization by the antibodies stimulated by each variant, it is important to establish the sensitivity and specificity of each of the neutralization assays in a panel comprising multiple variants. An assessment of the accuracy of the neut assay for each variant is needed to be confident that it is able to distinguish between variants.</p>
<p>e. Blood donors are notoriously poor representations of the general population in many countries, driven partly by whether donation is financially rewarded. For example, in the USA, drug addicts are disproportionately over-represented in blood donor populations as they use it as a source of money. The authors provide no information on whether the blood donor population in Bolivia is representative of the entire population. Comparison of the prevalence of specific disease markers in the general population and in blood donors could provide a signal of their comparability.</p>
<p>(2) Please provide the sensitivity and specificity of each of the assays so that the reader can assess the degree of accuracy in the assay that claims that the prevalent antibodies are due to, for example, omicron.</p>
<p>(3) Please provide an assessment of the representativity of the blood donor population eg. Is the prevalence of hepatitis B serological markers in the blood donor population comparable with the prevalence of hepatitis B serological markers in the general population from community-based studies?</p>
