<title>Abstract</title><p>Proper brain function requires the assembly and function of diverse populations of neurons and glia. Single cell gene expression studies have mostly focused on characterization of neuronal cell diversity; however, recent studies have also revealed substantial diversity of glial cells, particularly astrocytes. To better understand glial cell types and their roles in neurobiology, we built a new suite of adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based genetic tools to enable genetic access to astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These oligodendrocyte and astrocyte enhancer-AAVs are highly specific (usually &gt; 95% cell type specificity) with variable expression levels, and the astrocyte enhancer-AAVs show multiple distinct expression patterns reflecting the spatial distribution of astrocyte cell types. To provide the best glial-specific functional tools, several enhancer-AAVs were: optimized for higher expression levels, shown to be functional and specific in rat and macaque, shown to maintain specific activity across transgenes and in epilepsy where traditional promoters changed activity, and used to drive functional transgenes in astrocytes including Cre recombinase and acetylcholine-responsive sensor iAChSnFR. The astrocyte-specific iAChSnFR revealed a clear reward-dependent acetylcholine response in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning. Together, this collection of glial enhancer-AAVs will enable characterization of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte populations and their roles across species, disease states, and behavioral epochs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Glial cell types play critical roles in CNS development, function, and homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref></sup>. Astrocytes provide trophic support for neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>, coordinate regional wiring patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>, respond to and regulate neurotransmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, and drive repair or pathology after traumatic injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup>. Oligodendrocytes form myelin sheaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>, strengthen circuits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>, secrete critical neurotrophic factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup>, and contribute to pathologic disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. Transcriptomic characterization of glial cells has revealed an array of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte cell types, often with pronounced regional signatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Furthermore, species-specific features have been described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>, although the functional significance of these differences is unknown. Glial cell types have also been shown to play critical roles in CNS diseases ranging from epilepsy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> to neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref></sup> to cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. To understand how glia differ between cell types, regions, species, and disease states, a set of tools is needed to grant targeted genetic access to these specific populations across species.</p>
<p>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are exceptionally useful tools for somatic transgenesis across mammalian species including human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref></sup>. Short enhancer or promoter regulatory elements work effectively in AAV expression cassettes to drive cell-type selective gene expression in the brain or other organs. Recent work has shown that selective AAVs can be rationally designed by using enhancers identified from epigenetic datasets that are selectively active and fit in an AAV vector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Enhancer-AAVs were recently developed to target different populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the brain, and some enhancers have shown successful targeting of glial cell populations as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">43</xref></sup>. However, the field largely relies on glial promoters that have some undesirable characteristics, most notably loss of specificity or change in strength in different contexts as seen for astrocytic <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter fragments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref></sup>. Furthermore, single cell genomics studies have revealed region-specific astrocyte cell types for which no current tools are available<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Here we present characterization of a collection of enhancer-AAVs that selectively target astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Twenty-five astrocyte and 21 oligodendrocyte enhancer AAVs were identified from mouse and human neocortical epigenetic data that produced reporter expression that was highly specific for the intended populations, often labeling more than half of the intended cells in the area, and with a wide range of expression strengths. Multiple astrocyte-targeting vectors exhibited distinct CNS region-specific expression patterns, whereas oligodendrocyte-selective vectors generally drove expression throughout the entire CNS. Several enhancer-AAVs maintained selective expression for astrocytes or oligodendrocytes across rat and macaque, across epileptic disease status, and even for difficult transgenes. Lastly, several astrocyte tools were adapted to drive expression of functional transgenes like Cre or the detection of neurotransmitters to reveal the role of astrocytes in neurobiology. We used astrocyte-selective AAV expressing iAChSnFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> to measure the dynamics of acetylcholine in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning. This collection of tools opens up new opportunities for selective labeling and functional interrogation of glial cell types across species and disease states, and could have translational applications via AAV-based therapeutics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref></sup>.</p>

<title>Generation of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs</title>
<p>We identified putative enhancers specific for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes from single cell/single nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (sc/snATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>) and single nucleus methyl-cytosine sequencing (snmC-seq) studies from neocortex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup>. Thousands of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-selective scATAC-seq peaks were identified previously in both human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and mouse primary visual cortex (VISp), averaging approximately 300-600 bp in size (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>). Additional ATAC-seq datasets confirmed these peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup>. Generally, astrocyte and oligodendrocyte candidate enhancers were accessible in non-neuronal cells but not in neuronal cells across the human forebrain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">55</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>), and in the corresponding astrocyte or oligodendrocyte subclasses across the mouse forebrain without strong cell type preferences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">56</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G-L</xref>).</p>

<p>We used three strategies to identify putative enhancers for testing: “high specificity”, “high strength”, and “marker gene” (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B-E</xref>). The “high specificity” nomination criteria (gold square or star icons) required enhancers and their orthologs to show accessibility specifically for both mouse and human astrocytes or oligodendrocytes but not other cell types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>. In addition, we required that these putative enhancers not be detected in demethylated genomic regions in both mouse and human neuron populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. Some “high specificity” enhancers also showed specific demethylation in bulk human and mouse glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (marked by gold star icons). “High strength” putative enhancers were selected on the basis of strong astrocyte-specific peaks using only mouse scATAC-seq data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, with strength measured by accessibility read count within peaks. Finally, “marker gene” putative enhancers showed specific and strong accessibility near known astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific marker genes.</p>
<p>We tested putative enhancer function in AAV vectors upstream of a minimal promoter driving the reporter SYFP2 and evaluated expression throughout the mouse brain after systemic administration of PHP.eB-serotyped AAVs. Enhancer-AAVs that showed anticipated reporter expression, were further evaluated for specificity, completeness of expression, and cross-species activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). All three strategies were effective, with approximately half of the candidates for both cell types yielding astrocyte or oligodendrocyte-specific expression patterns during primary screening (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D, E</xref>), which were confirmed on-target by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or scRNA-seq (see figures below). Some of these vectors were also characterized in parallel large-scale efforts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>, all raw data from which are available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portal.brain-map.org/genetic-tools/genetic-tools-atlas">https://portal.brain-map.org/genetic-tools/genetic-tools-atlas</ext-link>, and the full set of experimental mice described below are summarized in <xref rid="tbls2" ref-type="table">Table S2</xref>.</p>

<p>We screened 50 candidate astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs, and 25 (50%) of them labeled astrocytes specifically with SYFP2 expression (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs showed a range of expression strengths and patterns (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-O</xref>) and vectors were categorized based on their labeling as: “Most of the CNS”, “Regional”, “Scattered”, “Weak” and “Mixed specificities”. “Most of the CNS” astrocyte enhancer-AAVs, including AiE0380h and the human <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter (GfaABC1D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>), labeled cells with astrocyte morphology in both brain and spinal cord (SpC, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A-B, G-H</xref>). Other examples in this category include AiE0387m, AiE0390h, AiE0390m, and the synthetic element ProB12<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). “Regional” astrocyte enhancer-AAVs showed regionally restricted expression, such as AiE0385m that labeled astrocytes primarily in the telencephalon (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C, F</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other &quot;Regional” enhancer-AAVs labeled astrocytes in subcortical domains but not in the telencephalon, such as AiE0381h and AiE2160m (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>); while AiE0375m only labeled Bergmann glia, specialized astrocytes in the cerebellar cortex (CBX, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, enhancers AiE2120m and AiE2160m labeled astrocytes in nearly mutually exclusive regions (<xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). “Scattered” enhancer-AAVs labeled astrocytes strongly but sparsely in most brain regions. These enhancer-AAVs include AiE0374m and its ortholog AiE0374h (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Enhancer-AAVs labeled as “Weak” gave astrocyte-specific patterns with low expression of SYFP (e.g., AiE0373m and AiE0386m, <xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2— figure supplement 1</xref>). Last, we designated several enhancer-AAVs as “Mixed specificities” because they labeled astrocytes and neurons. For example, AiE2118m labels many astrocytes strongly and specifically within the telencephalon, but also labels neurons strongly in non-telencephalic structures like midbrain (MB), deep cerebellar nuclei (CBN), and globus pallidus, external segment (GPe) (<xref rid="fig2s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p>

<p>We quantified the specificity of many of these astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs using multiple independent techniques. First, we characterized SYFP2-expressing cells with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Sox9, a marker of astrocytes throughout the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">58</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G-O</xref>). Many of the astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAV vectors show high specificity, which we define as &gt;80% specificity for the target cell population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. Astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs are usually &gt;95% specific, and often &gt;99% specific in VISp for Sox9-expressing astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref>). Second, we also observed high specificity when we isolated single SYFP2+ cells by flow cytometry and profiled them by scRNA-seq (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref>). Additionally, we assessed completeness of astrocyte labeling using IHC, and we observed that vectors scored as “Most of CNS” often label &gt;50% of astrocytes in VISp, but “Weak” or “Scattered” vectors labeled many fewer astrocytes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref>). “Regional” vectors showed differing completeness across brain regions as expected (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2P</xref>). Whole-brain serial two-photon tomography (STPT) of mouse brain transduced with astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs demonstrated distinct astrocyte morphologies in multiple brain regions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2Q</xref>). Thus, this collection of astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs are diverse with regard to the density of labeled cells, expression strength, and regionalization.</p>

<title>A collection of oligodendrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs</title>
<p>We screened 43 candidate oligodendrocyte enhancers, of which 21 (49%) gave oligodendrocyte-specific expression patterns (<xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike the astrocyte collection, the oligodendrocyte enhancer-AAVs all produced similar expression patterns throughout the gray matter and white matter tracts without any obvious regional specificity (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A-F</xref>). Oligodendrocyte-specific enhancer-AAV vectors ranged in expression from strong (for example AiE0410m, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>, AiE0641m, AiE0395h, and AiE0396h), to moderate (for example AiE0409h, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>, and the Myelin Basic Protein (<italic>MBP</italic>) promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref></sup>, <xref rid="fig3s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), to weak (for example AiE0400h, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref>).

<title>Transcriptomic identities of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes</title>
<p>To investigate distinctions among enhancer-AAV-transduced cells, we performed SMARTerV4 scRNA-seq on sorted SYFP2-expressing cells. We characterized 2040 cells from 47 mice injected with 31 different enhancer-AAVs (1-2 mice per enhancer-AAV). After removing low-quality single-cell transcriptomes and cells not expressing the SYFP2 transcript, we focused the analysis on 1946 high-quality single cells. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes separated in the UMAP space, as did astrocytes sorted from the distinct brain regions including VISp, midbrain/hindbrain (MB/HB), and CBX (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). The molecular distinctions among regional astrocyte populations agree with findings from recent whole-brain atlases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.

<p>To understand the molecular regulation of these astrocyte and oligodendrocyte-selective enhancer-AAVs, we performed de novo motif detection on a collection of specific and strong astrocyte and oligodendrocyte enhancers (n = 15 each) using MEME-CHIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup>. This analysis yielded one motif occurring in the majority of enhancers in each set (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>).

We mapped these motifs against known transcription factor (TF) motif databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">62</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">64</xref></sup>, which revealed top matches to the Zic family consensus motifs for astrocytes (JASPAR accession numbers MA0697.2, MA1628.1, and MA1629.1; average of these three shown) and the Sox family motif for oligodendrocytes (JASPAR accession number MA0442.1 [Sox10 shown], and also Uniprobe accession numbers UP00030.1 and UP00062.1; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4F, G</xref>).

<title>Regional expression correlates with astrocyte cell type distribution</title>
<p>Using STPT imaging, we observed astrocyte-specific enhancer-AAVs to have two distinct expression patterns within the basal ganglia circuit. Several enhancer-AAVs showed elevated expression in astrocytes of the dorsolateral striatum and depletion in the globus pallidus (GP; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4I-K</xref>), and several other enhancer-AAVs drove stronger transgene expression in astrocytes in the GP compared with those of the lateral striatum (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4L-N</xref>, <xref rid="fig2s2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

<title>Measuring and optimizing enhancer strength</title>
<p>In some cases, enhancer-AAVs might not drive sufficient levels of a transgene to functionally affect the target cell. We sought to boost the expression levels of some enhancers by assembling concatemers of “core” sequences. These core sequences are responsible for the selective expression patterns and are often found in the central third of the original enhancer region identified by snATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> (that is, ∼100-200 bp core from ∼300-600 bp original enhancer, <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). We observed that concatenation of the core can substantially increase expression from the original enhancer, such as AiE0387m concatenated to AiE0387m_3xC1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B, C</xref>), AiE0390h concatenated to AiE0390h_3xC2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D, E</xref>), or AiE0390m concatenated to AiE0390m_3xC2 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F, G</xref>) while retaining similar expression patterns (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H-J</xref>) and cell type specificity (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>).

<title>Enhancers can yield more robust specific expression across transgenes than classic promoters</title>
<p>Previously it was demonstrated that the human <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter (GfaABC1D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">57</xref></sup>) can change specificity from astrocytes to neurons over time when driving certain difficult transgene cargos including NeuroD1-mCherry fusion protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>.

<title>Astrocyte specific sensing of cholinergic signals in the nucleus accumbens during behavior</title>
<p>We next asked whether the vectors would drive sufficient expression to obtain functional signals in a cell-type specific manner. We created a vector driving astrocyte-specific expression of the acetylcholine indicator iAChSnFR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9A,B</xref>), to detect extracellular acetylcholine fluctuations in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in an awake and behaving animal using fiber photometry. After stereotaxic injection, we implanted optical fibers above the injection site to perform fiber photometry. We trained mice to perform a dynamic foraging reinforcement learning task while we recorded photometry signals to assess bulk acetylcholine fluctuations in the NAc. In the task, water-restricted mice chose freely between two lick ports for a water reward after an auditory cue. Reward probabilities of the two lick ports were changed in a block-design manner, which resulted in both rewarded and unrewarded trials (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9C</xref>). During these trials, the astrocyte-specific iAChSnFR vector drove sufficient expression to observe fluorescence intensity fluctuations (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>) which can be seen to differ during individual rewarded and unrewarded licks (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9D</xref>, bottom left). Both rewarded and unrewarded trials showed an increase in fluorescent signal at the time of choice, followed by a deviation in signal depending on whether the trial was rewarded (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>). Astrocyte acetylcholine signals decreased more in rewarded trials than in unrewarded trials (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Figure 9E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Flexible and dependable tools to target glial cell populations will be essential to understand their diverse roles in brain biology. Here we report a collection of astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific enhancers that can be used in AAV vectors and applied across species. Most of these enhancer-AAVs generated highly specific labeling of astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, and often substantial completeness of labeling. Detailed characterization revealed the enhancers showed a range of expression strengths, and the astrocyte enhancers frequently exhibited regional enrichment and differences in labeling densities. We demonstrate that this enhancer-AAV toolset can be applied: 1) across species in mouse, rat and macaque, 2) in epileptic mice where gliosis is occurring without losing specificity, and 3) to deliver Cre selectively to many astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, 4) irrespective of transgene delivered, and 5) to measure circuit dynamics with a neurotransmitter sensor <italic>in vivo</italic>. As a result, these glial enhancer-AAVs will be useful for interrogating the roles of these glial cell types in health and disease.</p>

<title>Lesson learned from screening</title>
<p>Several lessons were learned through the process of screening for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte enhancer-AAVs. First, multiple selection criteria can identify strong glial enhancer-AAVs. Excellent functional enhancers were derived from genome-wide peak selection across mouse and human datasets of distinct epigenetic modalities, peak selection from one mouse dataset based on peak strength, or peak selection only near marker genes. Second, screening one enhancer-AAV at a time can be efficient for the identification of useful enhancer-AAVs. Nearly half of the candidate enhancers proved to be specific for the targeted type, and this created a large and diverse library of new enhancer-AAVs that labeled astrocytes or oligodendrocytes in different ways. Third, while enhancers were identified from neocortex at the subclass level, brain-wide patterns match well to whole brain cell gene expression atlas patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. Specifically, AAV-labeled oligodendrocytes appear homogeneous across the brain, while astrocytes show prominent regional enrichments and differences in cell density. Fourth, body-wide specificity of enhancer-AAV expression can be predicted based on body-wide epigenetic datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c70">70</xref></sup>. Thus, off-target expression can be predicted and limited during the enhancer selection process, and enhancers can be identified that label different cell types throughout the body. These attributes will make enhancer-AAVs a valuable tool for precision gene therapy where only the cell population of interest is expressing the therapeutic transgene.</p>

<title>Enhancer-AAVs show diverse expression patterns</title>
<p>We tested a large collection of astrocyte-selective enhancer-AAVs and saw a diversity of expression patterns. Some astrocyte enhancer-AAVs predominantly labeled in telencephalic structures, some in MB/HB structures, and others showed sparse “Scattered” but uniform expression. Within the forebrain, we also observed multiple enhancer-AAVs that showed mutually exclusive enriched or depleted expression in dorsolateral striatum or the globus pallidus. These regional differences were reflected by region-specific astrocyte transcriptomic profiles in agreement with recent results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The GPe astrocytes express high levels of GABA uptake gene <italic>Slc6a11</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref></sup> while striatal and cortical (but not GPe) astrocytes express high levels of glutamate uptake gene <italic>Slc1a2</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c79">79</xref></sup>. This suggests that the astrocytes help selectively maintain glutamate or GABA tone depending on the local neurotransmitter balance. The functional roles of astrocytes in different brain regions will require additional experiments that this collection of enhancer-AAVs may facilitate. Similarly, it is not yet clear what produces “Scattered” astrocyte reporter expression, and the answer will await future experiments.</p>

<title>Enhancer-AAVs can be optimized to improve vector function</title>
<p>Achieving functional levels of transgene expression is critical for applying enhancer-AAV tools to learn new biology and deliver gene therapies. We show that two astrocyte enhancers could be optimized through generation of a triple concatenated core to produce significantly higher levels of transgene expression without sacrificing astrocyte specificity. One such optimized tool was used to detect acetylcholine activity in the NAc. The NAc has been implicated in reward-related reinforcement learning and receives inputs from dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, in addition to local cholinergic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c80">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c83">83</xref></sup>. We used enhancer-AAVs to deliver the acetylcholine indicator iAChSnFR to astrocytes within the NAc, and measured dynamics with fiber photometry. This experiment showed that the astrocyte enhancer AiE0390m_3xC2 maintained faithful astrocyte specificity after direct injection into NAc and expressed sufficient iAChSnFR for sensing of acetylcholine in live awake animals. It also showed that iAChSnFR expressed by astrocytes could readily detect acetylcholine dynamics in NAc, and that astrocytes are a good cellular compartment for the sensor.</p>
<p>Different optimization efforts enabled the generation of a functional Cre-AAV that was specific for astrocytes in most parts of the brain. Cre recombinases can lose specificity when expressed from enhancer-AAVs, possibly due to low-level expression of this potent enzyme<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>. We were able to successfully generate an astrocyte-selective Cre AAV using an attenuated Cre recombinase with the R297T mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c74">74</xref></sup>, in combination with the AiE0390m_3xC2 enhancer. As a result we produced a highly specific somatic astrocyte Cre. Similarly we were able to produce a highly specific oligodendrocyte Cre AAV using the AiE0410m enhancer along with miR126 binding sites. We anticipate these vectors may unlock many types of functional experiments dissecting the roles of these important glial cell populations.</p>

<title>Enhancers-AAVs can be identified that have conserved specificity from mouse to macaque</title>
<p>Some astrocyte and oligodendrocyte enhancer-AAVs are active and selective across species from mouse through macaque. This property will allow these tools to be applied somatically in multiple organisms besides mice. Testing enhancers in macaques revealed interesting morphological differences compared to mouse. Abundant mature oligodendrocytes with large dendritic arbors were labeled in both mouse and primate tissues with AiE0410m, but this enhancer-AAV also labeled <italic>SOX10</italic>+ cells wrapping around radial tubes (presumably blood vessels) in primate but not mouse. Also, the astrocyte enhancer AiE0390m labeled abundant protoplasmic astrocytes in the gray matter in mouse and macaque, but also labeled several large fibrous astrocytes that were not observed in the mouse experiments. The ability to function across species and label cells that are not obviously represented in mouse tissue, makes this collection of enhancer-AAVs a powerful toolset to better understand new biology. It also makes a compelling case that some of these enhancer-AAVs could be suitable for use in human gene therapy where astrocyte or oligodendrocyte expression selectivity is required.</p>

<sec id="s3e">
<title>Enhancer-AAVs can be cell state-independent</title>
<p>AAVs that drive expression using promoters can cause gene expression changes in a state dependent fashion. We showed that the <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter changed expression strength and specificity in the context of epilepsy-induced gliosis using an <italic>Scn1a</italic> haploinsufficiency model. This is not surprising since the <italic>GFAP</italic> gene is known to change in response to disease and injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. Additionally, <italic>GFAP</italic> promoter-driven expression changed specificity from astrocytes to neurons with the difficult transgene NeuroD1-mCherry, as seen in other reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>. Enhancer-AAVs utilizing AiE0390m, on the other hand, did not show a change of expression in either epileptic gliosis conditions or due to differing transgenes. This could be due to the enhancer being selected based on core cell type identity, and most properties of cell types have not been seen to change character dramatically in the context of disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c84">84</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c85">85</xref></sup>. Enhancers can be selected that do not change activity during development, aging, or disease, in a similar way to avoid selecting enhancers predicted to have activity in off-target tissues. As epigenetic datasets are expanding to cover these axes of disease, development, and aging, it is becoming feasible to select only putative enhancers with the desired activity profiles.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We have characterized a large collection of enhancer-AAV vectors for targeting astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. These vectors will provide researchers with the ability to mark and manipulate these critical cell types in a variety of species, genetic backgrounds, ages, and disease contexts, and could also enable delivery of therapeutics.

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="s4a">
<title>Epigenetic analysis and enhancer nomination</title>
<p>We identified candidate astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific enhancers from cortical epigenetic datasets. We used the following datasets: human middle temporal gyrus snATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, mouse primary visual cortex scATAC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, human frontal cortex snmC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, mouse frontal cortex snmC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, human frontal cortex bulk mC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>, and mouse frontal cortex bulk mC-seq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup>. A single cell glial snmC-seq dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">54</xref></sup> became available only after initial identification of most of the enhancers described in this study. From the single nucleus/cell ATAC-seq datasets, we aggregated reads according to cell subclass as in the references, and then called peaks using Homer findPeaks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/</ext-link>) with the -region flag, yielding typically tens of thousands of peaks per subclass, sized approximately 300-600 bp, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>. To find differentially methylated regions (DMRs) we either used the published regions by Luo et al. 2017 in Extended Data Tables 5 and 6<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and aggregated by subclass and then to all neurons using bedtools merge (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>). Alternatively for bulk non-neuronal DMRs we used methylpy DMRfind with minimum differentially methylated sites set to 1 on the dataset of Lister 2013, as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>. To convert mouse and human peak or DMR regions to each other’s genomic coordinates for direct intersectional analysis, we used liftOver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver">https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver</ext-link>) with minMatch parameter set to 0.6. All peak regions described in this manuscript successfully liftOver from human to mouse, and vice-versa, except AiE0733m which does not have an obvious human ortholog via liftOver.</p>
<p>To automatically identify peaks and DMRs genome-wide that are astrocyte- or oligodendrocyte-specific within each dataset, we used a series of bedtools intersectBed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</ext-link>) operations to filter for regions that are only detected in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. For the “high specificity” criteria, we found peaks that were specifically detected in both human and mouse cortical astrocytes/oligodendrocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, but did not overlap DMRs from either human or mouse neurons of any subclass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">52</xref></sup>, and these candidate enhancers are marked by gold square icons in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. These criteria yielded a set of 87 candidate astrocyte-specific enhancers and 112 candidate oligodendrocyte-specific enhancers, and the top 17 (Astrocyte) or 16 (Oligodendrocyte) candidate enhancers were chosen from this list as ranked by Homer findPeaks score. Homer findPeaks score is a measure of peak significance relative to local background, not peak strength. Additionally, a small number of these “high specificity” criteria candidate enhancers also overlapped with DMRs from both human and mouse non-neuronal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref></sup> (3 Astrocyte and 4 Oligodendrocyte), and these are marked by gold star icons in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p>
<p>For the “high strength” criteria we found peaks that were specifically detectable in cortical astrocytes, using mouse scATAC-seq data only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, and agnostic to detection in human and methylation datasets. This analysis yielded 2119 (astrocyte) and 3940 (oligodendrocyte) candidate enhancers, which were ranked by read counts within the region, and the top 7 candidate enhancers for astrocytes from this list were chosen. This ranking led to nomination of peaks that are overall stronger and longer, and these candidate enhancers are marked with a purple triangle in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>, but accessibility profiles were not always conserved in human tissue, as shown in <xref rid="fig1s1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>.</p>
<p>Some candidate enhancers were identified manually in the vicinity of known astrocyte or oligodendrocyte marker genes by visual inspection of ATAC-seq read pileups on UCSC browser (marked as “<italic>M”</italic> for Marker genes in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>). Methylation data was not visualized in this manual nomination process. Importantly we found that both automatic and manual approaches can identify peaks with high strength and specificity, as shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D-E</xref>.</p>
<p>Additionally, enhancer AiE2160m was initially identified as a candidate enhancer for pericytes in cortex using the data of Graybuck et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>, but it was found in the course of this study to instead label mid/hindbrain astrocytes.</p>
<p>To model enhancer screening results as a generalized linear model, we confined analysis to 50 screened enhancers where we observed a clear yes/no screening result for both itself and its cross-species ortholog. These candidate enhancers were AiE0371, 372, 373, 375, 377, 379, 380, 382, 383, 384, 388, 393, 394, 398, 399, 401, 406, 407, 408, 374, 376, 390, 395, 409, and 410, both the m and h orthologs for each. For each of these genomic regions we calculated candidate enhancer strength (read CPM within either astrocytes or oligodendrocytes), candidate enhancer specificity (defined as the proportion of astrocyte or oligodendrocyte enhancer strength relative to the summed strength in all populations, using the data of Mich et al. or Graybuck and Daigle et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup>), candidate enhancer length in base pairs, region-segmented PhyloP using the previous method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup>, and tabulated whether each candidate enhancer’s partner ortholog worked (binary yes [1] or no [0]). We fit a logistic generalized linear model of testing results from these predictors using <monospace>glm()</monospace> in R with the following command:
<monospace>glm (Screen_result_01 ∼ Length + PhyloP + Specificity + Strength_cpm + Ortholog_result_01, family=binomial(link=’logit’), data = data)</monospace></p>
<p>The significance of each coefficient to predict the screening result was determined from the coefficients of the model, using the data as provided in <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>. Although high peak specificity and strength were important criteria for candidate enhancer identification, these metrics each had little predictive power to explain success or failure of screening collection testing as evidenced by coefficients of fit to a logistic linear model (<xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>; strength z-value = 1.43, <italic>p</italic> = 0.15; specificity [defined as proportional strength within target cell subclass] z-value = -1.20, <italic>p</italic> = 0.23), similar to enhancer length (z-value = -0.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.89), enhancer sequence conservation measured by PhyloP (z-value = 0.87, <italic>p</italic> = 0.38), and the presence of a functional ortholog in testing (z-value = 1.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.077), which suggests that there are additional undiscovered elements that determine successes versus failures in AAV-based enhancer screening. Overall, the null deviance was 67.3 on 49 degrees of freedom, and the residual deviance was 57.7 on 44 degrees of freedom, again indicating little power of these features to predict the screening results.</p>

<title>Cloning and packaging enhancer-AAVs</title>
<p>With candidate enhancers chosen, we next found their predicted DNA sequence from genomic reference sequence using Bioconductor package Bsgenome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c86">86</xref></sup>. We extracted the sequence and padded 50 bp to each side of the enhancer to provide room for forward and reverse primer binding sites that capture the entire enhancer. From these padded sequences, we used automatic primer design in Geneious to identify primer pairs within the 50 bp pads to specifically amplify each enhancer, and append a constant 5’ homology arm to each enhancer for automatic Gibson assembly into reporter-AAV plasmid. We amplified the regions from C57Bl/6 tail snip DNA or from human male genomic DNA (Promega catalog # G1471) using FastPhusion 2x Master Mix (Thermo Fisher catalog # F548L), and &gt;90% of the PCR reactions were successful on the first try. In some cases we redesigned primers to attempt a second amplification.</p>
<p>We cloned into reporter backbone CN1244 (Addgene plasmid #163493) using the sites MluI/SacI and the 5’ primer homology arms F: TTCCTGCGGCCGCACGCGT and R: GACTTTTATGCCCAGCCCGAGCTC, using Infusion kit (Takara catalog # 638949). For some enhancers we instead cloned into a next generation reporter vector backbone that includes a SYFP2-P2A-3xFLAG-H2B reporter for detection of cytosolic SYFP2 and nuclear FLAG for simultaneous expression analysis and snRNA-seq, using the same cut sites and homology arms (see <xref rid="tbls1" ref-type="table">Table S1</xref>). We transformed infusion reactions into Mix N’ Go (Zymo Research catalog # T3001) chemically competent Stbl3 E. coli (Thermo Fisher catalog # C737303) and selected on 100 µg/mL carbenicillin plates. We cultured individual clones at 32 C, verified them by Sanger sequencing, maxiprepped them with 100 µg/mL ampicillin, and saved them as frozen glycerol stocks at -80°C.</p>
<p>We used maxiprep DNA for packaging into PHP.eB AAV particles. For routine enhancer-AAV screening by intravenous delivery in mouse we generated small-scale crude AAV preps by transfecting 15 µg maxiprep enhancer-reporter DNA,15 µg PHP.eB cap plasmid, and 30 µg pHelper plasmid into one 15-cm dish of confluent HEK-293T cells using PEI-Max (Polysciences Inc. catalog # 24765-1). After transfection the next day we changed the medium to 1% FBS, and after 5 days the cells and supernatant were collected, freeze-thawed 3x to release AAV particles, treated with benzonase (1 µL) for 1 hr to degrade free DNA, then clarified (3000g 10min) and then concentrated to approximately 150 µL by using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit at 5000g for 30-60 min (NMWL 100 kDa, Sigma #Z740210-24EA), yielding a titer of approximately 3-5 E13 genome copies (gc)/mL. For large-scale gradient preps for intraparenchymal injection into macaque or mouse or ICV injection into rat, we transfected 10 15-cm plates of cells, and also purified preps by iodixanol gradient centrifugation. We assessed viral titer for both crude and gradient AAV preps by digital droplet PCR on a BioRad QX200 system. All vectors showing specific expression patterns are available through Addgene.</p>

<title>Optimizing enhancer strength through concatemerization</title>
<p>For some native enhancers that showed specific expression patterns, we sought to boost their expression levels through concatemerization. To concatemerize, we segmented the enhancer (typically approximately 400-600 bp) into approximately thirds with approximately 25 bp of overlaps at the junctions (each a candidate “core” of approximately 200 bp), then designed a tandem array of three cores in series (approximately 600 bp). These synthetic tandem array sequences were gene synthesized by Azenta/GeneWiz PRIORITYGene synthesis service with flanking MluI/SacI sites for restriction enzyme digestion and ligation into corresponding sites in CN1244. We then packaged and tested concatemerized PHP.eB enhancer-AAVs as above.</p>

<title>Mice and injections</title>
<p>All mouse experimentation was approved by Allen Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as part of protocol #2020-2002. In these studies, we purchased C57Bl/6J mice from The Jackson Laboratory (Stock # 000664). For enhancer screening these C57Bl/6J mice were injected with AAVs in the retro-orbital sinus at age P21 with 5E11 genome copies of AAV/PHP.eB viral vectors with brief isoflurane anesthesia. For enhancer validation studies (IHC) mice were injected the same way but between ages P42 to P56. Tissues from mice were harvested at 3 to 4 weeks post injection for analysis, except in the case of the NeuroD1-mCherry experiments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F</xref>) where mice were analyzed at 17 days post injection as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">44</xref></sup>, and in the liver experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6C</xref>) in which 1-2 mice for each vector were analyzed at 3 weeks and 1-2 mice were analyzed at 36 weeks to confirm durability across age. We perfused animals with saline then 4%PFA in PBS, and harvested brains or other tissues and post-fixed in 4%PFA overnight, before rinsing and cryoprotecting in 30% sucrose solution before sectioning at 30 micron thickness on sliding microtome with a freezing stage. PFA used in these experiments was prepared by dissolving solid PFA (VWR Chemicals #28794.295) in PBS by heating, which was then stored in frozen aliquots. For enhancer screening we counterstained with DAPI and propidium iodide and mounted in Vectashield Vybrance, and imaged on either a Nikon Ti-Eclipse or Nikon Ti-Eclipse 2 epifluorescent microscope, Olympus FV-3000 confocal microscope, or Leica Aperio slide scanner. In some experiments where noted, we tested enhancer-AAVs after bilateral intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection at age P2 using the technique of Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c87">87</xref></sup> These ICV-injected pups were harvested for tissue analysis at age P21.

<p>For testing in Dravet syndrome model mice, 129S1/SvImJ-<italic>Scn1a<sup>em1Dsf/J</sup></italic>mice (strain # 034129) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and bred to C57Bl/6J mice to create <italic>Scn1a<sup>R613X/+</sup></italic> pups on a F1 hybrid C57Bl/6J:129S1/SvImJ background, and these pups were injected retro-orbitally at P21 with tissue analysis at P42.

<title>Mouse immunohistochemistry (IHC)</title>
<p>For IHC and ISH, we transcardially perfused mice with ice-cold 25 mL HBSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 14175079) containing 0.25 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific # AM9260G), followed by 12 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS, freshly prepared from 16% PFA (Electron Microscopy Sciences #15710). We dissected brains and other tissues from carcasses and post-fixed them at 4 degrees overnight, and the next morning we rinsed the tissues with fresh PBS, and then transferred to 30% sucrose solution in PBS for cryoprotection. For sectioning on Leica CM3050 cryostat, we then embedded tissues in OCT cryo-compound (Tissue-Tek # 4583) at room temperature at least 3 hours, then froze the blocks on dry ice and stored at -80°C until sectioning at 25 micron thickness. Alternatively, we sectioned half-brains at 25 µm thickness on frozen 30% sucrose solution slabs on a sliding microtome (Leica SM2000R) equipped with freezing stage. Sections were stored at 4 degrees in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide until analysis. IHC of liver was performed as for brain, focusing on the frontal lobe.</p>
<p>For IHC we used the following antibodies: chicken anti-GFP (Aves # GFP-1010, 1/3000), rabbit anti-Sox9 (Cell Signaling clone D8G8H, # 82630S), mouse CC1 antibody (Abcam # ab16794, 1/1000), mouse anti-GFAP (Millipore Sigma clone G-A-5, # G3893, 1/1000), with 5% normal goat serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific # 31872) and 0.1% Triton X-100 (VWR 97062-208) for blocking and permeabilization, and appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for detection.</p>

<title>Flow cytometry and single cell transcriptomics</title>
<p>We prepared cell suspensions for flow cytometry and single cell RNA-seq from brain tissue as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>. Briefly, for flow cytometry, we perfused mice transcardially under anesthesia with ACSF.1. We harvested the brains, embedded in 2% agarose in PBS, then sliced thick 350 micron sections using a compresstome with blockface imaging, then picked the sections containing the region of interest (VISp, or mid- and hindbrain, or cerebellar cortex), and dissected out the regions of interest. We then treated dissected tissues with 30U/mL papain (Worthington LK003176) in ACSF.1 containing 30% trehalose (ACSF.1T) in a dry oven at 35°C for 30 minutes. After papain treatment we quenched digestion with ACSF.1T containing 0.2% BSA, triturated sequentially using fire-polished glass pipettes with 600, 300, and 150 micron bores, filtered the released cell suspensions into ACSF.1T containing 1% BSA, centrifuged cells at 100g for 10 min, then resuspended cells in ACSF.1T containing 0.2% BSA and 1 μg/mL DAPI prior to flow cytometry and sorting on a FACSAria III (Becton-Dickinson). SYFP2 reporter brightness was measured as the ratio of positive cell population mean fluorescence intensity, divided by the low mean fluorescence intensity of autofluorescence in non-expressing cells. This measure of reporter brightness is more consistent than positive cell population mean fluorescence intensity alone, due to differences in raw signal across days, cytometers, and cytometer settings.</p>
<p>For single cell RNA-seq, we sorted single SYFP2+ cells into tubes and processed them via SMARTer v4 using the workflow described previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>, on 47 enhancer-AAV-injected mice. In each experiment from one mouse injected with one single enhancer-AAV we sorted and profiled up to 48 cells per experiment, and each measurement was taken from a distinct individual cell. After retroorbital injections, enhancer-AAV SYFP2-expressing cells consisted of on average 7% of the positive brain cells (range 0.1-20.1% of cells, n = 47 experiments). We sequenced single cell-derived SMARTer libraries at 659996 ± 199038 (mean ± standard deviation) reads per library on an Illumina NovaSeq instrument at Broad Institute (Cambridge, MA) or on an Illumina NextSeq instrument at Allen Institute (Seattle, WA). We aligned the libraries to mm10 genome using STAR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR</ext-link>), and also aligned them to the synthetic AAV transgene reference construct using bowtie2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml">https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml</ext-link>). From 2040 initial cells, we excluded from analysis the libraries with poor library quality metrics, consisting of: firstly low-quantity or degraded libraries (judged as less than 65% percentage of cDNA library sized greater than 400 bp, consisting of 71 [3.4%] libraries in this study), and secondly those that lacked AAV transgene-mapping reads (likely mis-sorted events, 23 [1.1%] of remaining libraries). Applying these filtering criteria yielded a dataset for analysis of 1946 high-quality AAV transgene-expressing cells, with alignment rates of 92 ± 3% to mm10 genome and 4654 ± 1285 genes detected per cell (mean ± standard deviation). To assess enhancer specificity within the cortex we mapped the high quality transgene-expressing SMARTer cells to the SMARTer-based VISp cellular taxonomy generated by Tasic et al. using bootstrapped hierarchical approximate nearest neighbor mapping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup>, and quantified the specificity as the percentage of positively sorted cells that mapped to the expected cell subclass (astrocytes or oligodendrocytes). To test for significance of correlation of brightness by flow cytometry with expression levels by scRNA-seq, we calculated Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient by <monospace>cor.test()</monospace> function in R.</p>
<p>To understand different characteristics of different regional astrocyte populations we utilized scrattch.mapping (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/AllenInstitute/scrattch">https://github.com/AllenInstitute/scrattch</ext-link>) from the Allen Institute. To accomplish this we first transformed these cells by principal component analysis and performed UMAP dimensionality reduction on the first 40 principal components for visualization using the default scanpy parameters, which clearly separated oligodendrocytes and regional groupings of astrocytes. For clustering astrocytes we subset the dataset to astrocytes only, then identified the top 2000 genes ranked by variance among them, recomputed UMAP projections from these high-variance genes, then performed Leiden clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c90">90</xref></sup> which identified VISp, MB/HB, and CBX astrocyte clusters as expected, and finally identified differential genes among them (differential gene expression threshold false discovery rate less than 5% and log2-fold change greater than 0.5) using scanpy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</ext-link>). In doing so we detected two major subgroups of VISp astrocytes that are distinguished by presence or absence of immediate-early gene markers (for example, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Fosl2</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, <italic>Irs2</italic>, <italic>Pde10a</italic>, and <italic>Pde7b</italic>). This distinction may be an artifact of the cell dissociation process for scRNA-seq; for the purposes of this study we collapse these cortical astrocyte clusters. In order to understand the different regional characteristics of astrocyte populations we mapped cells to whole brain taxonomy we mapped to the best-correlated mean-aggregated taxonomic cluster from the ABC-WMB atlas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> with 100 bootstrapped iterations using the top 10% of high-variance genes and omitting a variable number of genes (10-50%) each round. We interpret the frequency of correct mapping rounds as the mapping confidence. We also used CELLxGENE for single cell visualization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene">https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene</ext-link>). Spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed as described in the recent whole brain transcriptomic taxonomy study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, and cell type location data was visualized using Cirrocumulus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cirrocumulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">https://cirrocumulus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html</ext-link>).</p>
<p>For determination of <italic>Zic5</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> differential gene expression between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, we used two-sided ANOVA on expression measurements from individually profiled cells from all the experiments with no exclusion, and no covariates were tested. Testing for normality by the Shapiro-Wilk test revealed that <italic>Zic5</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> expression are not normally distributed (<italic>Zic5</italic> W = 0.539, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16; <italic>Sox10</italic> W = 0.958, p-value = 5.1e-16), so we used a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test. No significance thresholds adjustments were made for multiple comparisons since only one comparison was performed. For the comparison of <italic>Sox10</italic> versus <italic>Zic5</italic> expression (mean counts per million +/-standard deviation, n cells): astrocyte <italic>Zic5</italic> expression 32 ± 71, n = 864; astrocyte <italic>Sox10</italic> expression 0.3 ± 5, n = 864; oligodendrocyte <italic>Zic5</italic> expression 0.6 ± 6, n = 964, oligodendrocyte <italic>Sox10</italic> expression 456 ± 276, n = 964.</p>

<title>Motif analysis</title>
<p>We performed de novo motif discovery from the sets of astrocyte and oligodendrocyte enhancers that showed specific and strong expression patterns, excluding those enhancers scored as weak. For astrocytes this list consisted of: AiE0375m, AiE0376h, AiE0376m, AiE0377m, AiE0380h, AiE0381h, AiE0385h, AiE0385m, AiE0380h, AiE0390h, AiE0390m, AiE2120m, AiE2122m, AiE2160m, and ProB12. For oligodendrocytes this list consisted of: AiE0361h, AiE0395h, AiE0395m, AiE0396h, AiE0397m, AiE0398h, AiE0400m, AiE0401h, AiE0403h, AiE0407h, AiE0409h, AiE0409m, AiE0410h, AiE0410m, and AiE0641m. We used MEME-CHIP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> to identify recurrent de novo motifs in these sets of sequences, using the parameter-meme-maxw 12, and comparing to a background set of random sequence with the same nucleotide content. This analysis revealed one strong motif in each set of sequences, as measured by its E-value, which is an estimate of the number of motifs expected by chance to have as strong a log likelihood ratio as itself within the given sequences. These de novo motifs where then mapped to known sequences using TomTom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">61</xref></sup> which revealed several possible matches to known motifs at significant p-values, but the strongest motif match (lowest p-value) in each case is shown. In the case of the Zic family transcription factors, for simplicity we averaged together the highly correlated strongest hits in the Zic family (JASPAR accession numbers MA0697.2, MA1628.1, and MA1629.1 covering Zic1, Zic2, and Zic3), since Zic5 itself is not present in databases. In the case of Sox10, the highly correlated Sox family members Sox4 and Sox11 (Uniprobe accession numbers UP00062.1 and UP00030.1) showed slightly stronger motif match p-values than Sox10 (JASPAR accession number MA0442.1), but these were excluded from analysis due to lack of expression in almost all oligodendrocytes as observed by Tasic et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c89">89</xref></sup> and in this study.</p>

<title>Enhancer-AAV testing in rat</title>
<p>The Allen Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved the following in vivo testing experiments in rat under protocol 2010. We procured timed-pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats from Charles River laboratories. We tattooed and injected ice-anesthetized neonatal pups at P1 with 1.5e11 viral genomes of enhancer-AAV virus, diluted with PBS to a total volume of 10 µL, unilaterally into the forebrain lateral ventricle (ICV delivery) with a 31-gauge, 4 point, 12° bevel 1 inch needle (custom ordered from Hamilton) and 25 µL capacity removable needle syringe (Hamilton, 7636-01). Between injections we washed the needle and syringe with 100% ethanol, and then nuclease-free water. We targeted the ICV space at 2 mm posterior to bregma, 2 mm lateral to the anterior-posterior midline, and at a depth of 2 mm perpendicular to the surface of the skull. We injected into the ventricle slowly over approximately 30 seconds. After injection, we held the needle in place for approximately 10 seconds to prevent viral leakage, then slowly withdrew the needle at the same relative angle as injection and then placed the animal onto a prewarmed heating pad in a clean cage. We sacrificed pups at 18 days post injection, prior to weaning, and transcardially perfused with 1X PBS and then 4% PFA in PBS. We hemisected each brain and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in deionized water for a minimum of 24 hours before sectioning. We sectioned each brain at 30 µm thickness using a sliding microtome (Leica part number SM2000R) on a leveled mount of Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound, collecting 3 sagittal planes separated by approximately 500 µm. We counterstained sections with 1 µg/mL DAPI and 2.5 µg/mL propidium iodide (Thermo catalog # P1304MP) overnight at 4°C and mounted in Vectashield HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories # H-1400-10) prior to imaging by epifluorescence.</p>

<title>Macaque enhancer-AAV testing</title>
<p><italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic> (pig-tailed macaque) animals were housed and injected at the Washington National Primate Center according to NIH guidelines and as approved by the University of Washington Animal Care and Use Committee under UW IACUC protocol #41-6701. These animals received several intraparenchymal injections under general anesthesia at spatially distinct sites located at least ∼1cm apart throughout the brain. During injection, over the course of 10 minutes we expelled a total of approximately 1e11 gc iodixanol gradient-purified PHP.eB-packaged viral vectors in a total volume of 5 µL at 10 depths ranging from 200 to 2000 microns deep in the animals. After injection the animal rested for 10 minutes between injections. These numbers are approximate and timing, volume, and depths may be adjusted according to animal anatomy and surgical considerations. The experiments described here result from four injection sites in three <italic>Macaca nemestrina</italic> animals (two males, one female). We harvested tissue from these animals after necropsy at 38, 47, and 113 days post injection.</p>
<p>After locating the injection sites and cutting out tissue blocks about 1-2cm on each side surrounding the injection sites, we fixed these tissue blocks in 4% PFA for 24 hrs. Then we rinsed the blocks with PBS, cut 350 µm thick slices on the sliding microtome, and postfixed the slices in 4% PFA for 2 hours at room temperature (RT), and then washed three times in PBS for 10 min each. For ISH analysis using HCR we transferred slices to 70% EtOH at 4°C for a minimum of 12 hours, and up to 30 days. To stain we first incubated the slices in 8% SDS in PBS at RT for two hours with agitation, then washed the slices at RT with 5X sodium chloride sodium citrate (SSC) for three hours, exchanging with fresh 5X SSC every hour. Next we performed HCR v3.0 using reagents and a modified protocol from Molecular Technologies and Molecular Instruments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c91">91</xref></sup>. We first incubated slices in pre-warmed 30% probe hybridization buffer (30% formamide, 5X sodium chloride sodium citrate (SSC), 9 mM citric acid pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 µg/mL heparin, 1X Denhardt’s solution, 10% dextran sulfate) at 37°C for 5 min. Then we exchanged hybridization buffer for hybridization buffer containing probes added at a concentration of 2 nM. Molecular Instruments designed the probes using the following accession numbers: SLC17A7 – XM_011768126.1, GAD1 – XM_011744029.1, FGFR3 – XM_011744842.2, SOX10 – XM_011712410.2. Hybridization proceeded overnight at 37°C, and afterwards we washed the tissue thrice with 5X SSC for 10 minutes each (total 30 minutes), then 30% probe wash buffer (30% formamide, 5X SSC, 9 mM citric acid pH 6.0, 0.1% Tween 20, 50 µg/mL heparin) for one hour at 37°C. Then we exchanged probe wash buffer with 5X SSC, then amplification buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% dextran sulfate) for 5 min at room temperature. Meanwhile we pooled even and odd amplification hairpins for each of the three genes and snap-cooled them by heating to 95°C for 90 seconds then cooling to room temperature for 30 min, and afterwards we added the snap-cooled hairpins to amplification buffer at a final concentration of 60 nM, and finally centrifuged at 18000g for 1 minute. Then we incubated tissue slices in amplification solution containing amplification hairpins for 4 hours at room temperature, followed by staining in DAPI (10µg/mL in 2X SSC) for 1 hour at room temperature, and finally washing twice for 30 min in 2X SSC at room temperature before imaging. We prepared a fresh aliquot of 67% 2,2’-Thiodiethanol (TDE) solution for use as a clearing and immersion fluid by mixing ≥99% TDE (Sigma-Aldrich) with deionized water to create a 67% TDE solution with a refractive index of 1.46. We transferred slices to 67% TDE and allowed them to equilibrate for at least 1 hour at room temperature prior to imaging on a confocal microscope (Olympus FV-3000). For IHC analysis of injected NHP tissue we subsectioned 350 µm thick slices to 30 µm and stained as for mouse tissue.</p>

<title>Stereotaxic injection and fiber implant surgery</title>
<p>Virus injection and optic fiber implantation surgery was performed in C57BL/6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, #000664) at around P60. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and monitored throughout the surgery using breathing rate and tail pinch. The skin above the skull surface was removed to make room for the fiber implant and headframe. After leveling the skull, a craniotomy was drilled above the injection and fiber coordinates (AP: 1.2 mm, ML: - 1.3 mm, DV: 4.1 mm). First, a glass pipette positioned at the injection coordinates was lowered through the craniotomy and virus injection was performed (100 nl, titer: 4e13 gc/mL). Once the injection was complete, the pipette was slowly raised, and the optic fiber probe was positioned at the same AP and ML coordinates as the injection. The tip of the fiber was then lowered to 100 μm above the injection site and glued in place where the base of the fiber ferrule contacts the skull. A custom headframe was then glued to the skull to allow head-fixed behavior and imaging. After surgery, the mouse was returned to the home cage and allowed to recover for at least two weeks prior to start of water restriction for behavior and imaging.</p>

<title>Dynamic foraging reinforcement learning task</title>
<p>Water-restricted and head-restrained mice were trained to perform a reinforcement learning task where they freely choose between two lick ports that delivered a water reward with nonstationary probabilities. This is a variation on the task described in Bari et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c92">92</xref></sup>. The base reward probability of both lick ports summed to 0.6 where the probabilities of the two lick ports were selected from two sets of ratios (0.53/0.07, 0.51/0.09). Block lengths that corresponded to each ratio lasted for about 30 trials (min trials per block: 40, max trials per block: 60). Each trial began with an auditory “go cue” that signaled the start of a trial. The mouse was free to choose between the left or right lick port immediately after the “go cue”. The trials were separated by a variable inter-trial-interval (range between 1-7 seconds). The data shown in this study was from a two-hour behavior session that consisted of 438 trials (170 rewarded trials).</p>

<title>Fiber photometry and analysis</title>
<p>Fiber photometry was performed using a commercially available photometry system (Neurophotometrics LLC, FP3002). A 470 nm LED was used to excite the iAChSnFR fluorophore, Venus, and the emitted fluorescence signals were collected using a CMOS camera. The 470 nm excitation was interleaved with a 415 nm LED as an isosbestic control to remove motion artifacts. Bonsai acquisition software was used to record the photometry signals as well as the behavior trigger signals events (go-cue, left and/or right lick choices, reward/no reward) for offline alignment of imaging data to behavioral events. Prior to start of acquisition, an ROI was drawn over the fiber image seen on the camera, and fluorescence intensity within this ROI was averaged for real-time signal visualization and offline analysis. First, the fiber photometry acquisition was started, following which the behavior task was initialized. Photometry signals were analyzed using custom python scripts. First, the fluorescence signal was detrended for photobleaching using a fourth order polynomial function and then corrected for motion using the control signal from the 415 nm excitation using standard photometry analysis techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c93">93</xref></sup>. Acetylcholine signal changes were calculated as a change in fluorescence intensity over the mean fluorescence (ΔF/F as a percentage). The photometry signals were then aligned to behavior events using simultaneously acquired TTL readouts of behavior events (go-cue, left and/or right lick choices, reward/no reward) using a NI USB card. These behavior events were then used to calculate trial averaged traces of rewarded and unrewarded signals.</p>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> study presents <bold>convincing</bold> findings on creating an exhaustive library of new enhancer-AAVs targeting astrocytes and oligodendrocytes with high potential for both basic and translational work, which will be of value to a large and growing community. However, the outdated description of glial biology in the Introduction, the overstated claims of utility in the Conclusion, and the loose stringency in the criteria used to assemble the library diminish the strengths of the claims. The work will be of interest to neuroscientists working on glial cell biology.</p>

<p>The goal of this study was to generate a library of new enhancer-driven AAVs in order to selectively and efficiently target astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in rodents. The implied criteria are that such viral vectors should have high specificity for the intended cell type and effectively express in all astrocytes/oligos in the brain or, alternatively, be specific for defined brain regions, layers, or subtypes of astrocytes/oligos. In addition, they should be compatible with intravenous retro-orbital delivery to facilitate experimentation and brain-wide targeting (i.e., show organ specificity and high efficiency in the brain). Ideally, these new AAVs would also maintain their characteristics across disease contexts and show applicability in non-human primates. Tools with such characteristics are generally lacking in studying glial cells and would be extremely useful to scale up and accelerate glial research, allowing targeting of astrocytes/oligos with distinct molecular identity and intersectional strategies.</p>
<p>At present, however, none of the enhancer-AAVs presented in the study seems to meet this combination of criteria, at least not with the level of stringency typically expected in the field. The main reason is that, in its current form, the study does not present one candidate AAV iteratively improved to meet all these criteria; instead, it presents a catalogue of new AAVs with various degrees of specificity, completeness, and mixed characteristics. Therefore, their utility should be interpreted cautiously. Moreover, the way specificity and completeness are intermixed in the analysis makes it difficult to evaluate the actual utility of any given AAV. The study might have been strengthened by focusing on a small set of the most promising candidates (i.e., AiE0890m_3x2C) and validating them thoroughly for expression specificity, completeness, effective cargo expression, ability to allow specific pan-astrocyte or astrocyte-subtype targeting in vivo, and preserved properties in NHPs and in disease, as this would encourage their adoption by the community. Currently, too many AAVs are assessed inconsistently against the desired criteria, with none being evaluated through and through.</p>
<p>The impact of the catalogue is also greatly diminished by the fact that a suite of AAVs with outstanding specificity and efficiency is already available for the study of astrocytes (e.g., 4x6T AAVs) and was not utilized as a standard to benchmark the new library, making it difficult to appreciate the relative benefits of the new AAVs. The inclusion of expression data in NHPs is very significant, but benchmarking against established AAVs would also be needed to fully appreciate their value.</p>
<p>Importantly, readers should also be aware that the study seems noticeably limited in its literacy with glial biology. The introduction and discussion frame the field in a way that seems outdated, creating the impression that the diverse roles of glia in health and disease have not yet been studied, which may inadvertently be perceived as dismissive and stigmatizing.</p>
<p>In summary, the paper introduces potentially useful viral tools and lays the foundations for future multiplexed targeting of distinct glial cell subpopulations in rodents and in non-human primates, which are extremely important directions. Some of the regionally restricted or even sparsely expressed AAVs may prove valuable in enabling subpopulation-specific targeting or molecular profiling strategies, but currently lack full benchmarking. At present, the promises over the utility of the new tools seem overstated, and the library may not yet represent an actionable resource for targeting astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.</p>

<p>Enhancer elements are regulatory DNA sequences that are capable of driving specific expression patterns. As these elements are generally short and context-independent, enhancers can be used in expression vectors (e.g., packaged in an adeno-associated virus, AAV) to limit expression to target cell populations. This approach was identified as a major strategy for cell-type-specific manipulation in the brain and has been pursued by both standard research studies as well as large-scale efforts led by the BRAIN Initiative. This manuscript describes a major effort to generate enhancer-AAVs targeting astrocytes and oligodendrocytes orchestrated by a large research team led by the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This manuscript parallels other recent publications describing sets of enhancer-AAVs, following rigorous, similar methods with relatively broad testing and application.</p>
<p>To identify and screen candidate enhancers, the scientists prioritized candidates via analysis of single-nucleus accessibility and methylation datasets (i.e., snATAC-seq) and tested them in mice. The scientists prioritized candidate enhancers that exhibited specificity of accessibility in the target cell type. Following selection, the scientists cloned the candidate sequences into AAV vectors with a minimal promoter and reporter gene, packaged the virus, delivered it to the mouse brain, and screened for activity based on reporter expression. Candidates that passed initial screening were further characterized via imaging and sorting, followed by single-cell RNA-seq. This process had around a 50% success rate and yielded 25 astrocyte and 21 oligodendrocyte enhancer-AAVs with the targeted cell-type-specific expression patterns.</p>
<p>The scientists went on to test for subtype-specific activity patterns, finding wide diversity in astrocyte activities across sub-populations and conversely, homogenous oligodendrocyte activation. They optimized a few of these via concatenating the enhancer core sequence to increase expression levels of the reporter gene and showed strong specificity and completeness of cell targeting for a set of these enhancer-AAVs. Following characterization and validation, they then deployed these enhancer-AAVs in a number of demonstration applications to show the utility for basic and translational science. All the constructs developed here are available for public use via Addgene, ensuring that these new tools can be used by other researchers.</p>
<p>There really are no obvious weaknesses in the work presented here, from the generation of the enhancer-AAVs to use in sophisticated validation studies. The enhancer-AAV testing is rigorous and provides critical information necessary for other scientists to select and use these constructs. The applications demonstrate the power of enhancer-AAV approaches. The toolbox presented here may not enable specific targeting of all relevant cellular subtypes or activity states for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and future work will be needed to fully understand the activity of the enhancers, identity of the target cell types, and context-dependent utility of these constructs. However, the set of enhancer-AAVs developed here should be transformative for researchers working on accessing and manipulating these cell types and have a major impact on the field.</p>
