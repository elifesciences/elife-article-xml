<abstract><p>Taste sensation plays a crucial role in shaping feeding behavior and is intricately influenced by internal states like hunger or satiety. Despite the identification of numerous neural substrates regulating feeding behavior, the central neural substrate that linked energy-sensing and taste sensation remained elusive. Here, we identified a novel neural circuitry that could directly sense internal energy state and modulate sweet sensation in the Drosophila brain. Specifically, a subset of neuropeptidergic neurons expressing hugin directly detected elevated levels of circulating glucose via glucose transporter Glut1 and ATP-sensitive potassium channel. Upon activation, these neurons released hugin peptide and activated downstream Allatostatin A (AstA)<sup>+</sup> neurons via its cognate receptor PK2-R1. Subsequently, the activation of AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons then directly inhibited sweet sensation via AstA peptide and its cognate receptor AstA-R1 expressed in sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons. We also showed that neuromedin U (NMU), the mammalian homolog of fly hugin, served as an energy sensor to suppress sweet sensation. Therefore, these data identify hugin<sup>+</sup> neuron as a central energy sensor responsible for regulating sweet sensation across species.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Animal behaviors are tightly associated with the internal metabolic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Munch et al., 2020</xref>). When experiencing hunger, animals exhibit behaviors aimed at obtaining food, including elevated sensitivity to appetitive cues and enhanced foraging and feeding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Augustine et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c64">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, hunger tends to increase anxiety levels and aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Rivaz et al., 2022</xref>), while inhibiting pain, sleep, and mating behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Alhadeff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Sun et al., 2023</xref>). These behavioral alterations upon hunger serve to sharpen the focus of starved animals on the tasks related to food acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Deem et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, when animals are sated, food-related behaviors diminish, redirecting their attention to other important behaviors such as reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Karigo and Deutsch, 2022</xref>). Such adjustments in behaviors help animals to fulfill various internal needs in a fast-changing environment, and also suggests the presence of neural circuitry in the brain that detects and encodes hunger and satiety states to guide individual behavioral choices and maintain metabolic homeostasis.</p>
<p>In mammals, agouti-related peptide (AgRP)- and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) are key sensors of hunger and satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Fu et al., 2019</xref>). When calories are scarce, AgRP neurons become active, promoting foraging and feeding behaviors while suppressing competing behaviors such as thirst, innate fear, anxiety-related behavior, and social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Burnett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Dietrich et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, satiety signals gradually inhibit the activity of AgRP neurons in response to food or food cues, resulting in reduced appetite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bruning and Fenselau, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Antagonistic to AgRP neurons, POMC neurons play a critical role as satiety sensors, suppressing feeding and increasing energy expenditure by releasing a α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bruning and Fenselau, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Koch et al., 2015</xref>). AgRP/POMC neuron activity is regulated by various upstream signals, including hormones like leptin, insulin, and ghrelin, as well as nutrients such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. Leptin, GLP-1, and insulin activate POMC neurons while inhibiting AgRP neurons, reducing food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Solis et al., 2024</xref>), whereas ghrelin, secreted during fasting, activates AgRP neurons to promote feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Vivot et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, AgRP and POMC neurons project to various brain regions inlcuding paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and brainstem, exerting complex regulations on behavior and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Belgardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">De Solis et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wei et al., 2018</xref>). These intertwined circuitry helps to coordinate behaviors and physiological responses in a dynamic environment. Despite the significant progress in the past decades, the direct link of these upstream internal energy sensors, such as AgRP and POMC neurons, to various behavioral outputs, remains incompletely understood. Current research highlights their central role in energy homeostasis but also suggests a complex, multi-level circuitry that modulates these behaviors. Fully elucidating the relative contributions of these neurons and circuits to behavioral and metabolic regulations is an ongoing challenge in the field.</p>
<p>Fruit flies offer an excellent system for studying satiety/hunger sensing and mapping out the complete circuitry towards behavioral consequences, owing to their simple nervous system and comprehensive genetic and neurobiological tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Hunger and satiety states modulate a range of behaviors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, including foraging, feeding, food preference, sleep, and even memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chouhan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Hungry flies tend to increase foraging, favor high-calorie food, and extend feeding durations, while satiated flies reduce food intake and shift their food preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Hunger also disrupts sleep, with starved flies becoming more alert to prioritize food-seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Willyard, 2008</xref>). A constellation of neuromodulators has been shown to steer these behavioral transitions. Dopamine navigates the feeding process by engaging reward pathways upon food detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>), whereas serotonin (5-HT) functions to quell feeding behavior during satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c61">Yao and Scott, 2022</xref>), simultaneously shaping food preferences and foraging endeavors. Neuropeptide F (NPF), akin to mammalian neuropeptide Y (NPY), is instrumental in instigating feeding bouts during periods of hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Malita et al., 2022</xref>). Hugin, bearing a resemblance to mammalian neuropeptide U, influences satiety levels and modulates food intake, regulated by gustatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Schoofs et al., 2014</xref>). Short neuropeptide F (sNPF) contributes to hunger-induced behaviors by calibrating sensory reactions to food stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Root et al., 2011</xref>). Allatostatin A (AstA) emerges as a satiety signal that, likely through interactions with sweet-sensing neurons, and suppresses feeding activities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>). CCHamide, which is associated with growth modulation, potentially acts as a hunger signal, whereas leucokinin adjusts meal size and manages the physiological aftermath of feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Corazonin is perceived to be intertwined with the modulation of stress and metabolic responses pertinent to hunger and satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kubrak et al., 2016</xref>). SIFamide is recognized for its role in translating hunger signals into both appetitive and consummatory feeding actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Martelli et al., 2017</xref>). The intricate interplay among these modulators constitutes a sophisticated regulatory network, the intricacies of which are yet to be delineated comprehensively, underscoring an exciting frontier for forthcoming research aimed at unraveling the neural circuitry that underpins energy homeostasis.</p>
<p>Sugar serves as an important source of satiety signals. The body’s precise responses to dietary sugar involve both peripheral organs and the brain, which facilitates the regulation of various behaviors, including sweet perception and food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Qi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ugrankar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). When exposed to a high-sugar diet, the midgut reacts by secreting Hedgehog (Hh) to suppress sweet sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c66">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) become sugar-sensitive in fed states, leading to the suppression of food consumption via neuropeptide diuretic hormone 44 (DH44)<sup>+</sup> neurons(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oh et al., 2021</xref>). In the brain, insulin-producing cells (IPCs) and tackykinin (TK)<sup>+</sup> neurons are also activated in the presence of sugar, contributing to appetite suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Qi et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast to satiety sensing, certain neurons, such as dopaminergic neurons, act as hunger sensors in fruit fly brains, being activated during hunger states and involved in regulation of sleep, sugar memory expression and sweet taste sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Senapati et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c65">Yurgel et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unclear how these neurons interact to form a regulatory network on energy homeostasis, especially how these neurons link the hunger/satiety state to direct behavioral outputs.</p>
<p>We aimed to dissect out a complete neural pathway that directly sensed internal energy state and modualted food-related behavioral output in the fly brain. More specifically, we focused on the circuitry mediating the effect of satiety to inhibit sweet taste sensation. Among several candidate neuropeptidergic neuron groups, we pinpointed hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons as a direct satiety sensor in the fly brain. These hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons were activated by elevated levels of circulating glucose after feeding, which in turn activated downstream AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons via the interaction of hugin peptide and its cognate receptor PK2-R1. Subsequently, AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons exerted direct inhibitory effect on sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons via AstA peptide and its receptor AstA-R1. As a result, sated flies exhibited a reduction in sweet sensitivity and hence food consumption. In summary, we unveiled a novel satiety sensing mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that detected circulating glucose and regulated sweet perception and feeding. We also showed that NMU, the mammalian homolog of hugin, was also an energy sensor in mouse models involved in regulation of sweet perception, highlighting the conserved regulatory mechanism of central energy sensing and sweet sensation across species.</p>

<title>hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons were a novel glucose sensor in the fly brain</title>
<p>Flies extend their proboscis in response to appetitive cues, a behavioral element known as the proboscis extension reflex (PER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Song et al., 2023</xref>). As previously observed, hunger significantly enhances this reflex(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, we first replicated this phenomenon: In the state of hunger, flies exhibited elevated PER towards various concentrations of sugar compared to those under fed conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A-B</xref>). These results confirmed the notion that sweet sensation was influenced by the internal energy state, elevated by starvation and suppressed by satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). Sweet sensation in flies is mediated by sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons located on the proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with the behavioral effect, we also confirmed that Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons exhibited elevated calcium responses to sugar under starvation conditions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 1A</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Dopaminergic neurons in the subesophageal zone (SEZ) region of the fly brain acted as a hunger sensor, promoting sweet sensation via a specific dopamine receptor DopEcR expressed in Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). However, although the gene knockout of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Budnik and White, 1987</xref>), a key enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis, significantly suppressed sweet sensation in starved fruit flies (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 1B</xref>), these flies still showed a further reduction in sugar-induced PER under sated conditions (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 1C-D</xref>). These results suggest the existence of dopamine-independent mechanisms for sensing satiety and hunger in fruit flies that exerts modulatory effect on sweet sensation.</p>
<p>In the terminating phase of feeding behavior, satiety signals play a crucial role to cease food consumption and to ensure an appropriate amount of food ingestion. A number of neuropeptidergic neurons were identified as putative satiety signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, some of these neurons, including those secreting neuropeptides LK, TK, hugin, AstA, CCHa1, and CCHa2, are also distributed in the SEZ region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Deng et al., 2019</xref>). It has been reported that the sweet-sensing gustatory neurons primarily receive regulatory inputs from neurons in the SEZ region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Song et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that these neuropeptidergic neurons might function as satiety signals, imposing inhibititory effect on sweet sensation after adequate food ingestion.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we selectively expressed the temperature-sensitive ion channel TrpA1 in these neurons and activated them at 30 °C, triggering the release of corresponding neuropeptides. Indeed, activation of LK-, TK-, hugin-, AstA-, CCHa1-, and CCHa2-expressing neurons robustly suppressed sweet taste sensitivity in both fed and starved flies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C–D</xref>; <bold><italic>also see </italic></bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 2</xref>). Moreover, LK-, TK-, and hugin-expressing neurons exerted particularly strong inhibition under satiated conditions (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C–D</xref><bold><italic>; also see </italic></bold><xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 2</xref>). These results reveal a multilayered, state-dependent neuropeptidergic network that finely tunes gustatory processing and feeding behavior. In contrast, activating dopaminergic neurons enhanced sweet perception in sated flies as expected (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref>). In starved flies, activating dopaminergic neurons elicited no change in PER likely due to a ceiling effect (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>In mammals and flies, circulating sugar levels are directly linked to satiety/hunger state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Qi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c63">Yoon and Diano, 2021</xref>). We then asked whether changes in circulating sugar levels exerted an effect on sweet sensation. Activating IPCs in the fly brain released <italic>Drosophila</italic> Insulin-like Peptides (DILPs), the fly analog of mammalian insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Brogiolo et al., 2001</xref>), into the hemolymph and reduced circulating sugar levels (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 3A</xref>). As a result, such manipulation enhanced sweet sensitivity of fed flies (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 3B-C</xref>). Therefore, it was plausible that changes in circulating sugar might be the driver of changes in sweet sensation.</p>
<p>Indeed, allowing starved flies to re-feed on normal fly diet or sucrose alone for 15 minutes both resulted in a significant decrease in sweet sensation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). To validate this effect across sweet modalities, we assessed responses to trehalose and fructose after sucrose refeeding and observed comparable reductions in sweet sensation (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 4</xref>). Conversely, when starved flies were supplied with fly diet deprived of sucrose (but with normal levels of polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids), there was no immediate change in sweet sensation after re-feeding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1E</xref>). These results demonstrate that sugar intake inhibits sweet sensation, probably via increasing circulating sugar levels.</p>
<p>Collectively, we thus hypothesized that the above neuropeptidergic neurons might directly sense an increase of circulating sugar levels and suppress sweet sensation in response. If so, these neurons should be activated by glucose, the main species of circulating sugars associated with feeding behavior in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Ugrankar et al., 2018</xref>), at the concentrations resembling sated state (&gt;50 mM in fed flies (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 5</xref>)). We thus conducted calcium imaging experiments in fly brains in an <italic>ex vivo</italic> preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Qi et al., 2021</xref>). Among all the six groups of neuropeptidergic neurons we examined in the SEZ, only hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons and AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons could be activated by 50 mM glucose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1F-I</xref><bold><italic>, also see </italic></bold><xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 6</xref>). Remarkably, each of these populations subdivided into anatomically distinct SEZ subclusters (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 7A</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 9A</xref>), yet glucose-evoked Ca²⁺ responses occurred exclusively within a single subcluster (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H,I</xref>; <xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 7B</xref>; <xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 9B</xref>). This selective activation highlighted profound functional heterogeneity in nutrient sensing among these neuron groups. When direct synaptic transmission was blocked with TTX, hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons, but not AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons, still exhibited calcium responses towards 50 mM of glucose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref><bold><italic>, green</italic></bold>), suggesting that hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons are a direct glucose sensor. Furthermore, the level of circulating glucose dropped to ∼ 20 mM in starved flies (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 5</xref>). We found that 20 mM of glucose did not activate hugin<sup>+</sup> and AstA<sup>+</sup>neurons (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G and I</xref><bold><italic>, orange</italic></bold>), suggesting that these neurons can only be activated under sated conditions.</p>
<p>We also assessed the activity of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons <italic>in vivo</italic> using calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator (CaMPARI), a method employing a photoconvertible fluorescent protein that allows the imaging of integrated calcium activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>), under both sated and starved conditions. In the CaMPARI assay, when neurons are activated, leading to an increase in free calcium ions, exposure to 405-nm light induces a permanent green-to-red photoconversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Fosque et al., 2015</xref>). We found an increased ratio of red/green fluorescence in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons in the sated state compared to that upon starvation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1J</xref>). These findings strongly imply that hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons function as a direct satiety sensor, sensing the levels of circulating glucose and modulating sweet sensation in response.</p>

<p>The transport of glucose mediated by glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) can activate certain neurons in the fruit fly brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Dus et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). By specifically knocking down Glut1 expression in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons, we observed a significant reduction in calcium responses to glucose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>). Consistently, these flies showed a slight yet significant increase in their PER responses to glucose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>). Again, these results further confirm that glucose needs to be transported into hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons to modulate neuronal activity and behavioral output.</p>
<p>In pancreatic β-cells and certain fly neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Oh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Parton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Wang et al., 2022</xref>), intracellular glucose modulates cell excitability primarily through its effect on intracellular energy metabolism and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<sub>ATP</sub>). We pre-treated fly brains with a K<sub>ATP</sub> inhibitor (glibenclamide) and observed a significant calcium response in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref>). Hexokinase, a key enzyme in glucose metabolism that generates ATP, also plays a crucial role in this process. When hexokinase activity was restricted by alloxan, glucose-induced calcium response in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons was significantly suppressed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, when hexokinase was specifically knocked down in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons, a comparable reduction in glucose-induced calcium responses was observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref>). Pyruvate, the end product from glycolysis, can lead to ATP generation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. We also found that pyruvate stimulation led to a significant calcium response in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2G</xref>). As a specificity control, nonmetabolizable L-glucose failed to activate hugin⁺ neurons (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2H</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings suggest that extracellular glucose directly enters hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons through specific glucose transporter and subsequently modulate the activity of K<sub>ATP</sub> through ATP production, ultimately leading to neuronal depolarization.</p>

<title>AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons were direct downstream target of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons</title>
<p>Since hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons were directly involved in glucose sensing and regulated sweet sensation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 8A-B</xref>), we sought to identify their downstream target. We then asked whether the hugin peptide had a direct effect on sweet sensation. Upon microinjection of synthetic hugin peptide, we observed a notable reduction in sweet sensation under both sated and starved states (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref>). In line with this observation, following the injection of hugin peptide, we observed a significant reduction of sugar-induced calcium responses in sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, the inhibitory function of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons on sweet sensation was likely mediated by the secretion of hugin peptide.</p>

<p>There were two hugin receptors, PK2-R1 and PK2-R2, in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Park et al., 2002</xref>). We knocked down their expression by RNAi in the nervous system and then tested flies’ PER to sugar. Knocking down PK2-R1 but not PK2-R2 significantly enhanced sweet perception in both sated and starved states (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C-D</xref>), suggesting a crucial role of PK2-R1 in receiving the input of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons in satiety sensing. To validate this finding, we further tested PK2-R1 null mutants and observed a similar enhancement in sweet sensitivity (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 10</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe any expression of PK2-R1 in the proboscis where gustatory sensory neurons were distributed, indicating that sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons could not directly receive input from hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons via PK2-R1 (data not shown).</p>
<p>AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons served as a plausible relay between hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons and sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons, especially based on a clear co-expression of hugin receptor PK2-R1 and AstA in the SEZ region of the fly brain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, these double-labeled neurons corresponded precisely to the AstA subcluster that exhibited glucose-specific Ca²⁺ responses (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>). We also used optogenetic tools to further confirm that hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons acted upstream of AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons. We expressed the light-sensitive neuronal activator CsChrimson in hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons and calcium indicator GCaMP6m in AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, opto-activation of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons led to a robust calcium transient in AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons.</p>
<p>We then investigated whether the hugin-AstA circuitry affected sweet sensation. As expected, knocking-down PK2-R1 (but not PK2-R2) in AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons led to a significant increase in sugar-induced PER (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3G-H</xref>). Therefore, AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons are the direct downstream target of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons in satiety sensing. hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons can directly sense elevated circulating glucose levels, promote the release of neuropeptide hugin, and then activate AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons via its cognate receptor PK2-R1.</p>
<p>hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons are distributed in both the brain and the ventral nerve cord (VNC). The hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons in the VNC sense sugar and inhibit feeding behavior by suppressing the activity of DH44 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oh et al., 2021</xref>). To determine which hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons regulate the activity of AstA neurons and sweet sensation, we performed the following experiments: 1, Physically severing the neural connection between the brain and the VNC: After severing the neural connection, activation of hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons were still able to downregulate the PER behavior, suggesting that hugin neurons in the SEZ regulated sweet perception (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 11A-B</xref>). 2, Optogenetic experiments in isolated brains: We dissected the fly brains in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3F</xref>, and upon light stimulation, we observed a significant calcium response in AstA neurons (<xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 11C</xref>). This indicates that hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons located in the SEZ but not VNC regulate the activity of AstA neurons. Therefore, we can infer that hugin neurons in the SEZ are responsible for sugar sensing, energy signal transmission, and the output of PER behavior.</p>

<title>hugin–AstA circuitry suppressed food consumption</title>

<title>Mammalian homolog of hugin was also a putative satiety sensor</title>
<p>Our present work identified hugin-AstA circuitry as a novel satiety sensor and feeding suppressor in fruit flies.

In mouse models, we observed a significant increase in NMU levels in the blood following glucose feeding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>). Using the sucrose preference test (SPT) to measure sweet preference, we noted that NMU injection reduced sugar preference in mice, phenocopying the effect of glucose feeding (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5B-C</xref>). Conversely, NMU knockout enhanced sweet sensation in mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5D</xref>).

<p>Neuropeptide NMU is secreted by a group of neurons located in the VMH region of hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Melcher et al., 2006</xref>). To investigate whether NMU<sup>+</sup> neurons functioned as an energy sensor in the mouse brain, we injected AAV-EF1α-DIO-GCaMP6m-WPRE into the VMH of NMU-Cre mice, specifically expressing GCaMP6m in NMU<sup>+</sup> neurons. We then monitored the dynamic activity of VMH <sup>NMU</sup> neurons during glucose stimulation by using fiber photometry (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5E</xref>). As expected, these neurons showed significant calcium responses following glucose administration in mice (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5F-G</xref>). To confirm the specificity of GCaMP6m expression in NMU⁺ neurons, we co-expressed a Cre-dependent mCherry reporter in the VMH of NMU-Cre mice and performed fluorescence in situ hybridization for NMU mRNA. Colocalization analysis demonstrated that GCaMP6m fluorescence was restricted exclusively to NMU⁺ cells (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 15A</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we conducted calcium imaging of brain slices <italic>in vitro</italic> to further assess these neurons’ ability to sense glucose (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5H</xref>). Similar to hugin neurons in the fly brain, VMH<sup>NMU</sup> neurons in the mouse brain exhibited strong calcium responses to glucose stimulation, which could not be inhibited by TTX (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5I</xref>), indicating their direct glucose-sensing capability.

<p>Calbindin 2-positive neurons (Calb2) in the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST) selectively respond to sweet tastants, facilitating sweet signal from the periphery into the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). Because attenuated sweet sensation should correspondingly diminish central sweet-signal transmission, we asked whether NMU modulates this relay. To assess potential anatomical connectivity between VMH NMU⁺ neurons and rNST Calb2⁺ neurons, we employed a dual-virus tracing strategy. In NMU-Cre mice, we injected AAV9-EF1α-DIO-EGFP into the VMH, which revealed dense GFP⁺ projections in close apposition to Calb2⁺ neurons in the rNST (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 15B</xref>). To further confirm this projection is monosynaptic, we combined anterograde tracing by co-injecting AAV2/1-EF1α-DIO-EGFP into the VMH and AAV2/1-hsyn-SV40-NLS-Cre into the rNST. This approach yielded GFP expression in rNST Calb2⁺ neurons, supporting a direct VMH→rNST NMU⁺→Calb2⁺ synaptic link (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5K</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the functional consequence of NMU on Calb2⁺ neuronal activity during sweet stimulation, we delivered AAVs encoding Cre-dependent GCaMP6m into the rNST of Calb2-Cre mice, thereby enabling real-time calcium imaging in Calb2⁺ neurons (<xref rid="figs15" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 15C</xref>). Using fiber photometry, we recorded calcium responses to sugar stimuli, both with and without NMU injection (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5L</xref>). We found that NMU injection significantly suppressed the calcium responses to sugar, aligning with observed behavioral phenotypes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5M</xref>). These data indicated that the neuropeptide NMU plays a role in regulating sweet taste perception during sugar feeding.</p>
<p>These findings indicate that NMU<sup>+</sup> neurons can indeed be a putative satiety sensor in the mouse brain that suppresses sweet perception, shedding light on understanding the conserved neural mechanism of feeding regulation in mammals including human.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In summary, we identified hugin-AstA circuitry as a novel satiety sensor in the fly brain. It directly detects circulating sugar levels, inhibits sweet taste perception, and terminates feeding, helping to maintain the homeostasis of internal energy state (<xref rid="figs16" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 16</xref>). Previous research has shown that hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons project to the pharyngeal muscles and the ring gland, playing a role in regulating both feeding and sleep, and these neurons are also part of a neural circuit that modulates taste-mediated feeding behavior. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Melcher and Pankratz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Miroschnikow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Oh et al., 2021</xref>). AstA⁺ neurons convey carbohydrate-satiety signals and shift dietary preference from sugar to protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Hentze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hergarden et al., 2012</xref>). . However, it was unclear whether they could sense the body’s energy state, how they interacted with each other, or how they influenced sensory/motor neurons to regulate feeding. Our research has clarified the relationship between hugin and AstA: hugin functions upstream, sensing glucose, while AstA acts downstream, directly modulating sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons to regulate sugar perception and feeding behavior. This discovery establishes a mechanistic link between glucose sensing and sweet sensation regulation, enhancing our understanding of how energy states influence nutrient sensing and feeding behavior.</p>
<p>Recent studies have highlighted the complex interplay of neural circuits and neuropeptides that regulate satiety and feeding behavior in Drosophila. For instance, dopaminergic and neuropeptide F (NPF) circuits play crucial roles in modulating the activity of Gr5a⁺ sweet-sensing neurons during hunger and refeeding. These studies showed that dopamine signaling adjusts the temporal integration of PER-driving inputs under fed conditions, while NPF enhances Gr5a sensitivity during starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Inagaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Marella et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings complement these established mechanisms by identifying the hugin–AstA pathway as a central satiety sensor that directly detects circulating glucose levels and inhibits sweet taste perception to prevent overconsumption. Moreover, the hugin–AstA circuitry fits within a broader regulatory framework of satiety signaling in Drosophila. Peripheral satiety signals, such as enteroendocrine NPF⁺ cells, detect luminal sugar and suppress feeding via hormonal release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Malita et al., 2022</xref>). Central hunger circuits, including dopaminergic neurons, adjust Gr5a responsiveness according to the energy state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>). Our study reveals that the hugin–AstA loop acts as a central brake on Gr5a activity following sugar intake, thus closing a feedback loop that protects against excessive sugar ingestion. Together, these multilayered mechanisms—from gut to brain—ensure robust regulation of sweet perception and energy balance.</p>
<p>Although multiple regulatory elements of energy homeostasis have been identified in both flies and mammals, our present work reveals a novel mechanism that links energy sensing to taste modulation. The energy sensor comprises three types of neurons: hugin<sup>+</sup> neurons as the sensor, AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons as a relay, and sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons as the behavioral modulator. Given the highly conserved regulatory mechanism of energy homeostasis across animal species (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A-D</xref>), our work paves a way to fully understand how internal state sensing and behavioral alternations are tightly coupled in more complex organisms, and how they are disrupted in metabolic disorders.</p>
<p>In addition to the novel mechanism we have uncovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is interesting to consider how conserved these pathways might be in more complex organisms like mammals, particularly concerning the function of the mammalian homologues, NMU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Melcher et al., 2006</xref>). NMU is known to play critical roles in regulating energy homeostasis, feeding behavior, insulin secretion, and immune responses in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Teranishi and Hanada, 2021</xref>). Our study has shown that NMU neurons may serve as an energy sensor in mammals as well, which regulated nutrient sensing, much like the hugin neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Given the functional parallels between the hugin-AstA circuitry in flies and NMU signaling in mammals, it is plausible that NMU may interfere with taste signaling to the brain and modulate the brain’s reward circuits, affecting other behaviors beyond feeding.</p>
<p>Additionally, our findings open up the possibility of using NMU or its pathways as therapeutic targets for appetite suppression and obesity treatment. Recent developments in appetite-regulating peptides, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, have shown efficacy in reducing food intake and promoting weight loss in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Aldawsari et al., 2023</xref>). Given NMU’s role in suppressing sweet taste perception and energy regulation, the NMU system could be a complementary or alternative target for anti-obesity interventions. Exploring how modulating NMU activity could synergize with GLP-1 therapies may provide new strategies for controlling appetite and managing energy balance.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our discovery of the hugin-AstA circuitry in flies provides a foundation for understanding the broader principles of energy sensing and behavioral regulation across species. Further studies in mammals will be essential to explore the potential roles of NMU neurons in these processes and their therapeutic relevance in metabolic disorders.</p>

<title>Behavioral assays (Fly)</title>
<p>PER was evaluated using a method outlined in a previous study. Briefly, individual flies were gently aspirated and positioned in a 200 µL pipette tip, allowing only the head and proboscis to protrude while the dorsal thorax was lightly affixed to prevent escape. After a 3-minute acclimation period, each fly was first presented with 0.5 µL water droplets on the labellum twice. Flies that responded by extending their proboscis were allowed to drink and were subsequently excluded from the experiment. Flies that did not extend their proboscis in response to water were then stimulated sequentially with ascending sucrose concentrations (6.25–800 mM). Each concentration was delivered as two brief (&lt;1 s) touches of a 0.5 µL droplet to the labellum, immediately withdrawn to prevent ingestion. A full proboscis extension, defined as the complete uncoiling of the rostrum beyond the labellum plane, was scored as positive. Partial or delayed (&gt;1 s) extensions were not considered positive responses. Responsiveness at each concentration was recorded if at least one full extension occurred in the two trials.For <xref rid="figs11" ref-type="fig">Figure supplementary 11</xref>, the connection between the brain and VNC were cut off by a dissecting scissors before the PER assay.</p>
<p>Feeding was assessed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Sun et al., 2017</xref>).

<title>Sucrose Preference Test</title>
<p>The two-bottle preference (TBP) behavioral test was conducted in a standard mouse cage. Two bottles, one containing water and the other with a 10 mM sucrose solution, were placed on top of the cage. Each tested mouse was individually caged and adopted to two bottles containing distilled water or a 10 mM sucrose solution for one week. Throughout the training period, the positions of the bottles were alternated every 24 hours to mitigate potential position-related biases. Prior to the TBP tests for sucrose, mice underwent a 12-hour pre-starvation period, followed by re-fed sucrose (20%) for 1 hour or intraperitoneal (IP) administration of NMU (YFLFRPRN-NH<sub>2</sub>, 4.5 µm/kg). The consumption of water and sucrose solution over a 2-hour period was meticulously recorded.

<title>Stereotaxic brain surgeries and viral injection</title>
<p>Mice were anesthetized with 1-2% isoflurane during stereotaxic injections, performed using a small animal stereotaxic instrument (RWD Life Science, #68030). Throughout the surgery, core body temperature was maintained at 36 ± 1 °C using a feedback-controlled heating system. Micro scissors were used for the incision, and a dental drill was employed to create the cranial window. Viral injections were delivered using a glass microelectrode syringe pump (RWD Life Science, #R-480). To express GCaMP6m and mCherry AAV2/9-EF1α-DIO-GCaMP6m-WPRE (titer: 2.89 × 10<sup>12</sup>, #H4955, Obio Biotechnology, Shanghai, China, Co., Ltd.) and AAV2/9-EF1α-DIO-mCherry-WPRE (titer: 2.89 × 10<sup>12</sup>, Obio Biotechnology, Shanghai, China, Co., Ltd.) were bilaterally injected into the VMH and rNST, with approximately 0.15 µL of virus delivered per site. The microelectrode was left in place for 10 minutes post-injection before being withdrawn. Injection coordinates were as follows: VMH (AP, −1.46 mm; ML, ±0.4 mm; DV, −5.5 mm) and rNST (AP, −7.08 mm; ML, ±0.6 mm; DV, −4.3 mm). After 3 weeks of AAV injections, optical fibers were chronically implanted in the VMH or rNST and secured with dental cement (C&amp;B Metabond®, Parkell, Japan). Injection coordinates were determined based on the 4th edition of the mouse brain atlas by Franklin and Paxinos (2008). Mice were allowed to recover for 5-7 days post fiber-implanted before any behavioral or calcium imaging evaluations were conducted. After the experiments, mice were perfused to verify virus expression and fiber placement. Data from mice with poor viral expression or incorrect fiber placement (0-20% of cases) were excluded from the final analysis.</p>
<p>For the anterograde tracing experiments, two viral vectors were used. AAV2/1-hsyn-DIO-EGFP-WPRE (titer: 1 × 10<sup>13</sup> viral particles/mL,Obio Biotechnology) was injected into the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and AAV2/1-hsyn-SV40 NLS-Cre (titer: 2.1 × 10<sup>12</sup> viral particles/mL, Brain Case) was injected into the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST).

<caption><title>A working model</title>
<p>In the fly brain, a small group of neurons expressing hugin peptide is responsible for detecting the circulating glucose levels. Following feeding, as the levels of glucose in the circulatory system increased, these neurons are activated, leading to the release of hugin, which activated AstA neurons via its receptor PK2-R1. Subsequently, the activation of AstA<sup>+</sup> neurons then directly inhibited sweet perception via AstA peptide and its cognate receptor AstA-R1 expressed in sweet-sensing Gr5a<sup>+</sup> neurons. This neural circuitry is a novel energy sensor that suppressed sweet perception and terminated feeding behavior, providing an efficient mechanism for maintaining energy homeostasis.</p></caption>

<p>This <bold>important</bold> work characterizes layers of neuropeptidergic modulations that collectively regulate the intake of sugar in a hunger state-dependent manner. Combinations of genetic, physiological, and behavioral approaches present <bold>convincing</bold> evidence that neurons that release Hugin and Allatostatin A are in an active state in sated flies, leading to suppression of sugar feeding behavior by reducing the sensitivity of sugar-sensitive gustatory neurons that express Gr5a. They also demonstrate that neurons that release Neuromedin U, a vertebrate homolog of Hugin, have common physiological properties as the fly Hugin neurons, revealing a similar function of evolutionarily conserved peptides across animal phyla.</p>

<p>In this manuscript, Qin and colleagues aim to delineate a neural mechanism by which the internal satiety levels modulate the intake of sugar solution. They identified a three-step neuropeptidergic system that downregulates the sensitivity of sweet-sensing gustatory sensory neurons in sated flies. First, neurons that release a neuropeptide Hugin (which is an insect homolog of vertebrate Neuromedin U (NMU)) are in an active state when the concentration of glucose is high. This activation does not require synaptic inputs, suggesting that Hugin-releasing neurons sense hemolymph glucose levels directly. Next, the Hugin neuropeptides activate Allatostatin A (AstA)-releasing neurons via one of Hugin's receptors, PK2-R1. Finally, the released AstA neuropeptide suppresses sugar response in sugar-sensing Gr5a-expressing gustatory sensory neurons through AstA-R1 receptor. Suppression of sugar response in Gr5a-expressing neurons reduces the fly's sugar intake motivation (measured by proboscis extension reflex). They also found that NMU-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of mice (which project to the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST)) are also activated by high concentrations of glucose, independent of synaptic transmission, and that injection of NMU reduces the glucose-induced activity in the downstream of NMU-expressing neurons in rNST. These data suggest that the function of Hugin neuropeptide in the fly is analogous to the function of NMU in the mouse.</p>
<p>Generally, their central conclusions are well-supported by multiple independent approaches. The parallel study in mice adds a unique comparative perspective that makes the paper interesting to a wide range of readers. It is easier said than done: the rigor of this study, which effectively combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to provide multiple lines of behavioral and physiological evidence, deserves recognition and praise.</p>
<p>A perceived weakness is that the behavioral effects of the manipulations of Hugin and AstA systems are modest compared to a dramatic shift of sugar solution-induced PER (the behavioral proxy of sugar sensitivity) induced by hunger, as presented in Figure 1B and E. It is true that the mutation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which synthesizes dopamine, does not completely abolish the hunger-induced PER change, but the remaining effect is small. Moreover, the behavioral effect of the silencing of the Hugin/AstA system (Figure Supplement 13B, C) is difficult to interpret, leaving a possibility that this system may not be necessary for shifting PER in starved flies. These suggest that the Hugin-AstA system accounts for only a minor part of the behavioral adaptation induced by the decreased sugar levels. Their aim to &quot;dissect out a complete neural pathway that directly senses internal energy state and modulates food-related behavioral output in the fly brain&quot; is likely only partially achieved. While this outcome is not a shortcoming of a study per se, the depth of discussion on the mechanism of interactions between the Hugin/AstA system and the other previously characterized molecular circuit mechanisms mediating hunger-induced behavioral modulation is insufficient for readers to appreciate the novelty of this study and future challenges in the field. In this context, authors are encouraged to confront a limitation of the study due to the lack of subtype-level circuit characterization, despite their intriguing finding that only a subtype of Hugin- and AstA-releasing neurons are responsive to the elevated level of bath-applied glucose.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>This study identifies a novel energy-sensing circuit in Drosophila and mice that directly regulates sweet taste perception. In flies, hugin+ neurons function as a glucose sensor, activated through Glut1 transport and ATP-sensitive potassium channels. Once activated, hugin neurons release hugin peptide, which stimulates downstream Allatostatin A (AstA)+ neurons via PK2-R1 receptors. AstA+ neurons then inhibit sweet-sensing Gr5a+ gustatory neurons through AstA peptide and its receptor AstA-R1, reducing sweet sensitivity after feeding. Disrupting this pathway enhances sweet taste and increases food intake, while activating the pathway suppresses feeding.</p>
<p>The mammalian homolog of neuromedin U (NMU) was shown to play an analogous role in mice. NMU knockout mice displayed heightened sweet preference, while NMU administration suppressed it. In addition, VMH NMU+ neurons directly sense glucose and project to rNST Calb2+ neurons, dampening sweet taste responses. The authors suggested a conserved hugin/NMU-AstA pathway that couples energy state to taste perception.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>Interesting findings that extend from insects to mammals. Very comprehensive.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>Coupling energy status to taste sensitivity is not a new story. Many pathways appear to be involved, and therefore, it raises a question as to how this hugin-AstA pathway is unique.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>In this manuscript, Qin and colleagues aim to delineate a neural mechanism by which the internal satiety levels modulate the intake of sugar solution. They identified a three-step neuropeptidergic system that downregulates the sensitivity of sweet-sensing gustatory sensory neurons in sated flies. First, neurons that release a neuropeptide Hugin (which is an insect homolog of vertebrate Neuromedin U (NMU)) are in an active state when the concentration of glucose is high. This activation does not require synaptic inputs, suggesting that Hugin-releasing neurons sense hemolymph glucose levels directly. Next, the Hugin neuropeptides activate Allatostatin A (AstA)-releasing neurons via one of Hugin's receptors, PK2-R1. Finally, the released AstA neuropeptide suppresses sugar response in sugar-sensing Gr5a-expressing gustatory sensory neurons through AstA-R1 receptor. Suppression of sugar response in Gr5a-expressing neurons reduces the fly's sugar intake motivation (measured by proboscis extension reflex). They also found that NMU-expressing neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) of mice (which project to the rostral nucleus of the solitary tract (rNST)) are also activated by high concentrations of glucose, independent of synaptic transmission, and that injection of NMU reduces the glucose-induced activity in the downstream of NMU-expressing neurons in rNST. These data suggest that the function of Hugin neuropeptide in the fly is analogous to the function of NMU in the mouse.</p>
<p>Generally, their central conclusions are well-supported by multiple independent approaches. The parallel study in mice adds a unique comparative perspective that makes the paper interesting to a wide range of readers. It is easier said than done: the rigor of this study, which effectively combined pharmacological and genetic approaches to provide multiple lines of behavioral and physiological evidence, deserves recognition and praise.</p>
<p>A perceived weakness is that the behavioral effects of the manipulations of Hugin and AstA systems are modest compared to a dramatic shift of sugar solution-induced PER (the behavioral proxy of sugar sensitivity) induced by hunger, as presented in Figure 1B and E. It is true that the mutation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which synthesizes dopamine, does not completely abolish the hunger-induced PER change, but the remaining effect is small. Moreover, the behavioral effect of the silencing of the Hugin/AstA system (Figure Supplement 13B, C) is difficult to interpret, leaving a possibility that this system may not be necessary for shifting PER in starved flies. These suggest that the Hugin-AstA system accounts for only a minor part of the behavioral adaptation induced by the decreased sugar levels. Their aim to &quot;dissect out a complete neural pathway that directly senses internal energy state and modulates food-related behavioral output in the fly brain&quot; is likely only partially achieved. While this outcome is not a shortcoming of a study per se, the depth of discussion on the mechanism of interactions between the Hugin/AstA system and the other previously characterized molecular circuit mechanisms mediating hunger-induced behavioral modulation is insufficient for readers to appreciate the novelty of this study and future challenges in the field.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comment. We agree that the behavioral effects of manipulating the Hugin–AstA system alone were considerably weaker than the pronounced PER shifts induced by starvation. We will revise our Discussion to address it by positioning our findings within the broader context of energy regulation.</p>
<p>More specifically, we will discuss that feeding behavior is controlled by two distinct, yet synergistic, types of mechanisms:</p>
<p>(1) Hunger-driven 'accelerators': as the reviewer notes, pathways involving dopamine and NPF are powerful drivers of sweet sensitivity. These systems are strongly activated by hunger to promote food-seeking and consumption.</p>
<p>(2) Satiety-driven 'brakes': our study identifies the counterpart to those systems above, aka. a satiety-driven 'brake'. The Hugin–AstA pathway acts as a direct sensor of high internal energy (glucose), which is specifically engaged during satiety to actively suppress sweet sensation and prevent overconsumption.</p>
<p>This framework explains the seemingly discrepancy in effect size. The dramatic PER shift seen upon starvation is a combined result of engaging the 'accelerators' (hunger pathways like TH/NPF) while simultaneously releasing the 'brake' (our Hugin–AstA pathway being inactive).</p>
<p>Our manipulations, which specifically target only the 'brake' system, are therefore expected to have a more modest effect than this combined physiological state. Thus, rather than being a &quot;minor part,&quot; the Hugin–AstA pathway is a mechanistically defined, satiety-specific circuit that is essential for the precise &quot;braking&quot; required for energy homeostasis. We will update our Discussion to emphasize how these 'accelerator' and 'brake' circuits must work in concert to ensure precise energy regulation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>In this context, authors are encouraged to confront a limitation of the study due to the lack of subtype-level circuit characterization, despite their intriguing finding that only a subtype of Hugin- and AstA-releasing neurons are responsive to the elevated level of bath-applied glucose.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the critical issue of subtype-level specialization within the Hugin and AstA populations.</p>
<p>We fully agree that the Hugin system is known for its functional heterogeneity (pleiotropy), with different Hugin neuron subclusters implicated in regulating a variety of behaviors, including feeding, aversion, and locomotion (we will cite relevant literature here). Our finding that only a specific subcluster of Hugin neurons is responsive to glucose elevation provides a crucial first step in functionally dissecting this complexity.</p>
<p>We will add a dedicated paragraph to elaborate on this functional partitioning. We propose that this subtype-level specialization allows the Hugin system to precisely link specific physiological states (like high circulating glucose) to appropriate behavioral outputs (like the suppression of sweet taste), demonstrating an elegant solution to coordinating multiple survival behaviors. Future work using high-resolution tools such as split-GAL4 and single-cell sequencing will be invaluable in fully mapping the specific functional roles corresponding to each Hugin and AstA subcluster.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment and agree that the modest behavioral effect of Glut1 knockdown is a critical finding that warrants further clarification. This observation strongly supports the idea that internal energy state is monitored by a sophisticated and robust network, not a single, fragile component. We believe the effect size is modest for two main reasons, which we will further address in revised Discussion.</p>
<p>Firstly, the effect size is likely attenuated by technical and molecular redundancy. Specifically, the RNAi-mediated knockdown of Glut1 may be incomplete, leaving residual transporter function. Furthermore, Glut1 is likely only one part of the Hugin neuron's intrinsic sensing mechanism; other components, such as alternative glucose transporters or downstream K<sub>ATP</sub> channel signaling, may provide molecular redundancy, meaning that the full energy-sensing function is not easily abolished by a single manipulation.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, the final feeding decision is an integrated output of competing circuits. While hunger-sensing pathways like the dopamine and NPF circuits act as powerful &quot;accelerators&quot; to drive sweet consumption, the Hugin–AstA pathway serves as a satiety-specific &quot;brake&quot;. The modest effect of partially inhibiting just one component of this 'brake' system is the hallmark of a precisely regulated, multi-layered homeostatic system. We will further clarify in the Discussion that the Hugin pathway represents one essential inhibitory circuit within this cooperative network that works together with the hunger-promoting systems to ensure precise control over energy intake.</p>

</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that several energy-sensing pathways are known. However, we now clarify that these previously established mechanisms, such as the dopaminergic and NPF pathways, primarily function as hunger-driven &quot;accelerators.&quot; They are activated by low energy states to promote sweet sensitivity and drive consumption.</p>
<p>The crucial, missing piece of the puzzle—which our study provides—is the satiety-specific &quot;brake&quot; mechanism. We identify the Hugin–AstA circuit as one of the “brakes”: a dedicated, central sensor that responds directly to high circulating glucose (satiety) to suppress sweet sensation and prevent overconsumption.</p>
<p>Thus, our work is unique because it defines the essential counterpart to the hunger pathways. In the revised Discussion, we will further explain how these 'accelerator' (hunger) and 'brake' (satiety) systems work in concert to allow for the precise, bidirectional regulation of energy intake. Furthermore, by demonstrating that this Hugin/NMU 'brake' circuit is evolutionarily conserved in mice, our findings reveal a fundamental energy-sensing strategy and suggest that this pathway could represent a promising new therapeutic target for managing conditions of excessive food intake.</p>
