<title>Abstract</title><p>Mechanism underlying the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Here, we reported that intermittent fasting promoted IL-22 production by ILC3s and subsequent beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced-obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 significantly increased the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell‒cell ligand receptor interactions indicated that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, suggesting that ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Obesity is defined as an epidemic metabolic disease characterized by excessive fat accumulation as the consequence of long-term energy surplus. Thus, therapeutic management of obesity has been focused on the restoration of energy balance, either by decreasing energy intake or increasing energy expenditure<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>]</sup>. Among these strategies, intermittent fasting is becoming a popular dietary approach. All intermittent fasting schemes including alternate day fasting, 5:2 intermittent fasting and daily time-restricted feeding have shown the health benefits such as delaying aging<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>]</sup>, improving metabolism<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>]</sup>, and enhancing cognition<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref>]</sup>. The mechanism underlying metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting remains largely unknown. Its metabolic benefit was initially attributed to limitation of energy intake. Recent studies have indicated an alternative mechanism involving beigeing of white adipose tissue, which accounts for the major plasticity of energy expenditure. Studies by Kim <italic>et al.</italic> have showed that intermittent fasting induces white adipose beigeing via stimulation of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 polarization<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>]</sup>. On the other hand, studies by Li <italic>et al.</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup> have indicated that alternate day fasting induces white adipose tissue beigeing by shaping the gut microbiota and elevating the fermentation products acetate and lactate. Although gut microbiota is closely related to immune response, it remains unclear whether intestinal immune cells contribute to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are a group of natural immune cells lacking antigen-specific receptors expressed on T cells and B cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref>]</sup>. Based on developmental trajectories, ILCs are divided into five groups: natural killer cells, type 1 ILCs, type 2 ILCs, type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) and lymphoid tissue-inducing cells<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref>]</sup>. Adipose-Resident type 1 ILCs can promote adipose tissue fibrosis and obesity-associated insulin resistance<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>]</sup> while type 2 ILCs promote beiging of white adipose tissue and limit obesity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref>]</sup>. However, the contribution of ILC3s on adipocytes and obesity are less clear. ILC3s can produce interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interleukin-22 (IL-22) in response to extracellular bacteria and fungi<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>]</sup>. ILC3s derived IL-22 can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier function, reduce endotoxemia and inflammation, ameliorate insulin sensitivity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>]</sup> and improve the metabolic disorder of polycystic ovary syndrome<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>]</sup>. However, ILC3s are also reported to be involved in the induction of obesity<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup>, contributing to the metabolic disease <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>]</sup>. Therefore, the role of ILC3s in metabolic disease seems complex and the role of ILC3s in intermittent fasting and beigeing of adipose tissue is not known.</p>
<p>Here, we showed that alternate day fasting promoted the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. Further, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s increased thermogenesis in DIO mice. Exogenous IL-22 induced the beigeing of white adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor attenuated the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. Our study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis is actively involved in the regulation of adipose tissue beigeing. Our findings thus reveal a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue.</p>

<p>To explore whether gut immune system contributes to the effects of intermittent fasting on white adipose tissue beigeing, we examined levels of various cytokines in intestine. Notably, mRNA level of IL-22 in the NCD-IF group was significantly higher relevant to the control group (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Consistently, plasma concentration of IL-22 detected by ELISA was also increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). These results suggest that intermittent fasting increases levels of IL-22 in the intestine and plasma. Since ILC3s are one of the major sources of IL-22 in mice<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>]</sup>, we detected the proportion of ILC3s in the lamina propria of small intestine using flow cytometry. In mice fed NCD, intermittent fasting significantly increased proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s in the small intestine lamina propria (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), while demonstrating no effect on the percentile of total ILC3s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). Interestingly, intermittent fasting did not influence the secretion of IL-22 of T cells marked as Lineage<sup>+</sup> Rorγ<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>). Besides, intermittent fasting didn’t alter the levels of ILC3s and IL-22 in mouse adipose tissue (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs3">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). Similar to NCD mice, intermittent fasting significantly increased mRNA levels of IL-22 in the intestine of HFD mice while didn’t influence the secretion of IL-22 by T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H-I</xref>). Furthermore, mice fed high-fat diet showed an obvious reduction in the plasma IL-22 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>)and percentage of total and IL-22 positive ILC3s (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>). Further, the decrement of plasma IL-22 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1J</xref>) as well as IL-22 positive ILCs in intestine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1K</xref>) was attenuated by 30 days intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>In order to explain the chronological relationship between ILC3s secreting IL-22 and beigeing of white adipose tissue, the mice were exposed to one cycle of intermittent fasting for 2 days. At this time, the body weight of mice didn’t change and beige adipocytes haven’t been induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplementary Fig 4 A-B</xref>). However, significant increase in proportion of IL-22 positive ILC3s was induced by intermittent fasting for two days whereas total percentile of ILC3s remained unalterd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">supplementary Fig 4 C</xref>). These results indicate that the beiging of white adipose tissue are subsequent to its effect on ILC3s secreting IL-22.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="s2b">
<label>2.</label><title>Intestinal ILC3s promote beigeing of white adipose tissue</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s can increase beigeing of white adipose tissue in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Intestinal ILC3s were isolated and purified from the small intestinal lamina propria of NCD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>). These cells were defined as lineage<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, DIO mice transferred with ILC3s demonstrated a significant increment in the proportion of small intestinal ILC3s. Plasma concentration of IL-22 also increased significantly relevant to PBS control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Relevant to PBS control, adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s decreased body weight and weight of sWAT (Subcutaneous adipose tissue) slightly, while had no impact on food intake and the liver weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig 5C-E</xref>). In addition, ILC3s from CD45.1 mouse intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes were adoptively transferred into recipient mice, and CD45.1 positive immune cells were significantly increased in intestine but not in adipose tissue in mice transferred with ILC3s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs5">Supplementary Fig. 5E</xref>), indicating the feasibility of ILC3s adoptive transfer. Notably, DIO mice transferred with intestinal ILC3s showed improved glucose tolerance (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>) and decreased levels of random blood glucose (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). Cold exposure experiment showed that DIO mice transferred with intestinal ILC3s maintained significantly higher rectal temperatures during a 6-h cold challenge (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>). Consistently, key thermogenic genes in sWAT including <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Cidea</italic> were significantly increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). Size of adipocytes in the sWAT and eWAT was markedly reduced (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G-H</xref>). Furthermore, differentiated SVF cells co-cultured with intestinal ILC3s in vitro (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>) demonstrated a significant increment in the expression of <italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J</xref>), as well as a concurrent decrement in the size of lipid droplets (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2K</xref>). On the other hand, co-culture with CD127<sup>-</sup> cells demonstrated no effect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2J-K</xref>). The in vitro experiment indicates the direct effect of ILC3s on adipocytes.</p>

<label>3.</label><title>Exogenous IL-22 increases beigeing of white adipose tissue</title>
<p>The role of type 3 immunity in DIO and metabolic syndrome is complex. ILC3-derived IL-22 are beneficial in metabolic syndrome<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>]</sup> but can also contribute to metabolic disease<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>]</sup>. In order to examine the role of promoting beigeing of white adipose tissue of IL-22 in the context of NCD and HFD mice, we intraperitoneally administrated IL-22 at the dose of 4 µg/kg body weight/every other day for 6 weeks into mice fed NCD or HFD. Saline was used as control. Administration of IL-22 increased its plasma concentration in mice fed either NCD or HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Supplementary Fig. 6A</xref>).

Exogenous IL-22 rendered mice fed HFD resistant to core temperature drop induced by cold exposure (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). Relevant to the pale yellow color in the control animals, subcutaneous fat of obese mice treated with exogenous IL-22 appeared dark yellowish (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>).

<p>To explore whether IL-22R mediates the effect of intermittent fasting on the beigeing of white adipose tissue, IL-22R knockout (IL-22RKO) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to alternate-day fasting diet for 30 days. Rectal temperature of WT-IF and IL-22RKO-IF mice was monitored during two consecutive days of intermittent fasting. On the fasting day, the rectal temperature of IL-22RKO-IF mice was significantly lower than that of WT-IF mice at 16:00 time point (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). On the feeding day, the rectal temperature of IL-22RKO-IF mice was lower at three time points: 8:00, 12:00 and 20:00 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). These results indicate that IL-22RKO attenuates the thermogenesis induced by intermittent fasting. Knock-out of IL-22R demonstrated no effect on the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in mice fed NCD (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C-D</xref>).

<p>To explore the mechanism by which intermittent fasting promotes the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s, live CD45<sup>+</sup> Lineage (CD3, CD5, B220, CD19, Gr1)<sup>-</sup> cells isolated from the siLP of mice fed NCD, HFD or HFD-IF were subjected for single-cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7A</xref>). Following quality controls, we analyzed 7455, 4803, 5954 single cells for the NCD, HFD and HFD-IF groups using Seurat-V3.1, respectively. Based on singleR, we identified twenty-five distinct clusters of immune cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7B</xref>), including ILC1s (Cluster 7 and cluster 16), ILC2s (Cluster 2, cluster 12, cluster 13, and cluster 14), ILC3s (cluster 3 and cluster 5), dendritic cells (Cluster 1, cluster 4, cluster 9, cluster 10, cluster 11, cluster 17, cluster 18, and cluster 21), eosinophils (Cluster 0 and cluster 6), B cells (Cluster 8 and cluster 24), macrophages (Cluster 15, cluster 20, and cluster 23), NKT cells (Cluster 22) and mast cells (Cluster 19). As expected, ILC3s expressed high RNA levels of Il7r (CD127), Rorc, and IL-22 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs7">Supplementary Fig. 7C, D</xref>). ILC3s contain two distinct cell types with highly similar expression profiles: NCR<sup>+</sup> and NCR<sup>-</sup>. These ILC3s were distinguished in our analysis as Cluster 5 and Cluster 3 respectively. NCR<sup>-</sup> ILC3s (cluster 3) were CCR6 positive and contained lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Interestingly, NCR<sup>-</sup> ILC3s were characterized by high levels of vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (Vipr2) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6C</xref>), which is critical for the migration and function of ILC3s<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>]</sup>. The heatmap of cellular composition showed the differences in cell number and percentage among NCD, HFD and HFD IF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. 8A</xref>). The change in ILC3 number was consistent with the flow cytometry results. The percentage of IL-22<sup>+</sup> cells in NCR<sup>+</sup> ILC3s was significantly increased by IF in mice fed HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. 8B</xref>). Moreover, GSEA revealed that HFD-induced decrement of cytokine‒cytokine receptor interaction, in which IL-22 is included, was reversed by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. 8C</xref>). Besides, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, in which vipr2 is included, was up-regulated in HFD-IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs8">Supplementary Fig. 8D</xref>).

Transcription factor analysis using the JASPAR database and TFBS Tools revealed that the expression of <italic>Hsp90ab1</italic> may be regulated by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6D</xref>). AHR is located in the Hsp90:XAP2:p23:Src chaperone protein complex in the cytoplasm without stimulation.

<p>We next analyzed the intestinal cellular communication networks using CellPhone DB analysis based on homologous gene transformation on all immune cells acquired. CellPhone DB ligand‒receptor analysis revealed hundreds of immune-to-immune interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9A</xref>). Connectome web analysis of siLP immune cells revealed strong interactions among CD8<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC) (Cluster 4), CD127<sup>+</sup> ILC1s (Cluster 16), DC8<sup>-</sup> DC-1 (Cluster 9), Macrophages-1 (Cluster 15), CD8<sup>-</sup> DC-2 (Cluster 1), Macrophages-2 (Cluster 23), CD8<sup>-</sup> DC-3 (Cluster 10), CD8<sup>-</sup> DC-4 (Cluster 11), and CD8<sup>-</sup> DC-5 (Cluster 17).

ILC subsets, DCs and macrophages were in the central communication hubs of the healthy small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9B-C</xref>). Analysis of highly expressed interactions uncovered various uncharacterized and validated signaling pathways implicated in intestine homeostasis in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9D</xref>). Analysis of the NCD mouse interactome suggests that macrophages (cluster 15) may interact with NCR<sup>+</sup> ILC3s through CD74_COPA, CD74_MIF, CD44_HBEGF, CD44_FGFR2, CCL4_SLC7A1, and IL1B_ADRB2. Similarly, DCs (cluster 9) may interact with NCR<sup>+</sup>ILC3s through CD74_COPA, CD74_MIF, IL1B_ADRB2, CD44_HBEGF, and CD44_FGFR2. All these observations indicates that macrophages and DCs play critical roles in the recruitment and maintenance of ILC3s.</p>
<p>HFD significantly reduced the interaction between ILC subsets, DCs and macrophages in the small intestine (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs9">Supplementary Fig. 9B</xref>). This reduction was reversed by IF (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 11B). Analysis of the interactomes in mice fed HFD suggested that IF significantly altered the interacting proteins (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7F-G</xref>). To further test this observation, we sorted macrophages and ILC3s from HFD and HFD-IF mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">Supplementary Fig. 10A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs10">supplementary Fig. 10B-C</xref>, <italic>Ccl4</italic> and <italic>Cd74</italic> increased significantly in macrophages, while the receptors expressed on ILC3s remained largely unchanged.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our present study demonstrates that intestinal ILC3s are critical for the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. This conclusion is supported by following observations. Firstly, intermittent fasting stimulates the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s in either lean mice fed normal chow diet, obese mice fed high-fat diet mice, or mice with metabolic dysfunction induced by HFCD diet. Secondly, a comprehensive set of in vivo and in vitro experiments shows that intermittent fasting promotes adipose tissue beigeing through the intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis.</p>
<p>The role of ILC3s in metabolism remains largely unknown. Our studies provide evidence supporting the metabolic benefit of intestinal ILC3s in intermittent fasting. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s isolated from lean mice was sufficient to improve the metabolic dysfunctions in DIO mice, including increase of white adipose tissue beigeing and glucose tolerance. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of ILC3s significantly increased their number only in intestine. Further, alternate day fasting did not alter the ILC3s in adipose tissue. These observations indicate that ILC3s in intestine rather than in adipose tissue account for the metabolic benefit. OSullivan et al. <sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>]</sup> have reported that ILC3s are negligible in white adipose tissue of either lean or obese mice. Similarly, Sasaki <italic>et al.</italic><sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>]</sup> have demonstrated that transplanting bone marrow cells from Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (lack of T cells, B cells) into Il2rg<sup>-/-</sup> Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice (lack of T cells, B cells, ILC cells) could not increase the number of ILC3s in the adipose tissue of recipient mice. However, it is worth of noting that ILC3s have been detected in adipose tissue by other report. Using the marker Lineage<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup>Il-7rα<sup>+</sup>Thy-1<sup>+</sup>, ILC3s cells have been reported to account for approximately 20% of lineage<sup>-</sup>KLRG1<sup>-</sup>Il-7rα<sup>+</sup> cells in adipose tissue<sup>31</sup>. In our study, we also detected ILC3s defined as CD127<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>RORγt<sup>+</sup> in adipose tissue. These ILC3s accounted for approximately 10% of CD127<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup> cells. ILC3s have also been shown to be present in human adipose tissue<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref>]</sup>. Importantly, the proportion and density of ILC3s in white adipose tissue of people with obesity increase relevant to healthy people, and positively correlate with BMI in obese patients. Thus, the existence and function of ILC3s in mouse and human adipose tissue deserve further investigation. Communication between intestine and metabolic organs is currently under active investigation. Our studies identify ILC3s-IL-22-IL-22R as a novel pathway medicating the crosstalk between intestine and adipose tissue. Evidence supporting this conclusion are five folds. (1) Intermittent fasting reverses the reduction of intestinal ILC3s and IL-22 in DIO mice. (2) Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s enhances beigeing of white adipose tissue. (3) Co-culture of intestinal ILC3s with SVF cells increases their differentiation into beige cells. (4) Exogenous IL-22 mimics the effect of intermittent fasting on beigeing of white adipose tissue. (5) Deficiency of IL-22R blocks the IF-induced beigeing of white adipose tissue. In lines with our observation, a series of recent studies have suggested that cytokines can act directly on adipocytes to regulate thermogenesis. For example, γδ T cells regulate heat production by secreting IL-17<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>]</sup>. Deficiency of IL-10 increases energy consumption and renders mice resistant to diet-induced obesity<sup>34</sup>. IL-27-IL-27Rα signaling promotes thermogenesis, prevents diet-induced obesity, and improves insulin resistance<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>]</sup>. IL-33 induces the beigeing of white adipose tissue by activating ILC2s<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>]</sup>. Our studies extend the effect of cytokines on thermogenesis to IL-22. IL-22 promotes heat production, renders mice resistant to reduction of body temperature induced by cold exposure, and reduces obesity induced by high-fat diet. Together with previous report showing that IL-22 increases the lipolysis of adipocytes, our studies suggest that IL-22 can directly act on adipocytes to alter the adipose tissue homeostasis. IL-22 activates IL-22 receptor, which then regulates the expression of downstream inflammatory factors, tissue repair molecules, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides and other molecules via Jak-1 and Tyk-2 dependent phosphorylation of STAT3. Our studies suggest that IL-22 may promote the expression of downstream thermogenic genes in adipose tissue through IL-22R. Deficiency of IL-22R blocks the up-regulation of thermogenic genes induced by intermittent fasting. SVF cells lacking IL-22R demonstrate no response to the up-regulation of thermogenic genes induced by intestinal ILC3. Thus, our results provide novel evidence supporting the concept that intestinal ILC3s modulate beigeing of adipose tissue via IL-22-IL-22R pathway.</p>
<p>The physiological mechanism underlying the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s remains largely unknown. Our studies reveal the distinct secretion pattern of IL-22 induced by intermittent fasting. Consistently, previous studies have shown that secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s changes between active and quiescent periods throughout the day which is regulated by the cycle patterns of food intake<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. These suggest that secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s is altered by feeding rhythm. It is currently unclear how feeding influences the physiological function of ILC3s. Previous studies indicate a mechanism involving neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which is able to stimulate the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>]</sup>. Consistently, our single cell RNAseq data also showedthat VIP receptor 2 (VIPR2) is highly expressed in intestinal ILC3s and intermittent fasting activates VIPR2 signaling pathway. Since release of VIP is stimulated by food intake, these observations indicate that VIP-VIPR signaling may coordinate with food intake to drive the production of IL-22. However, conflicting result exists. Studies by Talbot <italic>et al</italic> have shown that VIP inhibits ILC3 secretion of IL-22<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>. Reasons accounting for this difference remains unknown but may be context dependent. Alternatively, we found that intermittent fasting may promote ILC3s secreting IL-22 though activating AhR signaling. Consistently, intermittent fasting has been reported to increase the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) acetate and lactate<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>]</sup>, which can lead to activation of AhR and subsequent up-regulation of IL-22 production<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>]</sup>. In addition, feeding may decrease the levels of antimicrobial peptides secreted by epithelial cells, while increasing the expression of lipid-binding proteins<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Moreover, segmented filamentous bacteria may account for the effect of feeding on the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s by periodically attaching to the epithelial surface<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>]</sup>. These alterations may substantially influence the immune networks in intestine, leading to subsequent change in the secretion of IL-22 by ILC3s. In support of this concept, our single cell RNAseq analysis shows a significant change in the intestinal immune cell network involving dendritic cells, macrophages and ILC3s. Further examination should focus on dissecting the novel molecular mechanism by which intestinal dendritic cells and macrophages interact with ILC3s and its consequence on the IL-22 production.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our studies suggest that intermittent fasting can promote the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s. IL-22 then directly activates IL-22R on adipocytes, leading to subsequent induction of beigeing of white adipose tissue. Intestinal ILC3s thus may serve as a potential target for the intervention of metabolic disorders.</p>

<label>1.</label><title>Animals</title>
<p>Four-week-old male C57BL/6 and CD45.1 mice were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Peking, China). IL-22 receptor knockout mice (IL-22R KO mice, KO-00115) were purchased from BRL Medicine Inc. Mice were handled in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals prepared by the National Academy of Sciences and published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH publication 86-23, revised 1985). Mice were housed in standard rodent cages and maintained in a regulated environment (21-24°C, humidity at 40-70%, 12:12 h light : dark cycle with lights on at 8:00 AM). A normal chow diet (D12450H; Research Diets) and water were available ad libitum. Obese mice (DIO) were induced with a high-fat diet (60% fat, D12492; Research Diets) for 12 weeks. Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice received intraperitoneal injection of saline control or IL-22 (R&amp;D, 582-ML) at a dose of 4 μg/kg/day every other day for 6 weeks. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University.</p>

<label>2.</label><title>Cell preparation</title>
<p>For isolation of small intestine lamina propria cells, small intestines from euthanized mice were emptied of the contents, excised of Peyer’s patches, opened longitudinally and cut into 1 cm pieces. The intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) were dissociated from the intestine fragments by first shaking the fragments for 20 min at 37°C in PBS containing 0.3% BSA, 5 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiothreitol. Vortex the fragments three times with PBS containing 2 mM EDTA. To isolate lamina propria cells, the remaining fragments were minced and digested at 37°C for 50 min in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.04 mg/mL collagenase Ⅳ (Sigma), 0.1 mg/mL deoxyribonuclease (DNase) I (Roche), and 0.5 mg/mL dispase. The digestion suspension was then filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer and centrifuged at 540 g for 6 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 2% FBS for further analysis.</p>

<p>Single-cell suspensions were preincubated with anti-CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2) for 10 min to block the surface Fc receptors. Then, cell-surface molecules were stained with different antibody combinations for 30 min in cell staining buffer. Dead cells were excluded with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor<sup>TM</sup> 606 (Invitrogen). For intracellular transcription factor staining, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with a Foxp3 staining buffer set (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

<p>Isolation of SVF and induction of beigeing were performed as reported<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref>]</sup>. Briefly, subcutaneous white adipose tissue (sWAT) from male C57BL/6 mice was digested with 1 mg/mL type 2 collagenase (Sigma‒Aldrich) at 37°C for 40 minutes with shaking. Digestion was terminated by complete DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/mL penicillin and 100 units/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The cell suspension was centrifuged at 700×g for 10 minutes to separate floating adipocytes from the SVF pellets. The pellets containing the SVF cells were resuspended in complete medium and filtered using a 70 μm diameter filter. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 700×g for 10 minutes. Cell pellets were resuspended and mixed well and then plated on dishes in complete medium. Cells were grown to 95% confluence in complete medium and then differentiated into beige or white adipocytes as previously described<sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">41</xref>]</sup>. Briefly, for induction to beige adipocytes, cells were cultured for 2 days with induction medium supplemented with 5 μg/mL insulin, 1 nmol/L T3, 1 μmol/L rosiglitazone, 125 μmol/L indomethacin, 0.5 mmol/L isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 5 μmol/L dexamethasone.

<p>This study provides <bold>valuable</bold> findings showing the production of IL-22 from intestinal ILC3 during intermittent fasting promotes beigeing of white adipose tissue. However, the study is <bold>incomplete</bold> because of the lack of mechanistic insight. In particular, the authors should clearly show the mechanism by which IL-22-derived from ILC3 directly induces beigeing.</p>

<p>In the present study, the authors carefully evaluated the metabolic effects of intermittent fasting on normal chow and HFD fed mice and reported that intermittent fasting induces beiging of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. By employing complementary mouse models, the authors provided compelling evidence to support a mechanism through ILC3/IL-22/IL22R pathway. They further performed comprehensive single-cell sequencing analyses of intestinal immune cells from lean, obese, obese undergone intermittent fasting mice and revealed altered interactome in intestinal myeloid cells and ILC3s by intermittent fasting via activating AhR. Overall, this is a very interesting and timely study uncovering a novel connection between intestine and adipose tissue in the context of executing metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting.</p>

<p>This study aims to investigate the mediatory role of intestinal ILC3-derived IL-22 in intermittent fasting-elicited metabolic benefits.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
The observation of induction of IL-22 production by intestinal ILC3 is significant, and the scRNAseq provides new information into intestine-resident immune cell profiling in response to repeated fasting and refeeding.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
The experimental design for some studies needs to be improved to enhance the rigor of the overall study. There is a lack of direct evidence showing that the metabolically beneficial effects of IF are mediated by intestinal ILC3 and their derived IL-22. The mechanism by which IL-22 induces a thermogenic program is unknown. The browning effect induced by IF may involve constitutive activation of lipolysis, which was not considered.</p>

<p>Chen et al. investigated how intermittent fasting causes metabolic benefits in obese mice and found that intestinal ILC3 and IL-22-IL-22R signaling contribute to the beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT) and consequent metabolic benefits including improved glucose and lipid metabolism in diet-induced obese mice. They demonstrate that intermittent fasting causes increased IL22+ILC3 in small intestines of mice. Adoptive transfer of purified intestinal ILC3 or administration of exogenous IL-22 can lead to increases in UCP1 gene expression and energy expenditure as well as improved glucose metabolism. Importantly, the above metabolic benefits caused by intermittent fasting are abolished in IL-22R-/- mice. Using an in vitro experiment, the authors show that ILC3-derived IL-22 may directly act on adipocytes to promote SVF beige differentiation. Finally, by performing sc-RNA-seq analysis of intestinal immune cells from mice with different treatments, the authors indicate a possible way of intestinal ILC3 being activated by intermittent fasting. Overall, this study provides a new mechanistic explanation for the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting and reveals the role of intestinal ILC3 in the enhancement of the whole-body energy expenditure and glucose metabolism likely via IL-22-induced beige adipogenesis.</p>
<p>Although this study presents some interesting findings, particularly IL-22 derived from intestinal ILC3 could induce beiging of WAT by directly acting on adipocytes, the experimental data are not sufficient to support the key claims in the manuscript.</p>
