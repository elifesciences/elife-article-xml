<abstract>
<p>Antigenic variability among influenza virus strains poses a significant challenge to developing broadly protective, long-lasting vaccines. Current annual vaccines target specific strains, requiring accurate prediction for effective neutralization. Despite sequence diversity across phylogenetic groups, the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain’s structure remains highly conserved. Utilizing this conservation, we designed cross-group chimeric HAs that combine antigenic surfaces from distant strains. By structure-guided transplantation of receptor-binding site (RBS) residues, we displayed an H3 RBS on an H1 HA scaffold. These chimeric immunogens elicit cross-group polyclonal responses capable of neutralizing both base and distal strains. Additionally, the chimeras integrate heterotrimeric immunogens, enhancing modular vaccine design. This approach enables the inclusion of diverse strain segments to generate broad polyclonal responses. In the future, such modular immunogens may serve as tools for evaluating immunodominance and refining immunization strategies, offering potential to bridge and enhance immune responses in individuals with pre-existing immunity. This strategy holds promise for advancing universal influenza vaccine development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Influenza is a major public health burden with vaccine formulation requiring yearly intervention based on annual predictions of circulating strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref></sup>. The current seasonal influenza vaccine includes hemagglutinin derived from H1N1, H3N2 and one or two lineages of influenza B. In addition, there are numerous animal influenza A virus subtypes, some of which are zoonotic such as highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup>. Current vaccines are based on the major viral glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA), which consists of a receptor binding site (RBS) as a major antigenic site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.The head domain of HA, however, is antigenically variable and immunodominant. Therefore, to try to elicit broader immune responses against HA, several approaches have been proposed. One approach aimed to elicit broad H1 reactivity by presenting several H1 head domains on a nanoparticle, to boost subdominant cross-reactive B-cell responses and disfavour strain-specific responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. An alternative approach was based on a consensus sequence approach to induce a broader range of antibodies against a particular subtype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Other methods including beads-on-a-string (BOAS) and multivalent virus-like particle presentation aimed to present multiple strains as individual trimers together on one particle to induce broad protection <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup>. Recently, genetically fused HAs of three strains from group 1 were successfully presented on one trimer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>. However, broadening the overall immune response by incorporating cross-group sequences on single trimer immunogens has not yet been demonstrated, likely due to structural incompatibilities of group 1 and group 2 sequences.</p>
<p>One approach to do so involves RBS sequence exchange. HA sequence replacements have successfully incorporated inter-subtype exchanges aimed to boost and broaden RBS-targeted antibody elicitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we hypothesised that the structural similarity in the HA head domain would be sufficient to tolerate changes required for sequence replacement of pandemic-relevant subtypes and that a stable trimeric immunogen with mixed head domains from different subtype HAs would be able to elicit a broader polyclonal response to cross-group HA subtypes towards expanding vaccine breadth in contrast to a vaccine cocktail. Here we design a cross-subtype HA chimera by structure-informed sequence exchange aimed to elicit an immune response to multiple HA subtypes of interest within and across groups which can also be readily incorporated as chimeric heterotrimers. In mice, the chimeric immunogens can elicit polyclonal cross-group immune responses. This study supports the use of cross-group chimeras as an efficient approach for multi-strain presentation in an influenza vaccine and an avenue for modularly incorporating vastly diverse HA subtypes on one trimer immunogen to increase the protective breadth of synthetic influenza immunogens.</p>

<title>Cross-group chimeric RBS by sequence replacement</title>
<p>The natural receptor that engages HA, sialic acid, binds through highly conserved residues in the core of the RBS, while most known neutralising antibodies bind through less conserved residues in the surrounding 4 segments of the RBS ring: the 190-helix, 220-loop, 150-loop, and the 150-loop (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>. We first explored the structural similarity of the HA head domain with closely related subtypes as well as distant cross-group subtypes. The four major RBS segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) show low sequence conservation between subtypes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, the HA head domain shows remarkable structural similarity even across groups, particularly at the RBS (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). We specifically compared H1 of A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (SI06) to H5 of A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and H3 of A/Hong Kong/1/1968, referred to in this paper as H1SI06, H5VN04, and H3HK68, respectively. HAs from these viruses have been structurally characterised in complex with RBS-specific antibodies. While H1SI06 was additionally selected for robust structural stability, H5VN04 and H3HK68 have been extensively structurally characterised in the presence of a number of neutralising antibodies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup>.</p>

</fig>
<p>We hypothesised that the structural similarity could be leveraged to replace the H1 RBS with other subtypes to present defined antigenic sites from more than one strain. We first exchanged cross-subtype residues within group 1. We replaced RBS residues that are surface exposed and critical for interaction with a subtype-specific antibody of H1SI06 with H5VN05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>. The resulting H1H5_Head chimera presented the RBS of H5VN04 in a background of H1SI06, the two strains originally showing 40.6% sequence identity of the four RBS segments (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). We used binding of the HA trimer interface-specific antibody FluA20<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">20</xref></sup> as an indicator of the adoption of native-like conformation, as this antibody relies on main chain interactions in the 220-loop provided the RBS is in native conformation. HA Head constructs H1H5_Head showed 62.6 nM apparent affinity for FluA20 IgG compared to 12 nM observed with H1SI06_Head wildtype while H1H5_Head showed low apparent affinity for a H5 RBS specific antibody, the kinetics could not be fit (Supplementary Fig. 1A-C). We then sought to assess the increased complexity of replacing cross-group residues from H3HK68 (H1H3_Head) where the sequence similarity of the RBS segments falls to 26.7% (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). While we observed 13.7 nM apparent affinity for FluA20 IgG, we could not detect binding of H1H3_Head to an H3 RBS-specific antibody (Supplementary Fig. 1D) suggesting the chimera adopted an overall Head conformation similar to native H1SI06, the RBS of H1H3_Head may not present full mimicry to H3 RBS in solution.</p>
<p>We sought to further investigate the structural integrity of the head domain as a result of cross-group residues replacement. While H1H5_Head showed a similar CD profile to the H1SI06 WT, we observed a decrease in Tm from 61°C in the H1SI06 to 40°C in the H1H5_Head (Supplementary Fig. 2A-B). The H1H3_Head showed a mixed coiled coil profile suggesting non-globularity in solution (Supplementary Fig. 2C). Yet, upon solving the crystal structure of both H1H5_Head and H1H3_Head in complex with FluA20 IgG, the transplanted RBS segments largely retain the structure of H1SI06 with the exception of the 130-loop not representative of either the H1SI06 WT base or the RBS replaced strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>-<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>). While this loop does not play a role in binding H5-specific antibody 13D4 IgG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>, there are at least three major contacts in the 130-loop for binding to H3-specific RBS targeting antibody F045-92 IgG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> which may be flexible in FluA20 binding or alone in solution compared to when bound to the RBS-targeting antibody (Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together, these data show that replacement of the RBS segments with cross-subtype and distant cross-group residues largely conserves RBS structure upon the stabilisation by FluA20 binding and may benefit from internal structural stabilisation to accurately present the RBS in solution.</p>

<sec id="s2b">
<title>Trimeric constructs improve stability and antigenic profile</title>
<p>Following the observation that the HA head chimera can be stabilised when complexed to FluA20, we reasoned that full length homotrimer constructs would similarly enhance the stability of the head domain and consequently contribute to accurate presentation of the engineered RBS. Previous studies have shown modularity of HA head and stem domains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref></sup>. We similarly incorporated the H1H5_Head and H1H3_Head with a H1SI06 stem sequence using a previously described approach to combine heterotypic head-stem constructs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup> (H1H5_FL and H1H3_FL, and H1H5_FL2 and H1H3_FL2) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The designs H1H5_FL and H1H3_FL bound with an apparent K<sub>D</sub> &gt;1 μM and 441 nM, to H5-RBS-specific 13D4 IgG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> and H3-RBS-specific F045-92 IgG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, respectively (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C-D</xref>). The affinities of H5VN04 and H3HK68 were 41 nM and 10 nM, respectively. We further improved the transplanted segments to better recapitulate subtype-specific antibody RBS binding by including additional epitope residues as observed in the H5-13D4 (PDB:6A0Z) and H3-F045-92 (PDB: 4O58) complexed crystal structures; residues were reverted to H1SI06 sequences for positions not directly contributing to subtype-specific antibody binding. Additionally, where the H5 or H3 subtype consensus residue identity differed from the specific strain residues of H5VN04 or H3HK68, consensus residue identities were incorporated (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A-B</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 4). The new full-length chimera H1H5_FL2 and H1H3_FL2 bound with an apparent K<sub>D</sub> of 137 nM and approximately 368 nM to their respective strain-specific RBS-targeting mAb (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). While mAb F045 was reported to have cross reactivity to some H1 strains, we observed weak binding which could not be fit (Supplementary Fig. 5), therefore binding to H1H3_FL2 increased over H1SI06 is the result of the designed H3 RBS chimerism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). The affinity of H1H3_FL2 to the H3-RBS-specific antibody did not vastly improve, yet both H1H5_FL2 and H1H3_FL2 are within 10-fold difference in affinity to the subtype-specific RBS antibody compared to their respective wildtype. Structural differences in the chimera RBS compared to the respective wildtype RBS, particularly at the 130-loop, may contribute to the difference in affinity. The RBS is a complex motif likely influenced by core residues in the HA head and replacement of only surface residues limits the ability to fully recapitulate the RBS structure, particularly of cross-group chimera. Nonetheless, the FL2 designs are stable in solution with a mixed alpha helix beta sheet profile by CD and are thermostable in contrast to the H1H3_Head design (Supplementary Fig. 6). These results highlight the benefit of using full length trimers to present increasingly radical RBS replacements.</p>

<title>Chimeras provide heterotrimeric compatibility of cross-group RBS</title>
<p>The homotrimeric chimera presents cross-subtype diversity at the RBS, yet the remaining head surface, particularly the trimerization interface, is conserved. Leveraging this property, we hypothesised that these chimeras would facilitate the formation of heterotrimeric constructs presenting cross-group RBS. While intra-group heterotrimerisation is possible via linked tandem heterotrimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>, the diversity between group 1 and group 2 sequences can complicate incorporation into heterotrimeric constructs as a result of sequence variability at the trimerization interfaces. Our cross-group RBS chimera presents the conserved H1SI06 trimerization interface thereby facilitating heterotrimeric incorporation of our chimeric full-length HA from any cross-group RBS replacement, in which each of the three monomers represents a unique RBS (H1, H5, H3) H1_H1H5_H1H3 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>). Using tandem linkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup>,we designed a H1_H1H5_H1H3 chimeric heterotrimer which shows a similar CD profile to full length H1SI06 WT and similar mass to a H1SI06 WT construct by mass photometry supporting the formation of trimer (Supplementary Fig. 7). The H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer binds an H1 RBS-specific antibody (CH65)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref></sup> with low nanomolar affinity (steady state apparent K<sub>D</sub> &gt;160 nM). The heterotrimer additionally binds a H5 RBS specific antibody (13D4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup> with nanomolar affinity and to an H3-specific antibody (F045-92 IgG)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> with micromolar affinity (steady state apparent &gt;200 nM and &gt;1 μM, respectively) (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B-D</xref>). The decrease in affinities from the chimeric subunits may be the result of the instability in solution of the fused heterotrimer as opposed to using an exogenous trimerization domain resulting in instability of the chimeric head. The heterotrimer does show a mixed secondary structure profile by CD yet the linear melting curve may be indicative of transient stability in solution (Supplementary Fig. 7). Incorporation of an exogenous trimerization domain in the genetically fused construct may improve stability of the heterotrimer and improve presentation of the chimera subunits. Taken together, these results indicate that heterotrimeric assembly of RBS chimera allows for modularity in the presentation of cross-group RBS on one immunogen.</p>

<title>Homotrimeric chimera elicits cross-group reactivity</title>
<p>Given the ability of the chimeric heterotrimer to engage with three subtype-RBS-specific antibodies, we further assess the chimeric heterotrimer for the ability to elicit antibodies to each replaced subtype. We immunised 6 groups of mice (n=5) with a homologous boost scheme of H1SI06 WT, H5VN04 WT, H3HK68 WT, H1H5_FL2, H1H3_FL2, or H1_H1H5_H1H3 chimeric heterotrimer (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>) and assessed reactivity to the subtype HA head domains. Both chimeric homotrimers (H1H5_FL2 and H1H3_FL2), as well as the H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer, show high serum IgG titers against H1 head domain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>). There no improvement of the serum IgG titers against H5 induced by H1H5_FL2 or H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer compared to base H1SI06, likely attributed to the existing cross-reactivity between H1 and H5 as closely related subtypes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>). On the other hand, the H1H3_FL2 chimera showed a significant improvement in H3 binding titers compared to H1SI06 WT (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, the H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer showed similar reactivity against the H3 head domain as H1SI06 WT did (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C-4D</xref>), indicating that a large proportion of the antibody response targets the conserved H1SI06 base.</p>

<p>Given the cross-reactivity of the chimeric immunogens, we assessed the neutralisation potency of the immune sera. The elicited sera from all novel immunogens H1H5_FL2, H1H3_FL2, and H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer were able to neutralise a pre-pandemic H1N1 virus (A/Brisbane/59/2007) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Br07 was used as the Br07 HA possesses 98.3% sequence identity to the HA SI06. In addition, the sera from H1H5_FL2 showed low neutralising activity against H5N1 (NIBRG-14, carrying HA derived from A/Vietnam/1194/2004), yet higher than the H1SI06 sera (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Likely the specific reactivity to H5 observed in ELISA by H1H5_FL2 was the contribution of the natural cross-reactivity of H1 and H5. However, increased neutralisation of H5N1 virus by H1H5_FL2 compared to H1SI06 corroborates that the antibodies elicited by H1H5_FL2 are specific to the H5 RBS beyond H1 cross-reactivity. Notably, the sera elicited by the chimeric immunogen H1H3_FL2 was able to neutralise H3N2 virus (A/X-31 vaccine strain) although less potently than the sera from homologous H3HK68 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The sera from the H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer neutralised H1N1 with a similar potency as H1SI06 WT immune sera, yet neutralisation of H5N1 or H3N2 was not detected at the tested serum dilutions (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A-C</xref>). Taken together, these data support the capacity of chimeric immunogens to elicit a cross-group polyclonal response against desired strains as a single trimer immunogen but when presented as a heterotrimer common antigenic sites are dominant in the immunogenic response.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Few sites on the HA head are conserved in sequence between subtypes, emphasised by the relatively rare neutralising head antibodies that are cross-reactive to different subtypes. Yet, these major antigenic sites are well defined for group 1 and group 2 subtypes and are strikingly similar in structure. We leverage the definition of these sites to replace the major segments of the RBS antigenic site across subtypes. The RBS chimera represents a mid-strain sequence consisting of elements from both strains in the HA head. These chimeric head domains would likely not emerge in nature as their vulnerability to H1 and H5 specific antibodies could present a disadvantage to viral fitness. However, leveraging this property as an immunogen may be able to elicit antibody responses bridging two HA subtypes. In naive mice, our H1H3 chimeric immunogen was able to induce immune serum that could potently neutralise not only H1N1, but H3N2 virus. Currently, the RBS chimera only presents two strains of interest which could be used for probing immunogenicity of specific strains. Notably, the strains used in this study share moderate sequence identity to currently circulating strains obtained through GISAID<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref></sup>. Compared to 2024-2025 recommended vaccine strains, H1SI06 shares 72.7% and 72.4% sequence identity to A/Wisconsin/67/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus and A/Victoria/4897/2022 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus respectively, while H3HK68 shares 83% sequence identity to both A/Thailand/8/2022 (H3N2)-like virus and A/Massachusetts/18/2022 (H3N2)-like virus. H5VN04, similarly, shares between 79.7% and 88.7% sequence identity to 2024 human-isolated H5 strains. The modularity presented by the RBS chimera allows for a rapid and flexible exchange of sequences and would be readily able to incorporate more recent circulating strains and could additionally incorporate consensus sequence strategies such as COBRA to improve the breadth of the exchanged RBS.</p>
<p>Current influenza vaccines incorporate HA of circulating strains as a cocktail vaccine. Here we propose a chimeric heterotrimer presenting three HA subtypes of pandemic interest as a single immunogen. The conservation of the HA head, apart from the major RBS antigenic site, encourages modularity of the chimeric heterotrimer without affecting heterotrimerization interfaces thereby allowing phylogenetically distinct strains to exist in a single trimer. While H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer showed low affinity to an H1-, H5- and H3-specific antibody, reduced from homotrimeric chimera, contribution from the H1 RBS to the binding of the H3- specific mAb F045-92 should be deduced with a H1 RBS mutant given the low cross-reactivity of the mAb to H1SI06. The H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer potently neutralised H1 but neutralisation was not detected by H5 or H3 head domain. Likely, the loss of avidity effects rendered the heterotrimer unable to engage with B-cell precursors targeting the RBS. Rather, the vast majority of antibodies were focused to the H1 conserved regions between the monomers and a small proportion targeted the H5 RBS or H3 RBS. For a heterotrimeric construct to support vaccine breadth by eliciting a polyclonal response to heterosubtypes, likely a larger sequence exchange will be required. Similar effects were observed in a study of heterotrimeric HIV constructs which benefited from improved neutralisation potency compared to homotrimeric counterparts, yet did not improve breadth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While we do not observe improved breadth with homotypic immunisation with H1_H1H5_H1H3 heterotrimer, such an immunogen may present a pathway to target antibody evolution and may be of use in heterotypic immunisation for germline-targeting and polishing vaccination strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. Further study of the antibody repertoire elicited may elucidate the benefit of the proximity of cross-strain RBS domains of such cross-group heterotrimers.</p>
<p>Here we demonstrate that a single immunogen presenting at least one major antigenic site from two phylogenetically diverse strains effectively produces a neutralising response in mice. Cross-group responses are critical in the progress of a broadly protective influenza vaccine. More broadly, the chimeric approach could be applied to viruses with large mutagenicity potential yet conserved structure, including the spike protein of coronaviruses.</p>

<title>HA RBS chimera design, and structure and sequence analysis</title>
<p>Design of HA head domain chimeras were computationally generated using a structurally-guided segment replacement approach. The H1 strain (A/Solomon Islands/3/2006(H1N1)) (SI06) was used as the base construct. Rosetta LayerDesign<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup> was used to computationally identify core, surface and boundary residues based on solvent exposure which defined residues available for graft replacement on SI06 (PDB ID: 6OC3). Grafted strains for H5 and H3 were selected based the availability of a crystal structure, VN04 (A/Vietnam/1194/2004(H5N1)) (PDB ID: 4BGW) and (A/Hong Kong/1/1968(H3N2)) (HK68) (PDB ID: 6OCB) respectively. Vaccine strain sequences and human-isolated 2025 H5N1 seequences for comparison were obtained using GISAID accession codes listed in Supplementary Table 3.</p>
<p>The structures were aligned using Pymol Super<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> to obtain a sequence independent Cα-based alignment. Consurf was used to determine the sequence variability between H1 and H5, or H1 and H3. A select dataset of sequences from 1960-2009 were selected from the Influenza virus database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref></sup> to form the multiple sequence alignment and consurf visualization. Replaced regions were defined as equivalent regions of known H1 epitopes with convergence on structural similarity to H5 or H3. If deviations were identified, the replacement segment was extended to regions of reconvergence. Rosetta-defined surface residues as well as solvent facing or inter-epitope facing boundary residues were selected for replacement. For FL2 designs, residues which made direct contact with the subtype-specific antibody were considered for subtype consensus residue identity rather than strain-specific residue identity. Residues which were not required for antibody binding were reverted to H1 native sequence to improve stability. The chimera designs were validated using Rosetta FastDesign to generate computational models and AlphaFold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> to validate the predicted structure.</p>

<p>Protein complexes were screened for crystals using several commercially-available crystallization screening kits, (JCSG-Plus, Peg/Ion, Index, SG1) using a sitting drop vapor diffusion method, testing both 1:1 and 2:1 ratio of protein to reservoir solution with a starting concentration of 10 mg/ml of complex and a reservoir volume of 50 uL. Crystal trays were allowed to incubate at 20°C and visualized every couple of days for crystals in a RockImager. Diffraction-quality crystals appeared between 10-15 days and were assessed to be protein crystals by UV.</p>

<p>Diffraction quality crystals of H1H5:FluA20 and H1H3:FluA20 complexes were grown in 0.2 M NH4NO3, 20% w/v PEG 3350 and 0.1 M PCB pH 6, 25% w/v PEG 1500, respectively. Crystals were cryo-preserved with 10% ethylene glycol, before being sent off for data collection. Data was collected at the Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) 22-ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The crystals were processed and diffracted to 2.00 and 2.06 Å, respectively. The crystals belonged to space group P 43 21 2 and P 1 21 1, respectively and contained a single copy of the antigen:fab complex in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement using Phenix PHASER program was used to resolve phases using PDB ID: 4BGW and 6OCB for H1H5 and H1H3 HA, respectively. For FluA20, PBD ID 6OBZ was used for molecular replacement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. Iterative rounds of refinement was performed using Coot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, and Phenix REFINE. Validation was performed using MOLPROBITY. The final refinement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The study by Castro et al. presents an interesting blueprint for designing influenza immunogens that can induce cross-group influenza-specific antibodies. The authors used a structure-based design to transplant receptor binding site (RBS) residues from H5 and H3 into an H1 scaffold. In addition, they assembled the transplanted structures as heterotrimers. They characterized the constructs structurally and used them to immunize mice to define ELISA binding and neutralizing antibodies (Abs) to different influenza strains.</p>
<p>Strengths and Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The authors succeeded in generating the different, correctly folded immunogens. The heterotrimers would benefit from more characterization: it remains unclear whether they are even formed or whether the sample is a mix of homotrimers and whether some combinations are more likely than others. While some of these questions are complex to answer, authors should at least confirm the presence of heterotrimers.</p>
<p>While all constructs were able to elicit H1-specific Abs, different immunogens displayed differential ability to induce a response to the transplanted epitope. While H3-transplant resulted in H3-specific Abs, this was not the case for H5 or the heterotrimers. The importance of the finding is that authors are able to elicit polyclonal Abs neutralizing group 1 and group 2 influenza viruses with a single immunogen. A more in-depth discussion on why the H3-transplant but not the H5-transplant resulted in those specific Abs could be beneficial.</p>
<p>Overall, the work is a proof of concept that H1-H3 chimeric proteins can be produced and an important first step towards computational vaccines, inducing Abs to multiple groups.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The manuscript from Castro et al describes the engineering of influenza hemagglutinin H1-based head domains that display receptor-binding-site residues from H5 and H3 HAs. The initial head-only chimeras were able to bind to FluA20, which recognizes the trimer interface, but did not bind well to H5 or H3-specific antibodies. Furthermore, these constructs were not particularly stable in solution as assessed by low melting temperatures. Crystal structures of each chimeric head in complex with FluA20 were obtained, demonstrating that the constructs could adopt the intended conformation upon stabilization with FluA20. The authors next placed the chimeric heads onto an H1 stalk to create homotrimeric HA ectodomains, as well as a heterotrimeric HA ectodomain. The homotrimeric chimeric HAs were better behaved in solution, and H3- and H5-specific antibodies bound to these trimers with affinities that were only about 10-fold weaker compared to their respective wildtype HAs. The heterotrimeric chimeric HA showed transient stability in solution and could bind more weakly to the H3- and H5-specific antibodies. Mice immunized with these trimers elicited cross-reactive binding antibodies, although the cross-neutralizing titers were less robust. The most positive result was that the H1H3 trimer was able to elicit sera that neutralized both H1 and H3 viruses.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The manuscript is very well-written with clear figures. The biophysical and structural characterizations of the antigen were performed to a high standard. The engineering approach is novel, and the results should provide a basis for further iteration and improvement of RBS transplantation.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The main limitation of the study is that there are no statistical tests performed for the immunogenicity results shown in Figures 4 and 5. It is therefore unknown whether the differences observed are statistically significant. Additionally, fits of the BLI data in Figure 3 to the binding model used to determine the binding constants should be shown.</p>
