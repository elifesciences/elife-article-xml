<title>Abstract</title><p>Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed circadian rhythms; however, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. To test the idea that circulating factors mediate age-dependent changes in peripheral rhythms, we compared the ability of human serum from young and old individuals to synchronize circadian rhythms in culture. We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) individuals at 14:00 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts. We found that young and old sera are equally competent at initiating robust ∼24h oscillations of a luciferase reporter driven by clock gene promoter. However, cyclic gene expression is affected, such that young and old sera promote cycling of different sets of genes. Genes that lose rhythmicity with old serum entrainment are associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer’s Disease as identified by STRING and IPA analyses. Conversely, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increased in the cells entrained with old serum. Genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions. We did not observe a global difference in the distribution of phase between groups, but found that peak expression of several clock-controlled genes (<italic>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2,</italic> and <italic>TEF</italic>) lagged in the cells synchronized <italic>ex vivo</italic> with old serum. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that age-dependent blood-borne factors affect circadian rhythms in peripheral cells and have the potential to impact health and disease via maintaining or disrupting rhythms respectively.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Circadian rhythms are known to regulate homeostatic physiology including sleep:wake, hormone production and body temperature, and their dysregulation with aging is accompanied by adverse health consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref></sup>, raising the possibility that health decline with age is caused in part by circadian dysfunction. Although the mechanisms responsible for age effects on circadian rhythms are unknown, signals from the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) dampen with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup> and rhythms change in peripheral tissues in different ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref></sup>. Here we aimed to develop a cell culture model to study the effect of aging on human rhythms of peripheral tissues. Given that serum can reset the clock in peripheral fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>, we questioned the extent to which serum factors normally contribute to peripheral rhythms of gene expression and how they might affect rhythms with age, given that blood-borne factors can influence other aspects of aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Using an established clinical study paradigm that sampled blood at 14:00<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>, we collected blood from young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) apparently healthy individuals with behavioral and physiological outputs quantified by wearable devices, and we tested the hypothesis that age-dependent factors in the sera affect circadian rhythms in cultured fibroblasts. In support of this hypothesis, we show here that genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial functions lose rhythmicity in fibroblasts exposed to aged serum factors. We also find evidence of reduced entrainment in terms of altered expression of several molecular clock genes (<italic>PER3, NR1D1, NR1D2, CRY1, CRY2</italic> and <italic>TEF</italic>) when synchronized with aged serum. These findings suggest that age-related changes in blood borne factors contribute to impaired circadian physiology and the associated disease risks.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We enrolled 8 old and 7 young human subjects (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.1A</xref>, Tables S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs2">Fig. S2</xref>), whose demographics are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls1">Table S1</xref>. The behavioral and physiological assessments confirmed entrainment to the light-dark conditions local to the East Coast of the US. This is, for example, evident in the diurnal rhythms observed for physical activity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref> top, vector magnitude two-way ANOVA for time-of-day <italic>q</italic>=3.3E-06), light exposure (lux two-way ANOVA for time-of-day <italic>q</italic>=0.01), heart rate (bpm two-way ANOVA for time-of-day <italic>q</italic>=0.016) and sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system indices derived from the Kubios heart rate variability analysis (two-way ANOVA for time-of-day <italic>q</italic>=0.099 and <italic>q</italic>=0.063, respectively).</p>

<p>Experimental protocol for enrolment and monitoring of human subjects (A, made with BioRender.com). As assessed by Zyphyr BioPatch, electrocardiogram (EKG) measurements suggest that MESOR of average heart rate decreases with age (p=0.056) and that MESOR of heart rate variability increases with age (p=0.056). N=5 per group. MESOR and amplitude were tested using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum exact test, while phase was tested by Kuiper’s two-sample test (B). Average activity counts across three axes (vector magnitude), as recorded by the actigraph device plotted throughout the day (top) and analyzed for circadian rhythm (bottom) (C). While the amplitudes of activity did not differ between the age groups, the older individuals trended towards an early phase (p∼0.055, Kupier’s two-sample test) compared to young individuals. N=7 for young and N=8 for old. Lines in the top panel of C are smoothed means (fit with penalized cubic regression splines) for data from each age group. Dots in the bottom panel of C are subject-level cosinor parameter estimates derived from cosinor fits to the actigaraphy data. Boxplot midlines correspond to median values, while the lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and their quartiles, respectively. Boxplot whiskers extend to the smallest/largest points within 1.5 * IQR (Inter Quartile Range) of the lower/upper hinge.</p></caption>

</fig>
<p>Age-specific differences emerged for several outputs. The standard deviation of instantaneous heart rate values was significantly lower in the old compared to young (two-way ANOVA for age group q=0.042). As expected, the peak clock time (acrophase) of physical activity (triaxial accelerometry integrated as vector magnitude) was phase-advanced among old compared to young subjects, as was the midsleep time calculated from the MCTQ (Fig S1B), though not at a statistically significant level (p=0.055). On average, a lower rhythm-adjusted mean (mesor) heart rate of 55.8±3.5 bpm was found in old compared to 69.7±5.0 bmp in young, along with a higher heart rate variability (RR intervals) of 1106.7±80.5 ms compared to 893.2±61.8 ms, respectively (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Old subjects displayed lower activity in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and higher activity in the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) compared to young (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1A</xref>), with no significant difference in cortisol levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs1">Fig. S1C</xref>). The overall high degree of variability rendered the cardiovascular trends, however, statistically not significant.</p>
<p>As noted above, blood was collected from these old/young individuals and the serum was used to synchronize BJ-5TA fibroblasts stably transfected with a <italic>BMAL1-luciferase</italic> construct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">11</xref></sup>. Circadian rhythms were assessed by luciferase assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref></sup> over 4 days (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). We conducted this study in a fibroblast line in order to build upon age-related changes found in a previous study which used human fibroblast lines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. An additional rationale for using this line is that it derives from normal human tissue, providing an advantage in studying normal physiology when compared to the commonly used U2OS line which is a genomically unstable osteosarcoma with chromosomal abnormalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref></sup>. No significant differences were observed in the period, amplitude, and phase of the <italic>BMAL1-luciferase</italic> rhythm with young versus old serum treatment (Fig S3).</p>

<caption><title>The circadian transcriptome is differentially affected by entrainment with sera from young and old human subjects.</title>
<p>A visual representation of the serum starvation-serum addition protocol to synchronize the <italic>BMAL1-luciferase</italic> BJ-5TA fibroblasts (<bold>A</bold>, made with BioRender.com). When comparing the circadian transcriptome entrained by either young or old sera (n=4 sera per group), 1519 genes lost rhythmicity with age (B, top) while only 637 genes gained rhythmicity with age (B, bottom). Weighted BIC criterion with a threshold of 0.75 was used to assess rhythmicity <bold>(B)</bold>. The number of genes rhythmic in young and old (according to weighted BIC &gt; 0.75 criterion) that show a detectable change in MESOR (q &lt; 0.05 criterion for MESOR difference) is 568, with MESOR increasing in 163 and decreasing in 405 genes. Out of these, 40 genes with increased MESOR (red) and 98 genes with decreased MESOR (blue) also satisfy the condition |log<sub>2</sub>FC| &gt; 0.25 <bold>(C)</bold>. We were only able to detect change in amplitude for a small number of genes, 39 genes had decreased amplitude in old and 2 had increased amplitude using CircaCompare. Only 30 genes with decreased amplitude also satisfy the condition |log<sub>2</sub> FC| &gt; 0.1 (blue) <bold>(D)</bold>. For phase, using a test provided by CircaCompare, under q &lt; 0.05 cutoff for age-related phase differences in genes rhythmic in young and old (with BIC&gt;0.75 cycling criteria), we detected 20 genes with advanced phase, and 34 with delayed phase <bold>(E)</bold>.</p></caption>
<graphic xlink:href="537477v2_fig2.tif" mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image"/>
</fig>
<p>To assess serum effects on circadian gene expression, we first performed RNA-seq on fibroblasts synchronized with serum from a single old or single young individual at two hour intervals and found that, compared to the first day of synchronization, the second day (36-58 hours after synchronization) showed greater differences in MESORs between young and old serum-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs4">Fig. S4</xref>). This is not surprising because the first day includes acute responses of the fibroblasts to serum, which can mask circadian rhythms, and so the second day is expected to reveal differences in endogenous rhythms between samples. Day 2 also revealed different phases of cyclic expression between young and old subjects for a larger number of genes. We proceeded to collect fibroblasts synchronized by sera from eight different subjects (four old, four young with two male and two female per group) at two-hour intervals, from 32 to 58 hours post serum addition. This added an extra two timepoints to the second day to facilitate the calculation of rhythmicity. Using CircaCompare<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref></sup> and a weighted Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)&gt;0.75 cutoff, a significant number of genes were found to lose (1519 genes) or gain (637 genes) rhythmicity with age, underscoring the impact of age on the ability of serum to synchronize circadian rhythms, while 1209 genes were rhythmic in both groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, 3A). Additionally, we used CircaCompare to estimate MESORs, amplitudes, and phases of gene oscillatory patterns in young and old groups, and to compare these cosinor parameters between groups (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C-D</xref>). Of the genes that were rhythmic in both groups, many also showed changes with age. For instance, 568 cyclically expressed genes showed a change in MESOR with age (q &lt; 0.05 for MESOR differences), with MESOR values increasing for 163 genes and decreasing for 405 genes in the old serum-treated samples (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, S5, right). Using q-values provided by CircaCompare we were able to detect changes in amplitude (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>, S5, left) for only a small number of genes (39 genes had decreased amplitude in old and 2 had increased amplitude). Using CircaCompare and a q &lt; 0.05 cutoff for phase differences in genes rhythmic in young and old, we detected 20 genes with advanced phase, and 34 with delayed phases (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>). However, it is important to note that in these analyses low p-values can be driven by large sample-size such as in Fig S5 where distributions of MESORs and amplitudes across genes are assessed such that each gene represents a sample.</p>
<p>As mentioned, we found several examples of transcripts that cycle with young serum synchronization and lose rhythmicity (ex. TCF4), decrease in amplitude (ex. HMGB2), phase shift (ex. TEF), or change MESOR (ex. HSD17B7) with aged serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figs6">Fig. S6</xref>). Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">14</xref></sup> and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">15</xref></sup> were used for functional genomics. Both approaches indicate a maintenance of cycling of cell cycle genes with young and old serum synchronization, and a loss of rhythmicity of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation in the aged serum (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref> and S7). STRING analysis revealed that the dominant pathways associated with genes rhythmic in both young and old conditions, cell cycle and DNA replication, demonstrate a decrease in MESOR with old serum. For instance, checkpoint control and chromosomal replication pathway associated genes were expressed cyclically in both young and old conditions; however, several chromosomal replication pathway genes exhibit decreased MESORs in the aged sera (Fig S7 D,E, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls3">Table S3</xref>). MESORs of steroid biosynthesis genes, particularly those relating to cholesterol biosynthesis, were increased in the old sera condition (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbls4">Table S4</xref>).</p>

<caption><title>Each type of circadian change is associated with different KEGG pathways by STRING analysis, but a similar set of transcription factors identified by LISA</title>
<p>Entrainment of the fibroblasts in culture with old serum significantly altered the circadian transcriptome despite use of the same cells in both young and old conditions, suggesting the aged serum itself affects the regulation of specific pathways in the cell. Significant KEGG Pathways (FDR &lt;1x10<sup>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref></sup> unless specified) are indicated next to each category of genes. Age related pathways such as Alzheimer’s Disease/oxidative phosphorylation are associated with a loss of rhythms in the old condition. Cell cycle and DNA replication pathways remain rhythmic in the old serum condition, but cycle with a decreased MESOR. Rhythmic genes were determined using CircaCompare. Rhythmicity was determined using the weighted BIC &gt; 0.75 criterion while p-values for difference in MESOR and phase were determined using CircaCompare <bold>(A)</bold>. LinC similarity analysis (LISA), based on known transcription factor binding in fibroblasts and RNA expression, suggests that 59 total transcription factors (q&lt;0.05) show significant changes in activity in conjunction with the following cycling phenotypes: decreased in MESOR, increased in MESOR, phase delay, gain of rhythmicity, and loss of rhythmicity as were defined above <bold>(B)</bold>.</p></caption>

<p>Loss of rhythms in oxidative phosphorylation suggests mitochondrial dysfunction with age. By STRING analysis, 24 out of the 26 genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation overlap with the Alzheimer’s Disease KEGG pathway highlighting the disease relevance of this class of genes that loses cycling in older individuals. Given that Alzheimer’s pathology is closely associated with the accumulation of oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref></sup>, it is possible that loss of cycling contributes to oxidative damage. An additional 31 genes in the Alzheimer’s Disease KEGG pathway lose rhythmicity with aged serum; these include amyloid precursor protein (APP) and apolipoprotein E (APOE). APP is by definition the precursor of amyloid beta, which accumulates in AD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref></sup>. While APOE plays an important role in lipid transport, specific variants of this gene are strongly associated with AD risk as APOE interacts with amyloid beta in amyloid plaques, a hallmark of the disease <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To determine whether aged serum modifies the activity of specific transcription factors, we performed an epigenetic Landscape In Silico deletion analysis (LISA), a computational tool designed to predict changes in transcription factor activity based on gene expression. Using a comprehensive database of known transcription factor binding profiles of fibroblasts, we identified altered gene expression corresponding to 59 total transcription factors (q&lt;0.05) in our young-versus-old cycling dataset. Potential changes in the activity of these transcription factors are associated with the following five categories of cycling phenotypes: decreased MESOR, increased MESOR, phase delay, gain of rhythmicity, and loss of rhythmicity, as were defined above (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). 26 transcription factors were represented in all groups, and included those implicated in diseases such as cancer (MYC, TP53, YAP1, RBL2, E2F7, BRD4, MXl1), inflammation (CEBPB, BHLHE40), oxidative stress (NFE2L2), and neurological conditions (NEUROG2, SUMO2).</p>
<p>Lastly, several clock genes showed differences in expression with the aged serum, most notably genes in the Circadian Rhythm KEGG pathway (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). In particular, expression of <italic>CRY1</italic>, <italic>CRY2</italic>, <italic>NR1D1</italic>, <italic>NR1D2</italic>, <italic>PER3</italic>, and <italic>TEF</italic> was significantly phase delayed after synchronization with old serum compared to young (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Studies of the aged SCN have revealed persistent cycling of clock gene expression but a breakdown of output signals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref></sup>. However, whether age-related changes in systemic signaling impact tissue/organ clocks has yet to be elucidated. We demonstrate here that while the core clock continues to cycle in cultured fibroblasts synchronized with serum from old volunteers, the circadian transcriptome is different from that seen in cells treated with serum from young individuals. Through this analysis of the role of serum in age-induced changes in circadian rhythms, we suggest a potential mechanism for observations where specific genes showed a loss, gain, or maintenance of rhythmicity with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref></sup>. This phenomenon, known as circadian reprogramming, may illuminate which pathways are affected by or become more impactful for changes in cellular integrity through aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>In order to study the effect of circulating factors on age-related changes of the circadian transcriptome, we utilized the well-established serum starvation-serum addition protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup> to synchronize cells in culture. Cultured fibroblasts from old and young subjects have robust clocks and respond similarly to synchronization with dexamethasone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>; however, when synchronized with dexamethasone in a media containing old serum, they reportedly exhibited shortened circadian periods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref></sup>. This effect was reversed by heat inactivating old serum. We did not observe a significant difference in period length between young and old serum synchronization in our <italic>BMAL1-luciferase</italic> experiment, perhaps because dexamethasone was not utilized. Our use of serum to synchronize allowed us to more closely simulate <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions where blood is an important mode by which central clocks can entrain peripheral clocks to maintain synchrony with the day:night cycle. Previously, serum factors were shown to activate the immediate early transcription factor, SRF, in a diurnal manner to confer time of day signals to both cells in culture and to mouse liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref></sup>. We show here that effects of age are also mediated by serum.</p>
<p>We find that while the number of rhythmic transcripts (weighted BIC&gt;0.75) in the young serum condition (∼18%) is higher than the old serum condition (∼12%), both conditions demonstrate a much larger number of cycling transcripts in these cultured fibroblasts than in other cell culture studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref></sup>. In mammals, up to 20% of transcripts can cycle in a given tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref></sup>, and the low number of cycling transcripts in culture has been cited as a major limitation of the culture model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref></sup>. While our analysis used a normal human fibroblast cell line (BJ-5TA) we had higher statistical power, given that we had four different biological replicates at every 2-hour timepoint. However, a major contributing factor to the high rhythmicity might be the use of human serum as the synchronization signal. In this way, our model of mimicking signaling to peripheral tissues by using serum directly from humans may more accurately recapitulate the human condition. In this study we focused only on the effects of serum synchronization on fibroblasts, but it is likely that factors circulating in serum act on several tissues, and so their effects are relatively broad. However, we acknowledge that in order to support this claim future studies should investigate other peripheral tissue cell types. Additionally, in the future we intend to analyze the serum using a combination of fractionation and either proteomics or metabolomics to identify relevant factors for the regulation of peripheral rhythms.</p>
<p>Interestingly, many of the genes in the circadian transcriptome that exhibit age-related changes are independently implicated in aging. For instance, some of the genes that lose rhythmicity in the aged condition are involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial function, both of which decrease with age<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup>. Previous work in the field demonstrates that synchronization of the circadian clock in culture results in cycling of mitochondrial respiratory activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref></sup> further underscoring the different effects of old serum, which does not support oscillations of oxidative phosphorylation associated transcripts. Age-dependent decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and increase in mitochondrial dysfunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref></sup> is seen also in aged fibroblasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref></sup> and contributes to age-related diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">35</xref></sup>. We suggest that the age-related inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is conferred by serum signals to the cells such that oxidative phosphorylation cycles are mitigated. On the other hand, loss of cycling could contribute to impairments in mitochondrial function with age.</p>
<p>Both pathway analyses utilized here identified increased MESORs of steroid biosynthesis components in the aged sera condition. In particular, the genes identified in this pathway are associated with cholesterol biosynthesis. Since elderly individuals typically have lower levels of cholesterol biosynthesis and higher levels of circulating cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref></sup>, we were surprised to see increased expression of biosynthesis transcripts. Perhaps the cholesterol synthesis related RNA levels are high as a response to low levels of cholesterol synthesis proteins within the cell. Previous studies in cultured hepatocytes demonstrated that increased reactive oxygen species resulted in higher levels of transcripts associated with cholesterol biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref></sup>. Given that deficits in oxidative phosphorylation are already implicated in these findings, it is possible that oxidative stress plays a role in the increase of cholesterol biosynthesis transcripts.</p>
<p>Although our findings are largely supported by the aging literature, the relatively small sample size of our study necessitates follow up studies to control for individual differences between subjects. We observed variations in luminescence and transcript traces across individuals and while we did not see changes that could account for the overall significant differences in transcript cycling between young and old subjects, we cannot exclude the possibility that factors other than aging contribute to these data.</p>
<p>Together, these findings indicate that at least some of the age-related changes in the cultured fibroblast circadian transcriptome are derived from signals circulating in the serum and not the age of the cells. This has profound implications for understanding and treating circadian disruption with age, and could also be relevant for other age-related pathology, given established links between circadian disruption and diseases of aging. Notably, many of the genes whose cycling is affected by old serum contribute to age-associated disorders.</p>

After obtaining informed consent from all volunteers, study assessments were conducted in the Center for Human Phenomic Science (Penn CHPS#3002) in accordance with relevant GCP guidelines and regulations. We originally intended on recruiting n=20 per group; however, patient recruitment was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants met criteria for inclusion (in general good health, either 70-85 years of age for the elderly cohort or 20-35 years of age for the young cohort, and a wrist-actigraphy-based average TST (total sleep time) ≥ 6 hours per night occurring between 22:00 – 08:00). Participants were excluded due to pregnancy or nursing, shift work (defined as recurring work between 22:00-05:00), a history of clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea, transmeridian travel across ≥2 time zones in the two weeks prior to study assessments and one week after, &gt; 2 drinks of alcohol per day, and use of illicit drugs. The subject-specific midsleep preferences were quantified using the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref></sup>.

<title>Acquisition of accelerometry data streams</title>
<p>Participants wore a triaxial actigraph device (wGT3X-BT, ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) on the non-dominant wrist. The devices were initialized using the following parameters: start date and time were synchronized with atomic server time without pre-defined stop date/time, at 60 Hz sampling rate for the three accelerometer axes, enabled for delay modus, steps, lux, inclinometer, and sleep while active. Raw data were downloaded from the device in AGD and GT3X file format in one second epochs using ActiLife software (version 6, ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL) and submitted for further analyses. For visualization and cosinor analysis, actigraphy data were aggregated into 1-minute intervals by summing ActiGraph counts across each minute. Cosinor analyses of the data were adapted from the single component cosinor analysis reviewed by Cornelissen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref></sup>, as well as the cosine fit described by Refinetti et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">40</xref></sup>. Briefly, the measurement times for the actigraphy data were recalculated as hours since midnight on the first day of measurement, within each participant’s data. For each actigraphy variable and each participant, the lm() function in R (v4.2.0) was used to perform a cosinor fit with a fixed 24-hour period. The two cosinor coefficients from these fits were used to calculate participant-level amplitudes and circadian phases, while the intercepts provided MESOR estimates. The two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum exact test, as implemented by R’s wilcox.test() function, was used to test for significant differences in amplitude and MESOR between the age groups. A two-sample Kuiper’s test, as implemented by the kuiper_test(nboots = 10000) function from the twosamples R package (v2.0.0), was used to test for significant differences in circadian phase between the age groups.</p>

Serum starvation was staggered every 12 hours over two days to allow for samples to be collected on the same day. Upon sample collection wells were place on ice and rinsed with cold DPBS and then put in cold RLT buffer with 2-Mercaptoethanol (10µL/mL). Samples were frozen at -80 overnight and sent to Admera for RNA extraction and sequencing. Total RNA was extracted with RNeay mini kit (Qiagen). Isolated RNA sample quality was assessed by High Sensitivity RNA Tapestation (Agilent Technologies Inc., California, USA) and quantified by Qubit 2.0 RNA HS assay (ThermoFisher, Massachusetts, USA). Paramagnetic beads coupled with oligo d(T)25 are combined with total RNA to isolate poly(A)+ transcripts based on NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module manual (New England BioLabs Inc., Massachusetts, USA). Prior to first strand synthesis, samples are randomly primed (5 ’ d(N6) 3 ’ [N=A,C,G,T]) and fragmented based on manufacturer’s recommendations.

<p>Sympathetic nervous system (SNS, A, top) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS, A, bottom) indices were measured using EKG. Amplitude, MESOR, and Phase were calculated from the resulting oscillations and the Median, quartiles, and SEMs are shown. Dots represent individuals. P&gt;0.05. N=5 per group. MESOR and amplitude were tested using Wilcoxon rank sum exact test, while phase was tested by Kuiper’s two-sample test. Boxplot midlines correspond to median values, while the lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles, respectively. Boxplot whiskers extend to the smallest/largest points within 1.5 * IQR (inter Quartile Range) of the lower/upper hinge (A). Boxplot distributions of midsleep times for subjects in the young (black) and old (red) cohorts. The midsleep time is advanced in the old subjects compared to young by Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) p=0.036). We calculated midsleep times for each subject from their responses to the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire (MCTQ). N=5 per group. We were not able to calculate midsleep times for four subjects (two from the old cohort and two from the young cohort) because they used alarms to wake on their non-working days and one old subject because they exhibited a total sleep time less than 6 hours (B). Serum cortisol levels are not statistically different by unpaired t-test (C, N=7 young, 8 old).</p></caption>

<p>From the IPA analyses, the eIF2 signaling pathway was enriched (BIC &gt;0.75) in two datasets: 1) genes cycling in the young sera and not the old and 2) cycling genes phase-advanced in the old sera (q&lt;0.05). A significant number of genes that maintain rhythmicity in the old sera condition are phase advanced as visualized in the heat map (A) or plot of peak phase (B). Note, the data in the peak phase plot are double-plotted. This means the range of the x-axis is doubled and the datapoints between 0 and 24 are duplicated in the right half of the plot. Phase is a circular metric meaning a phase of 0 is equivalent to a phase of 24 (1 ⇔ 25, 2 ⇔ 26, etc). Double-plotting is used to visualize data with repeated patterns or when data straddle the 24-0 boundary. As the eIF2 pathway is involved in protein translation, this suggests that the timing of protein translation is phase advanced in the older serum and/or less rhythmic.</p></caption>

<p>Aging is associated with a number of physiologic changes including perturbed circadian rhythms. However, mechanisms by which rhythms are altered remain unknown. Here authors tested the hypothesis that age-dependent factors in the sera affect the core clock or outputs of the core clock in cultured fibroblasts. They find that both sera from young and old donors are equally potent at driving robust ~24h oscillations in gene expression, and report the surprising finding that the cyclic transcriptome after stimulation by young or old sera differs markedly. In particular, genes involved in the cell cycle and transcription/translation remain rhythmic in both conditions, while genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and Alzheimer's Disease lose rhythmicity in the aged condition. Also, the expression of cycling genes associated with cholesterol biosynthesis increases in the cells entrained with old serum. Together, the findings suggest that age-dependent blood-borne factors, yet to be identified, affect circadian rhythms in the periphery. The most interesting aspect of the paper is that the data suggest that the same system (BJ-5TA), may significantly change its rhythmic transcriptome depending on how the cells are synchronized. While there is a succinct discussion point on this, it should be expanded and described whether there are parallels with previous works, as well as what would be possible mechanisms for such an effect.</p>
<p>Comments on revised version:</p>
<p>The authors have done a thorough revision of their manuscripts and provided convincing answers to all of my points. In particular, I applaud the authors for having added raw luminescence traces, and for providing Figure S5 on the amplitudes. Perhaps the authors could add a comment in the final text that the amplitudes are fairly low, 10^0.1 = 1.25 which means that the bulk of those genes has rhythms of at most 25%, which could reflect that the synchronization of the cells is partial.</p>

While there is a succinct discussion point on this, it should be expanded and described whether there are parallels with previous works, as well as what would be possible mechanisms for such an effect.</p>

<p>We’ve expanded our discussion in the manuscript to discuss possible mechanisms and also how the genes/pathways implicated in our study relate to other aging literature.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Major points:</p>
<p>Fig 1 and Table S1. Serum composition and levels of relevant blood-borne factors probably change in function of time. At what time of the day were the serum samples from the old and young groups collected? This important information should be provided in the text and added to Table S1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made sure to highlight the collection time in the abstract of the manuscript “We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) individuals at 14:001 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts.” The time of blood draw is also in sections of the paper (Intro and Methods). Since Table S1 is demographic information, we did not think that the blood draw time fit best there, but hopefully it is now clear in the text.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What was the rationale to use these cells over the more common U2OS cells? Are there similarities between the rhythmic transcriptomes of the BJ-5TA cells and that of U2OS cells or other human cells? This could easily be assessed using published datasets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The original rationale to use BJ-5TA fibroblast cells was that we were aiming to build upon an observation found in a previous study2 which showed that circadian period changes with age in human fibroblasts. While our findings did not match theirs, we think an added benefit of using the BJ-5TA line is that unlike U2OS cells, it is not a carcinoma derived cell line. We’ve added this point in lines 98-101.</p>
<p>Our study finds many more rhythmic transcripts compared to the previous studies examining U2OS cells. This can be attributed to several factors including differences in methods, including the use of human serum in our study, cell type differences, or decoupling of rhythms in some cancer cells. While a comparison of BJ-5TA cells and U2OS cells could be interesting, a proper comparison requires investigation of many data sets, since any pair of BJ-5TA and U2OS data sets will most likely differ in some detail of experimental design or data processing pipeline, which could contribute to observed differences in rhythmic transcripts.</p>
<p>That being said, we compared clock reference genes (see Author response image 1) between BJ-5TA and U2OS cells, comparing circadian profiles obtained from our data with those available on CircaDB. These circadian profiles exhibit many similarities and a few differences. The peak to trough ratios (amplitudes) are quite similar for ARNTL, NR1D1, NR1D2, PER2, PER3, and are about 25% lower for CRY1 and somewhat higher for TEF (about 15%) in our data. We find that the MESORS are generally similar with the exception of NR1D1 which is much lower and NR1D2 which is much higher in our data.</p>

<title>BJ-5TA and U2OS Cells Exhibit Similar Profiles of Circadian Gene Transcription.</title>
<p>We compared the transcriptomic profiles of the BJ-5TA cells in young and old serum (left) to the U2OS transcriptomic data (right) available on CircaDB, a database containing profiles of several circadian reference genes in U2OS cells. This figure suggests that circadian profiles of these genes exhibit many similarities. We find that the peak to trough ratios (amplitudes) are similar for ARNTL, NR1D1, NR1D2, Per2, PER3, and that the MESORS are similar (with the exception of NR1D1 which is much lower and NR1D2 which is much higher in the BJ-5TA cells). We find that the amplitudes of CRY1 is ~25% lower and TEF is ~15% higher for the BJ5TA cells. The axis for plots on the left show counts divided by 3.5 in order to made MESORs of ARNTL similar to ease comparison.</p>

<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the rhythmic cell cycle genes, could this be the consequence of the serum which synchronizes also the cell cycle, or is it rather an effect of the circadian oscillator driving rhythms of cell cycle genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point. Given our previous data showing that the cell cycle gene cyclin D1 is regulated by clock transcription factors3, we believe the circadian oscillator drives, or at least contributes, to rhythms of cell cycle genes. However, the serum clearly makes a difference as we find that MESORs of cell cycle genes decrease with aged serum. This is consistent with the decreased proliferation previously observed in aged human tissue4.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the reduction of rhythmicity in the old serum for oxidative phosphorylation transcripts is very interesting and fits with the general theme that metabolic function decreases with age, it is puzzling that the recipient cells are the same, but it is only the synchronization by the old and young serum that changes. Are the authors thus suggesting that decrease of metabolic rhythms is primarily a non cell-autonomous and systemic phenomenon? What would be a potential mechanism?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are indeed suggesting this, although it is also possible that it is not cycling <italic>per se</italic>, but rather an overall inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation that is conveyed by the serum. Relating other work in the field to our findings, we’ve added the following to our discussion: “Previous work in the field demonstrates that synchronization of the circadian clock in culture results in cycling of mitochondrial respiratory activity5,6 further underscoring the different effects of old serum, which does not support oscillations of oxidative phosphorylation associated transcripts. Age-dependent decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and increase in mitochondrial dysfunction7 has been seen in aged fibroblasts8 and contributes to age-related diseases9. We suggest that the age-related inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is conferred by serum signals to the cells such that oxidative phosphorylation cycles are mitigated. On the other hand, loss of cycling could contribute to impairments in mitochondrial function with age.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The delayed shifts after aged serum for clock transcripts (but not for Bmal1) are interesting and indicate that there may be a decoupling of Bmal1 transcript levels from the other clock gene phases. How do the authors interpret this? could it be related to altered chronotypes in the elderly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One possible explanation is that the delay of NPAS2, BMAL1’s binding partner, results in the delay of the transcription of clock controlled genes/negative arm genes. Since the RORs do not seem to be affected, Bmal is transcribed/translated as usual, but there isn’t enough NPAS2 to bind with BMAL1. In this case downstream genes are slower to transcribe causing the phase delay.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p>
<p>Schwarz et al. have presented a study aiming to investigate whether circulating factors in sera of subjects are able to synchronize depending on age, circadian rhythms of fibroblast. The authors used human serum taken from either old (age 70-76) or young (age 25-30) individuals to synchronise cultured fibroblasts containing a clock gene promoter driven luciferase reporter, followed by RNA sequencing to investigate whole gene expression.</p>
<p>This study has the potential to be very interesting, as evidence of circulating factors in sera that mediate peripheral rhythms has long been sought after. Moreover, the possibility that those factors are affected by age which could contribute to the weaken circadian rhythmicity observed with aging.</p>
<p>Here, the authors concluded that both old and young sera are equally competent at driving robust 24 hour oscillations, in particular for clock genes, although the cycling behaviour and nature of different genes is altered between the two groups, which is attributed to the age of the individuals. This conclusion could however be influenced by individual variabilities within and between the two age groups. The groups are relatively small, only four individual two females and two males, per group. And in addition, factors such as food intake and exercise prior to blood drawn, or/and chronotype, known to affect systemic signals, are not taken into consideration. As seen in figure 4, traces from different individuals vary heavily in terms of their patterns, which is not addressed in the text. Only analysing the summary average curve of the entire group may be masking the true data. More focus should be attributed to investigating the effects of serum from each individual and observing common patterns. Additionally, there are many potential causes of variability, instead or in addition to age, that may be contributing to the variation both, between the groups and between individuals within groups. All of this should be addressed by the authors and commented appropriately in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not aware of any specific feature distinguishing the subjects (other than age) that could account for the differences between old and young. The fact that we see significant differences between the two groups, even with the relatively small size of the groups, suggests strongly that these differences are largely due to age. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that individual variability can be a contributing factor. For instance, the change in phase of clock genes appears to be driven largely by two subjects. We have commented on this and individual differences, in general, in the discussion.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The authors also note in the introduction that rhythms in different peripheral tissues vary in different ways with age, however the entire study is performed on only fibroblast, classified as peripheral tissue by the authors. It would be very interesting to investigate if the observed changes in fibroblast are extended or not to other cell lines from diverse organ origin. This could provide information about whether circulating circadian synchronising factors could exert their function systemically or on specific tissues. At the very least, this hypothesis should be addressed within the discussion.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is likely that factors circulating in serum act on several tissues, and so their effects are relatively broad. However, this would require extensive investigation of other tissues. We now discuss this in the manuscript.</p>

<p>In addition to the limitations indicated above I consider that the data of the study is an insufficiently analysis beyond the rhythmicity analysis. Results from the STRING and IPA analysis were merely descriptive and a more comprehensive bioinformatic analysis would provide additional information about potential molecular mechanism explaining the differential gene expression. For example, enrichment of transcription factors binding sites in those genes with different patters to pinpoint chromatin regulatory pathways.</p>

<p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p>
<p>The two reviewers and reviewing editor have agreed on the following recommendations for the authors:</p>
<p>Major:</p>
<p>(1) The bioinformatic analysis would benefit from a more thorough focus on variability between individuals. Specifically, the main conclusion of the manuscript could be significantly influenced by individual variabilities within and between the two age groups. This is of particular concern, as the groups are relatively small (four individual two females and two males, per group). In addition, the consideration of factors such as food intake and exercise prior to blood drawn, or/and chronotype, known to affect systemic signals should be more adequately explained. The lab is an experienced chronobiology lab, and thus we are confident that these factors had been thought of, but this needs to be better made clear.</p>
<p>As seen in Figure 4, traces from different individuals vary heavily in terms of their patterns, which is not addressed in the text. Only analysing the summary average curve of the entire group may be masking the relevant data. Furthermore, there are many potential causes of variability, instead or in addition to age, that may be contributing to the variation both, between the groups and between individuals within groups. All of this should be addressed by the authors and commented appropriately in the text.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We are not aware of any specific feature distinguishing the subjects (other than age) that could account for the differences between old and young. The fact that we see significant differences between the two groups, even with the relatively small size of the groups, suggests strongly that these differences are largely due to age. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that individual variability can be a contributing factor. For instance, the change in phase of clock genes appears to be driven largely by two subjects. We have commented on this and individual differences, in general, in the discussion.</p>

<p>(3) There were some questions about the amplitude of the core circadian clock gene rhythms raised, which in other human cell types would be much higher. A comment on this matter and the provision of the raw luminescence traces for Fig 2A would be greatly beneficial.</p>
<p>Addressing the same topic: what are the typical fold changes of the many genes that change their rhythms after stimulation with young and old sera? For example, it would be useful to show histograms for the two groups. Does one group tend to have transcript rhythms of higher or lower fold changes? The presentation of the manuscript would further benefit from showing a few key examples for different types of responses.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The average luminescence trace for each individual serum sample from Fig 2A has been added to Fig S3A.</p>
<p>We’ve presented the fold change data in Figure S5. There are a few significant differences, but largely the groups are similar in terms of fold change.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>(4) There are several points that we recommend to consider to add to the discussion:</p>
<p>What was the rationale to use these cells over the more common U2OS cells? Are there similarities between the rhythmic transcriptomes of the BJ-5TA cells and that of U2OS cells or other human cells? It should be relatively easy to address this point by assessing published datasets.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The original rationale to use BJ-5TA fibroblast cells was that we were aiming to build upon an observation found in a previous study2 which showed that circadian period changes with age in human fibroblasts. While our findings did not match theirs, we think an added benefit of using the BJ-5TA line is that unlike U2OS cells, it is not carcinoma derived cell line. We’ve added this point in lines 98-101.</p>
<p>Our study finds many more rhythmic transcripts compared to the previous studies examining U2OS cells. This can be attributed to several factors including differences in methods, including the use of human serum in our study, cell type differences, or decoupling of rhythms in some cancer cells. While a comparison of BJ-5TA cells and U2OS cells could be interesting, a proper comparison requires investigation of many data sets, since any pair of BJ-5TA and U2OS data sets will most likely differ in some detail of experimental design or data processing pipeline, which could contribute to observed differences in rhythmic transcripts.</p>
<p>That being said, we compared clock reference genes (see Author response image 1) between BJ-5TA and U2OS cells, comparing circadian profiles obtained from our data with those available on CircaDB. These circadian profiles exhibit many similarities and a few differences. The peak to trough ratios (amplitudes) are quite similar for ARNTL, NR1D1, NR1D2, PER2, PER3, and are about 25% lower for CRY1 and somewhat higher for TEF (about 15%) in our data. We find that the MESORS are generally similar with the exception of NR1D1 which is much lower and NR1D2 which is much higher in our data.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>For the rhythmic cell cycle genes, could this be the consequence of the serum which synchronizes also the cell cycle, or is it rather an effect of the circadian oscillator driving rhythms of cell cycle genes?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This is an interesting point. Given our previous data showing that the cell cycle gene cyclin D1 is regulated by clock transcription factors3, we believe the circadian oscillator drives, or at least contributes to rhythms of cell cycle genes. However, the serum clearly makes a difference as we find that MESORs of cell cycle genes decrease with aged serum. This is consistent with the decreased proliferation previously observed in aged human tissue.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>While the reduction of rhythmicity in the old serum for oxidative phosphorylation transcripts is very interesting and fits with the general theme that metabolic function decreases with age, it is puzzling that the recipient cells are the same, but it is only the synchronization by the old and young serum that changes. Are the authors thus suggesting that decrease of metabolic rhythms is primarily a non cell-autonomous and systemic phenomenon? What would be a potential mechanism?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It may not be the cycling <italic>per se</italic>, but rather an overall inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation that is conveyed by the serum. Relating other work in the field to our findings, we’ve added the following to our discussion: “Previous work in the field demonstrates that synchronization of the circadian clock in culture results in cycling of mitochondrial respiratory activity5,6 further underscoring the different effects of old serum, which does not support oscillations of oxidative phosphorylation associated transcripts. Age-dependent decrease in oxidative phosphorylation and increase in mitochondrial dysfunction7 is seen also in aged fibroblasts8 and contributes to age-related diseases9. We suggest that the age-related inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is conferred by serum signals to the cells such that oxidative phosphorylation cycles are mitigated. On the other hand, loss of cycling could contribute to impairments in mitochondrial function with age.”</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The delayed shifts after aged serum for clock transcripts (but not for Bmal1) are interesting and indicate that there may be a decoupling of Bmal1 transcript levels from the other clock gene phases. How do the authors interpret this? Could it be related to altered chronotypes in the elderly?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>One possible explanation is that the delay of NPAS2, BMAL1’s binding partner, results in the delay of the transcription of clock controlled genes/negative arm genes. Since the RORs do not seem to be affected, Bmal is transcribed/translated as usual, but there isn’t enough NPAS2 to bind with BMAL1. In this case downstream genes are slower to transcribe causing the phase delay.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The discussion would also benefit from mentioning parallels and dissimiliarities with previous works, as well as what would be possible mechanisms for such an effect.</p>

<p>We’ve expanded our discussion in the manuscript to discuss possible mechanisms and also how the genes/pathways implicated in our study relate to other aging literature.</p>

<p>While time of serum collection is provided in the methods, it would be very useful to provide this information, along with the accompanying argumentation also at a more prominent position and to also add it to Table S1.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We made sure to highlight the collection time in the abstract of the manuscript “We collected blood from apparently healthy young (age 25-30) and old (age 70-76) individuals at 14:001 and used the serum to synchronize cultured fibroblasts.” The time of blood draw is also in sections of the paper (Intro and Methods). Since Table S1 is demographic information, we did not think that the blood draw time fit best there, but hopefully it is now clear in the text.</p>

<p>Fig.4 The fold change amplitude of the clock gene seems quite a bit lower than what is usually expected (for Nr1d1 it is usually 10 fold). The authors should provide an explanation and discuss this.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>There are a variety of factors that contribute to the fold change amplitude of clock genes. First, the change in amplitude of clock genes is lower <italic>in vitro</italic> compared to in vivo samples. For example, in U2OS cell cultures the fold change in the cycling of Nr1d1 is only 2 fold and is not significantly different from the fold change we observe (as shown in the U2OS data from CircaDB plotted in Figure 1R). Second, the method of synchronization contributes to the strength of the rhythms. Serum synchronization is generally less effective at driving strong clock cycling than forskolin or dexamethasone although, as noted in the manuscript, it may promote the cycling of more genes. Lastly, rhythm amplitude is also dependent on the cell type in question so cell to cell variability also contributes to differences. However, overall, we do not find major differences in comparing the U2OS data and ours. Please note that the y-axis has a logarithmic scale.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>What is the authors' strategy to identify which serum components that are responsible for the reported changes? This should be discussed.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the future, we intend to analyze the serum factors using a combination of fractionation and either proteomics or metabolomics to identify relevant factors. We have added this to the discussion.</p>
