<title>Abstract</title><p>TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a potent inducer of tumor cell apoptosis through TRAIL receptors. While it has been previously pursued as a potential anti-tumor therapy, the enthusiasm subsided due to unsuccessful clinical trials and the fact that many tumors are resistant to TRAIL. In this report we identified heparan sulfate (HS) as an important regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. TRAIL binds HS with high affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 73 nM) and HS induces TRAIL to form higher-order oligomers. The HS-binding site of TRAIL is located at the N-terminus of soluble TRAIL, which includes three basic residues. Binding to cell surface HS plays an essential role in promoting the apoptotic activity of TRAIL in both breast cancer and myeloma cells, and this promoting effect can be blocked by heparin, which is commonly administered to cancer patients. We also quantified HS content in several lines of myeloma cells and found that the cell line showing the most resistance to TRAIL has the least expression of HS, which suggests that HS expression in tumor cells could play a role in regulating sensitivity towards TRAIL. We also discovered that death receptor 5 (DR5), TRAIL and HS can form a ternary complex and that cell surface HS plays an active role in promoting TRAIL-induced cellular internalization of DR5. Combined, our study suggests that TRAIL-HS interactions could play multiple roles in regulating the apoptotic potency of TRAIL and might be an important point of consideration when designing future TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily consists of 19 protein ligands that have diverse biological functions mainly in immune, nervous and skeletal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Vanamee É and Faustman, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, while most factors in the superfamily stimulate cell proliferation and differentiation, several members function as pro-apoptotic ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">Croft et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, all known ligands that drive extrinsic pathways of apoptosis, including FAS ligand (FASL), TRAIL and TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, belong to the TNF superfamily. TNF superfamily ligands are expressed as type II transmembrane proteins and form homotrimers through their extracellular domains. These extracellular domains can be liberated from the cell surface by proteases and function as soluble cytokines.</p>
<p>TRAIL was originally identified as a highly potent pro-apoptotic factor for tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">Wiley et al., 1995</xref>). The main physiological function of TRAIL is believed to be regulation of thymocyte apoptosis during negative selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Lamhamedi-Cherradi et al., 2003</xref>). TRAIL is known to bind five members of the TNF receptor superfamily. Two of these, TRAIL-R1 (also known as DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (also known as DR5) are functional death receptors with intact intracellular death domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Pan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Walczak et al., 1997</xref>). The other three receptors, including TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4 and osteoprotegerin, are decoy receptors because binding of TRAIL will not induce apoptosis due to a lack of functional death domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Degli-Esposti et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Emery et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Sheridan et al., 1997</xref>). Binding of TRAIL to DR4 and DR5 triggers apoptotic cascade by recruiting Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), which in turn uses its death effector domains to recruit and activate pro-caspases-8 and –10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">von Karstedt et al., 2017</xref>).</p>
<p>TRAIL received plentiful attention due to its unique property of inducing apoptosis in many types of cancer cells without affecting healthy, non-transformed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Ashkenazi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Chen et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">Lemke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">Voss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c58">Walczak et al., 1999</xref>). Studies suggests that TRAIL plays an important role in tumor immune surveillance by suppressing tumor growth and metastasis, and TRAIL expressed by natural killer T cells has been implicated to play a major role in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Smyth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Takeda et al., 2002</xref>). To harness the therapeutic potential of TRAIL-induced tumor cell apoptosis, two classes of therapeutics have been developed to stimulate TRAIL signaling in tumor cells, which include recombinant TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against TRAIL receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Montinaro and Walczak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">von Karstedt et al., 2017</xref>). Although one recombinant form of TRAIL and multiple agonistic anti-TRAIL-R antibodies have advanced to clinical trials, they failed to provide clinical benefit to cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Forero-Torres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Herbst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Kelley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Merchant et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Papadopoulos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Paz-Ares et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Soria et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">von Pawel et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple factors have been attributed to the failure in clinical trials so far, which includes insufficient capacity of the agonists to induce higher-order clustering of TRAIL-Rs, resistance of many primary tumors to TRAIL-R agonists monotherapy, and a lack of biomarkers to identify tumors that are most suitable for TRAIL-based therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">von Karstedt et al., 2017</xref>). These roadblocks indicate that our understanding of TRAIL signaling system is far from complete, which clearly hampers realization of the full potential of TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapy.</p>
<p>Heparan sulfate (HS) is linear, negatively charged polysaccharide found at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix of all mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bishop et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Esko and Selleck, 2002</xref>). HS performs its biological function by binding to hundreds of secreted and transmembrane proteins. HS regulates the functions of protein binding partners chiefly by inducing oligomerization, promoting protein-protein interactions and inducing conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c60">Xu and Esko, 2014</xref>). In the current study, we discovered that TRAIL is a novel HS-binding protein and HS can regulate the biological function of TRAIL in a multifaceted manner. We found that cell surface HS proteoglycans are required for the full proapoptotic activity of TRAIL in multiple tumor cell lines, and the activity of TRAIL can be fully inhibited by soluble heparin. Mechanistically, we provided evidence that HS readily induces TRAIL to form higher order oligomers, and that HS is involved in TRAIL-induced TRAIL receptor internalization by mediating a stable complex with TRAIL and TRAIL receptor. Additionally, crystallization of murine TRAIL reveals that trimeric TRAIL can exist in a strand-swapped fashion, which has never been reported for a TNF superfamily member. These discoveries strongly suggest that HS play an active role in TRAIL biology and HS-TRAIL interaction should be taken into consideration when developing future TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapy.</p>

<title>TRAIL is a HS binding protein and binding involves three specific basic residues</title>
<p>To investigate whether TRAIL is a HS-binding protein, we first examined binding of the recombinant, soluble, extracellular domain of TRAIL to heparin using heparin– Sepharose chromatography. We found that both human TRAIL (hTRAIL) and murine TRAIL (mTRAIL) bind well to heparin column, and the binding of mTRAIL (eluted by 775 mM NaCl) to the heparin-Sepharose column was stronger than that of hTRAIL (eluted by 560 mM NaCl) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). To investigate the HS–TRAIL interaction in greater detail, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of the binding between hTRAIL and immobilized HS dodecasaccharide (HS 12mer, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Our results showed that hTRAIL binds HS 12mer with a <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> of 73 nM (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). To explicitly determine the HS-binding site of TRAIL, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of 7 conserved lysine and arginine residues on mTRAIL, some of which (Arg119, Arg122 and Lys125) cluster (in triplicate) near the ‘top’ of the trimer and likely form the HS-binding site (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Binding of these mTRAIL mutants to heparin was evaluated by heparin–Sepharose chromatography. Among tested mutants, only three (R119A, R122A and K125A) displayed substantial reduction in binding to heparin (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Interestingly, these three residues are located at the N-terminus of the soluble TRAIL, which likely adopts random coil structure because it was not visible in the crystal structure of soluble TRAIL (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). Among the identified residues, Arg119 apparently makes the most significant contribution to HS-binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1E</xref>). To confirm that human TRAIL utilizes a similar HS-binding site, we mutated Arg115 of human TRAIL (structurally homologous to murine Arg119) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cha et al., 2000</xref>) to alanine and found indeed, human R115A also display a dramatic reduction in HS-binding (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>HS induces TRAIL to form higher order oligomers in a length-dependent manner</title>
<p>To understand the structural details of HS-TRAIL interaction, we examined complex-formation between mTRAIL and structural-defined HS oligosaccharides (6mer to 18mer, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We found that when HS 6mer was incubated with mTRAIL, it failed to induce any visible shift in the elution position of TRAIL (retention volume 15.8 ml), and that unbound, excess 6mer could be found eluted at 18.6 ml (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). When HS 8mer was incubated with mTRAIL, we observed a slight shift in the retention volume of TRAIL, which possibly indicates complex formation between mTRAIL and 8mer. When larger HS oligosaccharides (10mer to 18mer) were incubated with mTRAIL, we observed they had progressively stronger effects on the retention position of TRAIL, clearly indicating complex formation between TRAIL and these larger HS oligosaccharides (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). In this experiment we noticed that the retention position of the apo form of mTRAIL (predicted trimer MW = 60 kDa) was much later than the retention position of similar sized proteins based on MW standards (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). To confirm that our recombinant mTRAIL truly exists as a homotrimer, and to determine the oligomeric states of the complexes formed by mTRAIL and HS oligosaccharides, we performed multiangle light scattering (MALS) analysis of mTRAIL, mTRAIL/12mer complex and mTRAIL/18mer complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). SEC-MALS analysis found that the apo form of mTRAIL has a MW of 63 kDa, which confirms that it is indeed a homotrimer. The MW of mTRAIL/12mer complex was found to be 72.8 kDa, which indicates that 12mer (MW = 3.2 kDa) could form a stable complex with mTRAIL homotrimer but could not induce mTRAIL to form a larger oligomer. In contrast, the MW of mTRAIL/18mer complex is significantly larger (102 kDa), which is close to the predicted MW of a mTRAIL hexamer (dimer of trimers, 120 kDa). This result suggests that longer HS oligosaccharides may induce mTRAIL to form larger oligomers. Indeed, we found that mTRAIL can form oligomers that appeared even bigger when incubated with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, average 24mer) or full-length heparin (average 50mer) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>). Of note, when we tried to perform similar experiments with hTRAIL, 12mer interaction caused rapid precipitation of hTRAIL, suggesting that HS also may induce hTRAIL oligomerization that is unstable in <italic>in vitro</italic> settings.</p>

<title>Crystallization of mTRAIL</title>
<p>We determined the crystal structure of soluble mTRAIL to better compare to hTRAIL and understand the biophysical characterization of HS and mTRAIL interactions (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Though a HS 12mer was present in the crystallization conditions, the oligosaccharide was not visible in the electron density. Similar to hTRAIL, mTRAIL exists as a trimer composed of three β-scaffold core protomers with one protomer comprising the asymmetric unit (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). A zinc ion, critical for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hymowitz et al., 2000</xref>), is located on the threefold axis bound by cysteine 240 from each protomer and a chloride ion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). A major difference between TRAIL and other TNF family members is an insertion of ∼12-16 residues between β-strands A and AL known as the A-AL loop (or AAL loop, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cha et al., 1999</xref>). The N-terminal β-strand A of mTRAIL is found sandwiched between β-stands H and AL of the neighboring protomer’s central β-scaffold core, a pattern repeated for each protomer (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Clear electron density can be traced between this strand and β-strand AL confirming the swapping of the N-terminal strand between the protomers. Interestingly, this swap has not been reported in other structures of TRAIL or TNF family members. In most structures of TRAIL reported some component of this loop is disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hymowitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hymowitz et al., 2000</xref>). When we overlay the crystal structure of hTRAIL (PDB_ID:1DU3, co-crystal structure with DR5) with our structure of mTRAIL, we found that in the 1DU3 coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cha et al., 2000</xref>), the A-AL loop is disordered between residues T135 and A146, however the distance (36 Å) between them is likely too great for eleven amino acids to span (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Yet, T135 is located ∼8 Å from A146 of the neighboring protomer, suggesting a strand swap might also be possible in hTRAIL.</p>

<title>Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of TRAIL/oligosaccharide complexes</title>
<p>To gain better structural insights into HS-induced TRAIL oligomerization, we performed SAXS analysis of mTRAIL alone and mTRAIL in complex with either a 12mer or 18mer. In these experiments, the complexes were first resolved by size exclusion chromatography and the SAXS data were collected from the eluent in-line in real-time. From the P(r) (paired distribution) plot (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), it is obvious that compared to TRAIL alone, mTRAIL/18mer complex has substantially increased radius of gyration (Rg), and dramatically increased maximum dimension (D<sub>max</sub>) (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>), indicating that mTRAIL/18mer complex likely adopts a larger oligomeric state. Consistent with the MW estimation of SEC-MALS analysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), MW estimation based on SAXS data showed that the predicted MW of the mTRAIL/18mer complex almost doubles the predicted MW of TRAIL alone (105.5 vs. 53.7 kDa), which strongly suggests that the TRAIL/18mer complex is likely a stable hexamer (dimer of homotrimers). Also consistent with our SEC-MALS analysis, SAXS data indicate that the dimension of mTRAIL/12mer is much smaller than mTRAIL/18mer but larger than the apo form of mTRAIL, suggesting that mTRAIL and HS 12mer likely formed a stable complex but the binding did not alter the oligomeric state of mTRAIL.</p>

However, the relative orientation of the two trimers in the SAXS model cannot be definitively determined. This is due to the fact the TRAIL trimer has similar dimensions vertically and horizontally (55 to 60 Å), which make it possible for many different relative orientations to fit reasonably well into the GASBOR model.</p>

<title>HS contributes to cell surface binding of TRAIL</title>
<p>Next, we sought to determine to what extent HS is involved in binding of soluble TRAIL to breast cancer cells by using a flow-cytometry-based cell surface binding assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, mTRAIL bound to the cell surface of murine breast cancer 4T1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After removing cell surface HS with heparin lyase III (HL-III), we found binding of mTRAIL was reduced by 55% at 300 ng/ml (relative fluorescence units (RFU) = 90 versus 40 in untreated and HL-III cells), and by 70% at 100 ng/ml (RFU reduced from 65 to 20). Similar HS-dependent binding was also observed in hTRAIL binding to human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells, which after HL-III treatment displayed 60% reduction in binding at 300 ng/ml and 67% reduction at 100 ng/ml (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). Using the same assay, we also examined the binding of hTRAIL R115A mutant to MDA-MB-453 cells. Consistent with its greatly reduced binding to heparin-Sepharose (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), R115A displayed 60% reduction in binding to cell surface compared to WT hTRAIL (RFU reduced from 10 to 4) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Of note, after cells are treated with HL-III, there is no difference in binding between WT and R115A hTRAIL, suggesting the R115A mutant fully retains its HS-independent binding capability to cell surface TRAIL receptors but completely lacks HS-dependent interaction with the cell surface (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>Cell surface HS promotes TRAIL-induced breast cancer cell apoptosis</title>
<p>Since HS contributes to the binding of TRAIL to tumor cell surfaces, we wondered if HS plays a role in TRAIL-induced tumor cell apoptosis. We first tested this on the adherent breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453 cells using Annexin V-FITC apoptosis assays. At 30 ng/ml, which we found is sufficient to induce maximum apoptosis in these cells, hTRAIL alone could induce around 8% of cells to undergo apoptosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). However, when cell surface HS was first removed by heparin lyase III (HL-III), TRAIL failed to induce apoptosis above the background level (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>). This result suggests that cell surface HS is essential for TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 cells. We further tested the impact of addition of exogenous heparin in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. When heparin was added together with TRAIL to MDA-MB-453 cells, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was completely blocked (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A and B</xref>) presumably by competitively inhibiting TRAIL binding to HS on the cell surface. Combined, these results strongly suggest that cell surface HS can play a critical role in promoting the activity of TRAIL, and such a role is impaired when exogenous heparin is present, which can directly compete with cell surface HS for binding to TRAIL.</p>

<title>Cell surface HS promotes TRAIL-induced myeloma cell apoptosis</title>
<p>To investigate whether the dependence of TRAIL on cell surface HS also applies to other types of tumor cells, we examined RPMI-8226 cells, a widely used human myeloma cell line. As reported, RPMI-8226 cells are highly sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitsiades et al., 2001</xref>), requiring only 1ng/ml hTRAIL to induce around 25% early apoptosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A and C</xref>). As expected, removal of cell surface HS significantly reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in RPMI-8226 cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B and C</xref>). After subtracting the background level of apoptosis (6%), we found that removal of cell surface HS resulted in 55% reduction in apoptosis at 1 ng/ml TRAIL and 44% reduction in apoptosis at 3 ng/ml TRAIL (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref>). Next we examined the effect of adding exogenous heparin and found that only 1 µg/ml heparin was able to abolish TRAIL-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). HS 12mer was also effective in inhibiting apoptosis, albeit to a lesser degree compared to heparin (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7D</xref>). This is perhaps unsurprising, given that longer oligosaccharide chains often compete better for binding than shorter chains, and cell surface HS is longer than either heparin or short, synthesized compounds. Finally, we examined the pro-apoptotic capacity of our HS binding-deficient mutant R115A. R115A showed significantly lower induction of apoptosis compared with WT hTRAIL at both 20 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7E</xref>). While only 20 ng/ml of WT hTRAIL is sufficient to induce 20% apoptosis, the mutant TRAIL requires 100ng/ml to induce the same level of apoptosis, indicating a 5-fold reduction in potency. This result also supports the hypothesis that interaction between cell surface HS and TRAIL greatly enhances TRAIL activity.</p>

<title>Cell surface HS level contributes to sensitivity of myeloma cells towards TRAIL</title>
<p>Studies indicate that the sensitivities of myeloma cell lines to TRAIL varies substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Gómez-Benito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Mitsiades et al., 2001</xref>). In order to understand whether HS plays a role in regulating the sensitivity of different myeloma cells to TRAIL, we compared the HS contents in three different myeloma cells lines. Compared to RPMI-8226 cells (requiring only 1 ng/ml of TRAIL to induce 25% apoptosis, <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig.7A</xref>), U266 cells are moderately sensitive to TRAIL, while IM-9 cells are highly resistant to TRAIL (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Despite the difference in sensitivity, removal of cell surface HS reduced 50-60% of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both IM-9 and U266 cells, suggesting cell surface HS promotes TRAIL-induced myeloma cell apoptosis regardless of the sensitivity levels (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8B</xref>). To determine whether the expression of TRAIL receptors determines their relative sensitivities towards TRAIL, we determined the cell surface expression levels of DR4 and DR5. It turns out that both receptors are abundantly expressed in all three cell lines.</p>

<p>For DR5, the highest expression was observed in IM-9 (32 x background), followed by RPMI-8226 (10 x background) and U266 (5x background). For DR4, the highest expression was observed in RPMI8226 (26 x background), followed by U266 (18x background) and IM-9 (5x background) (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8C</xref>). Thus, the expression level of TRAIL receptors may not be a major determining factor for the dramatic differences in sensitivity among these lines.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the abundance of cell surface HS by using a monoclonal anti-HS antibody (HS20), which preferably recognizes highly sulfated HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Here we found while RPMI-8226 and U266 cells both express abundant HS (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>), IM-9 cells express very small amounts of highly sulfated HS at the cell surface (1.5x background). Because syndecan-1 has been shown to be the predominant HS proteoglycan expressed by most myeloma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sanderson and Yang, 2008</xref>), we performed FACS analysis of cell surface syndecan-1. Interestingly, while syndecan-1 is abundantly expressed by both U266 and RPMI8226 cells, only a portion of IM-9 cells express syndecan-1 at a much lower level (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8E</xref>). These observations suggest that reduced syndecan-1 expression could be the main contributor to the limited cell surface presentation of HS.</p>
<p>To examine whether the overall biosynthesis of HS differs among these three myeloma lines, we quantified the total amounts and disaccharide compositions of HS expressed by these cells. We found that the total amount of HS expressed by IM-9 cells is substantially lower, amounting to only 36% and 23% of total HS expressed by U266 and RPMI-8226 cells, respectively (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In sum, our result suggests that the greatly reduced syndecan-1 expression, combined with a reduced overall production of HS, contributes to the dramatic reduction of cell surface expression of HS in IM-9 cells, which might be a contributing factor to the resistance displayed by this cell line.</p>

<title>HS forms a complex with TRAIL and DR5 and regulates TRAIL-induced DR5 internalization</title>
<p>To have more complete understanding of the role of HS in regulating TRAIL signaling, we investigated whether HS directly interacts with TRAIL receptor. When recombinant extracellular domain of DR5 was applied onto heparin Sepharose column, we found that no DR5 was retained on the heparin column (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>, left half), suggesting there is no direct binding between DR5 and HS. However, when DR5 was premixed with TRAIL and then applied onto heparin column, we found DR5 and TRAIL both bound heparin column and were co-eluted in 500mM and 1M salt fractions (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>, right half). This result strongly suggests that TRAIL-DR5 interaction and TRAIL-HS interaction are fully compatible with each other, which is consistent with the fact that the DR5 binding site and the HS-binding site are spatially separated (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). This finding raised the possibility that HS, a molecule that is commonly involved in internalization of HS-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Christianson and Belting, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Payne et al., 2007</xref>), might regulate the internalization of DR5 after it is bound by TRAIL. On RPMI-8226 cells, we found that DR5 undergoes rapid internalization after stimulation with TRAIL (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>), while the internalization of DR4 is very limited (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>). Focusing on TRAIL-induced DR5 internalization, we compared the internalization kinetics between intact cells and cells pre-treated with HL-III from 15min to 1 hour. Interestingly, the removal of cell surface HS significantly reduced the rate of DR5 internalization (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). By 60 mins, the internalization level of DR5 on HL-III treated cells was less than the internalization level of DR5 of cells without HL-III treatment at 15 min, which represents a reduction of internalization rate of at least 4-fold after removal of cell-surface HS. This result suggests HS might regulate TRAIL signaling by altering TRAIL-induced DR5 internalization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report, we identified TRAIL as a second member of the TNF superfamily that interacts with cell surface HS. Previously, it was reported that APRIL (A proliferation-inducing ligand) interacts with HS and the interaction plays important roles in APRIL localization and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hendriks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">Huard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">Ingold et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, many similarities were found between the TRAIL-HS and APRIL-HS interactions. First, the HS-binding site of TRAIL and APRIL are similar—both utilize three basic residues located at the N-terminal ends of the soluble forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hendriks et al., 2005</xref>). Due to the trimeric nature of TNF family proteins, three basic residues from three monomers can combine into a HS-binding site that comprises nine basic residues. Second, binding of HS is fully compatible with the binding of TRAIL and APRIL to their respective receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Hendriks et al., 2005</xref>). At last, it was proposed that one mechanism by which HS promotes APRIL signaling is to promote its oligomerization at cell surface, which is also similar to our observation of HS-induced TRAIL oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Kimberley et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Our finding suggests that HS can regulate the biological function of TRAIL on several different levels. First, we have shown that HS can induce TRAIL to form higher-order oligomers. It is well-known that clustering of TRAIL greatly promotes the apoptotic response through gathering large numbers of TRAIL receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Montinaro and Walczak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">von Karstedt et al., 2017</xref>). Apparently, one way HS could promote TRAIL signaling is by clustering TRAIL on the tumor cell surfaces. As we have observed in MDA-MB-453 cells, which express low level of DR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2012b</xref>), heparin lyase treatment completely blocked TRAIL-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). In contrast, in tumors cells that express high level of TRAIL receptors, heparin lyase treatment only blocked 50-60% of TRAIL-induced apoptosis (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7B</xref> and <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8B</xref>). This difference suggests that the global contribution of HS-induced TRAIL-oligomerization to apoptosis likely depends on the expression level of TRAIL receptors. Due to the low density of TRAIL receptors on MDA-MB-453 cell surface, TRAIL induced apoptosis has a greater dependence on HS to cluster TRAIL with its receptor.</p>
<p>A second way HS could regulate the function of TRAIL is to promote TRAIL-induced receptor internalization. While the exact role of TRAIL-induced internalization in apoptosis remains controversial, and the role could be very different in different tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Akazawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Artykov et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Mazurek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c62">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), our study in myeloma cells clearly shown that HS promotes rapid internalization of DR5 upon binding with TRAIL. The absence of HS at the cell surface greatly reduced the internalization rate for all time points (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9E</xref>). While heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are known to play an active role in internalizing many HS-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Christianson and Belting, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Payne et al., 2007</xref>), the unique finding here is that, although DR5 is not a HS-binding protein itself, its internalization is HS-dependent. This dependence can be explained by our finding that DR5 become associated with HSPGs through TRAIL by forming a ternary complex (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9A</xref>). Interestingly, our lab previously reported another similar ternary complex involving RANKL, which also belongs to TNF superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Li et al., 2016</xref>). But in that ternary complex, RANKL (not a HS-binding protein) becomes associated with HS through its HS-binding decoy receptor OPG.</p>
<p>In this study, we utilized several biophysical methods to gain structural insights of HS-TRAIL interaction. By SEC-MALS and SAXS analysis of TRAIL-oligosaccharide complexes, we confirmed that HS 18mer (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>) can indeed induce TRAIL to form a stable homohexamer. While the hexamer model generated from the SAXS data indicates the hexamer may exist as a dimer of trimers (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>), due to the round shape of the TRAIL homotrimer, more precise determination of the relative orientation of the two trimers was not possible. We have also attempted to solve the co-crystal structure of the complex between mTRAIL and HS 12mer, but the crystal we obtained unfortunately did not contain HS 12mer. However, from this crystal structure we discovered that mTRAIL exists in a strand-swapped homotrimer. Close examination of several crystal structures of human TRAIL found that a significant portion (11 to14 aa) of a long loop connecting strand A and A” is disordered in a number of the structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">Cha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Cha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Hymowitz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Hymowitz et al., 2000</xref>), which raises the possibility that in some conditions, hTRAIL might also exist in strand-swapped trimers. Whether a strand swap is a regulatory component of TRAIL’s function remains to be seen and warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>A main obstacle facing TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapy is tumor resistance to TRAIL. Based on current understanding, the main contributing factor for resistance are first, the overall expression of TRAIL receptors; and second, the expression levels of essential components of intracellular apoptotic proteins such as caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Montinaro and Walczak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">von Karstedt et al., 2017</xref>). Our finding strongly suggests that a third contributor to TRAIL resistance could be the expression level and composition of HS on tumor cell surfaces. The fact that removal of cell surface HS greatly diminishes TRAIL-induced apoptosis in both breast cancer and myeloma lines already suggests that altering cell surface presentation of HS could have a substantial effect on tumor sensitivity to TRAIL. To investigate the potential correlation of HS expression level and TRAIL-sensitivity, we examined three myeloma cell lines with different sensitivities to TRAIL, with RPMI-8226 as the most sensitive line (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7A</xref>), U266 as the moderately sensitive line and IM-9 as the most resistant line (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8A</xref>). Surprisingly, our analysis found that RPMI8226 cells express the highest amounts of HS and syndecan-1, while IM-9 express the least amount of HS and syndecan-1 (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8D</xref>&amp;E, <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In other words, in this set of myeloma cells we found a strong correlation between HS/HSPG levels and sensitivities to TRAIL. Our data suggests that the expression level of HS/HSPG can be one important compounding factor that contributes to the sensitivity of tumor cells to TRAIL.</p>
<p>The potent inhibitory effect of exogenous heparin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis is quite intriguing and may have important implications in clinical setting when TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapy is attempted (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7D</xref>). Due to greatly increased risk of venous thrombosis, it is common for cancer patients to receive heparin as an athromboprophylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Lee and Peterson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Pernod et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, daily administration of LMWH for 6 months has been a standard treatment for cancer-associated thrombosis since early 2000. This practice raised an important question: when patients receive heparin and TRAIL-based therapy at the same time, will circulating heparin diminish the effect of TRAIL? Our data suggest that use of heparin may complicate evaluating the efficacy of TRAIL therapy in clinical trials.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study has provided strong evidence that HS plays essential roles in TRAIL-induced tumor cell apoptosis. These new mechanistic insights will promote a more comprehensive understanding of TRAIL biology and may one day lead to novel TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapy.</p>

Biotinylated 12merNS2S6S was immobilized to a streptavidin sensor chip (Nicoya) based on the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, 150 µl of solution of the biotin-12merNS2S6S (18 µg/ml) in HBS-running buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) was injected to channel 2 of the flow cell of the sensor chip at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. The successful immobilization of biotin-12merNS2S6S was confirmed by the observation of a 100-200 resonance unit increase in the sensor chip. The flow cell channel 1 was used as the background control, which was not immobilized with biotin-12merNS2S6S. Different dilutions of hTRAIL (concentrations from 68 to 1088 nM) in HBS-running buffer were injected at a flow rate of 20 µl/min. At the end of the sample injection, the same buffer was flowed over the sensor surface to facilitate dissociation. After a 5-min dissociation time, the sensor surface was regenerated by injecting with 150 µl regeneration buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 2M NaCl) at a flow rate of 150 µl/min to get a fully regenerated surface.

<title>Annexin V-FITC assay</title>
<p>Apoptosis of tumor cells was determined with an Annexin-FITC staining kit (R&amp;D Systems) as per the manufacturer’s instructions and analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, breast cancer cells and myeloma cells were treated with recombinant hTRAIL (B294007, Biolegend, 1 to 300 ng/ml for different cells) for 3 h in the presence or absence of either HL-III (5 milliunits/ml), heparin (1 to 20 µg/ml or HS 12mer (10 µg/ml). The treated cells were harvested and incubated with a reaction mixture containing Annexin-FITC and Propidium iodide in the dark for 15-30 min for labeling. Annexin-FITC binds phosphatidylserine that are exposed in apoptotic cells. Propidium iodide (PI) is a membrane-impermeant DNA dye and only stains cells that have lost membrane integrity (necrotic cells) but not early apoptotic cells. Fluorescence of PI often increase at least 30-fold after binding to DNA. In our hands, after HL-III or heparin treatments the PI signal often decreased ∼2 fold on viable cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7C</xref>). Because PI is positive charged, it is likely that cell surface HS binds PI and such interaction might contribute to the background staining of PI on live cells. We also observed viable cells that were treated with TRAIL alone had a 1.5-2 fold increase in PI signal. The reason for this increase is unknown. In all experiments, early apoptotic cells (labeled apoptotic cells for simplicity) were identified as PI low (in PE channel), Annexin-FITC high cells; while necrotic cells were identified as PI high, Annexin-FITC high cells.</p>

<p>Summary: TRAIL (Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in tumor cells. Initially, this finding raised high expectations on the possibility to induce tumor-specific apoptosis by activation of TRAIL-receptors DR4 and DR5. However, attempted TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapies failed so far, and several tumor types were found to resist TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Yin Luo and colleagues provide an explanation for these observations with the potential to provide a new important biomarker for future TRAIL-based anti-tumor therapies and to reduce resistance. The authors reveal that sensitivity towards TRAIL correlates inversely with heparan sulfate (HS) expression levels at the surface of tumor cells, suggesting that HS functions as a tumor suppressor. These observations are explained by two two mechanisms: First, HS induces the assembly of higher-order oligomers from soluble TRAIL trimers, and second, TRAIL and HS form a ternary complex with DR5 to promote its cellular internalization. Therefore, this timely and important work provides a better mechanistic understanding of TRAIL-induced apoptosis and TRAIL resistance of some tumor types, with the potential to improve therapy.</p>
<p>Strengths: The major novel finding of this study is that extracellular heparan sulfate (HS) acts as a positive regulator of TRAIL-induced tumor cell apoptosis, and that HS expression of different tumor cell lines correlates with their capacity to induce cell death. The authors first show by affinity chromatography and SPR that murine and human TRAIL bind strongly to heparin (heparin is a highly sulfated, and thus strongly negatively charged form of HS that is derived from connective tissue type mast cells), and identify three basic amino acids on the TRAIL N-terminus that are required for the interaction. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and multiangle light scattering (MALS) revealed that TRAIL exists as a trimer that requires a minimum heparin length of 8 sugar residues for binding, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) showed that TRAIL interaction with longer oligosaccharides induced higher order multimerization of TRAIL. Consistent with these biochemical and biophysical analyses, HS on tumor cells contributes to TRAIL-binding to their cell surface and subsequent apoptosis. The study also describes domain swapping observed by TRAIL trimer crystallization, and demonstrates different degrees of HS core protein and DR receptor expression in different tumor cell types. These findings are well supported and together with the advanced and established methodology used by the authors are the strengths of this paper. The paper will be of great interest to medical biologists studying TRAIL-resistance of tumors, to biologists interested in DR4 and DR5 receptor function and the effects of receptor internalization, and to glycobiologists aiming to understand the multiple important roles that HS plays in development and disease. The authors also raise the important point (and support it well) that routine heparin treatment of cancer patients potentially interferes with TRAIL-based therapies, providing one possible reason for their failure.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Despite the importance and the clear strengths of the paper, some of its aspects could have been developed further. First, the authors findings that HS at the tumor surface promotes TRAIL binding, and that HS promotes TRAIL-induced breast cancer and myeloma cell apoptosis, are based on pre-treatment of cells with heparinase to remove surface HS prior to TRAIL-treatment, or on the addition of soluble heparin to compete with cell-surface HS for TRAIL binding. A more direct way to establish such new HS function could have been the genetic manipulation of cancer cells to overexpress HS or to express less or undersulfated HS. Changed susceptibility of these cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis would have greatly underlined the physiological significance of the authors findings. Second, the mechanistics of TRAIL-induced, HS-modulated tumor cell apoptosis could have been more clearly defined. For example, the authors demonstrate convincingly that cell surface HS is essential for TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells, and show that a tumor cell line (IM-9 cells) that expresses HS and the core protein to which HS is attached to only limited degrees is the most resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. However, Indeed, the authors later also report that cell surface HS promotes TRAIL-induced myeloma cell apoptosis regardless of the sensitivity levels, and that other factors - the degree of TRAIL multimerization or DR4/DR5 receptor internalization - are also important. Therefore, HS levels do not play a sole determining role in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Along the same line, the authors show that RPMI-8226 cell-surface HS promotes DR5 internalization despite the absence of direct DR5/heparin interactions. This suggests that HS at the cell surface may also affect apoptosis indirectly. To test this hypothesis, it would have been worthwhile to include the binding characteristics and HS-dependent internalization of DR4 into the study.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>
In the manuscript by Luo et al, the authors investigated the nature and function of TRAIL-HS binding for the regulation of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells. The authors discovered that TRAIL binds to 12mer HS and identified the amino acid residues critical for the binding. The authors further nicely showed that 12mer HS binds to TRAIL homotrimer and larger HS can further promote the formation of larger TRAIL oligomers. Structural analyses were conducted to characterize the binding of TRAIL/HS complexes. At functional level, the authors demonstrated that HS promotes the cell surface binding of TRAIL to enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in a variety of cancer cells. Moreover, the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis is correlated with cell surface HS level. Lastly, the authors showed that HS forms complex with TRAIL and its receptor DR5 and promotes DR5 internalization.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>
Overall, this is a nicely executed study providing both mechanistic and functional insight for TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. It conducted detailed characterization on the direct binding between HS and TRAIL and provided solid evidence supporting the role of such interaction for the regulation of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. The experiments were well-designed with proper controls included. The data interpretation is accurate. The manuscript was clearly written and easy to follow by general readers.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>
There is no major weakness identified from this study. As the authors pointed out, the current relationship between cell surface HS level and sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis is still correlative and will need further investigation in the future.</p>

<p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>This reviewer found the paper of very high interest, well supported, and well written. I have only a few suggestions to the authors for further improvement:</p>
<p>1. TRAIL mutants carrying individual mutations of basic residues R119, R122 and K125 were tested, but a TRAIL mutant lacking all three residues was not. This combined mutant protein would have allowed to test whether all heparin binding is abolished (e.g. that no other residues contribute to HS binding) and could have also been used as an independent control replacing heparin and heparinase treatment in binding/apoptosis studies. Given that the DR4/5 and heparin binding sites of TRAIL do not overlap, this form would be useful in determining the extent to which HS contributes to, or serves as a prerequisite for TRAIL binding to its receptor and cell death. Moreover, if bound to the receptor, this mutant TRAIL is expected to completely prevent HS-mediated receptor internalization. The added value of this experiment therefore is that it may provide an answer to the controversial debate on whether DR receptor internalization promotes or inhibits apoptosis.</p>
<p>In Fig. 5C, we provided data showing that the binding of R115A mutant of hTRAIL (equivalent to murine R199A mutant) to MB-453 cells was very similar to the binding of WT hTRAIL to heparin lyase treated cells. This finding suggests that nearly all HS-dependent binding to cell surface HS was abolished by mutating R115.   Since a single mutant is sufficient, we felt there is little point in combining multiple mutations. We also used R115A mutant as an independent control replacing heparin and heparinase treatment in apoptosis assay in Fig. 7E.  With regard to using the mutant in the internalization assay, we thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and will incorporate it into our future study as we intend to perform more in-depth investigation on the exact mechanism of internalization.</p>
<p>1. The domain data is interesting, but its physiological significance remains obscure and it also somewhat distracts from the main theme of the study. It may be removed from a revised manuscript.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We partially agree with the reviewer’s assessment, but we felt that this discovery is of sufficient novelty and should be made known to the whole community.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. TUNEL data is shown as a picture in Figure 6, but quantification is lacking.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We have included the statistics of the TUNEL data in the final version as Fig. 6D.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Is the HS20 antibody a well-suited pan-anti-HS antibody? Why was this antibody used instead of heparinase digestion followed by the use of HS &quot;stub&quot; antibodies that were previously used as a reliable readout for overall sulfation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The HS20 mAb has been very well characterized by Dr. Mitchell Ho group (Gao et al., 2016).  We have also done side-by-side comparison of HS20 and the most commonly used anti-HS mAb 10E4 by immunostaining and FACS. In nearly all tissues and cells tested, HS20 gave better sensitivity and lower background (after heparin lyase treatment) compared to 10E4. The staining pattern of the two mAbs are usually identical, but the signal/noise ratio of HS20 is much better than 10E4. The HS ”stub” antibody can be useful in certain applications, but it is used mainly as an indicator of the distribution/abundance of HSPGs, rather than a readout of overall sulfation.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The discussion should be stripped from expressions such as interestingly, curiously, unexpectedly, certainly, undoubtedly and the like to improve readability. The manuscript should be checked for typos (for example surface plasma resonance line 473, was served line 481).</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions and many of these expressions were removed in the final version.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Last but not least: to test the physiological relevance of these findings, it would be of the highest interest to use a mouse model harboring a tumor cell line of choice and derived lines with impaired or increased HS expression, as outlined in my public comments, and to test tumor responsiveness to TRAIL treatment. If already planned, I wish you Good Luck with the experiments!</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion and we have indeed planned to do exactly that!</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p>
<p>1. The authors showed in Fig.2 that 12mer HS forms complex with TRAIL homotrimer. Please clarify if 12mer HS binding leads to the formation of the TRAIL homotrimer or TRAIL can form homotrimer in the absence of HS binding. Do the TRAIL mutations that affect HS binding, such as R115A, also impact the homotrimer formation?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>TRAIL automatically forms a homotrimer independent of HS. It is known that formation of the homotrimer critically depends on a zinc ion, which is located on the threefold axis of the trimer and is bound by cysteine 240. We have also verified that all TRAIL mutants remain homotrimeric by size exclusion chromatography.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. Does 12mer HS also suppress TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in MDA-MB-453 cells?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank the reviewer for this question but felt performing this experiment will not add any more insight to the main conclusion. Most likely, the result will be similar to what we saw in Fig. 7D, where we found 12mer significantly inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but inhibits less efficiently compared to heparin.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>1. The authors nicely showed the correlation between surface HS level and sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MM cell lines and implicated that such correlation could be related with the difference in the expression level of SDC1. This is an interesting point worth further validation. Does ectopic SDC1 expression in IM-9 cells lead to increase cell surface HS and sensitivity to TRAIL treatment? On the other hand, will depletion of SDC1 expression in U266 or RPMI8226 cells decrease their sensitivity to TRAIL treatment?</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that this would be an excellent experiment to try and have actually attempted to overexpress SDC1 in IM-9 cells. But we found IM-9 cells are very difficult to transfect and we only managed to convert a small percentage of SDC1 negative cells to positive cells. Also, the level of SDC1 expression on the SDC1-positive cells was not changed after overexpression. We have not tried depleting SDC1 expression in U266 and RPMI8226 cells because such an experiment might change the property of these cells in unexpected ways, which would make result interpretation impossible.  A previous report has shown that knocking down SDC1 could enhance clustering of TRAIL receptors in H929 cells (Wu et al.,  J Immunol 2012;), which actually led to slightly increased apoptosis.</p>
