<title>Abstract</title><p>Skeletal muscle atrophy and the inhibition of muscle regeneration are known to occur as a natural consequence of aging, yet the underlying mechanisms that lead to these processes in atrophic myofibers remain largely unclear. Our research has revealed that the maintenance of proper mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) is vital for preventing skeletal muscle atrophy in microgravity environments. We discovered that the deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin2 (MFN2), which serves as a tether for MAM, in human iPS cells or the reduction of MAM in differentiated myotubes caused by microgravity interfered with myogenic differentiation process and an increased susceptibility to muscle atrophy, as well as the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. The atrophic phenotype of differentiated myotubes in microgravity and the regenerative capacity of Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells in dystrophic mice were both ameliorated by treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. Our findings demonstrate how the orchestration of mitochondrial morphology in differentiated myotubes and regenerating muscle stem cells plays a crucial role in regulating Notch signaling through the interaction of MAM.</p>

<title>Plain-language summary</title>
<p>This study investigated the link between Mfn2 and Notch signaling in skeletal muscle atrophy. We used a microgravity system to induce muscle atrophy and found that the loss of Mfn2 leads to decreased numbers of MAM and activation of Notch signaling and that treating MFN2-deficient human iPS cells with a gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT improved their mitochondrial morphology and function. Additionally, Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells in mice have a lower capacity to regenerate dystrophic muscles and DAPT treatment improves the regeneration of these cells. The study suggests that targeting the Notch signaling pathway with a gamma-secretase inhibitor could be a therapeutic option for skeletal muscle atrophy caused by defects in Mfn2.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Skeletal muscles play a vital role in body posture, movement and in regulating metabolism. Regular physical activity helps to maintain muscle mass, while decreased use of skeletal muscle can lead to muscle atrophy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">Bodine et al., 2001</xref></italic>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c42">Sandri et al., 2004</xref></italic>). This can occur in a variety of disease states, such as muscular dystrophies, as well as in conditions where movement is limited, such as long-term bed rest or injury-induced immobility, or even in microgravity conditions during spaceflight (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">Gao et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Additionally, muscle loss is a common aspect of the aging process (<italic>Larsson et al., 2017</italic>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">Distefano and Goodpaster, 2018</xref></italic>). The mechanisms of disuse-induced muscle atrophy and the impact on regenerative capacity in skeletal muscle have been extensively studied in various animal models, including humans.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and supplying adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during muscle development and regeneration. This is particularly important in energy-intensive myogenic cells, such as differentiated myofibers and muscle stem cells, as they mature (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">Duguez et al., 2002</xref></italic>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c40">Ryall 2013</xref></italic>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">Bhattacharya et al., 2020</xref></italic>). The shape and size of mitochondria in mature myofibers undergo drastic changes to meet the energy demands of developmental growth, the switch between slow- and fast-twitch myofibers, exercise, and aging (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">Ljubicic et al, 2010</xref></italic>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c54">Wyckelsma et al., 2017</xref></italic>). These morphological and functional changes in mitochondria are facilitated by the processes of fission and fusion, respectively (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref></italic>). Mitochondrial fusion is regulated by the transmembrane GTPase proteins, Mitofusin1 (Mfn1) and Mitofusin2 (Mfn2), which are located on the outer mitochondrial membrane (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">Eura et al., 2003</xref></italic>; <italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">Sin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c57">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Ablation of both Mfn1 and Mfn2 leads to embryonic lethality in mice, while muscle-specific inactivation of <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic> genes results in severe mitochondrial dysfunction and muscle atrophy (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c11">Chen et al., 2010</xref></italic>). Mfn2, in particular, is necessary to tether the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria, thereby enhancing mitochondrial energetics (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">de Brito and Scorrano, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Filadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref></italic>). However, the specific role of the mitochondria-ER complex in developmental, regenerative, and atrophic processes in skeletal muscle remains unclear. Our research has revealed that muscle atrophy is linked to Mfn2 and the Notch signaling pathway, as demonstrated by the use of MFN2 knockout human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, primary human myoblasts, and mice.</p>
<p>Our research demonstrates that the restoration of ER-mitochondria contacts through the regulation of Notch signaling is sufficient to partially alleviate the bioenergetic defects in MFN2-deficient human iPS cells or myogenic cells. This suggests that treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitors may be a viable therapeutic option in pathological conditions in which Mfn2 is involved. These findings provide new insights into the treatment of skeletal muscle atrophy caused by mitochondrial abnormalities.</p>

<title>Human primary myotubes exhibit an atrophic phenotype in a microgravity environment</title>
<p>To investigate the effects of microgravity on skeletal muscle atrophy, we utilized a 3D-clinorotation system to simulate microgravity conditions with human primary skeletal muscle hOM2 cells, which are derived from the orbicularis oculi (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c55">Yamanaka et al., 2019</xref></italic>). We observed that the proliferation of both myogenic cells and human iPS cells decreased in microgravity (<italic>Supplementary file 1</italic>). Additionally, we examined differentiated myotubes derived from primary hOM2 cells after confluence, both with and without 3D-clinorotation (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref></italic>). These primary cells were mainly differentiated into MYH7-positive type 1 slow-twitch myotubes after 7 days (<italic>Supplementary file 2</italic>), and we found that these differentiated myotubes in microgravity, when cultured for 7 days, were more fragile and tenuous in appearance than those cultured for 2 days, compared to controls (the bottom images in <italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref></italic>). We also observed an increase in the transcripts of <italic>MuRF1</italic> and <italic>FBXO32</italic> (<italic>Atrogen1/MAFbx</italic>), which are markers of muscle atrophy, in these myotubes, as the duration of microgravity increased. However, the expression of <italic>MYH3</italic>, an early myogenic differentiation marker, was not altered (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1C</xref></italic>). To investigate the condition of MAM in differentiated myotubes, we utilized a proximity ligation assay (PLA) with antibodies against the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) of mitochondria and the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3 receptor) of the ER (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">Prole and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">Shoshan-Barmatz et al., 1996</xref></italic>). Previous studies have demonstrated that PLA can occur within a range of 40nm, which aligns with findings suggesting that optical Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer necessitates a mitochondrial proximity of approximately 20nm (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">Gottschalk et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">Lim et al., 2021</xref></italic>). We found that the number of MAM was severely decreased in microgravity, specifically in differentiated multinucleate myotubes rather than undifferentiated myoblasts (<italic><xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref></italic>). It has been previously reported that the mitochondrial fusion protein MFN2 tethers MAM. We found that the protein level of MFN2 was decreased in differentiated myotubes under microgravity conditions, although the mRNA level was not significantly changed (<italic>Supplementary file 3</italic>).</p>

<title>Mitochondrial abnormality in human MFN2-deficient iPS cells</title>
<p>To investigate the role of MFN2 in atrophic myotubes differentiated from human iPS cells, we generated MFN2-mutated human iPS cells by introducing a double-strand break in the MFN2 exon3, which includes the coding sequence, using the pX458-hMFN2 editing vector with guide RNA, and two different knock-in oligos (ssODN, <italic>Supplementary file 4A and 4B</italic>). The electroporated cells were plated on SNL feeder cells, and single cells exhibiting GFP expression were sorted through bicistronic expression with guide RNA, expanded, and subsequently, the genomic DNA was screened for the correct insertion of the knock-in reporter cassette. The genomic sequencing showed that the selected clone contained the oligo cassette (<italic>Supplementary file 4B</italic>). This clone was confirmed to retain the pluripotency of undifferentiated human iPS cells using antibodies against NANOG or TRA1-81, however, the expression of MFN2 was not detected using an antibody against MFN2 (<italic>Supplementary file 4C and 4D</italic>).</p>
<p>We further examined the mitochondrial condition using MFN2-deficient human iPS cells. MFN2-deficient human iPS cells showed a decrease in the number of MAM, similar to that observed in differentiated myotubes under microgravity (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref></italic>). Additionally, these cells exhibited abnormalities in mitochondrial fission (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref></italic>) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">Cartoni et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c35">Ohara et al., 2017</xref></italic>) and a decrease in ATP production (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2D</xref></italic>). To investigate the effect of MFN2 in human iPS cells, we performed next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses comparing normal MFN2 (201B7, PB-MYOD) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref></italic>) to deficient MFN2 (<italic>MFN2</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) human iPS cells (<italic>Supplementary file</italic> 5). We found that among the upregulated mRNAs expressed in MFN2-deficient iPS cells, the expression levels of Notch-related factors, such as genes of the HES or ID family, were significantly higher as shown by NGS and RT-qPCR analyses (<italic>Supplementary file 5 and 6</italic>). In keeping with these findings, we observed that MFN2-deficient human iPS cells activated the Notch intercellular domain (NICD) in nuclei (red in <italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2E</xref></italic>). The expression levels of these upregulated factors related to Notch signaling in the MFN2-knockout condition were further increased in the microgravity condition (<italic><xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2F</xref></italic>). To investigate the effects of MFN2 deficiency on differentiated myotubes derived from human iPS cells, these cells were induced by MYOD, activated by Doxycycline (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c44">Sato et al., 2019</xref></italic>), cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> under differentiation conditions, and immunostained for MYHC expression as an indicator of their ability to differentiate into myotubes. We found that the number of differentiated myotubes derived from MFN2-deficient human iPS cells was significantly lower than that of wildtype cells (<italic>Supplementary file 7A and 7B</italic>). The activation of Notch signaling was also consistent with its increase in MFN2-deficient human iPS cells (<italic>Supplementary file 7C</italic>). These data indicate that the formation of differentiated myotubes derived from human iPS cells compromised in the absence of MFN2.</p>

<title>The rescue of mitochondrial defects in human MFN2-deficient iPS cells by gamma-secretase inhibitor</title>
<p>We have confirmed that MFN2-deficient iPS cells showed abnormal mitochondrial morphology, MAM, and function. In these MFN2-deficient cells, Notch signaling was activated as recently reported in cardiomyocytes, where it was shown that the elevated Notch signaling in MFN2-deficient conditions was caused by the enzymatic activation of Calcineurin (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">Kasahara et al., 2013</xref></italic>). We observed upregulation of Calcineurin activity in human iPS cells in the absence of MFN2 and in primary human muscle cells under microgravity (<italic>Supplementary file</italic> 8). We therefore investigated whether the inhibition of upregulated Notch or Calcineurin pathways could ameliorate mitochondrial functions in MFN2-deficiency. MFN2-deficient hiPS cells were treated with a gamma-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, and the inhibitor of Calcineurin activity, FK506. We found that DAPT, but not FK506, improved mitochondrial morphology in these cells (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref></italic> and <italic>Supplementary file</italic> 9). MFN2-deficient hiPS cells, treated with DAPT, showed decreased expression of activated HES family genes such as <italic>HES1</italic> and <italic>HEY1</italic> (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3B</xref></italic>). We found that the number of MAM in these cells treated with DAPT, was increased (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref></italic>). Additionally, when DAPT was administrated to MFN2-deficient hiPS cells, we observed an increase in total ATP production (<italic><xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3E</xref></italic>). These results suggest that mitochondrial functions depending on MAM, are closely linked to Notch signaling.</p>

<title>Gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT ameliorates the atrophic phenotype in differentiated human myotubes under microgravity</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of microgravity on Notch signaling in differentiated myotubes, we evaluated Notch expression in primary human muscle cell cultures.

<p>To test the effect of inhibition of Notch signaling on the diminished mitochondrial function and increased expression of atrophic markers seen under microgravity, we administered DAPT every 2 days to cultured myotubes under microgravity (<italic><xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4E</xref></italic>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Skeletal muscle atrophy is caused by various factors, including disuse or mechanical unloading. Here we found that diminished MAM, mitochondrial-associated ER-membrane, is associated with muscle atrophy in the microgravity condition. The result of our studies demonstrated the essential role of MAM in the regulation of skeletal muscle atrophy. MAM is considered to serve as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transit point from the ER to mitochondria and is regulated not only by MFN2 but by the IP3R-VDAC1 protein complex (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">Rizzuto et al., 1998</xref></italic>) which releases Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER and participates in its transfer to the mitochondria (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">Szabadkai et al., 2006</xref></italic>). We have therefore measured the proximity of these protein complexes by the PLA method, as reported in liver, or kidney cells (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">Alam, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c14">D’Eletto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c52">Theurey et al., 2016</xref></italic>).</p>
<p>Mfn2 is a key factor in regulating mitochondrial fusion, which is affected by the GTPase activity of both Mfn1 and Mfn2 on the mitochondrial outer membrane. It has been reported that Mfn2 but not Mfn1 independently regulates not only MAM, but also mitophagy, obesity, cardiomyopathies, and several neuronal defects such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and Parkinson’s disease, suggesting that Mfn2 might not functionally compensate for Mfn1 (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">Chen and Dorn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c20">Filadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c45">Sebastián et al., 2016</xref></italic>). Our experiments with MFN2-disrupted iPS cells, also indicated that the numbers of MAM were decreased and affected mitochondrial functions. However, no effect on developmental myogenesis or growth was observed in Mfn2-deficient mice, which showed comparable to that of wild-type mice. In muscle regeneration, Mfn2-deficient mice showed little change from wild-type mice in the event of a single muscle injury. In contrast, Mfn2 deficiency caused a muscle atrophy-like phenotype in vitro culture, however, no such muscle atrophy is observed with muscle-specific Mfn2 deficiency in vivo (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">Luo et al., 2021</xref></italic>). One potential explanation for this discrepancy is that cell culture conditions introduce excessive mechanical stress (<italic>Banfanti et al., 2022; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c53">Valon and Levayer, 2019</xref></italic>). Indeed <italic>in vivo</italic>, repeated injury of muscle lacking Mfn2 did result in impaired regeneration. Future studies should consider how Mfn2 is involved in adaptation to mechanical stress.</p>
<p>In addition, enhanced Notch signaling was observed accompanying the decrease of MAM in MFN2-deficient iPS cells and myocytes. Reports on cardiac muscle cells suggest that there is crosstalk between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calcineurin with MAM and Notch signaling pathways, which may function in addition to, or in parallel with, Notch1 regulation by extracellular calcium and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">Rand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">Roti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">Song et al., 2022</xref></italic>). Indeed, we report that when human iPS cells in the absence of MFN2 were treated with inhibitors of calcineurin and Notch signaling, the mitochondrial distribution was not significantly altered by FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor, but by DAPT, a Notch signaling inhibitor (<italic>Supplementary file 9</italic>). The same results were obtained in skeletal muscle cells, where changes in mitochondrial distribution were observed and partial functional recovery was demonstrated upon suppression of Notch signaling. Further research will be necessary to unravel the underlying mechanisms that lead to enhanced Notch signaling in MFN2 deficiency, to explore upstream pathways, other than calcium, and to elucidate the reverse control mechanism by which Notch regulates MAMs.</p>
<p>The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved cascade that plays a role in organ development and morphogenesis, stem cell fate, tissue metabolism, and in various diseases (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">Andersson et al., 2011</xref></italic>). In skeletal muscles, Notch signaling is regulated throughout multiple stages of development and regeneration. It is essential for maintaining the dormant state and also for self-renewal of muscle stem cells in the adult (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">Gioftsidi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">Liu et al., 2018</xref></italic>). The positioning of these stem cells on muscle fibers depends on basal lamina assembly controlled by Notch (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">Bröhl et al., 2012</xref></italic>), which also acts as an inhibitor of premature differentiation by repressing the expression of MyoD, a myogenic regulatory factor (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c15">Delfini et al., 2000</xref></italic>). However, its role in myogenesis at late-stages or in mature myotubes remains unclear. In studies involving the forced expression of NICD in differentiating muscle cells, Notch signaling has been shown to inhibit their maturation after myocyte fusion, but also to ameliorate the pathophysiology of mature muscle fibers in aged or dystrophic muscle (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">Bi et al., 2016</xref></italic>). The differentiated human muscle cell culture used in this experiment reported here do not form fully mature fibers. Therefore the effects of Notch inhibition by DAPT at later stages, using more highly organized culture systems to prompt maturation, require further investigation.</p>
<p>Activated Notch signaling has been reported in dystrophic or atrophic muscles (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c21">Fujimaki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c41">Sakai-Takemura et al., 2020</xref></italic>) and also in other pathological situations such as neuroblastomas (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">Ferrari-Toninelli et al., 2010</xref></italic>) or in ischemic stroke where inhibition of Notch signaling with DAPT is beneficial (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">Balaganapathy et al., 2018</xref></italic>). Our study has shown that treatment of DAPT can counteract the negative effect of MFN2 deficiency in human iPS cells and myocytes. Furthermore, grafting efficiency of Mfn2 deficient muscle stem cells is improved if the recipient muscle is treated with DAPT. These experiments point to the positive effects of inhibiting Notch in this context. Importantly, reduction in Notch signaling by DAPT addition in muscle cells under microgravity resulted in higher Mfn2 and MAM levels with improved mitochondrial function and reduced atrophy. This opens the possibility that compounds to inhibit Notch signaling may be of therapeutic value in treating pathological muscle wasting. The treatment of various cancers and of Alzheimer’s disease, in which the Notch pathway has been implicated, is in progress (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">McCaw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c56">You et al., 2023</xref></italic>). Further investigation will be required to find out whether these gamma-secretase inhibitors are also effective against muscle atrophy and muscle diseases.</p>

<title>Mouse lines</title>
<p>All animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of Animal Experimentation of Fujita Health University (Permission number AP18019). Needle injections were performed under anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. <italic>MFN2<sup>loxP/+</sup></italic>(Jackson Laboratory #026525), <italic>Pax7<sup>CreERT2/+</sup></italic> (Jackson Laboratory #017763) mice were used to obtain skeletal muscle cells, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; Sigma-Aldrich) was administrated to 12 weeks old male mice at a dose of 1.0mg/40g body weight via intraperitoneal injection for five consecutive days. Female <italic>Dmd<sup>-/y</sup></italic> mice crossed with male NSG mice (Charles River) (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c43">Sato et al., 2014</xref></italic>) were used as transplanted donors.

<title>Mouse MuSCs sorting</title>
<p>For the isolation and culture of live skeletal muscle stem cells in mice, <italic>tibialis anterior</italic> (TA) muscles were treated with 0.1% Collagenase Type2 in DMEM/F12 at 37°C for 60 minutes. The dissociated cells were resuspended with 1% BSA in PBS and filtrated through a cell strainer. The cell suspensions were stained with anti-SM-C/2.6 antibody (<italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">Fukada et al., 2004</xref></italic>) as well as anti-CD45-PE (diluted 1/500, Biolegend), anti-CD31-PE (diluted 1/500, Biolegend), anti-Sca1-PE (diluted 1/500, Biolegend) antibodies to exclude non-muscle cells.</p>

<title>Grafting of MuSCs into TA muscles of DMD mice</title>
<p><italic>Dmd<sup>-/y</sup></italic>; NSG host male mice aged 12 weeks were used for engraftment of freshly isolated MuSCs derived from wildtype or conditional Mfn2 knockout mice (1.0×10<sup>4</sup> cells per 20μL of PBS) into TA muscles. TA muscle was removed 2 weeks after transplantation with several injections of DAPT solution (20µL of 50µM stock, WAKO) as shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>, fixed, and stained as above. For quantification, serial transverse sections were cut across the entire TA muscle, generating approximately 20 slides per muscle, each containing about 20 serial sections. Five distinct slides were immunostained, encompassing regions where the majority of engrafted cells were located, to quantify the number of Dystrophin-positive (doner cells) or Lama2-positive (whole) myofibers using a hybrid cell counting system. At least four transplanted mice were analyzed per experiment.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>We present statistical data, including the results of multiple biological replicates. The statistical analyses were conducted using Prism9 software (GraphPad Software), employing non-parametric Wilcoxon tests to compare two factors, and one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s comparison test to determine significant differences among more than three factors. The p-values are indicated on each figure and considered significant when &lt;0.05 (*). All error bars are represented as means ± SEM unless otherwise stated.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors investigated the role of MAM and the Notch signaling pathway in the onset of the atrophic phenotype in both in vivo and in vitro models. The rationale used to obtain the data is one of the main strengths of the study. Already from the reading, the reasoning scheme used by the authors in setting up the study and evaluating the data obtained is clear. Using both cellular and mouse models in vivo consolidates the data obtained. The authors also methodologically described all the choices made in the supplementary section. A weakness, on the other hand, is the failure to include averages and statistical data in the results that would give a quantifiable idea of the data obtained. To complete the picture, the authors could also investigate the possible involvement of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway as well as describe probable metabolic shifts to muscle cells in atrophic conditions. The rationale used by the authors to obtain the result is linear. The data obtained are useful for understanding the onset and characterization of the atrophic phenotype under disuse and microgravity conditions. The methods used are in line with those used in the field and can be a starting point for other studies. The cellular models are well described in the materials and methods section. The selected mouse models followed a logical rationale and were in line with the intended aim.</p>

<p>In this study, the authors examined how the maintenance of mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAM) is critical for the prevention of muscle atrophy under microgravity conditions. They observed, a reduction in MAM in myotubes placed in a microgravity condition; in addition, MFN2-deficient human iPS cells showed a decrease in the number of MAM, similar to in myotubes differentiated under microgravity conditions, in addition to the activation of the Notch signaling pathway. The authors, moreover, observed that treatment with the gamma-secretase inhibitor with DAPT preserved the atrophic phenotype of differentiated myotubes in microgravity and improve the regenerative capacity of Mfn2-deficient muscle stem cells in dystrophic mice.</p>
<p>The entire study was well conducted, bringing an interesting analysis in vitro and in vivo of aging conditions. In my opinion, it is necessary to improve the analysis of both genes and proteins to better support the conclusions</p>
<p>The study can contribute to a better understanding of one of the major problems of aging, such as muscle atrophy and inhibition of muscle regeneration, emphasizing the importance of the NOTCH pathway in these pathological situations. The work will be of interest to all scientists working on aging.</p>
