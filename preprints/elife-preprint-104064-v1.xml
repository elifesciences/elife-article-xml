<title>Abstract</title><p>Bacterial contractile injection systems (CIS) are phage tail-like macromolecular complexes that mediate cell-cell interactions by injecting effector proteins into target cells. CIS from <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> (CIS<sup>Sc</sup>) are localized in the cytoplasm. Under stress, they induce cell death and impact the bacteria’s life cycle. It remains unknown whether CIS<sup>Sc</sup> require accessory proteins to directly interact with the cytoplasmic membrane and function.</p>
<p>Here, we characterize the putative membrane adaptor CisA, a conserved factor in <italic>CIS</italic> gene clusters across <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species. We show by cryo-electron tomography imaging and <italic>in vivo</italic> assays that CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction and function depend on CisA. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we provide an atomic model of the extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> apparatus; however, CisA is not part of the complex. Instead, our findings show that CisA is a membrane protein with a cytoplasmic N-terminus predicted to interact with CIS<sup>Sc</sup> components, thereby providing a possible mechanism for mediating CIS<sup>Sc</sup> recruitment to the membrane and subsequent firing.</p>
<p>Our work shows that CIS function in multicellular bacteria is distinct from Type 6 Secretion Systems and extracellular CIS, and possibly evolved due to the role CIS<sup>Sc</sup> play in regulated cell death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Bacteria employ different types of contractile injection systems (CIS) to mediate cell-cell interactions or to mediate cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>). CIS are evolutionarily and structurally related to contractile tails of bacteriophages and are comprised of core modules including a baseplate, a contractile sheath, and an inner tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c3">3</xref>). CIS firing is triggered by a conformational change within the baseplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c5">5</xref>) and results in the contraction of the sheath, which in turn propels the inner tube along with the spike tip. Tube expulsion facilitates the release of associated effector proteins into target cells or the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c7">7</xref>).</p>
<p>Bioinformatic analyses have shown that CISs are conserved across diverse microbial phyla, including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>). Based on their distinct modes of action, CIS can be categorized into two main groups: intracellular type VI secretion systems (T6SS) and extracellular CIS (eCIS). T6SS are abundant among Gram-negative bacteria and in some archaea, and they are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane during assembly and firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c12">12</xref>). A crucial component of the T6SS is the baseplate, which acts as a nucleus for T6SS assembly and mediates the binding of the T6SS particles to the cytoplasmic membrane until contraction. Upon contraction, the spike and inner tube are propelled out of the cell into an adjacent cell or the medium. eCIS, on the other hand, are assembled as free-floating particles in the cytoplasm and are subsequently released into the extracellular space upon lysis of the producer cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>). Following the release, eCIS attach to the surface of target cells via their tail fibers, followed by contraction and puncturing of the target cell envelope.</p>
<p>Besides T6SS and eCIS, there is accumulating evidence of additional CIS assemblies with distinct modes of action in bacteria. For example, in multicellular cyanobacteria, CIS are anchored to the intracellular thylakoid membrane stacks via an extension of the baseplate components and have been proposed to function in cell lysis and the formation of “ghost cells” in response to stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). Furthermore, several recent studies reported the production of free-floating cytoplasmic CIS particles in the multicellular Gram-positive <italic>Streptomyces</italic> bacteria, which have been shown to modulate cellular development through presumably slightly different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c22">22</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Streptomyces</italic> are best known for producing a plethora of medically and industrially important secondary metabolites, including molecules with antimicrobial, antifungal, anticancer or immunosuppressive properties. The production of these molecules is tightly coordinated with the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> developmental life cycle that encompasses two filamentous cell types: vegetative hyphae that grow by tip extension and branching to scavenge for nutrients, and reproductive (aerial) hyphae that eventually differentiate into chains of spores, which can then be dispersed to restart the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c24">24</xref>). Using <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic> as a model organism, we and others previously demonstrated that <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> CIS (CIS<sup>Sc</sup>) mediate a form of regulated cell death, which influences the onset of sporulation and secondary metabolite production in response to exogenous stress and unknown cellular signals (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>).</p>

<p>It remains unclear whether CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction occurs while the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles are free-floating in the cytoplasm or whether this depends on an interaction with the membrane. Moreover, CIS encoded in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genomes lack clear homologs for tail fiber components or a T6SS trans-envelope complex, raising the question of how CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles could potentially interact with the cytoplasmic membrane. We and others recently noted an uncharacterized protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>), SCO4242, which is conserved in the majority of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> species and other Actinomycete species that carry a type IId eCIS locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c9">9</xref>) (<xref rid="figs1" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and Supplementary Data 1 and 2). Interestingly, SCO4242 is encoded just downstream of the baseplate components in the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> gene cluster, a location that usually encodes tail fibers from conventional eCIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>). We will, therefore, refer to the gene product of SCO4242 as CisA for “CIS<sup>Sc</sup>-associated protein A.” Here, we set out to assess the importance of CisA for CIS<sup>Sc</sup> function and its possible role as a membrane anchor.</p>

<title>CisA is required for CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction <italic>in situ</italic></title>
<p>To explore the role of CisA (SCO4242) in CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction and function, we first generated an <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> Δ<italic>cisA</italic> null mutant. Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) imaging of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles that were purified from Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant cells showed assemblies in the contracted conformation, similar to the CIS particles purified from the wild type (WT) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b/c</xref>). We then imaged vegetative hyphae of the WT, the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant and the complemented mutant (Δ<italic>cisA/cisA</italic><sup>+</sup>) by cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) (270 tomograms in total, n=3 experiments). The observed CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles in intact hyphae of these three imaged strains did not reveal discernable differences, indicating that CisA is not required for CIS<sup>Sc</sup> assembly. We previously showed that CIS<sup>Sc</sup> contraction is linked to cell death in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> wildtype hyphae and we observed a clear shift in the number of extended to fully contracted CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles in damaged and dead hyphae (ghost cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Interestingly, and in contrast to the WT and complemented <italic>cisA</italic> mutant strain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">f</xref>), <italic>cisA-</italic>deficient hyphae only contained CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles in the extended conformation irrespective of the cellular integrity of the hyphae (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, <xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2a-d</xref>). While hyphal cell death can be induced by a range of different external or internal factors, our results suggest that CisA is required for the contraction of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> <italic>in situ</italic>.</p>

<title>CryoEM structure of the extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> assembly</title>
<p>Contractile injection systems are generally classified into intracellular type VI secretions systems (T6SS) and the superfamily of extracellular CIS (eCIS), which is subdivided into six families with distinct genetic compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>). Many <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genomes contain a class IId eCIS locus, a subtype that is structurally less well understood compared to other eCIS subtypes, which includes ‘antifeeding prophages’ (AFPs) from <italic>Serratia</italic>, ‘metamorphosis-associated contractile structures’ (MACs) from <italic>Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea</italic>, AlgoCIS from <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> or ‘<italic>Photorhabdus</italic> virulence cassettes’ (PVCs) from <italic>P. asymbiotica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c1">1</xref>).</p>
<p>The CIS<sup>Sc</sup> gene cluster consists of 19 predicted open reading frames (accessions <italic>SCO4242-4260</italic>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), including genes with sequence similarities to potential CIS structural components (<italic>cis1</italic>-<italic>cis16</italic>), as well as additional genes with unknown functions (including <italic>cisA</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). To determine whether CisA is an integral component of CIS<sup>Sc</sup>, we set out to elucidate the high-resolution structure of purified CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles from a non-contractile CIS<sup>Sc</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). The purified assemblies were subjected to single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) for structure determination (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), yielding the first high-resolution model of the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> in its extended conformation, which also presents the first example of a CIS IId subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c8">8</xref>).</p>

<p>Our model shows that extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles share the conserved eCIS architecture, including three modules: cap, sheath-tube and baseplate (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). We processed the dataset using an established workflow that was previously employed to produce the atomic model for other CIS (<xref rid="figs3" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c17">17</xref>). The resulting maps of the baseplate and the cap reached resolutions of 3.5 and 3.4 Å, respectively. The quality of the final maps from the two modules enabled <italic>de novo</italic> structural modelling (<xref rid="figs4" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>, Supplementary Table 1).</p>
<p>The final model of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> comprised 783 polypeptide chains that assemble into a bullet-shaped particle measuring 268 nm in length (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b/c</xref>). All analyzed particles were identical in length, consistent with our <italic>in situ</italic> data of extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles in vegetative hyphae of WT <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d-f</xref>). The length of eCIS particles is often controlled by tape measure proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c26">26</xref>), we note, however, that the corresponding gene is absent from the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> gene cluster. The distal end of the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> is capped by a tail terminator complex (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c/e</xref>). This cap comprises one protein, Cis16, forming a C6-symmetrical complex that terminates the inner tube and sheath, respectively. This minimal architecture resembles the cap complexes of PVC or Pyocin R2 CISs, but it is different from the more complex AlgoCIS from <italic>A. machipongonensis</italic> and AFP from <italic>S. entomophila</italic> (<xref rid="figs5" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). The structures of the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> sheath-tube module have been discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Here we found that the module consists of 61 sheath layers (Cis2-L<sub>1</sub>–L<sub>61</sub>) and 60 tube layers (Cis1-L<sub>1</sub>-L<sub>60</sub>) (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b/d</xref>).</p>
<p>The baseplate module comprises a heteromeric assembly of the proteins Cis1b/7/8/9/11/12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b/c</xref>). The symmetry transition from the inner tube (Cis1a, C6) to the VgrG-like spike (Cis8, C3) is adapted by two layers of the tube initiators Cis1b and Cis7. The first layer of the sheath (Cis2) is bound to the conserved gp25-like protein Cis9, which connects to the baseplate ‘wedges’ composed of Cis11 and Cis12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b/c</xref>). Importantly, the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> ‘wedges’ consist of two copies of Cis11 and one copy of Cis12 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>), resembling the baseplate of Pyocin R2(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c27">27</xref>). This is in contrast to other previously reported eCIS, whose baseplate wedge comprises only one Cis11/12 component (AlgoCIS, AFP, PVC) and a Cis11 extension forming a cage around the spike (AlgoCIS) (<xref rid="figs6" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c25">25</xref>).</p>
<p>Out of the 19 predicted open reading frames in the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> gene cluster (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), nine encoded proteins were present in the final reconstruction, all with atomic models built (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b/c</xref>). However, we did not detect a density for CisA in our model, suggesting that CisA is not part of purified CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles but may interact via a different mechanism. This is also in agreement with mass spectrometry results that indicate the absence of CisA peptides from purified CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). We speculate that the purification protocol used to isolate CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles for single-particle analysis may not preserve a CIS<sup>Sc</sup>-CisA interaction, or the interaction is too transient and only occurs under certain growth conditions.

<title>CisA is a bitopic protein</title>
<p>Previous bioinformatic analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>) and Alphafold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c28">28</xref>) modeling of CisA suggest that CisA consists of a largely unstructured N-terminal region, a transmembrane segment, and a conserved immunoglobulin-like (IgG) domain at the C-terminus (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). To characterize the intracellular localization of CisA, we first generated a strain in which <italic>cisA</italic> was fused to the N-terminus of <italic>mCherry</italic> and expressed <italic>in trans</italic> from a constitutive promoter in the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant. Using fluorescence light microscopy, we consistently observed a CisA-mCherry fluorescence signal along the hyphal periphery, indicative of a membrane-associated protein (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In contrast, no fluorescence was observed in WT hyphae carrying an empty plasmid (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). Next, we tested if CisA is indeed localized to the membrane <italic>in vivo</italic> by performing cellular fractionation experiments. We separated soluble proteins from membrane proteins using whole cell lysates from the <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> WT or the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant that was complemented with a <italic>cisA-3xFLAG</italic> fusion expressed <italic>in trans</italic> from a constitutive promoter. Our analysis confirmed that CisA-3xFLAG co-sedimented with the cell membranes, while the cytoplasmic transcription factor WhiA could only be detected in the soluble protein fraction (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we investigated the topology of CisA in the membrane using a dual <italic>phoA</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic>α reporter system in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The reporter activity can be directly visualized on indicator plates based on the complementary activities of the cytoplasmic reporter β-galactosidase LacZ (magenta coloration) and the periplasmic reporter alkaline phosphatase PhoA (blue coloration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c29">29</xref>). We engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> strains that expressed a C-terminal fusion of CisA variants to the PhoA-LacZα reporter, including full-length CisA and CisA variants that carried either a deletion in the predicted transmembrane domain and/or the putative periplasmic domain (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>). In addition, we included three controls, including 1) cells carrying the empty reporter plasmid, resulting only in cytoplasmic β-galactosidase activity, 2) cells expressing a PhoA/LacZ fusion to the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> cytoplasmic cell division protein SepH, and 3) cells expressing a PhoA/LacZ fusion to the periplasmic domain of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> membrane protein RsbN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c31">31</xref>). The results of this assay confirmed that CisA is a bitopic protein with an N-terminus (amino acids 1-285) located in the cytoplasm and a C-terminus (amino acids 310-468) present in the periplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that CisA is a membrane protein comprised of a flexible, cytoplasmic N-terminal domain and a C-terminal globular IgG-like domain that is exposed to the outside of the cytoplasmic membrane.</p>

<title>CisA is essential for the cellular function of CIS<sup>Sc</sup></title>
<p>We previously established a fluorescence-based assay to demonstrate that the production of functional CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles results in a significantly reduced viability of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> hyphae exposed to exogenous stress, including treatment with the membrane-pore forming antibiotic nisin, UV radiation or the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). This viability assay is based on the measurement of the ratio of two fluorescent markers, namely cytoplasmic sfGFP produced by viable intact hyphae and the membrane dye FM5-95 to detect intact as well as partially lysed hyphae. Using this assay, we tested whether CisA was essential for CIS<sup>Sc</sup>-mediated cell death. We therefore determined the relative viability of the WT <italic>cisA</italic>, the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> and the complemented <italic>cisA</italic> (Δ<italic>cisA/cisA</italic><sup>+</sup>) strains expressing cytosolic sfGFP. We compared cells exposed to a sublethal concentration of nisin (1 µg/ml for 90 min) to cells not exposed to antibiotic stress. All three strains were found to express CIS<sup>Sc</sup> assemblies under these growth conditions (<xref rid="figs7" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>).</p>
<p>Without nisin stress, all three strains exhibited a similar sfGFP/FM5-95 ratio, indicating no significant difference in viability (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a/c</xref>). As previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), the viability of the WT was dramatically reduced in response to nisin stress. In contrast, the viability of Δ<italic>cisA</italic> hyphae was unaffected by nisin stress and comparable to the viability of untreated cells. This phenotype could be completely reversed by complementing the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> deletion <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b/d</xref>). Notably, the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> strain phenocopies CIS<sup>Sc</sup> knockout and non-contractile mutants we analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Thus, we conclude that CisA is required for CIS<sup>Sc</sup>-mediated cell death upon stress.</p>

<p>To further test the dependence of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> function on CisA, we conducted additional <italic>in vivo</italic> assays. Previous studies showed that the absence of functional CIS<sup>Sc</sup> impacted the timely differentiation of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> hyphae into chains of spores, resulting in accelerated cellular development and reduced secondary metabolite production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c19">19</xref>). Here we repeated these analyses using the WT, the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant and the complemented mutant (Δ<italic>cisA/cisA<sup>+</sup></italic>). All strains consistently completed their life cycle and synthesized spores after 96 h of growth on solid medium (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>). Importantly, unlike the WT and the Δ<italic>cisA/cisA<sup>+</sup></italic> strain, Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant colonies sporulated markedly earlier (72 h). These findings were further corroborated by quantifying the number of spores produced by each strain under the same experimental conditions (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). Finally, we also tested the production of the two characteristic pigmented secondary metabolites of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>, actinorhodin (blue) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c32">32</xref>) and undecylprodigiosin (red) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c33">33</xref>). Compared to the WT and the Δ<italic>cisA/cisA<sup>+</sup></italic> strain, the Δ<italic>cisA</italic> mutant showed significantly reduced levels of secondary metabolite production (<xref rid="figs8" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we identify CisA as an essential membrane-associated factor that mediates the cellular function of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles in <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>. In the absence of CisA, CIS<sup>Sc</sup> are not able to contract in the cellular context (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Similar to a CIS<sup>Sc</sup> deletion or non-contractile mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>), this decreases the induction of cell death upon stress, which in turn affects cellular development and secondary metabolite production (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The mechanistic aspects of this distinct mode of action of a CIS are discussed below.</p>

<label>Figure 5:</label>
<caption><title>Cytoplasmic CIS<sup>Sc</sup> require the membrane protein CisA for contraction and function.</title><p>Proposed model illustrating a possible role of CisA.

</fig>
<p>A conserved feature of all previously studied CIS is the requirement of the contractile apparatus to bind to a membrane before firing. This can be achieved in different ways, leading to the classification of CIS into different modes of action. First, T6SS are anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell by a trans-envelope complex spanning from the cytoplasm to the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c36">36</xref>). Second, contractile phages and eCIS bind to the surface of their target cell via tail fibers, which are typically connected to the baseplate and transmit the signal for firing to the baseplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c37">37</xref>). Third, tCIS are anchored to thylakoid membrane stacks in cyanobacteria by an extension of their baseplate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c38">38</xref>). Finally, and in contrast to the previously described CIS, we show that intracellular CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> do not include structural components that can directly bind the host membrane. Our data suggest that CisA may be required to mediate an interaction of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> with the cytoplasmic membrane prior to firing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This interaction may occur directly via the binding of the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particle to the membrane protein CisA, or through the interaction with a yet unknown factor. To explore this idea, we performed an <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of protein-protein interactions between monomeric CisA and CIS<sup>Sc</sup> components using Alphafold2-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c39">39</xref>) (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9a</xref>). Interestingly, this analysis identified the baseplate component Cis11 as a significant hit and possible interaction partner of CisA (<xref rid="figs9" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 9b-d</xref>). Importantly, such a protein-protein interaction would be consistent with our cryoEM structure (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b-f</xref>), showing a peripheral surface-exposed position of Cis11 in the baseplate complex of extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup>.</p>
<p>Additional structural modelling using AlphaFold2-Multimer with truncated versions of CisA in complex with Cis11 further support the idea that the largely unstructured cytosolic portion of CisA is required to interact with the Cis11 (<xref rid="figs10" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>). We have been unable to confirm a direct interaction between CisA and Cis11 because the expression of <italic>cisA</italic> is toxic in <italic>E. coli,</italic> which prevented the experimental analysis of the CisA-Cis11 interaction using co-purification approaches and bacterial two-hybrid studies. However, we did detect CisA peptides in crude purifications of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> from nisin-stressed cells (Supplementary Table 2). This would be consistent with a transient and/or short-lived interaction of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles with CisA, triggered by an exogenous or cellular signal. In agreement with this idea, we rarely observed extended CIS<sup>Sc</sup> assemblies associated with the cytoplasmic membrane via their baseplate in WT cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p>
<p>We further speculate that CisA may not only serve as a mediator for the interaction of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> with the cytoplasmic membrane but also as a sensor and checkpoint for inducing cell death only under specific stress conditions or in response to cellular signals. The CisA C-terminal IgG-like domain that is localized outside the cytoplasm and in proximity of the Gram-positive cell wall may sense stress signals that could potentially trigger conformational changes in CisA, which in turn could mediate the recruitment of CIS<sup>Sc</sup> assemblies to the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by firing. The fatal outcome of firing for the producing cell may have driven the evolution of a stepwise mechanism involving a checkpoint that prevents self-inflicted cell death by accidental firing. Such a mechanism would keep the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> in a free-floating, non-functional and safe state in the cytoplasm.</p>

Grids were blotted for 5.5 s and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane-propane mix (37 %/63 %). Frozen grids were stored in liquid nitrogen until loading into the microscope.</p>
<p>For cryo-electron tomography (cryoET), <italic>Streptomyces</italic> cells were mixed with 10 nm Protein A conjugated colloidal gold particles (1:10 v/v, [Cytodiagnostics]) and 4 µl of the mixture was applied to a glow-discharged holey-carbon copper EM grid (R2/1 or R2/2, [Quantifoil]). The grid was automatically blotted from the backside for 4-6 s in a Mark IV Vitrobot by using a Teflon sheet on the front pad, and plunge-frozen in a liquid ethane-propane mixture (37 %/63 %) cooled by a liquid nitrogen bath.</p>

<title>SPA data collection and image processing</title>
<p>44,925 movies were collected on Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific), operated at 300 keV equipped with K3 direct electron detector, operating in counting mode, and using a slit width of 20 eV on a GIF-Quantum energy filter (Gatan). The automated data collection was conducted with EPU software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with a final pixel size of 1.065Å/pix over 40 frames with a total dose of 50 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. The targeted defocus was set between -1.6 and -2.8 µm with 0.2 µm increment.</p>
<p>Movie-alignments with dose-weighting were performed in MotionCor2 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c46">46</xref>) with a gain reference estimated a posteriori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c47">47</xref>) followed by standard in-house pipeline of manual inspection and selection of 38,845 micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>) for further processing in cryoSPARC package v4.0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c49">49</xref>). Due to the low concentration of particles and the presence of other contaminants in the sample, automatic particle picking appeared challenging, and we developed CIS-specific approach for efficient picking of the cap and baseplates. In this approach, CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles were manually selected as filaments (start-to-end) on 920 micrographs and used for training a crYOLO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c50">50</xref>) picking model (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The large size of the training set appeared essential for successful picking; we could not get rid of large number of false-positive picks, but there were not so many false-negative picks. Then, CIS<sup>Sc</sup> particles were picked in crYOLO as filaments, followed by the extraction of the ends of the “filaments” using star_modif.py script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c48">48</xref>). Particle coordinates were imported in cryoSPARC, where 211,041 particles were extracted at a large box size of 756 pixels binned to 64 pixels for initial 2D-classification, which allowed us to separate initial particle sets corresponding to the CIS<sup>Sc</sup> cap (36,569 particles) and CIS<sup>Sc</sup> baseplate (43,087 particles) (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Two subsets of this dataset were processed in cryoSPARC separately. For the cap subset, a standard cryoSPARC single-particle processing approach was applied, including gradual iterative 2D-classification rounds, followed by selection of good classes and particle re-extraction at finer sampling. The main challenge was the proper centering of the particles selected on the end of elongated filament-like objects with repeating patterns (sheath-tube module of CIS), hampering the alignments. Ab-initio model generation with applied C6 symmetry was hampered by poor centering of 2D-classes due to elongated nature of the particles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Homo-refinement with this reference was performed followed by particle re-extraction and one more round of ab-initio model generation with applied C6 symmetry (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The new 3D-reconstruction appeared reliable and was used for further iterative 3D-refinements (Homo-refinement and NU-refinements) accompanied by 2D-classification and CTF-refinement rounds to exclude particles with wrong Euler angle assignments. The final 3.4 Å resolution map with imposed C6 symmetry resulted from 19,218 particles.</p>
<p>The baseplate subset was processed using the same approach, resulting in a 3D-reconstruction with imposed C6 symmetry with a resolution of 3.5Å from 22,980 particles (<xref rid="figs2" ref-type="fig">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The tip of the baseplate has a C3 symmetry, therefore to solve that part of the map correctly, we exported that particle stack to Relion4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c51">51</xref>) and took advantage of 2D-classification in Relion to select 18,124 particles, corresponding to the best 2D classes averages. 3D-refinement with relaxed symmetry resulted in a 3.8 Å 3D-resolution reconstruction with imposed C3 symmetry.</p>

<title>Fluorescence microscopy</title>
<p>Fluorescence-based cell viability assays were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c18">18</xref>). Briefly, to produce cytoplasmic sfGFP in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, the coding sequence for sfGFP was introduced downstream of the constitutive promoter <italic>ermE</italic>* on an integrating plasmid.

One ml aliquots of each culture were centrifuged for 5 min at 15,000 x <italic>g</italic>, washed twice with 1xPBS, resuspended in 1 ml of 1xPBS containing 5 µg/ml of the red-fluorescent membrane dye FM5-95 (Invitrogen) and then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min followed by two wash steps with 1x PBS. Washed cell pellets were resuspended in a total volume of 50 µl PBS and 10 µl of each sample was spotted onto 1 % agar pads and subsequently imaged using the Thunder imager 3D cell culture microscope (Leica). First, tile scan images were acquired using the Las X Navigator plug-in software (Leica Application Suite X, Version 3.7.4.23463), and 100 regions of interest were picked manually. Then Z-stack images were acquired using a HC PL APO 100x objective with the following excitation wavelengths: GFP (475 nm) and TRX (555 nm). Images were processed using LasX software to apply thunder processing and maximum projection and FIJI to create segmentation and quantify the live (sfGFP)/total cells (FM5-95) area ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="c59">59</xref>). Statistical analyses were performed on data from biological triplicates (n=100 images for each experiment) using a one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-test in GraphPad Prism 9 (Version 9.3.1).</p>
<p>For imaging the subcellular localization of the CIS adaptor protein in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, cells (strain JS69 or <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> M145) were grown for 48 h in TSB/YEME liquid medium.

<p>Contractile Injection Systems (CIS) are versatile machines that can form pores in membranes or deliver effectors. They can act extra or intracellularly. When intracellular they are positioned to face the exterior of the cell and hence should be anchored to the cell envelope. The authors previously reported the characterization of a CIS in Streptomyces coelicolor, including significant information on the architecture of the apparatus. However, how the tubular structure is attached to the envelope was not investigated. Here they provide a wealth of evidence to demonstrate that a specific gene within the CIS gene cluster, cisA, encodes a membrane protein that anchors the CIS to the envelope. More specifically, they show that:</p>
<p>- CisA is not required for assembly of the structure but is important for proper contraction and CIS-mediated cell death</p>
<p>
- CisA is associated to the membrane (fluorescence microscopy, cell fractionation) through a transmembrane segment (lacZ-phoA topology fusions in E. coli)</p>
<p>
- Structural prediction of interaction between CisA and a CIS baseplate component</p>
<p>
- In addition they provide a high-resolution model structure of the &gt;750-polypeptide Streptomyces CIS in its extended conformation, revealing new details of this fascinating machine, notably in the baseplate and cap complexes.</p>
<p>All the experiments are well controlled including trans-complemented of all tested phenotypes.</p>

<p>While it would have been great to test the interaction between CisA and Cis11, to perform cryo-electron microscopy assays of detergent-extracted CIS structures to maintain the interaction with CisA, I believe that the toxicity of CisA upon overexpression or upon expression in E. coli render these studies difficult and will require a significant amount of time and optimization to be performed. It is worth mentioning that this study is of significant novelty in the CIS field because, except for Type VI secretion systems, very few membrane proteins or complexes responsible for CIS attachment have been identified and studied.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>The overall question that is addressed in this study is how the S. coelicolor contractile injection system (CISSc) works and affects both cell viability and differentiation, which it has been implicated to do in previous work from this group and others. The CISSc system has been enigmatic in the sense that it is free-floating in the cytoplasm in an extended form and is seen in contracted conformation (i.e. after having been triggered) mainly in dead and partially lysed cells, suggesting involvement in some kind of regulated cell death. So, how do the structure and function of the CISSc system compare to those of related CIS from other bacteria, does it interact with the cytoplasmic membrane, how does it do that, and is the membrane interaction involved in the suggested role in stress-induced, regulated cell death? The authors address these questions by investigating the role of a membrane protein, CisA, that is encoded by a gene in the CIS gene cluster in S. coelicolor. Further, they analyse the structure of the assembled CISSc, purified from the cytoplasm of S. coelicolor, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The beautiful visualisation of the CIS system both by cryo-electron tomography of intact bacterial cells and by single-particle electron microscopy of purified CIS assemblies are clearly the strengths of the paper, both in terms of methods and results. Further, the paper provides genetic evidence that the membrane protein CisA is required for the contraction of the CISSc assemblies that are seen in partially lysed or ghost cells of the wild type. The conclusion that CisA is a transmembrane protein and the inferred membrane topology are well supported by experimental data. The cryo-EM data suggest that CisA is not a stable part of the extended form of the CISSc assemblies. These findings raise the question of what CisA does.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The investigations of the role of CisA in function, membrane interaction, and triggering of contraction of CIS assemblies, are important parts of the paper and are highlighted in the title. However, the experimental data provided to answer these questions appear partially incomplete and not as conclusive as one would expect.</p>
<p>The stress-induced loss of viability is only monitored with one method: an in vivo assay where cytoplasmic sfGFP signal is compared to FM5-95 membrane stain. Addition of a sublethal level of nisin lead to loss of sfGFP signal in individual hyphae in the WT, but not in the cisA mutant (similarly to what was previously reported for a CIS-negative mutant). Technically, this experiment and the example images that are shown give rise to some concern. Only individual hyphal fragments are shown that do not look like healthy and growing S. coelicolor hyphae. Under the stated growth conditions, S. coelicolor strains would normally have grown as dense hyphal pellets. It is therefore surprising that only these unbranched hyphal fragments are shown in Fig. 4ab. Further, S. coelicolor would likely be in a stationary phase when grown 48 h in the rich medium that is stated, giving rise to concern about the physiological state of the hyphae that were used for the viability assay. It would be valuable to know whether actively growing mycelium is affected in the same way by the nisin treatment, and also whether the cell death effect could be detected by other methods.</p>
<p>The model presented in Fig. 5 suggests that stress leads to a CisA-dependent attachment of CIS assemblies to the cytoplasmic membrane, and then triggering of contraction, leading to cell death. This model makes testable predictions that have not been challenged experimentally. Given that sublethal doses of nisin seem to trigger cell death, there appear to be possibilities to monitor whether activation of the system (via CisA?) indeed leads to at least temporally increased interaction of CIS with the membrane. Further, would not the model predict that stress leads to an increased number of contracted CIS assemblies in the cytoplasm? No clear difference in length of the isolated assemblies if Fig. S7 is seen between untreated and nisin-exposed cells, and also no difference between assemblies from WT and cisA mutant hyphae.</p>
<p>The interaction of CisA with the CIS assembly is critical for the model but is only supported by Alphafold modelling, predicting interaction between cytoplasmic parts of CisA and Cis11 protein in the baseplate wedge. An experimental demonstration of this interaction would have strengthened the conclusions.</p>
<p>The cisA mutant showed a similarly accelerated sporulation as was previously reported for CIS-negative strains, which supports the conclusion that CisA is required for function of CISSc. But the results do not add any new insights into how CIS/CisA affects the progression of the developmental life cycle and whether this effect has anything to do with the regulated cell death that is caused by CIS. The same applies to the effect on secondary metabolite production, with no further mechanistic insights added, except reporting similar effects of CIS and CisA inactivations.</p>
<p>Concluding remarks:</p>
<p>
The work will be of interest to anyone interested in contractile injection systems, T6SS, or similar machineries, as well for people working on the biology of streptomycetes. There is also a potential impact of the work in the understanding of how such molecular machineries could have been co-opted during evolution to become a mechanism for regulated cell death. However, this latter aspect remains still poorly understood. Even though this paper adds excellent new structural insights and identifies a putative membrane anchor, it remains elusive how the Streptomyces CIS may lead to cell death. It is also unclear what the advantage would be to trigger death of hyphal compartments in response to stress, as well as how such cell death may impact (or accelerate) the developmental progression. Finally, it is inescapable to wonder whether the Streptomyces CIS could have any role in protection against phage infection.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Casu et al. have reported the characterization of a previously uncharacterized membrane protein CisA encoded in a non-canonical contractile injection system of Streptomyces coelicolor, CISSc, which is a cytosolic CISs significantly distinct from both intracellular membrane-anchored T6SSs and extracellular CISs. The authors have presented the first high-resolution structure of extended CISSc structure. It revealed important structural insights in this conformational state. To further explore how CISSc interacted with cytoplasmic membrane, they further set out to investigate CisA that was previously hypothesized to be the membrane adaptor. However, the structure revealed that it was not associated with CISSc. Using fluorescence microscope and cell fractionation assay, the authors verified that CisA is indeed a membrane-associated protein. They further determined experimentally that CisA had a cytosolic N-terminal domain and a periplasmic C-terminus. The functional analysis of cisA mutant revealed that it is not required for CISSc assembly but is essential for the contraction, as a result, the deletion significantly affects CISSc-mediated cell death upon stress, timely differentiation, as well as secondary metabolite production. Although the work did not resolve the mechanistic detail how CisA interacts with CISSc structure, it provides solid data and a strong foundation for future investigation toward understanding the mechanism of CISSc contraction, and potentially, the relation between the membrane association of CISSc, the sheath contraction and the cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is well-structured, and the conclusion of the study is supported by solid data and careful data interpretation was presented. The authors provided strong evidence on (1) the high-resolution structure of extended CISSc determined by cryo-EM, and the subsequent comparison with known eCIS structures, which sheds light on both its similarity and different features from other subtypes of eCISs in detail; (2) the topological features of CisA using fluorescence microscopic analysis, cell fractionation and PhoA-LacZα reporter assays, (3) functions of CisA in CISSc-mediated cell death and secondary metabolite production, likely via the regulation of sheath contraction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data presented are not sufficient to provide mechanistic details of CisA-mediated CISSc contraction, as authors are not able to experimentally demonstrate the direct interaction between CisA with baseplate complex of CISSc (hypothesized to be via Cis11 by structural modeling), since they could not express cisA in E. coli due to its potential toxicity. Therefore, there is a lack of biochemical analysis of direct interaction between CisA and baseplate wedge. In addition, there is no direct evidence showing that CisA is responsible for tethering CISSc to the membrane upon stress, and the spatial and temporal relation between membrane association and contraction remains unclear. Further investigation will be needed to address these questions in future.</p>
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Overall, the work provides a valuable contribution to our understanding on the structure of a much less understood subtype of CISs, which is unique compared to both membrane-anchored T6SSs and host-membrane targeting eCISs. Importantly, the work serves as a good foundation to further investigate how the sheath contraction works here. The work contributes to expanding our understanding of the diverse CIS superfamilies.</p>

<p>We thank the editor and the three reviewers for the positive assessment and constructive feedback on how to improve our manuscript. We greatly appreciate that our work is considered valuable to the field, the recognition of the high-resolution model we presented, and the comments on our investigation of CisA’s role in the attachment and firing mechanism of the extended assembly. It is truly gratifying to know that our study contributes to expanding the current understanding of the biology of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> and the role of these functionally diverse and fascinating bacterial nanomachines.</p>
<p>We have provided specific responses to each reviewer's comments below. In summary, we intend to address the following requested revisions:</p>
<p>We will expand our bioinformatic analysis of CisA and provide additional information on the oligomeric state of CisA. We will also modify the text, figures, and figure legends to improve the clarity of our work and experimental procedures.</p>
<p>Some reviewer comments would require additional experimental work, some of which would involve extensive optimization of experimental conditions. Because both lead postdoctoral researchers involved in this work have now left the lab, we currently do not have the capability to perform additional experimental work.</p>

<p>We thank this reviewer for their highly supportive and positive comments on our manuscript. We are grateful for this reviewer’s recognition of the novelty of our study, particularly in the context of membrane proteins and complexes involved in CIS attachment.</p>
<p>We agree that further experimental evidence on the direct interaction between CisA and Cis11 would have strengthened our model of CisA function. However, as noted by this reviewer, this additional work is technically challenging and currently beyond the scope of this study.</p>
<p>We thank Reviewer #1 for suggesting discussing the potential oligomeric state of CisA. We will perform additional AlphaFold modelling of CisA and discuss the result of this analysis in the revised manuscript.</p>

<p>The beautiful visualisation of the CIS system both by cryo-electron tomography of intact bacterial cells and by single-particle electron microscopy of purified CIS assemblies are clearly the strengths of the paper, both in terms of methods and results. Further, the paper provides genetic evidence that the membrane protein CisA is required for the contraction of the CISSc assemblies that are seen in partially lysed or ghost cells of the wild type. The conclusion that CisA is a transmembrane protein and the inferred membrane topology are well supported by experimental data. The cryo-EM data suggest that CisA is not a stable part of the extended form of the CISSc assemblies. These findings raise the question of what CisA does.</p>

<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The investigations of the role of CisA in function, membrane interaction, and triggering of contraction of CIS assemblies, are important parts of the paper and are highlighted in the title. However, the experimental data provided to answer these questions appear partially incomplete and not as conclusive as one would expect.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We acknowledge that some aspects of our work have not been fully answered. We believe that providing additional experimental data is currently beyond the scope of this study. To improve this study, we will modify the text and clarify experimental procedures and figures where possible in the revised version of our manuscript.</p>

<p>The stress-induced loss of viability is only monitored with one method: an in vivo assay where cytoplasmic sfGFP signal is compared to FM5-95 membrane stain. Addition of a sublethal level of nisin lead to loss of sfGFP signal in individual hyphae in the WT, but not in the cisA mutant (similarly to what was previously reported for a CIS-negative mutant). Technically, this experiment and the example images that are shown give rise to some concern. Only individual hyphal fragments are shown that do not look like healthy and growing S. coelicolor hyphae. Under the stated growth conditions, S. coelicolor strains would normally have grown as dense hyphal pellets. It is therefore surprising that only these unbranched hyphal fragments are shown in Fig. 4ab.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for their thoughtful criticism regarding our stress-induced viability assay and the data presented in Figure 4. We acknowledge the importance of ensuring that the presented images should reflect the physiological state of <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> under the stated growth conditions and recognize that hyphal fragments shown in Figure 4 do not fully capture the typical morphology of <italic>S. coelicolor.</italic> As pointed out by this reviewer, <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> grows in large hyphal clumps when cultured in liquid media, making the quantification of fluorescence intensities in hyphae expressing cytoplasmic GFP and stained with the membrane dye FM5-95 particularly challenging. To improve the image analysis and quantification of GFP and FM5-95-fluorescent intensities across the three <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> strains (wildtype, <italic>cisA</italic> deletion mutant and the complemented <italic>cisA</italic> mutant), we vortexed the cell samples briefly before imaging to break up hyphal clumps, increasing hyphal fragments. The hyphae shown in our images were selected as representative examples across three biological replicates.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Further, S. coelicolor would likely be in a stationary phase when grown 48 h in the rich medium that is stated, giving rise to concern about the physiological state of the hyphae that were used for the viability assay. It would be valuable to know whether actively growing mycelium is affected in the same way by the nisin treatment, and also whether the cell death effect could be detected by other methods.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reasoning behind growing <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> for 48 h before performing the fluorescence-based viability assay was that we (DOI: 10.1038/s41564-023-01341-x ) and others (e.g.: DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37087-7 ) previously showed that the levels of CIS particles peak at the transition from vegetative to reproductive/stationary growth, thus indicating that CIS activity is highest during this growth stage. The obtained results in this manuscript are in agreement with our previous study, in which we showed a similar effect on the viability of wildtype versus <italic>cis</italic>-deficient <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> strains (DOI: 10.1038/s41564-023-01341-x ) using nisin, the protonophore CCCP and UV light, and supported by biological replicate experiments and appropriate controls. Furthermore, our results are in agreement with the findings reported in a complementary study by Vladimirov et al. (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37087-7 ) that used a different approach (SYTO9/PI staining of hyphal pellets) to demonstrate that CIS-deficient mutants exhibit decreased hyphal death. We agree that it would be interesting to test if actively growing hyphae respond differently to nisin treatment, and such experiments will be considered in future work.</p>
<p>Taken together, we believe that the results obtained from our fluorescence-based viability assay are consistent with data reported by others and provide strong experimental evidence that functional CIS mediate hyphal cell death.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The model presented in Fig. 5 suggests that stress leads to a CisA-dependent attachment of CIS assemblies to the cytoplasmic membrane, and then triggering of contraction, leading to cell death. This model makes testable predictions that have not been challenged experimentally. Given that sublethal doses of nisin seem to trigger cell death, there appear to be possibilities to monitor whether activation of the system (via CisA?) indeed leads to at least temporally increased interaction of CIS with the membrane.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for their suggestions on how to test our model further. In the meantime, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> cells that produced CisA-FLAG as bait and were treated with a sub-lethal nisin concentration for 0/15/45 min.  Mass spectrometry analysis of co-eluted peptides did not show the presence of CIS-associated peptides. While we cannot exclude the possibility that our experimental assay requires further optimization to successfully demonstrate a CisA-CIS interaction (e.g. optimization of the use of detergents to improve the solubilization of CisA from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> membrane, which is currently not an established method), an alternative and equally valid hypothesis is that the interaction between CIS particles and CisA is transient and therefore difficult to capture. We would like to mention that we did detect CisA peptides in crude purifications of CIS particles from nisin-stressed cells (Supplementary Table 2, manuscript: line 265/266), supporting our model that CisA associates with CIS particles <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Further, would not the model predict that stress leads to an increased number of contracted CIS assemblies in the cytoplasm? No clear difference in length of the isolated assemblies if Fig. S7 is seen between untreated and nisin-exposed cells, and also no difference between assemblies from WT and cisA mutant hyphae.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The reviewer is correct that there is no clear difference in length in the isolated CIS particles shown in Figure S7. This is in line with our results, which show that CisA is not required for the correct assembly of CIS particles and their ability to contract in the presence and absence of nisin treatment. The purpose of Figure S7 was to support this statement. We would like to note that the particles shown in Figure S7 were purified from cell lysates using a crude sheath preparation protocol, during which CIS particles generally contract irrespective of the presence or absence of CisA. Thus, we cannot comment on whether there is an increased number of contracted CIS assemblies in the cytoplasm of nisin-exposed cells. To answer this point, we would need to acquire additional cryo-electron tomograms (cyroET) of the different strains treated with nisin. We appreciate this reviewer's suggestions. However, cryoET is an extremely time and labour-intensive task, and given that we currently don’t know the exact dynamics of the CIS-CisA interaction following exogenous stress, we believe this experiment is beyond the scope of this work.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The interaction of CisA with the CIS assembly is critical for the model but is only supported by Alphafold modelling, predicting interaction between cytoplasmic parts of CisA and Cis11 protein in the baseplate wedge. An experimental demonstration of this interaction would have strengthened the conclusions.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We agree that direct experimental evidence of this interaction would have further strengthened the conclusions of our study, and we have extensively tried to provide additional experimental evidence. Unfortunately, due to the toxicity of CisA expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> and the transient nature of the interaction under our experimental conditions, we were unable to pursue direct biochemical or biophysical validation methods, such as co-purification or bacterial two-hybrid assays. While these challenges limited our ability to experimentally confirm the interaction, the AlphaFold predictions provided a valuable hypothesis and mechanistic insight into the role of CisA.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>The cisA mutant showed a similarly accelerated sporulation as was previously reported for CIS-negative strains, which supports the conclusion that CisA is required for function of CISSc. But the results do not add any new insights into how CIS/CisA affects the progression of the developmental life cycle and whether this effect has anything to do with the regulated cell death that is caused by CIS. The same applies to the effect on secondary metabolite production, with no further mechanistic insights added, except reporting similar effects of CIS and CisA inactivations.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank this reviewer for their thoughtful feedback and for highlighting the connections between CisA, CIS function, and their effects on the developmental life cycle and secondary metabolite production in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic>. The main focus of this study was to provide further insight into how CIS contraction and firing are mediated in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, and we used the analysis of accelerated sporulation and secondary metabolite production to assess the functionality of CIS in the presence or absence of CisA.</p>
<p>We agree that we still don’t fully understand the nature of the signals that trigger CIS contraction, but we do know that the production of CIS assemblies seems to be an integral part of the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> multicellular life cycle as demonstrated in two independent previous studies (DOI: 10.1038/s41564-023-01341-x and DOI: 10.1038/s41467-023-37087-7 ). We propose that the assembly and firing of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> CIS particles could present a molecular mechanism to sacrifice only a part of the mycelium to either prevent the spread of local cellular damage or to provide additional nutrients for the rest of the mycelium and delay the terminal differentiation into spores and affect the production of secondary metabolites.</p>
<p>We recognize the importance of understanding the regulation and mechanistic details underpinning the proposed CIS-mediated regulated cell death model. This will be further explored in future studies.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Concluding remarks:</p>
<p>The work will be of interest to anyone interested in contractile injection systems, T6SS, or similar machineries, as well for people working on the biology of streptomycetes. There is also a potential impact of the work in the understanding of how such molecular machineries could have been co-opted during evolution to become a mechanism for regulated cell death. However, this latter aspect remains still poorly understood. Even though this paper adds excellent new structural insights and identifies a putative membrane anchor, it remains elusive how the Streptomyces CIS may lead to cell death. It is also unclear what the advantage would be to trigger death of hyphal compartments in response to stress, as well as how such cell death may impact (or accelerate) the developmental progression. Finally, it is inescapable to wonder whether the Streptomyces CIS could have any role in protection against phage infection.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #2 for their supportive assessment of our work. In the revised manuscript, we will briefly discuss the impact of functional CIS assemblies on Streptomyces development. We previously tested if <italic>Streptomyces</italic> could defend against phages but have not found any experimental evidence to support this idea. The analysis of phage defense mechanisms is an underdeveloped area in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> research, partly due to the currently limited availability of a diverse phage panel.</p>

<p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>In this work, Casu et al. have reported the characterization of a previously uncharacterized membrane protein CisA encoded in a non-canonical contractile injection system of Streptomyces coelicolor, CISSc, which is a cytosolic CISs significantly distinct from both intracellular membrane-anchored T6SSs and extracellular CISs. The authors have presented the first high-resolution structure of extended CISSc structure. It revealed important structural insights in this conformational state. To further explore how CISSc interacted with cytoplasmic membrane, they further set out to investigate CisA that was previously hypothesized to be the membrane adaptor. However, the structure revealed that it was not associated with CISSc. Using fluorescence microscope and cell fractionation assay, the authors verified that CisA is indeed a membrane-associated protein. They further determined experimentally that CisA had a cytosolic N-terminal domain and a periplasmic C-terminus. The functional analysis of cisA mutant revealed that it is not required for CISSc assembly but is essential for the contraction, as a result, the deletion significantly affects CISSc-mediated cell death upon stress, timely differentiation, as well as secondary metabolite production. Although the work did not resolve the mechanistic detail how CisA interacts with CISSc structure, it provides solid data and a strong foundation for future investigation toward understanding the mechanism of CISSc contraction, and potentially, the relation between the membrane association of CISSc, the sheath contraction and the cell death.</p>
<p>Strengths:</p>
<p>The paper is well-structured, and the conclusion of the study is supported by solid data and careful data interpretation was presented. The authors provided strong evidence on (1) the high-resolution structure of extended CISSc determined by cryo-EM, and the subsequent comparison with known eCIS structures, which sheds light on both its similarity and different features from other subtypes of eCISs in detail; (2) the topological features of CisA using fluorescence microscopic analysis, cell fractionation and PhoA-LacZα reporter assays, (3) functions of CisA in CISSc-mediated cell death and secondary metabolite production, likely via the regulation of sheath contraction.</p>
<p>Weaknesses:</p>
<p>The data presented are not sufficient to provide mechanistic details of CisA-mediated CISSc contraction, as authors are not able to experimentally demonstrate the direct interaction between CisA with baseplate complex of CISSc (hypothesized to be via Cis11 by structural modeling), since they could not express cisA in E. coli due to its potential toxicity. Therefore, there is a lack of biochemical analysis of direct interaction between CisA and baseplate wedge. In addition, there is no direct evidence showing that CisA is responsible for tethering CISSc to the membrane upon stress, and the spatial and temporal relation between membrane association and contraction remains unclear. Further investigation will be needed to address these questions in future.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>We thank Reviewer #3 for the supportive evaluation and constructive criticism of our study in the public and non-public review. We appreciate your recognition of the technical limitations of experimentally demonstrating a direct interaction between CisA and CIS baseplate complex, and we agree that further investigations in the future will hopefully provide a full mechanistic understanding of the spatiotemporal interaction of CisA and CIS particular and the subsequent CIS firing.</p>
<p>To further improve the manuscript, we will revise the text and clarify figures and figure legends as suggested in the non-public review.</p>
<disp-quote content-type="editor-comment">
<p>Discussion:</p>
<p>Overall, the work provides a valuable contribution to our understanding on the structure of a much less understood subtype of CISs, which is unique compared to both membrane-anchored T6SSs and host-membrane targeting eCISs. Importantly, the work serves as a good foundation to further investigate how the sheath contraction works here. The work contributes to expanding our understanding of the diverse CIS superfamilies.</p>
